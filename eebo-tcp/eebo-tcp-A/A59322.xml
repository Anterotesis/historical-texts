            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AFter the fruitleſs Iſſue of two ſeveral Treaties; The Firſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1613. in <hi>London;</hi> and the other, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> touching the differences between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> At laſt, by a Third Treaty, <hi>Anno</hi> 1619. in <hi>London,</hi> there was a full and ſolemn Compoſition made of all the ſaid Differences; and a fair Order ſet for the future proceeding of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of both Companies in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well in the courſe of their Trade and Commerce, as otherwiſe. Amongſt ſundry other points, it was agreed, That in regard of the great Blood-ſhed and coſt, pretended to be beſtowed by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in winning of the Trade of the Iſles of the <hi>Molluccos, Banda,</hi> and <hi>Amboyna,</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> and in building of Forts for the continual ſecuring of the ſame; the ſaid <hi>Hollanders</hi> therefore ſhould enjoy two Third parts of that Trade, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the other Third; and the charge of the Forts to be maintained by Taxes and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, to be levied upon the Merchandize. Wherefore, in conſequence of this Agreement, the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company planted certain Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for their ſhare of this Trade; ſome at the <hi>Molluccos,</hi> ſome at <hi>Banda,</hi> and ſome at <hi>Amboyna.</hi> Of the Two former of theſe, there will be, at this preſent, ſmall occaſion to ſpeak further; but the laſt will prove the Scene of a ſad Tragedy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Amboyna</hi> is an Iſland lying near <hi>Seran,</hi> of the circuit of Forty Leagues, and giveth Name alſo to ſome other ſmall Iſlands adjacent. It beareth Cloves; for gathering, and buying in whereof, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for their part, had planted Five ſeveral Factories; the head, and <hi>Rendevouz</hi> of all, at the Town of <hi>Amboyna;</hi> and therein firſt Maſter <hi>George Muſchamp,</hi> and afterward Maſter <hi>Gabriel Towerſon,</hi> their Agents; with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections over the ſmaller Factories at <hi>Hitto</hi> and <hi>Larica,</hi> upon the ſame Iſland; and at <hi>Lobo</hi> and <hi>Cambello,</hi> upon a point of their neighbouring Iſland of <hi>Seran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe Iſlands of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the point of <hi>Seran,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have four Forts, the chief of all is at the ſaid Town of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and is very ſtrong, having four Points or Bulwarks, with their Curtains; and upon each of theſe Points ſix great Pieces of Ordinance mounted, moſt of them of Braſs.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105372:6"/>
The one ſide of this Caſtle is waſhed by the Sea, and the other is divided from the Land with a Ditch of four or five fathom broad, very deep, and ever filled with the Sea. The Garriſon of this Caſtle conſiſteth of about 200 <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, and a Company of free Burgers: Beſides theſe, there is always a matter of three or four hundred <hi>Mardikers</hi> (for ſo they uſually call the free Natives) in the Town, ready to ſerve the Caſtle at an hours warning. There lie alſo in the Road (for the moſt part) divers good Ships of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as well for the guard of the place by Sea, as for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Traffick: this being the chief Rendezvouz, as well for the Iſland of <hi>Banda,</hi> as for the reſt of <hi>Amboyna.</hi> Here the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lived; not in the Caſtle, but under the Protection thereof, in a Houſe of their own in the Town; holding themſelves ſafe, as well in reſpect of the Ancient Bonds of Amity between both Nations, as of the ſtrict conjunction made by the late Treaty before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>They continued here ſome Two Years, Converſing and Trading together with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by vertue of the ſaid Treaty. In which time, there fell out ſundry Differences and Debates between them: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did not only laviſh away much Money in Building, and unneceſſary Expences upon the Forts, and otherwiſe, and bring large and unreaſonable Reckonings thereof to the common Account, but alſo did, for their part, pay the Garriſons with Victuals, and cloath of <hi>Coromondel,</hi> which they put off to the Soldiers at three or four times the Value it coſt them; yet would not allow the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies part of the ſame Charge, but only in ready Money, thereby drawing from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (which ought to pay but one Third part) more than two Thirds of the whole true charge. Hereupon, and upon the like occaſions, grew ſome Diſcontents and Diſputes, and the Complaints were ſent to <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Java Major,</hi> to the Council of Defence of both Nations, there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding: who alſo, not agreeing upon the points in Difference, ſent the ſame hither over into <hi>Europe,</hi> to be decided by both Companies here; or, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of their Agreement, by the King's Majeſty, and the Lords the States General, according to an Article of the Treaty of the Year, 1619. on this behalf. In the mean time, the Diſcontent between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> about theſe and other Differences, continued, and daily encreaſed; until at laſt there was a Sword found to cut in ſunder that knot at once, which the tedious Diſputes of <hi>Amboyna</hi> and <hi>Jaccatra</hi> could not untie: And this was uſed in manner as followeth:</p>
            <p>About the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>February, 1622. Stile veteri, a Japoner-</hi>Soldier of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in their Caſtle of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> walking in the Night upon the Wall, came to the Sentinel (being a <hi>Hollander)</hi> and there, amongſt other Talk, asked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105372:6"/>
him ſome queſtions, touching the ſtrength of the Caſtle, and the People that were therein. It is here to be noted, that thoſe <hi>Japoners</hi> (of whom there is not Thirty in all the Iſland) did, for the moſt part, ſerve the <hi>Dutch</hi> as Soldiers; yet were not of their Truſty bands, always lodged in the Caſtle, but upon occaſion called out of the Town to aſſiſt in the Watch. This <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poner</hi> aforeſaid, was (for his ſaid Conference with the Sentinel) apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſuſpition of Treaſon, and put to Torture: Whereby (as ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> affirmed) he was brought to confeſs, That himſelf, and ſundry others of his Countrey-Men there, had contrived to take the Caſtle. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon other <hi>Japoners</hi> were Examined and Tortured, as alſo a <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Guardian of the Slaves under the <hi>Dutch.</hi> During this Examination, which continued three or four days, ſome of the <hi>Engliſh-</hi>Men went to and from the Caſtle upon their buſineſs, ſaw the Priſoners, heard of their Tortures, and of the Crime laid to their charge, but all this while ſuſpected not that this matter did any whit concern themſelves, having never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the <hi>Japoners,</hi> nor with the <hi>Portugal</hi> aforeſaid. At the ſame time there was one <hi>Abel Price,</hi> Chirurgeon of the <hi>English,</hi>

Having given him the Torture, they ſoon made him confeſs what ever they asked him. This was the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>February, 1622.

Next was <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> brought in, being newly Arrived from <hi>Hitto,</hi> as is before cited; and was the ſame day brought <note place="margin">Samuel Colſon <hi>Examined.</hi>
               </note> to the Torture; who, for fear of the pain wherewith he ſaw <hi>Collins</hi> come out, in ſuch a caſe, that his Eyes were almoſt blown out of his Head, with the Torment of Water, choſe rather to confeſs all they asked him; and ſo was quickly diſmiſſed, coming out Weeping, Lamenting, and proteſting his Innocency.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>John Clark,</hi> that came with <hi>Colſon</hi> from <hi>Hitto,</hi> fetcht in, an a little after was heard (by the reſt that were without <note place="margin">John Clark <hi>Examined.</hi>
               </note> in the Hall) to cry out amain: They Tortured him with Water and Fire for the ſpace of Two hours. The manner of his Torture (as alſo of <hi>Johnſons</hi> and <hi>Thompſons)</hi> was as followeth: Firſt, they hoiſed him up by the Hands, with a Cord, on a large door, where they made him faſt upon two Staples of Iron, fixt on both ſides at the top of the door Poſts, haling his Hands one from the other as wide as they could ſtretch: Being thus made faſt, his Feet hung ſome two Foot from the Ground, which alſo they ſtretcht aſunder as far as they could retch, and ſo made them faſt beneath, unto the door Trees, on each ſide: Then they bound a cloth about his Neck and Face, ſo cloſe that little or no Water could go by: That done, they poured the Water ſoftly upon his Head, until the cloath was full up to the Mouth and Noſtrils, and ſomewhat higher; ſo that he could not draw Breath, but he muſt withal ſuck-in the Water: which being ſtill continued to be poured in ſoftly, forced all his inward parts, came out of his Noſe, Ears, and Eyes, and often, as it were, ſtifling and choaking him; at length took away his Breath, and brought him to a Swoond or Fainting: Then they quickly took him down, and made him Vomit up the Water. Being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle recovered, they triced him up again, and poured in the Water as before, always taking him down as he ſeemed to be ſtifled: In this manner they handled him three or four ſeveral times with Water, till his Body was ſwoln twice or thrice as big as before, his Cheeks like great Bladders, and his Eyes ſtaring and ſtrutting out beyond his Forehead: yet all this he bare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confeſſing any thing; inſomuch that the Fiſcal and Tormentors reviled him, ſaying, <hi>That he was a Devil, and no Man; or ſurely was a Witch, at leaſt had ſome Charm about him, or was Enchanted, that he could bear ſo much.</hi> Wherefore they cut off his Hair very ſhort, as ſuppoſing he had ſome Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft hidden therein. Afterwards they hoiſed him up as before, and then burnt him with lighted Candles in the bottom of his Feet, until the Fat dropt out the Candles, yet then they applied freſh Lights unto him. They burne him alſo under the Elbows, and in the Palms of the Hands; likewiſe under the Arm pits, until his Inwards might evidently be ſeen.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105372:8"/>
At laſt, when they ſaw he could of himſelf make no handſome Confeſſion, then they led him along with Queſtions of Particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, by themſelves framed. Being thus wearied and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the torment, he anſwered, yea, to whatſoever they asked: whereby they drew from him a body of a Confeſſion to this effect; to wit, <hi>That Captain</hi> Towerſon <hi>had upon New-years-day laſt before, ſworn all the</hi> Engliſh <hi>at</hi> Amboyna <hi>to be ſecret and aſſiſtant to a plot that he had projected, with the help of the</hi> Japoners, <hi>to ſurprize the Caſtle, and to put the Governor and the reſt of the</hi> Dutch <hi>to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus martyred this poor man, they ſent him out by four Blacks: who carried him between them to a Dungeon where he lay five or ſix days, without any Chyrurgion to dreſs him, untill (his fleſh being putrified) great Maggots dropt and crept from him in a moſt loathſom and noiſom manner. Thus they finiſhed their Sabbath days work; and it growing now dark, ſent the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (that came that day from <hi>Hitto,</hi> and till then attended in the Hall) firſt to the Smiths-ſhop, where they were loaden with Irons, and then to the ſame loathſom Dungeon, where <hi>Clark</hi> and the reſt were, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the poor <hi>Japoners,</hi> lying in the putrefaction of their tortures.</p>
            <p>The next morning being <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> Old ſtile, <hi>William Griggs</hi> and <hi>John Fardo,</hi> with certain <hi>Japoners,</hi> were brought into the place of examination.</p>

               </note> who, ſeeing how grievouſly others were martyred, made his earneſt prayer to God (as ſince upon his Oath he hath acknowledged) that he would ſuffer him to make ſome ſuch probable lies againſt himſelf, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> might believe, and ſo he might eſcape the torment. Being brought to the Rack, the Water provided, and the Candles lighted, he was by the Governor and Fiſcal examined, and charged with the Conſpiracy. He fell upon his knees, and proteſted his innocency. Then they commanded him to the Rack, and told him; Unleſs he would confeſs, he ſhould be tormented with Fire and Water to death, and then ſhould be drawn by the heels to the Gallows, and there handed up.

He anſwered, <hi>For fear of Torment.</hi> The Fiſcal and the reſt in a great rage, told him he lied; his mouth had ſpoken it, and it was true, and therefore he ſhould ſubſcribe it. <hi>Which as ſoon as he had done, he fell preſently into a great paſſion, charging them bitterly to be guilty of the innocent blood of himſelf and the reſt; which they ſhould look to anſwer for at the day of Judgment: withall he grapled with the Fiſcal, and would have ſtopped him from carrying in the confeſſion to the Governor, with whom he alſo craved to ſpeak;</hi> but was inſtantly laid hold on, and carried away to priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Webber,</hi> being next examined, was told by the Fiſcar, <hi>that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">William Webber <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> John Clark <hi>had confeſſed him to have been at</hi> Amboyna <hi>on Now years day, and ſworn to Captain</hi> Towerſon'<hi>s plot,</hi> &amp;c. All which he denyed, alledging, <hi>he was that day at</hi> Larica: yet being brought to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he then confeſſed, <hi>he had been at the conſultation at</hi> Amboyna <hi>upon New-years day,</hi> with all the reſt of the circumſtances in order as he was asked. He alſo further told them, <hi>he had received a letter from</hi> John Clark; after which was a Poſtſcript, excuſing his brief writing at that time, for that there was great buſineſs in hand. But one <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> a Dutch Merchant, then ſtanding by, told the Governour, that <hi>upon New-years day,</hi> the time of this pretended conſultation, Webber <hi>and he were merry at</hi> Larica. So the Governour left him, and went out. But the Fiſcal held on upon the other point, touching the Poſtſcript of <hi>Clark</hi>'s Letter, urging him to ſhew the ſame. Which when he could not do, though often terrified with the torture, he gave him reſpite; promiſing to ſave his life, if he would produce that Letter.</p>
            <p>Then was Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> brought to examination, and ſhewed <note place="margin">Gabriel Towerſon <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> what others had confeſted of him. He deeply proteſting his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> was brought to confront him: who being told, that <hi>unleſs he would now make good his former confeſſion againſt Captain</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſon, <hi>he ſhould to the Torture,</hi> coldly re-affirmed the ſame, and ſo was ſent away. They alſo brought <hi>William Grigs</hi> and <hi>John Fardo</hi> to juſtifie their former confeſſions to his Face. Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly charged them, that <hi>as they would anſwer it at the dreadful day of Judgment, they ſhould ſpeak nothing but the Truth.</hi> Both of them inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell down upon their knees before him; <hi>praying him for Gods ſake
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105372:10"/>
to forgive them,</hi> and ſaying further openly before them all, <hi>that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they had formerly confeſſed, was moſt falſe, and ſpoken only to avoid torment.</hi> With that the Fiſcal and the reſt offered them again to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which they would not endure, but then affirmed their former confeſſions to by true.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Colſon</hi> (who had accuſed Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> before) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſet his hand to his confeſſion, he asked the Fiſcal, <hi>upon whoſe head he thought the ſin would lie; whether upon his that was conſtrained to confeſs what was falſe, or upon the conſtrainers.</hi> The Fiſcal after a little pauſe upon this queſtion, went in to the Governour then in another room; but anon returning, told <hi>Colſon</hi> he muſt ſubſcribe it: which he did; yet withall made this proteſtation: <hi>Well,</hi> quoth he, <hi>you make me to accuſe my ſelf and others of that which is as falſe as God is true: for, God is my witneſs, I am as innocent as the Child newborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have they examined all that belong to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company in the ſeveral Factories of the Iſland of <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one and twentieth of February, they examined <hi>John Wetheral,</hi> Factor at <hi>Cambello</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Seran.</hi> He confeſſed, <hi>he was at</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna <note place="margin">John We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theral <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>upon New-years day: but for the conſultation, whereof he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he ſaid he knew of no other but touching certain cloath of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Company, that lay in the Factories rotten and wormeaten, which they adviſed together how to put off to the beſt avail of their Imployers.</hi> The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſaid, <hi>they queſtioned him not about cloath, but about Treaſon:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when he had proteſted his innocency, he was for that time diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But the next day he was ſent for again, and Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> brought to confront and accuſe him, having before (it ſeems) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſomewhat againſt him. But Mr. <hi>Towerſon</hi> ſpake now theſe words only: <hi>Oh Mr.</hi> Wetheral, <hi>Mr.</hi> Wetheral, <hi>ſpeak the truth, and nothing but the truth, as God ſhall put into your heart.</hi> So Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> was put out again, and <hi>Wetheral</hi> brought to the torture of water with great threats; if water would not make him confeſs, fire ſhould. <hi>He prayed them to tell him what he ſhould ſay, or to write down what they would, he would ſubſcribe it.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>he needed no Tutor: they would make him confeſs of himſelf.</hi> But when they had triced him up four ſeveral times, and ſaw he knew not what to ſay, then they read him other mens confeſſions, and asked him from point to point, as they had done others: and he ſtill anſwered, <hi>Yea,</hi> to all.</p>
            <p>Next was called in <hi>John Powl, Wetherals</hi> aſſiſtant at <hi>Cambello:</hi> but <note place="margin">John Powl <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> he, proving <hi>that he was not at</hi> Amboyna <hi>ſince November (ſave now when he was brought thither priſoner)</hi> and being ſpoken for by one <hi>John Jooſt,</hi> who had long been well acquainted with him, was diſmiſſed without <hi>torture.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:105372:10"/>
Then was <hi>Thomas Ladbrook,</hi> ſervant to <hi>Wetheral</hi> and <hi>Powl</hi> at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bello,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Thomas Ladbrook <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> brought to be examined: but proving that he was at <hi>Cambello</hi> at the time of the pretended conſultation, and ſerving in ſuch quality, as that he was never acquainted with any of the Letters from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> he was eaſily and quickly diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephraim Ramſey</hi> was alſo examined upon the whole pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, <note place="margin">Ephraim Ramſey <hi>examined.</hi>
               </note> and particularly queſtioned concerning Captain <hi>Welden</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent in <hi>Banda,</hi> but denying all, and proving that he was not at <hi>Amboyna</hi> at <hi>New-years-tide,</hi> being alſo ſpoken for by <hi>John Jooſt,</hi> was diſmiſſed, after he had hanged in the Rack a good while, with Irons upon his Legs, and the cloath about his mouth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>John Sadler,</hi> ſervant to <hi>William Griggs</hi> at <hi>Larica,</hi> was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; <note place="margin">John Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
               </note> and being found to have been abſent from <hi>Amboyna</hi> at <hi>New-years tide,</hi> when <hi>Grigs</hi> and others were there, was diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>Thus have we all their Examinations, Tortures, and Confeſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of eight days, from the 15. to the 23. of <hi>February.</hi> After which was two days reſpite before the Setence. <hi>John Powl,</hi> being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquitted, as before ſaid, went to the Priſon to viſit <hi>John Fardo,</hi> one of thoſe that had accuſed Captain <hi>Towerſon.</hi> To him <hi>Fardo</hi> religiouſly proteſted his innocency; but eſpecially his ſorrow for accuſing Maſter <hi>Towerſon: For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the fear of death doth nothing diſmay me; for, God (I truſt) will be merciful to my Soul, according to the innocency of my cauſe. The only matter that troubleth me, is, that through fear of Torment I have accuſed that honeſt and godly Man, Captain</hi> Towerſon, <hi>who (I think in my conſcience) was ſo upright and honeſt towards all men, that he harboured no ill will to any, much leſs would attempt any ſuch buſineſs as he is accuſed of.</hi> He further ſaid, <hi>he would before his death receive the Sacrament, in acknowledgement that he had accuſed Captain</hi> Towerſon <hi>falſly and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, only through fear of Torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 25. of <hi>February,</hi> old ſtile, all the Priſoners, as well the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the <hi>Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Japoners,</hi> were brought into the great Hall of the Caſtel, and there were ſolemnly condemned, except <hi>John Powl, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim Ramſey, John Sadler,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ladbrook,</hi> formerly acquitted, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> having been (during all his impriſonment) kept apart from the reſt, ſo that none of them could come to ſpeak with him; writ much in his Chamber (as ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> report,) but all was ſuppreſſed, ſave only a Bill of Debt, which one <hi>Tho. Johnſon,</hi> a free Burgher got of him by favour of his Keepers for acknowledgment, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company owed him a certain ſum of money. In the end of this Bill he writ theſe words: <hi>Firmed by the Firm of me</hi> Gabriel Towerſon, <hi>now appointed to die guiltleſs of any thing that can be juſtly laid</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105372:11"/>
               <hi>to my charge. God forgive them their guilt; and receive me to his mercy. Amen.</hi> This Bill being brought to M. <hi>Welden</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent at <hi>Banda,</hi> he paid the money, and received in the acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Griggs</hi> (who had before accuſed Captain <hi>Towerſon)</hi> writ theſe words following in his Table-book: <hi>We, whoſe names are here ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;</hi> John Beomont <hi>Merchant of</hi> Loho, William Griggs <hi>Merchant of</hi> Larica, Abel Price, <hi>Chyrurgion of</hi> Amboyna.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>February, Stilo veteri,</hi> the Priſoners were all brought into the great Hall of the Caſtle (except Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> and <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel Tomſon)</hi> to be prepared for death by the Miniſters. The <hi>Japoners</hi> now all in general, as ſome of them had done before in particular, cryed cut unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaying; Oh you <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, <hi>where did we ever in our lives eat with you, talk with you, or (to our remembrance) ſee you?</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> anſwered, <hi>Why then have you accuſed us?</hi> The poor men, perceiving they were made believe each had accuſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, before they had ſo done indeed, ſhewed them their tortur'd bodies, and ſaid, <hi>If a ſtone were thus burnt, would it not change his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? how much more we that are fleſh and blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt they were all in the Hall, Cap <hi>Towerſon</hi> was brought up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of Examination, and two great Jarrs of Water carried after him. What he there did or ſuffered was unknown to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without: but it ſeemeth they made him then to underwrite his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. After Supper <hi>John Powl, Ephraim Ramſey. Th. Ladbrook,</hi> and <hi>John Sadler,</hi> who were found not guilty, as aforeſaid, were taken from the reſt, and put into another room. By and by alſo were <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Colſon,</hi> and <hi>Edward Collins</hi> brought from the reſt; into the room where <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> lay: The Fiſcal told them, it was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours mercy to ſave one of them three: and it being indifferent to him which of them were the man, it was his pleaſure they ſhould draw lots for it, which they did, and the free lot fell to <hi>Edward Collins;</hi> who then was carried away to the Chamber, where <hi>John Powl</hi> and the reſt that were quit, lodged, and <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> back into the Hall. Anon alſo <hi>John Beomont</hi> was brought out of the Hall into the Chamber,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105372:12"/>
where <hi>John Powl,</hi> and the reſt of the acquitted perſons were, and was told, that he was beholding to <hi>Peter Johnſon</hi> the Dutch Merchant of <hi>Lobo,</hi> and to the Secretary; for they two had begged his Life.</p>
            <p>So then there remained in the Hall ten of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> (as is ſaid before) were kept in ſeveral rooms apart from the reſt. To theſe that remained in the Hall, came the Dutch Miniſters, who telling them how ſhort a time they had to live, admoniſhed and exhorted them to make their true confeſſions: for it was a dangerous and deſperate thing to diſſemble at ſuch a time. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtill profeſſed their innocency, and prayed the Miniſters that they might all receive the Sacraments, as a Seal of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Sins: &amp; withall, thereby to confirm their laſt profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Innocency. But this would by no means be granted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> ſaid thus unto the Miniſters; You manifeſt unto us the danger of diſſimulation in this caſe. But tell us, if we ſuffer guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, being otherwiſe alſo true believers in Chriſt Jeſus, What ſhall be our reward? The Preacher anſwered, <hi>By how much the clearer you are, ſo much the more glorious ſhall be your reſurrection.</hi> With that word, <hi>Colſon,</hi> ſtarted up, imbraced the Preacher, and gave him his Purſe, with ſuch mony as he had in it, ſaying, <hi>Domine,</hi> God bleſs you: tell the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I freely forgive him; and I intreat you, to exhort him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his bloudy tragidy, wrought upon us poor innocent ſouls. Here all the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſignified their conſent to this Speech.

And they all freely forgave one another: for none had been ſo falſly accuſed, but he himſelf had accuſed another as falſly. In particular, <hi>George Sharrock</hi> (who ſurvived to relate this nights paſſage) kneeled down to <hi>John Clark</hi> whom he had accuſed of the Tale at <hi>Hitto</hi> above mentioned, and craved forgiveneſs or his hands. <hi>Clark</hi> freely forgave him, ſaying; how ſhould I look to be forgiven of God, if I ſhould not forgive you, having my ſelf ſo falſly accuſed Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> and others?</p>

After this, they ſpent the reſt of the doleful Night in Prayer, Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and Comforting one another; though the Dutch that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, offered them Wine, bidding them drink <hi>Luſtick,</hi> and drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſorrow; according to the Cuſtom of their own Nation in the like caſe, but contrary to the nature of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

They all requeſted him to relate unto their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> the Innocency of their Cauſe, taking it upon their deaths, that what they had confeſſed againſt themſelves and others touching this crime, was all falſe, and forced by fear of Torture.</p>
            <p>The ſame Morning <hi>William Webber</hi> was called again into the Fiſcals Room, and there preſſed to produce the Letter, which he had before confeſſed to have received from <hi>John Clark,</hi> in the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> whereof ſome great buſineſs was intimated. They promiſed him his Life, if he would deliver or produce them that Letter: which although he did not, nor indeed could, yet at laſt they pardoned him, and ſent him to the reſt that were ſaved, and <hi>Sharrock</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>That morning <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> underſtanding that <hi>John Beomont</hi> was pardoned, made means to have him come and ſpeak with him; which with much ado he obtained. <hi>Beomont</hi> found him ſitting in a Chamber, all alone, in a moſt miſerable faſhion; the wounds of his Torture bound up, but the matter and gore-blood iſſuing through the Rollers. He took Mr. <hi>Beomont</hi> by the hand, and prayed him when he came into <hi>England,</hi> to do his Duty to the Honourable Company his Maſters, to Mr. <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and to his Brother <hi>Billingſley,</hi> and to certifie them of his Innocency, which (ſaid he) you your ſelf know well enough.</p>
            <p>All things being prepared for the Execution, the Condemned were brought forth of the Hall, along by the Chamber were the quit and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned were, who ſtood in the door, to give and take the farewel of their Countrey-men now going to Execution.

               </gap> and charged thoſe that were ſaved, to bear witneſs to their Friends in <hi>England</hi> of their Innocency, and that they died not Traitors, but ſo many innocents, meerly murthered by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom they prayed God to forgive their Blood-thirſtineſs, and to have Mercy upon their own Souls.</p>
            <p>Being brought into the Yard, their Sentence was there read unto them from a Gallery, and then they were thence carried unto the place of Execution, together with nine <hi>Japons,</hi> and a Portugal; not the ordinary

and ſhort way, but round about in a long Proceſſion through the Town, the way guarded with five Companies of Soldiers, Dutch and Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and thronged with the Natives of the Iſland, that (upon the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given the day before by the ſound of the Drum) flocked together to behold this triumph of the Dutch over the Engliſh. <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi> had conceived a Prayer in Writing, in the end whereof he proteſted his Innocency: which Prayer he read to his Fellows the Night before, and now alſo at the place of Execution devoutly pronounced the ſame; then threw away the Paper, which the Governour cauſed to be brought to him, and kept it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> told the reſt, he did not doubt but God would ſhew ſome ſign of their Innoceny; and every one of the reſt took it ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their death, that they were utterly guiltleſs; and ſo one by one with great cheerfulneſs ſuffered the fatal ſtroke.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> Prayed over his Beads very devoutly, and often kiſſed the Croſs, ſwearing thereupon, that he was utterly Innocent of this Treaſon: yet confeſſed, that God had juſtly brought this puniſhment upon him, for that having a Wife in his own Country, he had by the perſwaſion of the Dutch Governour, taken another in that Country, his firſt being yet living.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Japons</hi> likewiſe (according to their Religion) ſhut up their laſt Act with the like profeſſion of their Innocency. So there ſuffered Ten <hi>Engliſh-men, viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Gabriel Towerſon,</hi> the Agent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Amboyna; Samuel Colſon,</hi> Factor at <hi>Hitto; Emanuel Tomſon,</hi> Aſſiſtant at <hi>Amboyna; Timothy Johnſon,</hi> Aſſiſtant there alſo; <hi>John Wetheral,</hi> Factor at <hi>Cambello; John Clark,</hi> Aſſiſtant at <hi>Hitto; VVilliam Griggs,</hi> Factor at <hi>Larica; John Fardo,</hi> Steward of the Houſe; <hi>Abel Price,</hi> Chirurgion; and <hi>Robert Brown,</hi> Taylor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugal</hi> alſo ſuffered with them; his name was <hi>Auguſtin Perez;</hi> he was born at <hi>Bengala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The names of the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> that ſuffered (if any be curious to know them) were as followeth:</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:105372:13"/>
Beſides theſe, there were two other <hi>Japoneſes,</hi> the one named <hi>Soyſino,</hi> born at <hi>Firando;</hi> and the other <hi>Sacoube,</hi> of the ſame place: The former of which being Tortured, confeſſed both to have been privy to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Treaſon, and to have offered his ſervice / unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to aid them in taking of the Caſtle: and the latter confeſſed to have had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Conſultation of the other <hi>Japons</hi> to this purpoſe. But neither of them was executed, nor ſo much as condemned. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were ſaved.</p>
            <p>They had prepared a Cloth of black Velvet for Captain <hi>Towerſon's</hi> Body to fall upon; which being ſtained and defaced with his blood, they afterwards put to the account of the <hi>Engliſh Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the inſtant of the Execution, there aroſe a great darkneſs, with a ſudden and violent guſt of wind and tempeſt, whereby two of the Dutch Ships riding in the harbour, were driven from Anchor, and with great labour and difficulty ſaved from the Rocks. Within a few days after one <hi>VVilliam Dunckin,</hi> who had told the Governour, <hi>That</hi> Robert Brown <hi>the Engliſh Taylor, had a few Months before told him, he hoped, that within ſix Months the Engliſh ſhould have as much to do in the Caſtle of</hi> Amboyna, <hi>as the Dutch:</hi> This fellow coming upon an evening to the Grave where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were buried, being all (ſave Captain <hi>Towerſon)</hi> in one Pit, fell down upon the Grave; and having lien there a while, roſe up again ſtark mad, and ſo continued two or three days together, and then died. Forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo fell a new Sickneſs at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> which ſwept away about a thouſand People <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Amboyners;</hi> in the ſpace wherein, there uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally died not above thirty at other ſeaſons: Theſe ſigns were by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving <hi>Engliſh</hi> referred to the confident prediction of <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-named, and were by the <hi>Amboyners</hi> interpreted as a Token of the Wrath of God, for this barbarous Tyranny of the Hollanders.</p>
            <p>The next day after the execution, being the eight and twentieth of <hi>February, Stilo veteri,</hi> was ſpent in Triumph, for the new General of the Dutch then proclaimed, and in publick rejoycing for the deliverance from this pretended Treaſon. The day following, being the firſt of <hi>March, John Beomont, George Sharrock, Edward Collins,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam VVebber,</hi> were brought to the Governour; who told <hi>VVebber, Beomont,</hi> and <hi>Sharrock,</hi> that they were pardoned in honour of the new General; and <hi>Collins,</hi> that he was to go to <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> there to ſtand to the favour of the General. So the Governour made them drink Wine with him, and courteouſly diſmiſſed them: willing them to go and conſult with the reſt that were ſaved, who were fit to be placed in the ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. VVhich done, and their Opinions reported to the Governour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105372:14"/>
he accordingly commanded each to his place, adding that he would thenceforth take upon him the Patronage and Government of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Companies buſineſs. To which purpoſe he had within a few days paſt, opened a Letter which came from the Engliſh Preſident at <hi>Jacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> directed to Captain <hi>Towerſon;</hi> being as he ſaid) the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ever he intercepted; further ſaying, that he was glad that he found by that Letter, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra</hi> were innocent touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Fiſcal</hi> having thus made an end at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched themſelves for <hi>Banda,</hi> where they made very diligent enquiry againſt Captain <hi>VVelden</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent there; yet found no colour nor ſhadow of guilt to lay hold on; but at laſt entertained him with courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, profeſſing to be very glad that they found him, as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> to be without ſuſpition of this Treaſon (as they term it.)

               </gap>e <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Companies affairs at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> by means of this dealing of the Dutch; forthwith hired a <hi>Dutch Pinnace</hi> at <hi>Banda,</hi> and paſſed to <hi>Amboyna;</hi> where inſtantly upon his arrival, he re called the Companies ſervants, ſent (as before) by the <hi>Dutch Governour</hi> to the upper Factories.</p>
            <p>Having enquired of them, and the reſt that were left at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> of the whole proceedings lately paſſed, he found by the conſtant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation of them all, that there was no ſuch Treaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as was pretended: as alſo underſtanding what ſtrict command the governour had given to the ſurviving <hi>Engliſh</hi> not once to talk or confer with the Countrey People concerning this bloody buſineſs, although the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People every day reproached them with Treaſon, and a bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to have maſſacred the Natives, and to have ripped up the bellies of women with Child, and ſuch like ſtuff, wherewith the Dutch have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſed the poor Vulgar, to make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> odious unto them. The ſaid M. <hi>VVelden</hi> therefore finding it to ſort neither with the honour and profit of the <hi>Engliſh Company,</hi> his Maſters, to hold any longer reſidence in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna,</hi> he took the poor remnant of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> along with him, in the ſaid hired <hi>Pinnace</hi> for <hi>Jaccatra;</hi> whither the governour had ſent <hi>John Beomont,</hi> and <hi>Edward Collins</hi> before, as men condemned, and left to the mercy of the general.</p>
            <p>When this heavy news of <hi>Amboyna</hi> came to <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, the Preſident forthwith ſent to the general of the Dutch, to know by what Authority the governour of <hi>Amboyna</hi> had thus proceeded againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and how he and the reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> there at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> did approve theſe proceedings. The governour returned for anſwer, that,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105372:14"/>
The Governor of <hi>Amboyna</hi>'s Authority was derived from that of the Lords States General of the United Neatherlands; under whom he had lawful Juriſdiction both in criminal and civil cauſes, within the deſtrict of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna;</hi> further, that ſuch proceedings was neceſſary againſt Traitours, ſuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> executed at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> might appear to be by their own confeſſions: a Copy whereof he therewith ſent to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; who ſent the ſame back to be Authentically certified, but receiv'd it not again.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath been recited the bare and naked Narration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Paſſage of this Action, as it is taken out of the Depoſitions of ſix ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors; whereof four were condemned, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two acquitted in this proceſs of <hi>Amboyna:</hi> all, ſince their return into <hi>England,</hi> examined upon their Oaths in the Admiralty Court. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi>'s, as alſo of <hi>Emanuel Tomſon</hi>'s examination and anſwers, are not yet come to light, by reaſon that theſe two were kept apart from all the reſt, and each alone by himſelf; nor any other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffered to come to ſpeak with them, except only that ſhort Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, which <hi>John Becmout</hi> took of <hi>Tomſon</hi> the morning before the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before mentioned. The like obſcurity is yet touching the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and anſwers of diverſe of the reſt that are executed; being, during their impriſonment, ſo ſtrictly lookt to, and warded by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they might not talk together, nor mutually relate their miſeries.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> defend their own proceedings by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the parties executed, acknowledging ſeverally under their hands, that they were guilty of the pretended crime; it will not be amiſs to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and recal unto this place, as it were unto one ſum and total, certain circumſtances diſperſed in ſeveral parts of this Narration; whereby, as well the innocency of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the unlawful proceedings againſt them, may be manifeſted.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore it is to be remembred, that the <hi>Japons</hi> were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, examined, and tortured three or four days, before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were attached; and the ſame as well of their apprehenſion, as torture, was riſe and notorious in the Town of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the parts adjoyning. <hi>Tomſon,</hi> in this <hi>interim,</hi> and the very firſt day of the examination of the <hi>Japon,</hi> went to the Caſtle to ask leave of the Governour to land ſome Rice, and brought back the news with him to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe of the cruel hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe poor <hi>Japons.</hi> This had been <hi>Item</hi> enough to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if they had been guilty, to ſhift for themſelves: whereto alſo they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy means by the Curicurries or ſmall Boats of the <hi>Amboyners,</hi> which lie along the Strand in great number, wherewith they might eaſily have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105372:15"/>
themſelves to <hi>Seran,</hi> to <hi>Bottoom,</hi> or to <hi>Maccaſſar,</hi> out of the reach and Juriſdiction of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but in that they fled not in this Caſe it is a very ſtrong preſumption, that they were as little privy to any Treaſon of their own, as ſuſpicious of any treacherous train laid for their bloods.</p>
            <p>In the next place let it be conſidered, how impoſſible it was for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to atchieve this pretended Enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Amboyna</hi> is of a very great ſtrength (as is before declar'd) the Garriſon therein two or three hundred men, beſides as many more of their free Burgers in the Town. What their care and circumſpection in all their Forts is, may appear, not only by the quick Alarm they now took at the fooliſh queſtion of the poor <hi>Japan,</hi> made to the Sentinel above recited; but alſo by that which a little before happened at <hi>Jaccatra,</hi> where one of their Souldiers was ſhot to death for ſleeping in the watch.</p>
            <p>Durſt ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> men (whereof not one a Souldier) attempt any thing upon ſuch a ſtrength and vigilancy? As for the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Japans,</hi> they were but ten neither, and all unarmed as well as the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> For, as at the ſeiſure of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe, all the proviſion therein found was but three Swords, two Muskets, and a half a pound of Powder: ſo the <hi>Japans</hi> (except when they are in ſervice of the Caſtle, and there armed by the <hi>Dutch)</hi> are allowed to have no Arms, but only a <hi>Catan,</hi> a kind of ſhort Sword: and it is forbidden to all the <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon great penalty, to ſell any hand gun, powder or bullets to the <hi>Japans</hi> or <hi>Amboyners.</hi> But let it be imagined, that theſe 20 perſons <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Japans,</hi> were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate as to adventure the exploit; how ſhould they be able to maſter the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Caſtle, or to keep poſſeſſion when they had gotten it? what ſecond had they? There was neither Ship nor Pinnace of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Harbor. All the reſt of the <hi>Japans</hi> in the Iſland, were not twenty Perſons, and not one <hi>Engliſh</hi> more. The neareſt of the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were at <hi>Banda,</hi> forty Leagues from <hi>Amboyna;</hi> and thoſe but nine perſons, all afterwards cleared by the Governour, and Fiſcal themſelves from all ſuſpition of this pretended crime, as were alſo the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Jaccatra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, beſides the ſtrength of the <hi>Caſtle and Town</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have three other ſtrong <hi>Caſtles,</hi> well furniſhed with <hi>Souldiers</hi> in the ſame <hi>Iſland,</hi> and at <hi>Cambello</hi> near adjoyning.

               <hi>Stories</hi> do record ſundry <hi>Valiant</hi> and <hi>hardy</hi> enterpriſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>Holland</hi> is Witneſs of ſome of them, yea, hath Reaped the Fruit of the <hi>Engliſh Reſolution;</hi> yet no <hi>Story,</hi> no <hi>Legend</hi> ſcarcely reporteh any ſuch hardineſs, either of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> That ſo few perſons ſo <hi>naked</hi> of <hi>Proviſions and Supplies,</hi> ſhould undertake ſuch an <hi>Adventure</hi> upon a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-party,</hi> ſo <hi>well</hi> and abundantly <hi>fitted</hi> at all <hi>points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let it be further granted, that they might poſſibly have overcome all theſe difficulties; yet to what end and purpoſe ſhould they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſuch a jeopardy? They knew well enough, that it was agreed between both Companies at home, That the <hi>Forts</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main reſpectively in the <hi>hands</hi> of ſuch, as had poſſeſſion of the at the <hi>Date</hi> of the <hi>Treaty, Anno</hi> 1619. and that the ſame was ratified by the <hi>Kings Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Lords States General.</hi> They know likewiſe, and all the <hi>World</hi> takes knowledg of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Religious obſervation of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Treaty</hi> with all his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> yea, with all the <hi>World:</hi> what reward then could theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> hope for, of this their <hi>Valor</hi> and <hi>Danger?</hi> Certainly none other than that which is expreſly provided by the <hi>Treaty</hi> it ſelf, that is, To be <hi>Puniſhed</hi> as the <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of the <hi>Common Peace</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> of both <hi>Nations.</hi>
