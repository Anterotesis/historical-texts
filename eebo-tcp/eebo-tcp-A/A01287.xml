         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to contend. Who denieth that? but he doth not
forbid to Iudge &amp; determine controuerſies: &amp;
there is great difference between iudging and
contending: for though God do forbid thee to
beate a poore traueling man: yet he doth not
forbid thee to bind vp his wound, when he is
hurt and maymed of others. So though he do
greatly abhorre the hatred, rancor, malice, and
diſagreement of men, yet he is wel pleaſed and
contented y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch pernicious &amp; contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueieth
to himſelfe an others mans goods by
craft, whom when charity &amp; duty cannot bring
into the right way, his diſloial dealing muſt be
repreſſed by the ſeuerity of Iudges. <hi>Moſes,
Dauid Solomon,</hi> committed no ſin, when they
cauſed wicked men to be rigorouſly puniſhed:
&amp; though Chriſt do condemne a quarrelous &amp;
reuengeful perſon, yet he leaueth to the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
their authority, whether they rule &amp; order
cauſes by the Lawes &amp; cuſtomes of nations, or
by the law of <hi>Moſes. Ioſeph, Daniel, Naaman,</hi>
the Centurion, did gouerne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales by
the lawes of the heathen. Surely the politicke
lawes of Kings &amp; Magiſtrates are greatly to
be heeded &amp; regarded, which Chriſt himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2906:8"/>
when he paid tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And the
profeſſion &amp; practiſe of the knowledge of lawe
is warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the example of great men, who
would not haue borne the names of profeſſors,
if the ſcience had not contained in it ſinguler
wit, excellent wiſdome, &amp; profitable directions
for the whole courſe of mans life. It is well
knowen that the <hi>Camilli,</hi> the <hi>Curij,</hi> the <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij,</hi>
the <hi>Fabij, the Claudij,</hi> the <hi>Scipioes,</hi> the <hi>Craſſi,</hi>
the <hi>Iulij</hi> the <hi>Ciceroes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Scaeuolaes</hi> were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler
men and ſingulerly ſkilled in law. And
to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their proper appellation were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.
Theſe men gouerned their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weals
not in the ſhadow, in darknes or corners, as the
<hi>Grecians</hi> did, but in the cleare light of the
Sun, and in the face of the world, vſing expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
as a Pilot againſt the boyſterous &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
affections of the people. And therefore
<hi>Virgil</hi> when he diſtributeth<note n="v" place="margin">Vir. Aeneid. 6.</note> ſeueral ſciences

of gouerning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales to the Romaines.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2906:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
termes, and as it were, couered with cloudes,
and wrapped in darknes: to whom I anſwere
that it is very expedient, that there ſhould be a
certaine art and ſcience of the Law, generall
rules &amp; preceptes, and conuenient diſcourſes.
For the particuler things which do fall vnder
the obſeruation of law ar infinite, &amp; the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of mans memorie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tollerate the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of particular lawes: and therefore it is
conuenient that that which we call <hi>aequum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
which in plaine termes is nothing elſe
but perfect reaſon, ſhould be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and
deliuered in certaine generall preceptes, and
<hi>Plato</hi> alleageth this for a reaſon<note n="x" place="margin">Plat. in polit.</note> becauſe it is
neceſſarie, that there ſhould be <hi>Regia diſciplina
<hi>a princely ſcience,</hi>
                  </hi> for he ſuteth it with that
name, which may by a generall cenſure, order
and diſpoſe of all things without regard of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
particular circumſtance. For the certaine
knowledge of matters, it is good that the law
ſhould be bounded by certaine rules &amp; limits:
For a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not certainly know what were
his owne, and what an other mans, vnles the
Law ſhould as it were by finger point, &amp; ſhew
vnto him, what, when, and howe it were his,
and therefore true is that ſaying of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Cicer. lib. 9. Epiſt. famil.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnia incerta ſunt cum a iure diſceſſum est. <hi>If
you depart from Law there is no certain ſtate
of any thing.</hi>
                  </hi> And his opinion is in an other
place,<note n="b" place="margin">Cicer. in ora. pro Caecin.</note> that our inheritance rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2906:9"/>
vs by the law, then by our aunceſtors: for
though they doe giue is, or leaue it vnto vs, yet
it is the law which doth ſettle it in vs, and
doth preſerue the poſſeſſion thereof free and
inviolate vnto vs. Wherefore it is to good
purpoſe, that the Law ſhould be definite in it
ſelfe, and ſhould conſiſt of certaine concluſions
which ſhould be as the liſtes and periodes of
the ſcience, by the contemplation of which, a
man may be inſtructed and ſufficiently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for particuler cauſes and euents: For the
particuler caſe lyeth as it were embowelled,
and is implicatiuely contayned in the generall
learning, and there is nothing in the Law
which may not be reduced vnto ſome vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<hi>theoreme,</hi> which may eaſily be conceyued
and remembred, becauſe it is generall.<note n="c" place="margin">Marcell. 2. ff. de iur. et fact. ignor.</note> And
though the profeſſors of the Law doe make-particuler
arguments of ſpeciall cauſes, and
do admire examples or caſes to the illuſtrating
of that which they do principally handle, yet
the Law it ſelfe is compriſed within certaine
rules. Neyther ought it to trouble vs, that
the Law bookes are ſo huge, &amp; large, and that
there is ſuch an ocean of reportes, and ſuch a
perplexed confuſion of opinions, becauſe the
ſcience it ſelfe is ſhort and eaſie to one that is
diligent, according to that ſaying: <hi>Industriae
omnia ſerua fiunt, <hi>All thinges are ſeruants to
diligence,</hi>
                  </hi> or come at her commaund, and artes
<pb facs="tcp:2906:10"/>
ar not to be eſtemed by the greatnes or ſmalnes
of the books, but by the goodnes of their rules.
And though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes which do vind mens liues
&amp; maners ought to be vnderſtood of all, that
their preſcript being knowen, men may decline
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is for bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; follow that which
is commaunded: yet that may be done either
by their own means, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes of others:
&amp; if a mans braine be no fit mould for the Law,
let an other mans mouth be his teacher. Hence
commeth the name of Counſailor, becauſe in
doubtful cauſes he may reſolue &amp; giue counſel:
Whereby appeareth aſwell the neceſſity, as
the excellent vſe of the calling: for what can be
more conuenient or of better oportunitie, then
that a man of experience ſhould ſhew the way
to one that is ignorant. It is therfore expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
that there ſhould be lawes written, &amp; that ſuch
lawes ſhould not be altered without vrgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
for it is a fonde part to ſtriue againſt the
courſe &amp; ſtream of lawes, &amp; cuſtomes receiued.
A great queſtion it hath bin heretofore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common weales were better gouerned by
written Lawes, or by the preſent &amp; voluntary
conceit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Magiſtrate: This matter, becauſe
religion it ſelfe hath committed ciuil duties to
the wiſdome and ordering of man, ought to be
meaſured by the examples of wiſe gouernors &amp;
by popular ſenſe. What good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal hath
there euer bin without written Lawes, which
haue bin vſed by the <hi>Egyptians, Cretenſians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2906:10"/>
Romanes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iewes.</hi> The writing or the
engrauing of lawes in Tables is a principall
cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certainty of the ſame, &amp; without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
it ſhould be of ſmal credit: for what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or force ſhould it haue, if it did alwaies
change like the Moone, or like <hi>Vertumnus:</hi> but
when cauſes ar decided by the opinion &amp; wil of
the Magiſtrate, the power of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be
in the hands of ſuch as be vnſkilful, or wicked, &amp;
ſo either for want of ſkil, or conſcience, Iuſtice
may faile of her courſe. How often might the
prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; ſhew of iuſtice beguile vs? how often
might iuſtice be peruerted by fauor or malice?
But if Lawes were not generall, &amp; ſhould not
ſometimes reſtrain Magiſtrates &amp; gouernors,
great inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would enſue: euen as great
as happened in <hi>Athens</hi> by the violent domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the 30. tirants, who when they had can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
&amp; diſadnulled the Lawes, did exerciſe a
common butchery and ſlaughter of good men:
Wherfore, as in dangerous tempeſtes the ſhip
is not raſhly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the winds: but there
is neede of a ſkilful Pylot by cunning &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
to gouern: ſo the wauering &amp; paſſionate
mind of the Magiſtrate, muſt be ballaſſed and
weighed downe by Law, leaſt his own priuate
affections do driue him from doing Iuſtice as
from the hauen. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth, that God
ruleth that common weale which is gouerned
by a written Law, becauſe the Lawes are the
<pb facs="tcp:2906:11"/>
champions and defenders of conuenient liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then which there is nothing more pleaſant
in this life: for what thing can be more happy,
then to be free from the feare of iniury, &amp; ſafely
to inioy the ſocietie of men, and therefore he
would not haue the gouerment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale to be committed to any one man,
though very vertuous, without the regiment
and direction of Lawes. Neither let any man
ſay, that I do ſiniſterly iudge of the natures &amp;
diſpoſitions of men, in that I accompt no man
of ſo approued and ſpeciall vertue, and fidelity,
that the mannaging of common affaires may
be offered vnto him to order them at his will
and pleaſure without the appointment &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of lawes: ſurely I could wiſh that euery
gouernor were a <hi>Numa:</hi> But yet I would
haue the law to be ioyned with the Magiſtrate
in the act of gouerment. Neither do I fancy
or figure in my minde any happier common
weale, then ſuch as may accord with the tenor
and progreſſe of humaine affaires. If a man
ſhould imagine that the aucthoritie of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were in the handes of the Stoikes, ſuch
as would neither be moued by hatre, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
though they in other reſpects were very
vnfit to gouerne, how ſhall their humors be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied,
who had rather be gouerned by written
lawes, then by vpright Magiſtrates? for ſuch
is the madnes and frowardnes of ſome, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2906:11"/>
they wil not be contented with the equitie and
faithfull dealing of the Iudges, but will ſtill
contend by the rigor, and dint of law, and will
trie all extremitie, being often times more at
iarres &amp; at oddes with the Iudges, then with
the aduerſe partie: here the aucthority of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
will be weak, vnleſſe the lawes publikely
receyued do ſtrengthen it: ſo that in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
lawes there is not onely a ſafegard for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
againſt iniury, but alſo for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
againſt the importunitie of the people:
But as wayfaring men whileſt they trauaile
are not afraide of going a ſtray, when <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
image doth point out vnto them the way
that they are to goe: ſo good men when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
law is propoſed vnto them, when by it
they know what euery man ought to perform,
what to auoyde, they are ſecured and do wholy
repoſe them ſelues in the protection of lawes.
To the intent that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> might well
agree, &amp; haue good order amongeſt them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
God did enact and eſtabliſh certain lawes,
that they might iudge by preſcript, and rule,
leaſt the law being ambiguous might procure
diſſentions. And other people and nations haue
either by the tyrannons domination of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
or the outragious diſcord of the people
bin enforced to receiue Lawes as the ſquare
and meaſure of their actions. In the Citie
of <hi>Athens</hi> when there was continuall debate
<pb facs="tcp:2906:12"/>
about the difficult points of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in force,
there aroſe three factions of men, not of the
worſt ſort, but yet not well agreeing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſtate: the Citie by this meane being
greatly moleſted, and the hartes of men being
edged &amp; exaſperated by the feſtered ſore and
cankerworme of contention, the gouernment
was committed to <hi>Solon:</hi> he ſurueying by depth
of iudgement the weake, and impuiſſant eſtate
of the Citie, made Lawes, whereby peace and
contentment were reſtored: And when he ſaw,
that theſe Lawes were the ſinewes of the good
eſtate of the citie, he determined that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſhould hold any iudiciall place, ſhould in
preciſe tearmes take oath that he would iudge
according to the Lawes. This was alſo the
cauſe why the <hi>Romanes</hi> dyd flie to a written
law: the Magiſtrates dyd arrogate &amp; aſſume
too much to them ſelues, the people did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
grudge and murmure that their honeſt
libertie was impeached by the maner of their
ruling, and the beſt men were at variance in
matters of Law: ſo that it was thought meete
that ſome equall Lawes ſhould be in force,
whereby the raſhneſſe of the people, &amp; the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Magiſtrates might be moderated:
For this cauſe the Lawes called the Twelue
tables were preſcribed to the City, which yoak
was willingly receiued, becauſe without laws
they knew their common weal could not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2906:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor continue. And as there ought to be a
certain forme of Lawes, ſo theſe lawes ought
not to be altered or abrogated wythout great
occaſion, &amp; the euident aduantage of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
weale. There was a Law amongeſt them of
<hi>Locros,</hi> that whoſoeuer would make a motion
or inuectiue againſt any receiued law, ſhould
therof deliuer his mind, hauing an halter about
his neck, &amp; if it were agreed by the aſſembly,
that the thing which he indeuored to perſwade
were for the good of the common weale, the
man was ſafe, &amp; receiued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation: but if
it were diſallowed, and reiected as an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
admonition, he was ſtreight way han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and receiued death as the guerdon of his
innouation. And in <hi>Athens</hi> there were a kind
of men called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who in all publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
did ſit amongeſt the chiefe Magiſtrates,
&amp; did put them in mind not to decree any thing
againſt the Lawes in force. Thus it is euident
that both the making &amp; maintayning of lawes
is neceſſarie. And it is rightly ſaid of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
that the Law is as neceſſary for the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of a ſtate, as the ſoule &amp; mind is for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the bodie,<note n="d" place="margin">in orat. pro Cluentio.</note> this (ſaith he) is the bond
of all dignities, and degrees, which are in the
common weale, this is the foundation of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the fountaine of equitie. The will, counſel,
&amp; decree of the Citie is contained in the lawes,
as the bodie can doe nothing without the ſoule:
<pb facs="tcp:2906:13"/>
ſo a citie without Law cannot vſe her actions,
power, or aucthoritie. The Magiſtrates are
the miniſters of Lawes, the Iudges are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
the people are the Seruants, that they
may haue true libertie. The Law is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
by <hi>Cicero,</hi>

and <hi>Ideaes</hi> of vertue and diſhoneſtie. So that
in the ſacred precepts of law, as in a chriſtall
glaſſe, a man may perceiue what he may doe
with praiſe, what he cannot doe without infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
for the common places, which be handled

truly good, of that which is perfect happines,
of the beſt eſtate of a common weale, do not ſo
ſufficiently qualifie and inſtruct the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as the law it ſelfe. But here I ſhalbe
croſſed by an other obiection, that great &amp; tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are the labors which are to be ſuſtained in
the ſtudy of the law. Surely there is nothing
of weight or woorth, which may be compaſſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2906:13"/>
without paine &amp; trauaile, and yet if the paine
be compared and ballanced with the profite,
it is but as a few drops of haile to a whole
ſhower of Manna. What would not a toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man do? what would he not vndertake by
his wiſedome &amp; warines, to keep all danger
from the bodies, heads, and lifes of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
to preſerue his memorie from obliuion,
and ſilence: to be of great accompt amongſt
the greateſt: to attaine to that knowledge,
which is the higheſt of all humane artes and

for a young gentleman to gaine the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

yet ſith there is no arte nor ſcience, by which

that I doe require in him, is, to haue the
true knowledge, and feare of God, without
which his other knowledge is but as a
ſword in the hand of a frantike perſon: and
where the light of truth is not, there is a
darke and tenne-folde mayſte about the minde.
But where God is not, there is no truth,
there is no light, there is no lawe. The
ſoule and ſences, are but the inſtruments
of his will, which hee bindeth and looſeth
at his pleaſure. And if they turne from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

effect nothing but their owne deſtruction.
I knowe this is no pleaſant ſound to ſome

of their prophane manners did not onely
regard, but in the very front and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

certaine notice and vnderſtanding what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and conſtellation is moſt fit to enter
into the ſtudie of the lawe: with ſuch dregs
they would haue their minde ſatiſfied. They
perhaps, will beleeue (for what is more credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
then fanſie) that they which are borne
vnder <hi>Iupiter,</hi> are not fit for the ſtudy of the
lawe, as <hi>Cocles</hi> teacheth them,<note n="c" place="margin">Cocles in Phyſiognom.</note> that they
which are borne vnder <hi>Mercury,</hi> are of
quick conceit, but quickly vnconceited, ſoone
ripe and ſoone rotten, eſpecially if <hi>Mars</hi> be
ioyned with <hi>Mercury</hi> in the conſtellation, as
it hapned according to the ſuggeſtion of ſome
in <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the Sophiſt, who writ of
Sophiſtry in his youth like a graue old man,
and was in his old age as a trifling boy. But
they which are borne vnder <hi>Saturne,</hi> are ſayd
to be more dull in the beginning, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of time of more ſound and deepe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then others: ſurely I am not of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the ſoule and the powers thereof are
ſubiect to the ſway and motion of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
If I ſhould thinke, that it were a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2906:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flowing from the bodie, or ſo mingled
with it, that it might be accompted a kind of
bloud, as ſome Philoſophers groſſely concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
this might ſeeme vnto me probable.<note n="d" place="margin">Cicer. in Tuſc. queſt.</note>.
But I am fully and immoueably perſwaded,
that the ſoule commeth from aboue into this
ſtrange matter, whereof the bodie is compac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and is of an incorporeall nature, which
is not ſubiect to the impreſſion of the ſenſes.
For when ſicknes affecteth the bodie, the ſoule
is ſound: and when the bodie is racked, the
minde is free. Neither is it to be maruailed
at, that it conformeth not it ſelfe to the
change of the bodie, becauſe ſome materiall
parts of the bodie are not alway partakers of
the change. Let a man go abroade in the moſt
cold and freezing weather, yet his eyes will
neuer be frozen, let him ſtand by a moſt ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
fire, yet they will neuer feele heate.
The ſtrange and different ſubſtance of them
from the other parts of the bodie, I take to be
the cauſe. Now the Planets do worke only
vpon corporall things, for their influence is
of the ſame ſort as the attractiue force of the
Adamant, or the Geate, which cannot worke
but vpon materiall things: and therefore I
may well conclude, that the Starres do not
qualifie the minde, but the bodie only, which
being a cotage of clay, muſt needs beare the
wind and weather, the alteration and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:2906:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Planets. Wherfore let not any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who aymeth at the knowledge of the lawe
as the marke of his deſire, make any eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of theſe Phyſognomicall fictions: let him not
goe to the houſe of <hi>Mars</hi> nor to the ſpheare of
<hi>Mercury</hi> for knowledge. <hi>Si quis indiget ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,
postulet a domino: <hi>If any lack wiſdome,
let him requeſt it at the hands of God</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He muſt likewiſe obſerue, that the way to
the hight of knowledge is by humilities gate.
Let not the increaſe of his ſkil make his mind

ſpirited men, who when they know nothing,
yet would ſeeme not to be ignorant of any
thing. Euery auditor muſt be willing to heare

                  </hi>
which is nothing els in plaine termes, but
that a man ſhould riſe with an appetite, being
rather ſatiſfied then filled. Yet he that feedeth
more plenteouſly, is not to be reprooued, if his
bodie do ſtand in neede of more copious nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
and a man muſt not ſo abſtaine, that
the functions and duties of the minde and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

doth quicken the ſpirits, and they do
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2906:17"/>
giue ſtrength to the braine, but that which is
vnwholeſome and immoderate doth ſtop,
thicken, confound, and deſtroy them. As in

to haue the rule and maſtery of his mind

               <p>Dilligence in the purſuing of any ſtudie
is of great weight and moment, and in
the ſtudye of the Lawe it hath principall
force and effect, for the caſes are many in
number, which muſt be read, remembred,
and applyed, which cannot bee compaſſed
but by extreame diligence. And whereas
ſome pretending a lumpiſh idlenes, would
haue the Lawe meaſured with narrowe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and woulde haue the multitude of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
caſes, rules, and diuerſities abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and made leſſe, ſurely they giue large te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
of their great deſire of eaſe. But
eaſe is a very badde medicine for difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and their pretenſe is wholy repugnant
to reaſon, yea to poſſibilitie. They that
would haue fewe lawes, muſt procure that
there be fewe cauſes, and little buſines,
which it is not poſſible for any to bring to
paſſe. If it were poſſible for theſe faint
ſtudents to take away the infinite and the
innumerable affayres and actions of men,
then that which they require might ſort
to good effect. But that lyeth not in their
power, and therefore they ſhould ſurceaſſe
theyr ſluggiſh ſurmiſe. For this cauſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douicus
Viues</hi> is iuſtly reprehended of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus

or controuerſies ſhould happen, which none
can bridle or preuent, if the lawe ſhoulde
not handle, diſcuſſe, and determine them
all, the lawe ſhoulde doe iniurie, and it
ſhould not be the handmayd of Iuſtice, it

in the Students minde this reſolution muſt
bee fixed, not to ſinke vnder the burden,
but with all conuenient induſtrie to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
hys Studye, neuer to be wearie of

without great labour, by which hee
may attayne to the knowledge of many
excellent thinges more worthie of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then prayſe. Neither is it ſeemely
to pretende weakeneſſe of bodye, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
of complexion, when health and

imployed in Studye. <hi>Ciceroes</hi> bodye was

not broken, nor in manner altered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
night-watchings, noone-ſittings,

ſhould any man deſpaire to doe that which
another hath done, eſpecially hauing the like
diſpoſition of minde, the like faculties and
meanes to attaine to knowledge, and the like
deſire. This diligence doth chiefely ſhew it
ſelfe in reading and hearing. It is not fit
for him that heareth or readeth, to haue a mind
wauering from the purpoſe, and as it were
going on pilgrimage. A man is then ſaid to
floate in fancie, and to wander in thought,
when hee doth not bend his minde to that
which is handled, and when he is amongſt his
bookes in bodie, but not in minde, or when he
is preſent at ſome reading, and doth not ſhew
himſelfe attentiue, but doth number the tiles
of the houſe, or buildeth in the aire, or doth
nothing leſſe then that which he ſhould do:
but the force of the mind muſt bend it ſelfe to
that thing only which is to be conceiued. For
the power of our mind and vnderſtanding is
more ſtrong when it is vnited, then when it is
diſperſed, and diſtracted into many parts.</p>

               <p>But as theſe things forenamed are of great
conſequence and value to the Student, ſo
wiſedome that rare and excellent vertue of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2906:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the mind is of great importance, which I do
rather exact, then require in a Student, for
without it nothing can be done decently or
perfectly: and ſurely to a Student of the law
it doth ſpecially appertaine, for it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the cunning diſcerning of the truth of
euery thing.<note n="c" place="margin">Cicer. Offic. lib. 1.</note> And a Student ought not only
well to deliuer things conceiued, but well to
iudge of them, and in this part ſtandeth the
beſt part of a Lawyer. It is the propertie of
a wiſe man moſt ſharply to perceiue what is
true, what is falſe in euery cauſe and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie,
not to be deceiued nor inueigled, not to
be vnconſtant in opinion, nor ignorant in the
circumſtances of things. The ordinarie
meane to attaine to wiſedome, is to vſe time
and diligence ſufficient for the conſideration
of things, to heare reaſons on both ſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
in his mind as it were armed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
enemies, not to iudge of any thing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or haſtily, nor to giue a ſleight cenſure of
weightie matters. For as <hi>Fabius</hi> ſayth in

the thing which is diſordered by badde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe,
be entirely reſtored or brought into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

ſufficient, hee cannot be ſayde to doe any
thing raſhlie. Wherefore not vnfitlie hath
it beene defined by ſome to be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the oportunitte of doing things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and the cauſe that all things be well
done,<note n="f" place="margin">Diogen. Laer. in vit. Platonis. Cicer. lib. 1. officior.</note>, and it hath not onely a ſtroake in
worldly affayres, but euen in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
for by it a man may be ſo directed,
that hee may neither decline to ſuperſtition,
nor to that which is contrary vnto it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
impietie or atheiſme. And it is the leauill

rudeneſſe or inciuilitie. It will guide
Iuſtice which gouerneth all things, leaſt it
turne to crueltie: nay it wil moderate it ſelfe,
leaſt it be termed craft or deceipt. By theſe
effects the Student may eaſily perceiue, how
neceſſary it will be vnto him.</p>

The qualities aboue mentioned, do ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
reſpect a Student, that they may be
numbred in the ranke either of adiuments,
or ornaments. One thing yet remayneth,
which is, to be placed and raunged amongſt
the ornaments only, being a meere ornament,
yet it doth as much adorne, as the other doe
helpe: and that is curteſie or mildnes, which
doth as much decke and illuſtrate any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as the dyamond doth the gold to which
it is faſtned, or as the chaine of the necke
doth giue a luſter to the brauerie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and graceth the other giftes of the minde,
without which they ſhoulde be vnſauorie,

of that courſe which in purſuing his ſtudie
hee may not vnprofitably obſerue. For though
the way were plaine, yet to them that know
it not, it is harde and difficulte. And as the
firſt yoake is to the young Steere heauie, not
becauſe hee is not able to beare it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is vnacquainted with the carying of

not doubt to enter. As hee muſt not neglect

the ſtraites of time and neceſſities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

the place where a thing ought to be done
is greatly to be regarded: ſo likewiſe the time

becauſe it is no moderne doubt, but either part

ſome paines in the opening of this

               <p>
                  <hi>Marſilius Ficinus</hi> a man of excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and iudgment doth by fiue reaſons proue
that a man ſhould rather riſe in the morning
to ſtudie, then watch in the night.<note n="k" place="margin">Marſilius Ficinus lib. de vita ſana. c. 7.</note> His firſt
reaſon is borrowed of the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> which
he doth not greatly vrge, becauſe he had ſmal
regarde of their vaine ſpeculations: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2906:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they ſay to be true, he thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth:
there be three planets which be verie
fauorable to Students in the courſe of their
ſtudies. <hi>Sol, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> all which in
the night are moſt remote from our <hi>Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheere,</hi>
and goe into the twelfth houſe of the
heauens, which is called the priſon, towarde
the Weſt. His ſecond reaſon is this. The
ſpirits of our bodies doe followe the ſtate and
diſpoſition of the aire. Now in the morning,
when the Sunne riſeth, the aire is ſubtilized
and made rhinne, pure, and free from al groſſe
vapours. But in the night time it is thickned,
and corrupted with contagious exhalations,
which poſſeſſing the ſences, doe pierce into
the braine. Thirdly, the day was made at
the firſt, for labour, and the night for reſt,
(and therefore it is ſaid in the 104. Pſalme.
<hi>Thou makeſt darkenes and it is night, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all the beaſtes of the Foreſt creepe forth,
when the Sun ryſeth, they retire and couch
in their dennes. Then goeth man foorth to
his labour, vntill the euening.</hi>) And whileſt
the Sunne holdeth and conteineth his race in
our <hi>Hemiſpheere,</hi> with his beames he doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the poares and paſſages of our bodies,
and from the center, to the circumference of
the ſame, he doth enlarge the humors and the
Spirites which maketh vs more apt to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and ſtudie: but when hee departeth
<pb facs="tcp:2906:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from vs then all theſe thinges are bound and
ſtraitned, and then we are driuen and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to ſleepe. Fourthly, it is verie healthfull
vnto vs to vſe labour or ſtudie in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which if it ſhould be in the night the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
being greatly waſted and conſumed by
the motion in the day-time, the bodie becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
weake, and ſo is vtterly vnfit for any
kinde of labour. And he that giueth himſelfe
at that time to ſtudie, cauſeth the Spirits to
flie vp into the head, and they being ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
cannot yeelde ſufficient ſeruice ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the head or to the Stomache. Fiftely
if a man ſtudie ſoone after ſupper, the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
is reſolued into groſſe vapors which
doe fill the bodie and are verie noiſome obſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiues
to the ſenſes. For the meate being
deſtitute of heate and ſpirit, doth waxe rawe
and doth putrifie in the ſtomacke. So that
the braine is offended and our ſtudie greatlie
hindred and impeached. It may be added for
a ſixt reaſon, if any thing may be added to <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
The ſpirits wherein all our agillitie and
dexteritie doth conſiſte, by which the braine
doth worke, are together with the other parts
of the bodie refreſhed and ſtrengthened. So
that in the morning they muſt needes be more
ſeruiceable then at night. Seuently, the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie
or imaginatiue part of the Soule which
helpeth greatly in ſtudie, and principally in
<pb facs="tcp:2906:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſtudie of the Law, is in the night time
confounded and obſcured. Laſtly the bodie in
the night time waxeth more dulle, ſo that the
minde cannot vſe it as a conuenient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For when the ſtomacke is full and ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
with meate, the thicke aire being round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vs, ſtopping the poores, the great ſtore
and abundance of humors is caried, as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
ſaith<note n="l" place="margin">Lib. de ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no &amp; vigil. c. 3.</note> to the head, where it ſticketh for a
time, and layeth as it were a lumpe of leade
vpon the braine, which maketh vs drowſie
and proane to ſleepe: then it diſcendeth by
ſteppes or degrees, and comming into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts doth ingender ſleepe. And it is the
opinion of a learned Phiſition,<note n="m" place="margin">Lemnius lib. 1. de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. c. 9</note> that the
nightlie ſtudie is vnſeaſonable, &amp; that it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
and weakneth Students, making them
leane and exhauſting their bodies. For by late
watchinges their vitall ſpirits through too
much intenſion are weakened, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
humiditie dried vp. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
much by candle light, and therfore his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were ſaid to ſmell of the Lampe: but he
did not begin to ſtudie till the firſt entrance of
the morning, and herein he did endeuor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
euerie man. But whoſoeuer will followe
<hi>Demosthenes</hi> in this, had need to be well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the ſtrength and conſtitution of his body
and to examin,
<q>Quid valea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t humeri ferre, et quid ferre recuſent.</q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2906:24"/>
For nature muſt not be oppreſſed, but mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and meane muſt bee vſed, leaſt the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
being made by too much fatigation
vnable to digeſt the meate receiued, the poares
of the bodie bee cleane worne out and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
The whole Senate of Phiſitions
doe call the morning howers, the golden how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in regarde that the bodie is then in beſt
temper. This may ſuffice to perſwade, that
the morning is more fit for all kinde of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in generall, and by conſequent for the
ſtudie of the Lawe. I hath bin prooued by
probable reaſons, and by aucthoritie of wiſe
men. If this will not ſerue, heare the voice
of wiſedome her ſelfe. <hi>I loue them that

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Prouer. c. 8. ver. 17.</note> I haue dwelt the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in this queſtion, becauſe it is very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for a Student, to know the beſt time
of his ſtudie, which if it bee vſed in ſeaſon,
may proſper, and take good effect: otherwiſe
his labour may bee vnprofitable <hi>God</hi> (ſaith)
<hi>Solomon</hi> hath made all things good in their
time.<note n="o" place="margin">Eccleſi. c. 3.</note> And <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> woulde haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man to obſerue time.<note n="p" place="margin">Eccleſi. c. 4.</note> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will noe longer handle, being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plaine, but will ſatiſfie the Student in
other difficulties, which are more frequent &amp;
doubtfull, and are occaſions, that many which
doe enter into this ſtudie doe breake off their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2906:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
courſe, and bid the Law farewell. The bookes
of Law, ſay they, are not pleaſant to reade, the
wordes or termes are harſhe and obſcure, the
ſtile no whit delightfull, the methode none at
all. It is a ſcience void of all proper definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
artificial diuiſions, and formall reaſons.
To aunſwere this cauil, (for I cannot blainch
it whiter.) I will vſe a two-folde manner
of confirmation, and will ſhew that either the
Lawe hath thoſe thinges which they denie
vnto it, or if it doe want them, it needeth
them not. The writings of wiſe and graue
common weale men learned in the Lawe are
not to be cenſured by <hi>Grammarians,</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians,</hi>
who make a gallant gloſſe of <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtraes
mules, <hi>Alexanders horſe,</hi>
                  </hi> and ſuch
friuilous vanities. For their ſtudie was farre
different being for the generall good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
gouernement of the common weale.
And if any man reprooue them for want of
ſharpenes of inuention, and finenes of witt,
let him be well aduiſed, and conſider the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of their workes, and he ſhall find, that
they caried <hi>Mercurie</hi> in their braine, and not
on their tongue, and that they wanttd not
wiſdome, though they were defectiue in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke,</hi>
which not to haue ioined with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is ſo far from fault, that if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined
it they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a fault, for who wil
not diſpraiſe &amp; deteſt curled haire, &amp; paynting
<pb facs="tcp:2906:25"/>
of the face in an aged Matron. And in their
writinges wherein their chiefe purpoſe and
addreſſe was, to ſearch out the truth of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
matters and to deliuer it to poſteritie,
there could be nothing worſe, then a curious
kind of ſtile, which is vſed commonly of them,
that ſeeke to flatter &amp; to diſſemble, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
with a familiar kind of perſwaſion the
common people, with whom ſuch flowers are
of more accompt, then ſubſtanciall fruit. All
kinde of things is not conuenient for all ſorts
of men. <hi>Rethoricke</hi> I graunt is a pleaſant
thing, and full of delite. But in profeſſors
of grauitie, neither comely nor commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Who would not allowe a tripping gate,
nimble handes, glauncing eyes in a Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaier
or dauncer. But in an auncient Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
or graue Philoſopher, who would not
diſlike them, blame them, abhorre them. If
we ſee a young Dameſell pleaſant and talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
we doe not reproue it in her, but if we
finde that in a Matron, wee loath and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it. And truely from the purpoſe and
practiſe of graue men, there ſhoulde bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more different, then that which ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of too much daintineſſe or curioſity. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi>
his ſhooe is not fit for <hi>Socrates</hi> his
foote, and it is not conuenient for graue men
to celebrate the feaſt of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Veſta:</hi> there is great diſtance betwixt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2906:25"/>
the ſtyle of the <hi>Courtier,</hi> and the profeſſor of the
Law: For if the Courtier ſhould neglect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
ſpeech, he ſhould be no good Courtier: ſo
if the profeſſor of the Law ſhould affect it, he
ſhould not ſpeake like a Lawier. If <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
could haue lyued without meate, he would
not haue eaten ſo much as herbes, and if he
could haue expreſſed his meaning by ſignes or
geſture, or by any other meane then ſpeech, he
would neuer haue ſpoken, ſo loath was he to
offend in ſuperfluitie: Therefore the writers
of the Law are not to be reprooued for doing
that, which if they had done they might iuſty
haue bin reprooued. <hi>Cicero</hi> when he treateth
of matters of Law, ſpeaketh like a Lawyer,
and a Lawyer muſt ſpeake as the Law doth
ſpeake: Therefore <hi>Baro</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">in Epiſt. ad Com. Iuſt.</note> ſaith well, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Law would not haue left to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
ſo many Law-bookes, if they had affected
a choice phraſe of ſpeach. And ſurely if when
the Latine tongue did moſt floriſh, the <hi>Caeſars</hi>
and <hi>Cicero</hi> him ſelfe, did not vſe any gorgeous
and fyled kind of ſpeech in matters of Law,
ſhall we deſire it of <hi>Bartolus, Bracton, Britton,</hi>
and <hi>Glanuill,</hi> when eloquence was in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
or wayne, &amp; exceedingly decayed. <hi>Varro</hi>
ſaith, that by the diuerſe mixtures of people &amp;
nations, olde wordes grow out of vſe, and are
changed, and new do take place:<note n="r" place="margin">Varro lib. 4. de lingua la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</note> How can it
then be, but that the Common Law ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:2906:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue harſh, obſcure, difficult, &amp; ſtrange tearmes
by the commixtion of the ſeueral languages of
the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> the authors
of the ſame. <hi>Polybius</hi> reporteth, that there was
ſuch alteration of the <hi>Romane</hi> language ſoone
after the expulſion of their king, vntil his time,
that they which were moſt ſkilfull of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
could hardly vnderſtand a great part of the
words<note n="ſ" place="margin">Polybius lib. 3. hyſtor.</note> which doubtles was a great impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to learning and knowledge. If the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
wordes of the Law ſhould be altered,
it may well be preſumed that many auncient
bookes of the Ciuill law, &amp; the old yeare bookes
would in ſhort time, be hardly vnderſtood: And
I am fully perſwaded, that if the auncient
Tearmes of the Law ſhould be changed for
more polite and familiar nouelties, the new
tearmes would be nothing ſo emphaticall and
ſignificant as the olde. The wordes of the law
may be compared to certaine Images called
<hi>Sileni Alcibiadis,</hi> whoſe outward <hi>feature</hi> was
deformed &amp; ouglie, but within they were full
of iewels &amp; precious ſtones: ſo the wordes of
the Law, though they be rude in ſound, yet are
they preignant in ſenſe. But ſome perhaps
will ſay mine eares cannot tollerate <hi>ſuch an
vnpleaſant ſound and ſo confuſed a ſtyle,</hi> O
delicate fellow, when you go to the Theater or
dauncing Schoole repoſe your ſelfe wholy in
your eares, but when you come to heare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2906:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of weight handled &amp; diſcuſſed, reſt not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your ſenſes, but vpon your mind &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> was more moued by the
naked ſpeech of <hi>Socrates,</hi> then by the laboured
eloquence of <hi>Pericles:</hi> But this <hi>Rhetoritian</hi> wil
replie: I confeſſe the Law to be of it ſelfe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
&amp; excellent thing: but it would be no
whit worſe, if it were more finely and politely
deliuered. Who wil deny that which is comely
of it ſelfe, to be made more comely, if other
thinges be added to adorne it? To aunſwere
this briefly and plainly, many things there be
to which if you ſhould adde any other thing,
you ſhould take away their grace and beawtie.
They be of their owne nature in ſo good eſtate,
that you can not change them, but you muſt
needs make them worſe: A Tombe or pillar of
marble, if it ſhould be painted with any colour,
ſhould loſe the former grace, &amp; be a great deale
worſe: &amp; a beawtifull face is often diſgraced,
by a needles ointment, &amp; ſo it is of other things
which of them ſelues are fayre &amp; comely: the
thing which is added hydeth that which it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
&amp; ſheweth that which it bringeth: &amp; theſe
thinges which ar handled in the law are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
by the varniſhing of art, but are obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by it. And it is not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſuch a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter to dally with tropes &amp; figures, nor
to riot with ſuperabunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of words, nor to flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; diaperd phraſes: But yet he
<pb facs="tcp:2906:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will further obiect, <hi>Though it do not belong
to the profeſſors of the Law to ſpeake and
write figuratiuely; yet ſurely it behoueth
them to ſpeake and write in good congruitie,
which notwithſtanding they do not.</hi> I would
gladly know what congruitie it is which <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie</hi>
doth require: The fine <hi>Rhetorician</hi> wil
ſay, <hi>abſurda conſuetudo diſrumpenda eſt:</hi> The
Lawyer, he will ſay, <hi>vſus contra rationem an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullandus
eſt,</hi> he will ſay that this is not <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
latine,</hi> it is moſt true: therefore (will
he conclude) it is not well ſpoken, nor <hi>congrue,</hi>
the argument halteth. The <hi>Moſcouite</hi> will
ſpeak of a thing after one ſort: the <hi>Fleming</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an other ſort will vtter the ſame thing:
neither of them ſpeake in Latine, but in their
owne language: do they not therefore ſpeake
right? yes, they ſpeake right and <hi>congrue</hi> in
their owne language, and ſo do the Lawyers
in their owne dialect and language proper to
their Art. Doth any man thinke that theſe
wordes, <hi>Bellum, Exul, Sylua, Proſcriptio, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
iniectio,</hi> were vnknowen to the auncient
writers of the Law? Yet ſometime they doe
not vſe theſe, but in ſtead of them they ſay,
<hi>Guerra, Bannitus, Boſcus, Attinctura, Arreſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
But it is conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they ſhould vſe theſe
latter wordes, being proper to their Art or ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Neither is it meete that they ſhould
change them for the wordes of a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2906:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wherefore <hi>Scaliger</hi> doth vpon good
cauſe diſpraiſe the <hi>Graetians,</hi> becauſe they doe
expreſſe things merely forraigne and external
by wordes of their owne Idiome: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> becauſe they did apply
forraigne wordes to forraigne matters.<note n="t" place="margin">Iuli. Scaliger in exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> And
the common law being deriued from the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and other nations, doth conueniently
retaine the words of the firſt Inuentors. And
becauſe amongeſt Lawyers Latine wordes be
vſed many times in an other ſence then they
are vulgarly and commonly taken, it is not
good to haue the interpretation of ſuch words
from any other then the Lawyers themſelues.
And though the <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Antiquaries</hi>
do in the Etymologicall interpretation of
wordes excell: yet the writers of the Law in
the Analogical interpretation of ſuch Latine
wordes as do belong to their art do farr ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
them. I do not think any exquiſite ſkill
of the Latine tongue to be neceſſarie in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Lawyer: but hold it ſufficient if he know ſo
much thereof, and in ſuch maner, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſort of men, which are conuerſant in the
reading of Latine bookes. And <hi>Plato</hi> hath a
good ſaying to this purpoſe, that theſe things
ought of neceſſitie to be knowen, whereof if a
man ſhould be ignorant, he ſhould be ſaid to be
ſhallow<note n="v" place="margin">Plato lib. 7. de Legi.</note> and ſuperficiall. So much therefore
of the Latine tongue ought to be knowne, as
<pb facs="tcp:2906:28"/>
will keepe a man free from ſuch reprochfull
tearmes. The auncient Reporters and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Law whileſt they writ of <hi>Fines,
Vouchers, Remitters, Reſtitution, Releaſes,</hi>
and ſuch intricate matters, had no leaſure
to note the properties and rules of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
tongue in <hi>Cicero, Plinie, Plautus,</hi> and
<hi>Varro:</hi> they inquired not which was good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
but what was good Law: But they
were wiſe in their Iudgements, circumſpect
in their aduiſe, ſharpe witted in their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
graue in their ſpeech, ſubtill in their
queſtions, cunning in their reſolutions: they
were excellently inſtructed to diſtinguiſh of
ambiguous thinges by moſt wittie diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to open and to argue harde and enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
caſes by ſound and inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
to confute that which was falſe, and
confirme that which was true. And whereas
they are impeached for the want of good and
proper definitions, let me aſke of theſe ſtrict
<hi>Logicians,</hi> what a definition is? I thinke
they will ſay that it is a briefe and plaine
declaration of the ſubſtance of a thing: and
be there none ſuch in the Law? ſurely many:
but they will haue ti to conſiſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>genus</hi> and the proper difference, as they
tearme it, wythout adding any thing els:
But it is ſufficient if it expreſſe the nature
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2906:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the thing, whereunto it is applied. May
May not theſe be admitted for good definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>A Fayre is a great Market: a Market is a

a Countie is a multitude of villages,</hi> Do not

Some do ſpend a whole decade of howers

and when they haue done, they are ſcarſely ſo

bookes written of the Law may be reduced to
theſe fower heades: either they are Hiſtorical,
as the yeare Bookes of the Common Law:
and <hi>Zaſius</hi> his counſailes in the Ciuill law, in
which no Methode is requiſite, but it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to report the thinges done, and how they
were done: or explanatory, as <hi>Maſt. Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
his Treatiſe of the Prerogatiue, and the
diſcourſes of diuers Gloſſographers, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors
in the Ciuil Law, wherein no ſtrict
Methode can be obſerued: For the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

that he goeth: And if there be no Methode in

are the Abridgements of the Common Law,

they be Monological, being of one certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
as <hi>M. Stamford</hi> his booke intituled the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2906:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pleas of the Crowne, <hi>Ma. Lambards</hi> Iuſtice

ſurely his iudgment is out of order, and
that excellent Booke of <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> a

               <p>But yet an other obiection hauing more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers
then the former muſt bee auuſwered,
which is that the <hi>Law is vncertaine, and that
Lawyers in their opinions and arguments do
greatly differ, and diſſent.</hi> But here the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is greatly miſtaken. For the Law it ſelfe,
which doth conſiſt of agreable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions, and
of the iudgements, awardes and opinions, to
which reaſon and truth haue ſubſcribed, is not
vncertaine, how-be-it they which doe argue

amongſt themſelues: but that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
diſputation is not the obſcuritie or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnderſtanding of the Law, but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and circumſtances of the perſons, of the
actions, and accidents, of the time, the place,
the antecedents, and conſequents. And though
reaſon be oppoſed to reaſon, and circumſtance
<pb facs="tcp:2906:30"/>
to circumſtance, yet the Law is neuer oppoſed
to it ſelfe. And if a man will condemne an art,
becauſe the profeſſors and practiſers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
in opinion, ſurely there is no art, nor ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which wil be free from condempnation.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2906:30"/>
If not, then it is euident, that an Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is not to bee reprooued, becauſe the
writers thereof doe in opinion or argument
diſagree. No more is the Law to be diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but rather to be liked for the varietie of
opinions in it. For as by the colliſion or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

So the truth is diſcloſed and made

<pb facs="tcp:2906:31"/>
of the Law, in the reading of which, he may
with aduantage and ouerplus beſtowe his
paines.</p>
               <p>He that frameth himſelfe to the ſtudie of
the Ciuil law, may very profitably imploy his
paines in reading of the <hi>Code, Nouellaes,</hi> and
<hi>Pandectes,</hi> which are neceſſarie for the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Of the auncient writers I thinke theſe
are moſt conuenient to be read, <hi>Bartolus, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
Paulus de castro, Philippus Decius, Alcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Zaſius.</hi> Of the latter writers, <hi>Budaeus, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arenus,
Cuiacius, Hotomannus, Donellus,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
theſe, yea aboue theſe, him whom I
lately named <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> who by his
great induſtrie hath quickned the dead bodie
the Ciuil Law written by the auncient <hi>Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
and hath in his learned labours expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the iudgement of a great ſtate-man: the
ſoundnes of a deepe Philoſopher, and the ſkill
of a cunning Ciuilian: Learning in him hath
ſhewed all her force, and he is therefore admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
becauſe he is abſolute.</p>
               <p>The common Lawe is for the moſt part
contained in the bookes called the <hi>Annals</hi> of
the Law, or yere Bookes, all which are to be
read, if the ſtudent will attaine to any depthe
in the Law. In them he ſhall ſee notable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
well worthy of paines and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The two late reporters are <hi>Ma. Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and <hi>Sir Iames Dyer,</hi> who by a ſeuerall and

diſtinct kind of diſcourſe, haue both laboured
to profit poſteritie. Some humors doe more
fancie <hi>Plowden</hi> for his fulnes of argument,
and plaine kinde of proofe: others doe more
like <hi>Dyer,</hi> for his ſtrictnes and breuity. <hi>Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
may be compared to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
to <hi>Phocion,</hi> both excellent men, of whome
<hi>Plutarche</hi> reporteth, that ſuch things as were
learnedly, wittily, copiouſlie, and with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
dilated, and deliuered at large by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi>
were ſhutte vp in fewe wordes,
compendiouſlie recited, and with admiration
handled of <hi>Phocion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be certaine auncient writers of the
Law, namely <hi>Bracton, Britton,</hi> and <hi>Glanuille,</hi>
whom as it is not vnprofitable to reade, ſo to
relye vpon them is dangerous: for moſt of that
which they doe giue foorth for Law, is nowe
antiquated, and aboliſhed: their bookes are
<hi>monumenta adorandae rubiginis,</hi> which bee of

               <p>
                  <hi>Ma. Forteſcue</hi> in his writing ſheweth a
ſharpe iudgement, and in this is exquiſite, and
artificiall, that where hee endeuoreth to bee
plaine, he ſpareth not to be profound. For he
writ to a King, who deſired to haue intricate
things plainly opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma. Littleton</hi> layde a ſure foundation of

moſt ſpeciall caſes, which were either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
agreed vpon, or by the Court awarded
to be Law, or elſe in all ages receiued for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue
rules. For very few there be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his whole treatiſe, which may not be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>
                  <hi>M. Fitzherbert</hi> muſt needes be commended

                  <hi>To know the Law is not to know the
wordes of the law, but the force and property
of the wordes:</hi> for wordes are as it were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to things, becauſe they were firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the plain &amp; perfect diſcription of things:
for though nature do make ſoundes, yet indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie
doth coyne words, without which our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
might be contemplatiue, but not
practicall: for without them the vnderſtanding
is in maner bound, or maimed, becauſe without
freenes of ſpeech, and plentie of wordes it can
not diſplay it ſelfe, nor extend his force to the
opening &amp; diſcouerie of any mean matter. And
as art maketh the mind to ſpeak, ſo the mind or
vnderſtanding maketh art to write. Certaine
it is, that without words a mans meaning may
not be certainly knowen: Of wordes ſome be
artificiall, &amp; ſome inartificiall: <hi>Inartificiall</hi> are
thoſe which the common or vulgar ſort of men

intentions and meanings, ſeruing not for the

are theſe which the inuentors of artes
haue deuiſed for acquainting the mind with the
rules &amp; myſteries of their arts, becauſe words
fitly &amp; accomodatly vſed are the verie images
and repreſentations of thinges, which do lead
the vnderſtanding as it were by the hand, to
the apprehenſion &amp; perfect knowledge of the
thinges them ſelues: wherefore in this reſpect
diligence muſt be vſed of the Student.</p>
               <p>2 Where the Law is obſcure, that ſence
muſt be taken which is leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preiudiciall: for
euery perfect ſpeech of man conſiſteth of two
thinges, of wordes, and of meaning, and when
both the wordes &amp; meaning are plaine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
he that doubteth of any thing is rather
fooliſh, then curious: But when the wordes
be directly repugnant to the meaning, the
whole propoſition or aſſertion is meerely
voide. Obſcuritie in writing or ſpeaking,
is when the ſenſe can not be gathered, 1. by
that which of the moſt part of men is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done, 2. nor by that which was vſually
done by him that vttered the wordes, 3. nor

but of Siluer as a mettall betwixt both:
But that is, becauſe euery deuiſe ought to be
interpreted for the benefit of the deuiſee, &amp; yet
as neere the meaning, &amp; as farre from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
of the deuiſor as may be: Therefore in
deuiſes not words but meaning is followed, &amp;
a tranſpoſing of the wordes may be vſed if the
meaning require: confuſed thinges muſt be
diſtinguiſhed, generalitie reſtrained, ſeuered
things muſt be conioyned, implied things muſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2906:35"/>
be explicated. But in bargaines &amp; contractes
we muſt not reſpect ſo much that which was
meant, as that which is ſpoken, becauſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines
do properly conſiſt in <hi>facto,</hi> &amp; therefore
in matters of contract a mans will is rather
gathered by his wordes, then by his meaning:
for, <hi>propoſitum in mente retentum nihil operatur,</hi>
and as the wordes do ſound, ſo his will is to be
conſtrued: and the wordes of the contract be
the ſubſtance of the contract.</p>
               <p>3 When the opinions of the learned in the
Law are repugnant the one to the other, it is
the ſafeſt and beſt way to follow that opinion
which is moſt agreeable to reaſon: for if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
reaſons be probable, the better of them
is to be choſen, and that which is more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Equitie: and where the reaſon of the
Law doth faile, there the diſpoſall of the law
doth faile:<note n="bb" place="margin">li. adiger. § quamuis. de iur. patron. li. 7. P. tit. 14. c. cum ceſſante de appell.</note> As of the contrary part where,
the reaſon of the law taketh place, her the law
taketh effect.<note n="c" place="margin">l. non poſſunt et li. nam et ait Pedius de ll. in p.</note> But if contrarie reaſons doe
ſeeme to be of great force, wherof the one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to a publique good, the other aymeth at a
priuate aduantage, that which is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good is more to be imbraced, fauored, &amp;
followed: for that which is good to many muſt
needes be good to euery particuler perſon: and
theſe things which are generally expedient, ar
with good reaſon preferred before ſuch things
as do peculiarly profit.<note n="d" place="margin">Iulian in l. ita vulnerat. § quod ſi quis abſurde ad leg. Aquilei.</note> But that reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which

is for the profit of a priuat man, and doth not
preiudice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon right, may well be admitted.
Publike profit may be conſidered after fower
maners, 1. When profit doth accrue both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
&amp; particularly, as by the gouernment of
Magiſtrates,<note n="e" place="margin">l. i §. huius. ff. de inſti. et iur.</note> 2, when the profit is general,
but not particuler: as <hi>locupletatio aerarij,</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of the Treaſury in Cities &amp; Townes
corporate,<note n="f" place="margin">l. pen. c. de princip. li. 12.</note> 3. when the profit is priuate, but
yet a publike good commeth of it: as the dowry
of women, and the infranchiſing of Citizens,
4. when it doth ſo profit particulerly, as that
it doth not diſprofit generally: <hi rend="sup">g.</hi> as when we
ſay that it is not expedient, that men ſhould
miſpend their goodes, or throw them into the
Sea: That reaſon therfore is of more force in
law, which is more generally commodious.</p>

               <p>It is good therefore for the Student to fift
out the reaſon of the Law, &amp; that by very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
&amp; earneſt ſearch: for the reaſon of the law
is the life &amp; ſoule of the Law: Wherfore not
without good cauſe is <hi>Bartolus</hi> reproued of the
<hi>Ciuilians,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Alciat. li. 1. de verb. ſign.</note> for that he denied reaſon to be of
the eſſence of the Law: And ſurely I thinke
there is no Law wholy without reaſon, I
mean which was not grounded vpon reaſon at
the fift making of it. Yet I will confeſſe that
the reaſon of many Lawes is ſo obſcure, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2906:36"/>
vncertain, that it can hardly be found out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
or deliuered. The Law is the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wiſe men, who would not make any
thing publique without reaſon, though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Law may be hid from him, from me,
and from a number of men: Neither are we to
think that any Law is therefore without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe a reaſon therof can not be rendred:
for as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Iniquum est quod accidit
non agnoſcere, ſi, cur id accidat, reperire nequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Cicer. in ora. ad Brut.</note> 
                  <hi>It is an vniuſt thing not to acknowledg
the thing which hath happened, becauſe we
cannot find out the reaſon, wherfore it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
It is not good to affirme that the Lawes
made by wiſe men do want reaſon, becauſe we
can not diſcouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon. But as I do not like
<hi>Plato</hi> his conceit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he forbiddeth yong men
not to inquire of the reaſon of the lawes:<note n="m" place="margin">Plat. lib. 1. de leg.</note> So
to be too curious in the inquiſition of it, wil be
rather matter of trouble then of praiſe to the
Students: Therfore it is a point of humility &amp;
modeſtie to think thoſe things, which by graue
&amp; ſage men haue bin eſtabliſhed for law, not to
be without reaſon, though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon therof can
not be diſcerned. And that which <hi>Gentilis</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily

that the aucthorities and caſes of the learned
writers of the Law ſhould rather be weighed,
then numbred: that is, ſhould rather be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
how they accord with reaſon, then how
many they be in number: but if it ſo fall out,
that two men of great iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do diſſent, his
argument is to be held for Law, which reaſon
doth informe &amp; enforce to be agreeable to the
truth: For no man will intend the meaning of
the Law to be, that the opinion of any man,
though ſinguler in knowledge, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the truth: For both the Lawyer
&amp; Iudge are the miniſters &amp; diſpenſers of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
&amp; of the giftes of God, &amp; are ſeruants to
God him ſelfe: but the ſeruant muſt not do that
which the Maſter will not permit: but neither
Iuſtice nor God will do any thing againſt
the truth: Therfore, neither the Lawyer nor
Iudge ought to do any thing againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth.
If Iuſtice ſhould iudge according to opinion, &amp;
not according to verity, it ſhould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do iniury,
which thing is againſt her nature. And though
many arguments be made for the preſeruing
and maintayning of the rigor of Law, yet none
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2906:37"/>
of them ought ſo to be admitted againſt iuſtice
and truth, as that occaſion of iniurie may

lawe, no courſe of equitie will tollerate, that
thoſe things which haue bene conueniently
introduced for the profit of men, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their profit with a more hard and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous

                  </note> But ſome
perhaps will obiect, that a Iudge ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
and a Lawyer ought to argue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the knowledge which he hath by the

of a Lawyer, as he is a Lawyer. But
ſurely ſuch arguments are not proofes, and
ſuch iudgements if they be not according to

Surely the light of the truth in an honeſt
mind dimmeth and obſcureth all cauils and

thinke, that a Lawyer hath one conſcience as
a Lawyer, and an other conſcience as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

<pb facs="tcp:2906:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>

conſcience: for <hi>conſcientia</hi> is <hi>cordis ſcientia,</hi>
and no reaſon will require that a lye, by any
diſtinction ſhoulde bee preferred before the
truth. The principall meane to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the truth of euery thing, is to examin of
two or more contrarie reaſons whether is
more probable. That which is plauſible to

the graunt, couenaunt, or deuiſe do faile, we
haue alwaies recourſe to that which is more
probable, and wee imagine that more was

Wherefore <hi>Bodinus</hi> ſaith not well, who
putteth this difference betwixt a lawe and a

               <p>5 The things which be odious in lawe muſt

then to condemne:<note n="i" place="margin">l. Arrianus. ff. de oblig. &amp; act.</note> and becauſe it is
better with the reſtraint of an odious conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to abſolue one that is giltie, then with the

that is innocent,<note n="k" place="margin">l. abſentem. ff. de paenis.</note> therefore there is nothing
that requireth more diligence &amp; conſideration,
then to deale warily where there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               </p>
               <p>6 It muſt likewiſe be obſerued, that when
a thing is forbidden, all things that follow
therof are likewiſe forbidden: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part when a thing is granted, all things
are implicatiuely graunted with it, whereby
we may attaine to the thing graunted:<note n="o" place="margin">l. ad rem mobil. ff. de procur. l. 2. ff. de iuriſd. om. iud. Temps E. 1. Grauntes. 41.</note> and
if the beginning of things be forbidden, the
end alſo is forbidden according to the rule,
<hi>Qui meditatur principiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meditatur etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finem,</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">bald. ad L. quamuis. c. de fide comm.</note>
and things are principally forbidden for the
end to which they are directed. But here a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is to be vſed, for where the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is of it ſelf auaileable, and doth not neceſſarily
<pb facs="tcp:2906:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
depend vpon the power and vertue of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
it may be of force, though the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
be forbidden,<note n="q" place="margin">Baldus ad d. l. non dubi. in 13. oppoſitione</note> for then it is without
the cauſe of the prohibition: but if it depend
eſſentially vpon the antecedent, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
For the better vnderſtanding of this
rule, it is good to be ſeene what may properly
be ſayd a principall thing, and what an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie.
That is principall which is of greateſt
moment: an acceſſorie thing is that, which
by conſequence goeth with the principall.
If the Queene graunt vnto one <hi>Cognitionem
cauſae,</hi> her highnes graunteth vnto him the
hearing of the parties, and the examination
of witneſſes. So the margarites or pretious
ſtones that be in gold or ſiluer, do yeeld vnto
it, and do paſſe with it, becauſe they are but
the ornaments thereof, and were applied to
the decking and beawtifying of it. An acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie
briefely may be taken to be that, which
is adioyned to a thing, and is leſſe then the
thing to which it is annexed, either in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or in valew, or in reſpect both of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and valew.</p>
               <p>7 The validitie of an act muſt be eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the nullitie of an act ſhall appeare by the

cauill,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Bart. in l. 3. parag. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnat. ff. de re iud.</note> it is to be held as voyd, but if the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
propoſed do not ſo appeare, but requireth
a deeper ſearch, becauſe many times error is
obiected that the Sute may be protracted,
there conſideration muſt bee vſed. But in
doubtfull cauſes interpretation muſt bee ſo
made, that the acte may rather ſtand then fall.
But the obiection of error is alway to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored,
when the error aſſigned doth concerne
the figure &amp; ſolemnitie of iudgement.<note n="t" place="margin">9. E. 4. 3. gloſſ. in verb. defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones in de ſaepe de verb. figu.</note> And
therefore he that will diſpute of the validitie
of an award or iudgement, ought to be warie
and carefull, that he put the axe to the roote,
and that he firſt examin the iuriſdiction and
power of the Iudge, becauſe that being the
baſis and foundation of the iudgement, if that
fall, the reſt cannot ſtand. It is therefore to be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered whether he were a compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iudge
by reaſon of the cauſe, of the parties, of the
time, and the place. For by reaſon of the ſute
or cauſe, a Iudge may be incompetent, as if
the cauſe belong to a meere iuriſdiction, and
the Iudge be only a Magiſtrate in a certaine
corporation: or if the cauſe be ciuill, and the
Iudge who taketh connuſans of it be Iudge
of Gaole deliuerie, or if the Iudge be ſecular,
and the cauſe Eccleſiaſticall, or if the Iudge
haue ſome other limited iuriſdiction, and he
taketh connuſans of a cauſe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended
within the liſts &amp; bounds of his commiſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:2906:42"/>
he may be incompetent alſo by reaſon of the
place, as if he iudge of cauſes without his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie,
or circuite, or els within his territorie,
but yet in a place exempted, he may be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
by reaſon of the time, as if he did iudge
before he had his commiſſion, or after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
expired, or if his iuriſdiction were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
as at feſtiuall times, which wee call
<hi>dies non iuridicos,</hi> or at ſuch a time, when a
greater Iudge was preſent: or if the Iudge
were called to a higher place, or if he were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to exerciſe his power. And alſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
&amp; qualitie of the partie is to be conſidered,
becauſe ſome by reaſon of a legall impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
are vncapeable of the aduantidge of lawe, as
theſe that are outlawed, excommunicate, and
out of the Queenes protection. And there can
be no faſt roote or ſure ground of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
for ſuch are to be denied audience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their offence &amp; default ought not to find
patronage. Likewiſe there may be a default
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> party making an Attorney, as if he could
not make an Attorney in that cauſe, or elſe by
reaſon of the Attorney himſelfe, as if he be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeable
of ſuch an office as being not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
aucthoriſed. But if a iuriſdiction be giuen
and graunted to one, it is to be intended to be
giuen him <hi>accumulatiue, &amp; non priuatiue,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to enlarge, then to diminiſh his power.
And though a Iudge of the Gaole deliuery
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2906:42"/>
being appointed and ordained by commiſſion
to the hearing of cauſes criminall, may not
principally inquire of cauſes ciuill and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarie,
becauſe it is a Iuriſdiction limitted,
yet incidently and as it were by the way, for
the better examining of capitall crimes, hee
may take notice of ſuch things. But if the
proceſſe and iudgement bee framed againſt
one, who is not onely not ſubiect to his iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but is alſo free from the iuriſdiction
of euery man liuing, as if the partie be dead,
concerning whome, no acte can be conceiued
or vpheld, the Iudgement is voide.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I ſhewed to the Student in

doth require, and likewiſe ſo particularly,
as to his vnderſtanding may be playne and

to demeane himſelfe well in his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and exerciſe, leaſt the multitude of
howers which he hath ſpent, do ſlip from him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2906:43"/>
without vſe, as the ſand falleth out of the

               <p>1 The ſtudent of the lawe ought to haue
great regard of his ſpeech, and that he deliuer
his opinion or argument in conuenient and
orderly ſort, not after a rude confuſed and
impolite manner, and hee who is not onely
wiſe but eloquent, is without compariſon
the beſt in all profeſſions which conſiſt in
practiſe and in the forme of ſpeech. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
parents and tutors in the Uniuerſity
ſhould haue principall regard, that he who
is to addreſſe himſelfe to the ſtudy of the
lawe, may be fitt with a plauſible grace to
diſcourſe and diſpute, and euen in the prime
of our yeares this care muſt be had. For
by nature we hold that faſt which in our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yeares we conceiue, and the worſe ſort
of things do ſtedfaſtly abide in vs, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſoone turned to worſe, but in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is good to follow the precepts of ſuch
as be neyther too curious nor too ignorant:
for there is nothing more like a may-game
then theſe vaineglorious perſons, who haue
decked themſelues with a falſe perſwaſion
of knowledge. To the Student of the lawe
I doe therefore thinke this courſe neceſſary,
becauſe he muſt liue in great celebritie in
<pb facs="tcp:2906:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the aſſembly of the people, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the common weale. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enure himſelfe from his youth, to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
aſſemblyes: let him not be afrayde
of men, nor appalled or tymerous through
a ſhadowed kinde of life, leaſt when hee
ſhoulde make vſe of hys ſtudye, hys eyes

vnto hym, who ſeeketh that in hymſelfe,
which is to bee done and performed in a
multitude: Yet I woulde not haue hym
too curious and deynty in hys ſpeeche, for
wee muſt vſe wordes as wee vſe coyne, thoſe
which be common and currant. And it is
a great errour for a man to eſtrange him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from the common vſe of ſpeach, and
to exceeding preciſeneſſe in wordes, and
ſtile, doth quench the heate of our inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and brideleth the courſe of our wittes.
Yet it is commendable to haue in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
both good wordes, and good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For <hi>Cicero</hi> dyd not fight with armour
of proofe onely, but wyth bright-ſhining
harneſſe, when hee did not onely gayne the
admiration of the Romanes, but theyr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

wordes conteyne in them good matter, that
the Argument or diſcourſe may not ſhyne
as it were by oyle and oyntment but by

bloud and complexion. It is a feauer-like
payne to endure a mans ſpeech, loadned
with ſuperfluous wordes. In all thynges
<hi>decorum</hi> muſt be obſerued, leaſt that which
wee ſaye, doe turne to laughter, or loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and purchaſe the name of folly, a
meane muſt bee kept, leaſt our ſpeach bee
drye and faynt, or elſe too copious, and full
of circumſtaunces: yet it is better for the
inuention to bee abundaunt and copious,
then to bee leane and poore. Wordes if
they bee not veſted with the ſubſtaunce of
thynges, are of no force: Rhetoricke which
is the Artificer of perſwaſion, if it bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

It is called <hi>Atechina.</hi> If it bee applyed to

and ſuperfluous matters, it may bee tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Mataeotechina,</hi> a friuolous labour, and
a tryflyng arte. There is nothing whiche
more beawtifieth a mans ſpeeche, then an
apte diuiſion or partition of the thynges
which bee handled, whiche doth eaſe the
mynde of the hearer, prepareth the mynde
of the vnderſtander, and refreſheth the

it the wit, the memory and the tongue, are
greatly furthered and holpen, and a man is
made more ready &amp; bold for publike matters,
and the truth which is the marke of our ſtudy,
doth more eaſily appeare. Wherefore it is not

becauſe the opening of the dore, and the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

whether in the ſame caſe if the woman be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

giuen the Student a ſufficient taſte, and my
meaning was in this treatiſe rather to drawe
the lineaments of things, then to diſcuſſe them
to the full. Theſe may ſerue to prepare the
minde of the Student to handle ſuch things
as may ſeeme to be contradictory in the body
of the Law.</p>
               <p>6 That the Student may with more eaſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2906:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compas and accompliſh the things precedent,
it is good for him to haue great care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
and continuing his memory, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a profitable courſe vnder titles to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
the caſes of the Lawe, into which they
may tranſfer ſuch things as they haue either
heard or read, neither is it ſafe to truſt to other
mens Abridgements which are little auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſuch as haue read little, but that which
we by our owne ſweat and labor do gaine, we
do firmely retaine, and in it we do principally
delight, and I am perſwaded there hath neuer
bin any learned in the Law, and iudicial, who
hath not made a collection of his owne, though
he hath not neglected the Abridgements of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
The memory is ſpecially to be helped
and increaſed of the Student, for though it be
the gift of nature, yet by induſtry it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
more excellent. For the integrity of
the memory it is good to haue ſound health &amp;
conuenient digeſtion of the meate, and a mind
free from all other thoughtes, It helpeth it
much to make good diuiſions, for he that deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
things aright, can neuer erre in the order
of things. There is nothing ſurely which doth
either more growe by diligence or by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
more decay then memory, It is not
good truſting to a ſuddeine memorie, but a
nights reſt will adde great ſtrength vnto it.
<pb facs="tcp:2906:48"/>
Of what force memory is by nature and labor
<hi>Themistocles</hi> may witnes, who in one yeares
ſpace did ſpeake the <hi>Perſian</hi> language verie
perfectly and <hi>Mithridates</hi> who did well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
the two and twentie languages of

whiles he was Preſident of <hi>Aſia</hi> attained
to the fiue differences of the Greeke tongue.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> did remember the names of all his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors
who were in his Campe. And if memory
be neceſſarie for any ſcience, ſurely to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Law, it is of weightie impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which becauſe it doth purſue <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and <hi>infinita</hi> requireth no helpe of nature ſo

to builde and deſtroy, and to turne ſayle by

no caſe which accidents may not alter, but
that one thing may counteruaile an other, or

poſſeſſion and title, which notwithſtanding
is not generally and indefinitely to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
becauſe then it tendeth to the ouerthrow
and vtter ſubuerſion of all common weales:
But <hi>Plato</hi> being after better aduiſed did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractate
his former opinion, and laboureth to
confute it: for in his book of Lawes he writeth
in one place, <hi>Let euery man haue the free

he be citizen or ſtranger,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Plat. lib. 8. de legib.</note> and in an

And againe, <hi>Let the inheritances and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

by Law.</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Plat. lib. 12. de ligib.</note> Thus it is euident that a diſtinct
propertie of thinges is commodious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
for the good adminiſtration of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale: It is of two ſortes, eyther an

may claime after one ſort, and wyth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
limitation, and an other may claime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an other maner, and wythout limitation:
As if a man doe hyre beaſtes of an other to
manure his land for a certaine tearme, hee
that hyreth them hath a propertie in the beaſts

he lykewiſe may haue an Appeal who is the

firme concluſion in law, that if ſheepe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered,
or leaſed to one for a certaine time to
marle his ground, the deliuerie or demiſe is
a good plea in barre of an action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,

               </p>
               <p>2 And as the propertie of thinges may be
particuler or generall, ſo likewiſe it may be
ioint or ſeuerall: A ioint propertie is where
two or more are ioyntly intereſſed in a thing:
A ſeuerall propertie when they haue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
intereſtes in ſeuerall thinges: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where the propertie or right in goodes
and chattels is ioint, there the action which
is brought to trie the propertie muſt not
bee ſeuerall: And therefore in a writte of
<hi>Rauiſhment of a warde</hi> the defendant ſayd
that the plaintife had nothing in the ſeyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2906:59"/>
but onely in common wyth ſuch a one,
and this was helde a good plea, wythout
ſaying that hee had nothing in the warde
in ſeueraltie, or wythout ſhewing how hee
helde in common in parcenarie, or by ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenauncie.
<note n="m" place="margin">6. H. 4. 6. 12. H. 6. 4. 22. H. 6. 14. &amp; 1. E. 4. 7.</note> And ſo if the propertie bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall,
the action muſt not be ioint but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall:
And therefore if in a writte of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleuine</hi>
brought by two for certaine beaſtes,
if the propertie of ſome of the beaſtes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to one of them onely, and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of ſome of the beaſtes to the other, the

the Lawe doth maintayne and vpholde the
ioynt and ſeuerall propertie of thinges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the common weale could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.
Now let vs conſider how the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of thinges is lykewiſe reſpected by
Law.</p>
               <p>3 A man may obſerue and deduce hys
accompt from former times, that it hath bin
thought very neceſſarie and conuenient that

               <p>The lawe Ciuill I doe not take ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

which euery citie or people hath appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

of it came from this word Citie,
yet by that was meant onely one Citie
where that lawe was practiſed and obſerued,

               <p>The Common lawe is that which by

likewiſe from ſtatute lawes in this, that
in ſuch lawes there are many times prouiſoes
and exceptions of certaine perſons. But the
Common lawe bindeth all alike, and is not
applyed and vſed as a plaiſter to one part,
but as a ſtrong purgation to all the partes
of the bodie politique, and it may challenge
a thirde difference, for that the Common
lawe ariſeth from the people and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but the Statute originally from the
King, becauſe before euery Parliament, writs

               <p>The cuſtomary Law is nothing els but a
cuſtome long time continued, which may bee
thus more fully defined, Cuſtome is a law not
written, by the manners and vſage of a certain
people or the greater part of them vpon good
reaſon and iudgement, begun, and continued,
and hauing the force of a Law. I ſaid (a Law
not written) becauſe the bare memory of man
is the regiſter of cuſtomes. I ſaid by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and vſage &amp;c.) becauſe no cuſtome doth
grow without the conſent of certains people
or the maior part of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaid (begunne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

things as are introduced by error, are not to
be obſerued. I ſaid (continued) becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diuturnitie of time, cuſtome can haue no
force or ſtrength. I ſaid (hauing the force of
Law) becauſe it muſt bee of equall power in
the place where it is vſed with the Law. Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
againſt the Law of nature is of no force,
becauſe <hi>naturalia ſunt immutabilia;</hi> A cuſtome
againſt the Law of nations is of no validitie,
becauſe that is grounded vpon the Law of

it is good and effectual, and a cuſtome once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed

or reuiued by any meanes. It hath
bin queſtioned how many Actes or deedes of
men be required to bring in a cuſtome, and the
opinion of the moſt learned hath bin, that ſo
many actes and ſo notorious, that the thing
which is done may be intimated into the notice
of the people, ſo that it may ſeeme to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſecrete conſent or likeing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

the cuſtome was not yet perfitte, and

breedeth ſcarſity, and a man can harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
tell which to chooſe. Curioſitie as in all
other thinges it is vaine, ſo in methode it is
neceſſarie. For to proceede without equalitie
of tenor is negligence, and to obſerue methode
vnartificially is ignorance. They that giue a
reaſon of the beginning, continuance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of their tractats and diſcourſes, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

moderate the courſe of matters, that though

they render not a preciſe reaſon of their doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
yet it is apparant to the reaſon and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of others. A twofolde methode
is verie much talked of, and that is by procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

direction of the ſenſes, and making thereof
a generall concluſion, which is eaſie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to euery mans capacitie, ſo that the

for is it any difficult thing to reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,

is the perceauing of theſe particulars to

but in deede the diſcourſing from vniuerſalles

which will not allow any diſcourſe but that

it is good for Students to vſe an artificiall

no more then a man by ſeeing perticular
Mappes of Cities, may certainely perceiue

<hi>Littleton</hi> vſeth, ſoundeth like a
good Logicall definition, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of the true <hi>genus,</hi> and the
proper difference: for this word (inheritance)
is the <hi>genus,</hi> which extendeth as well to fee
ſimple, as to fee taile, and this word (pure) is
a difference, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from
fee taile: for fee ſimple is a pure inheritance,
that is without limitation or reſtreint, but
fee taile is a limitted or a reſtreigned inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
This word (lawfull) in the definition
is not idle: but the meaning of it is, that it is
an inheritance according to the meaning of
common lawe, for if by (lawfull) ſhould be
meant rightfull, then a fee ſimple by diſeiſin
ſhould be excluded, which I thinke was not
Maiſter <hi>Littletons</hi> intent. And againe, if this
worde (lawfull) ſhoulde extend to all lawes,
inheritance ſhould be heere taken according

which cannot be. Maiſter <hi>Littleton</hi> well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth

fee ſimple by certaine adiuncts or properties
which do greatly ſerue to illuſtrate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
the things whereof wee intreate: they
are of two ſortes, externall and internall.
Internall are they whiche flowe from the
nature of the thing it ſelfe: of ſuch ſorte are
the firſt and third properties mentioned in
the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> for in that fee ſimple may li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally
diſcende, and not lineally aſcende,
the nature of the tenure is the onely cauſe,
for it beeyng to a man and ſo hys heyres,
<pb facs="tcp:2906:90"/>
the more worthie heire is he that is of the
bodie, the leſſe worthie he that is of the bloud
and not of the bodie, but the father in regard
of the ſonne can be neither of theſe but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and by mediation of the vncle he may
be heire to the ſonne, becauſe he is of the
vncles bloud, ſo that in the direct line it is
euident, that the fee ſimple cannot aſcend:
and it is a very eſſential propertie to fee ſimple
to be the largeſt and greateſt inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is to a man and his heires without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.
Externall properties are theſe;
which do ſo go before a thing, or ſo follow it;
or ſo cleaue to it, that notwithſtanding there
is no neceſſitie of any of theſe: as for example,
before the killing of a man, commonly there
is ſome brawling and contention of words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
With the acte doth concurre the ſighing or
groaning of him that is ſlaine, and the flight,
feare, lurking, trembling, and vnconſtant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
of him that did kill him do follow the
acte, howbeit ſome be ſlaine, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of theſe circumſtances. There be
two ſortes of adiunctes, ſome belonging to
the perſon, ſome to the thing it ſelfe, to the
perſon as the kinred, countrey, ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, age, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the habit of the bodie, the fortune, the
eſtate, the qualities of his minde, the manner
of his life. The adiuncts of the thing are the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2906:90"/>
cauſes, the place, the time, the manner of
doing a thing, and ſuch like. Of theſe, ſome
be common, and ſome be proper: common,
as if one ſhould commend <hi>Achilles,</hi> becauſe
he was of good birth, becauſe he was a great
captaine, becauſe he was in fight againſt the
<hi>Troians,</hi> for euery of whiche, <hi>Diomedes</hi> is
as much to be commended as <hi>Achilles.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
adiuncts be, as if thou ſhouldeſt commend
<hi>Achilles</hi> for his great valor in killing <hi>Hector</hi>
the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Troians,</hi> and for his good
fortune in killing <hi>Cygnus,</hi> who being inuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,
did barre all the Gretians from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
downe the wall, and becauſe beeing
young, and not bound by any othe or leage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he fought ſo valiantly for the Gretians.
Theſe two later of the proper adiuncts, I
call externall, as not flowing from the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a thing, but befalling externally
to it when it is in <hi>eſſe.</hi> Of this kinde there
are two in the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> the ſeconde and

<hi>Littleton</hi> maketh of eſtate taile,
conſiſteth likewiſe of <hi>genus,</hi> and
of a difference. The <hi>genus</hi> is <hi>hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditas,</hi>
which is common both to it and to
fee ſimple: the difference <hi>in quadam certitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
limitata,</hi> by which it is diſtinguiſhed from
fee ſimple, for that is <hi>non limitata &amp; ſine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudine,</hi>
and by this definition a man may
know what a fee ſimple is, and by the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fee ſimple what fee taile is, ſo that the
rules of arte are well obſerued, which are that
<hi>Rectum eſt iudex ſui obliqui,</hi> and <hi>oppoſita iuxta
ſe poſita magis illuceſcunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the diuiſion or tenure of eſtate taile
doth in the Table precedent conſiſt of two
members, or two differences, yet the eſpeciall
taile is deuided into more partes: and that
manner of deuiding is not contrary to the
rules of methode, for it is too much curioſitie
to exact in euery diuiſion two onely oppoſed
eſſentiall differences, and two diſtinct kindes.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2906:92"/>
There be three cauſes wherefore a diuiſion
cannot be made by two differences. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of noe kind of thing, both the eſſential
differences cannot certainly bee knowen, but
the one of them wee doe expreſſe by a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.
Secondly, becauſe that difference which
wee ſet downe in the affirmatiue is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the true difference. Thirdly, becauſe the
diuerſe nature of diuerſe immediate kindes
of one thing wil not alwaies permit a twofold
diuiſion, for though the diuiſion of <hi>Animal in
hominem &amp; brutum</hi> bee <hi>bimembris</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to rigorous exaction, yet ſithe there be
many kindes of brutiſh creatures, ſome that
ſwimme, ſome that flye, ſome that goe, ſome
that creepe, and the particulars of theſe
kindes doe differ in the quinteſſence of their
nature, ſurely to comprehend all theſe diſtinct
thinges vnder two differences is not to be
required, becauſe it is either impoſſible, or
a thing of exceeding difficultie. But when
things are to be handled by way of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the arguing of caſes which is of great
vſe in the lawe, another methode and courſe
muſt be vſed then hath bene taken in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

the whole controuerſie debated, whether it
were by iudgement, adiournement, or by the
concord of the parties, or by other ſpeciall
meane, and for better direction herein (I am
deſirous to profit others if I could) I haue
ſet downe an homely paterne according to
the plaines of my conceit, in the diſpoſing
and ordering of a caſe, famous in our yeare
bookes, and of great weight and vſe, being
the <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>Mertons</hi> caſe, being very often
at large argued, namely, in the eightenth,
ninetenth, twentith, and twentie one yeares
of the raigne of King Edward the fourth at
ſeuerall times, and was likewiſe touched the
ſecond yeare of Richard the third, and all the
contents of the arguments vpon this caſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered,
as many as did concerne the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

                     <hi>A.</hi> The firſt reaſon made by <hi>Maſt. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
is drawen from the cauſe of the thing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
and ſpecially from the material cauſe:
For if the onely material cauſes of fines be
thinges which are in eſſe, it is a probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
to ſay that of this rent being not in
<hi>eſſe,</hi> a fine could not be leuied. And as the rule
of Logicke is, <hi>Quae eadem ſunt eorum genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
et corruptiones, cauſae constituentes et cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpentes
eaedem ſunt:</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Ariſt. Top. 7. c. 1.</note> So of ſuch thinges
which be the ſame in kind, the cauſes material
are the ſame: and therfore the material cauſes
of fines, that is the thing whereof they are
leuied, ought to be the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> The aunſwere of <hi>Brian</hi> to <hi>Maſt. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletons</hi>
reaſon is by way of diſtinguiſhing, for
euery aunſwere muſt be either by direct gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or direct denying, or els by diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
which is partly a granting partly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>C. Maſt. Neale</hi> his reaſon is drawen from
the ſame place of Logicke, from which <hi>Maſt.
Littletons</hi> was deriued: for he ſuppoſeth that
an Ammitie is no fit materiall cauſe whereof
a fine may be leuied.</p>

                     <hi>D. Sulyards</hi> reaſon is drawen <hi>à compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
patibus</hi> from thinges alike probable: For
if a man in a writ of <hi>Couenant</hi> brought of a
manor, may graunt and couenant to diſcharge
the ſaid mannor againſt the Lord of the fee,
though in the writ of couenant there were no
mentioning of any ſuch diſcharge: by the like
reaſon a man may leuie a fine of a thing which
is not mentioned in the writ of couenant, and
which was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in <hi>Eſſe</hi> before. And this maner
of reaſoning is grounded vpon that rule in
Logike, <hi>Si duo duobus aeque conueniant, &amp; hoc
huic conueniat, etiam illud illi conueniet.</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Ariſt. Top. 2 c. 4.</note>

                     <hi>E. Sulyards</hi> ſecond reaſon is drawen <hi>á ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili:</hi>
For like as in a fine leuied vpon a writ
of <hi>Right</hi> brought of cuſtomes and ſeruices, the
tenant may graunt a rent which was not in
<hi>Eſſe</hi> before: ſo likewiſe in this caſe the fine
might be leuied of a rent, which had no being
before. And this conſequens is warranted by
this rule, <hi>Si in vno eorum quae ſimilia ſunt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo
modo ſe res habeat, eodem etiam modo in
alijs ſe habebit.</hi>
