            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I call to mind the Saying of the Excellent Mr <hi>Boyle, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That if we were Maſters of Specifick Remedies, we might render the ways of Curing Diſeaſes leſs painfull, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44434:3"/>
thereby Gratifie ſick Perſons, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them by the uſe of tormenting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, by Bliſters, Cupping glaſſes, Purges, Vomits, Iſſues, and Scarifications:</q> I could not chooſe but ſet Pen to paper, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this wonderfull Remedy, which I have had ſo much Experience of. In the uſe of the above-named ſmarting Remedies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that recover endure much more for Health, than many that are juſtly reckoned amongſt Martyrs, did for Religion. <q>Upon which account (ſaith Mr. <hi>Boyle)</hi> I look upon the diſcovering of ſpecifick Remedies as the Greateſt acts of Charity, and ſuch as by which a man may really more Oblige Mankind, and relieve more diſtreſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, than if he built an Hoſpital.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrange and almoſt miraculous Cures, that I have known wrought by the <hi>Malabar</hi> Nutt, in the Kings-Evil, would fill a man with wonder and Amazement: And indeed, to ſee ſo many Tumors under the Throat, and in other parts, to fall and diſappear; to ſee running Soars dry'd up, and weak Limbs reſtored to their Strength, upon the uſe of ſuch a plain ſimple Medicine, is exceeding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44434:3"/>
remarkable, and the Author of Nature ought to be highly magnified, for giving ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue unto Plants and Trees, for the Good of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>I am told by a good Author, that a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine who was ſent to Preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Indians,</hi> being a man skilfull in Phyſick, wrought ſuch wonderfull Cures amongſt them, by the uſe of their own Remedies, that they thought he confirmed his Doctrine by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>The Nature of this admirable Nut, is to rectifie the Blood, alter the Humours, mend the Liver and Spleen, reſtore the Digeſtive Ferments of the Stomack and Bowels, and changes the whole Habit of the Body, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salt as it were into the Springs of Nature, whereby they become pure and wholſome, and thereby conveighs kindly Nutriment to the parts.</p>
            <p>I knew a young Lad in our Town, who was grievouſly afflicted with Scrophulous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours under his Throat, had been touched by the <hi>Royal Hand,</hi> and worn Gold, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44434:4"/>
a long time, yet the Diſtemper returned Spring and Fall, untill he was directed unto the uſe of this ſoveraign Nutt, and then his Sores dryed up like a Brook in Summer.</p>
            <p>I could tell you of another Young man, who had conſulted with divers Chyrurgeons, and had been ſtroaked by ſeven <hi>Seventh</hi> ſons, and all to no purpoſe, untill he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the uſe of this Remedy: And then he wonderfully recovered.</p>
            <p>A pretty young Gentlewoman, who had her Face extreamly disfigured by the Evil, and her ſpirits broken with Grief upon that account, was ſpeedily reſtored to a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her former Beauty, by Drops chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally drawn out of this Nutt.</p>
            <p>A Woman whoſe Limbs were Diſtorted, like the Womans in the Goſpel, <hi>whom Satan</hi> had <hi>Bound Eighteen Years,</hi> and when ſhe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was an Object of great pity, gained won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Strength in her Limbs by the uſe of this Remedy; but ſhe could not have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure without a Miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44434:4"/>
Many young Children have received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Cures by the Uſe of this Remedy, whoſe Bodies were wonderfully annoyed with loathſome Humours proceeding from this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, therefore I think the World ought to take notice of it.</p>
