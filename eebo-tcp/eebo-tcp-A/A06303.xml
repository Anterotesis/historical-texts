            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat his Maieſtie by his Proclamation dated 2. Decemb. An. 11. Iacobi, did
ſtraightly prohibite all perſons from thenceforth to vnſhip, diſcharge, or lay
on la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in England or in Wales any Felts, Hats, or Caps, wrought or halfe wrought
in any part beyond the ſeas, And did thereby command all his Cuſtomers and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his Ports to forbeare to take any entries of the ſame.</p>
            <p>That there are neuertheleſſe great numbers of Felts and Hats made beyond
the ſeas, which are dayly brought by ſtrangers into this Realme, and put to ſale
in this Kingdome, in contempt of his Maieſties ſaid Proclamation and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
            <p>The petitioners further ſhew, that by reaſon of the permiſſion of the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into this Realme of the ſaid manufacture of Felts and Hats ready wrought;
and for that there is no prohibition againſt the buying of the ſame in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
infinite numbers of people are thereby employed and relieued beyond the
ſeas, and contrariwiſe many thouſands of his Maieſties poore ſubiects which were
accuſtomed to be employed and ſet on worke by the Felt-makers of this Realme,
in carding, baſenning, felting, dreſſing, pouncing, blocking and dying, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
other feates concerning Felt-making, are now vtterly vndone, and many of
them (for want of employment) are fallen to idleneſſe, begging, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to other euill courſes, to the great ſcandall of the gouernment of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch (as the Petitioners conceiue,) there is no Statute or Law of
this Realme in force to preuent thoſe great miſchiefes and inconueniences, They
do therefore moſt humbly pray, that (for the reliefe of ſo many thouſands of his
Maieſties ſubiects) there may be ſome ſeuere law made in this preſent Seſſion of
Parliament as well for the prohibition of the importation into this Realme of
Felts and Hats wrought and halfe wrought beyond the ſeas, as alſo for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
