            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Secondly, When Gracious and Holy Souls go from hence, they go to Christ:</hi> It was the joy of our Dearest Lord, when he had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his nearly approaching Death, that he could say, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Holy Father, now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come unto thee.</hi> I must leave the World; and I must leave these too, but I come unto thee: So it may well be a matter of joy to a Godly man or woman, when the day of their departure is at hand; when they must say, I shall be no more in the World, my dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends I shall be no more with you; we have so many years lived comfortably together, and in the Fear of God, and now we must part; yet a little while, and ye shall see my face no more; and then they can say, Now my dearest <hi>Iesus</hi> I come to thee. Alas! When Graceless and Wicked Wretches go out of the World, they go to a company of ugly Devils and Damned Spirits; they had a communion with Devils here, and that <hi>out of choice,</hi> and they shall have a communion with them hereafter <hi>whether they will or no.</hi> But as for you, O Saints, be glad and rejoyce; you at Death shall go to Christ; and let the consideration hereof promote your care of doing your present Duty: Now labour for as great and intimate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him as you can possibly get; now let your hearts work and run out to him with the strongest vigour of an intire affection; bid him most heartily welcome, and use him with utmost kindness whensoever he comes to you; when he doth by his Spirit at a Dyty, at an Ordinance, or any other time give you a Gracious visit, be sure to make much of him, and rejoyce in him, and be his joy, and then you may delight your selves in this assurance, that when you go to him, he will bid you welcome, and to all Eternity rejoyce over you, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly, A being with Christ in Heaven, is the best of beings.</hi> This is the top of the Saints perferment; this the highest round in the Scale of the Creatures happiness; there is no imaginable life to be compared to a <hi>Life unto Christ</hi> in this World, and a <hi>Life with Christ</hi> in the world to come; there is no Company like unto his Company, no Presence that hath in it such a fulness of Joy and Pleasures for evermore, as are to be meth wit in his Presence, and his Father's, and Spirit's: It is good to be with Saints, very good to sit under Ordinances, but it is best of all to be with Christ in Glory.

You see here in the Text, that <hi>Paul</hi> desir'd it; and he very well understood himself; he knew there was sufficient, yea, abundant reason for his doing so. It must be acknowledged, That Death was at first threatned as a Curse, and since the Fall it hath been inflicted as the Punishment of Sin. But <hi>God</hi> for the great Love wherewith he loves his People; and for the sake of his Son our dear Lord Jesus, hath as to them turned that Curse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Blessing.
