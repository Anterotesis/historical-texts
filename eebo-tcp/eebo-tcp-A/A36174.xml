            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

2. The late <hi>removal by Death</hi> of ſome of our eminent <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>ſeers,</hi> who were as eyes unto us in the Wilderneſs, and the <hi>Charen</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Horſe-men</hi> thereof. <hi>April 5th,</hi> 1663, That burning and ſhining Light, who ſhone in the Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and gave light to the whole Colony and Country, Mr. <hi>John Norton,</hi> a man eminently accompliſhed, was taken from us, and tranſlated to an higher Orb. Of whom <hi>New-England</hi> was not worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> 20 1663. That bright and radiant Star, a Star of the firſt magnitude, Mr. <hi>Samuel Stone,</hi> the ſtrength and glory of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> reſted from his labours and ſorrows, and fell a ſleep ſweetly and placidly in the Lord. A little before Him, Mr <hi>Iohn Miller</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Newman,</hi> faithful, painful and affectionate Preachers of the Goſpel, were alſo taken from us by death. Thus our Pillars are cut down, our ſtrongeſt Stakes pluck't up, and our breaches not repaired. Is it a ſmall thing in our eyes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our principal Congregations &amp; Head-townes, ſhould be ſo ſadly bereaved, as they are at this day?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſad <hi>Mildew</hi> and <hi>Blaſting,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have been greatly afflicted the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſome ofus the Summer before: our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal grain being turned into an husk &amp; rotteneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Severe <hi>Drought</hi> this laſt Summer, which burnt up the Paſtures and the latter growth.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57160:12"/>
5. Early <hi>Froſts,</hi> which ſmote our <hi>Indian Corn,</hi> and greatly impoveriſhed our latter harveſt.</p>
            <p>Unto theſe and ſome other no leſs threatning Viſitations, is ſuperadded this ſtrange and fearful Appearance in the Heavens, which is now ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a new Appearance this Spring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant to the tranſlation of our Honoured and Aged Governour, Mr. <hi>John Endicot,</hi> from hence to a better World: By all which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Lord calls upon <hi>New-England</hi> to awake and to repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this End Conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What a jealous eye the Lord hath upon us, obſerving how we carry and behave our ſelves at ſuch a time as this. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8. And I ſaw, when for all the cauſes, whereby backſliding Iſrael committed Adultery, I had put her away. and given her a bill of Divorce: yet her Treacherous Siſter Judah feared not, but went and played the Harlot alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Lord expects and looks for from a people ſo highly favoured and priviledged, and ſo awfully warned and threatned. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 7. I ſaid ſurely thou wilt fear mee; thou wilt receive Inſtruction: ſo their dwelling place ſhould not be cut off; howſoever I puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How ſadly will the Lord Jeſus expoſtulate with us, if we fall aſleep in the hour of the Paſſion and Agony of the Goſpel. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. He cometh unto the Diſciples and findeth them a ſleep, and faith unto <hi>Peter,</hi> what could ye not watch with me one hour? each word is very Emphatical</p>
            <p n="4">4. The danger of being ſurprized by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before we are aware. <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 9. She
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57160:13"/>
Remembred not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came down wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: ſhe had no comforter. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15 Behold I come as a thief, Bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſingular bleſſing reſerved for the Vigilant and penitent. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16. When I heard my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs entred into my bones: and I trembled in my ſelfe, that I might reſt in the day of trouble. <hi>Luke.</hi> 21. 36. Watch ye therefore and pray alwaies, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>
