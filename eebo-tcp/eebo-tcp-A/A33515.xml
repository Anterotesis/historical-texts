            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>IT may look like Presumption, perhaps, to appear again in publick, after such ill success, such a fearful Engagement, and such dangerous Enemies, who resolve to draw upon an Author, whatever he be, and fly at him open-mouthed, like a Pack of</hi> Irish Wolves <hi>barking at the Moon; who think that Man happiest that strikes deepest; who, because they have no Wit themselves, will not allow any in others.

Much excess is to be allow'd in Love, and even more in Poetry, so we avoid those two unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Vices, Prophaneness and Obscenity, which (says he) if I am Guilty of, they have ill represented my thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Prophaneness and Blasphemy commonly go together, and the Author of the Satyrs against the</hi> Jesuits <hi>seems to me, to be Guilty of all those three Vices. I don't mean to detract from the honour of the dead; but, as the most vulgar Persons are allow'd to give their Vote, so I only speak my opinion, which, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in this case no body will go about to contradict. As for Blasphemy, of which I was accus'd, I cannot but allow with</hi> Mr. Dryden, <hi>that the using of it is a kind of applying Pidgeons to the Soles of the Feet, it proclaims their Fancy as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in a desperate condition. This I say, because I have found the same immoderate liberty of Verse in others, as well as my self; and if the Supercilious Readers had examined them with the like strictness and impartiality, I am sure very few of them would have escap'd the fire. I do not mean to tread in their steps; for the</hi> Ode <hi>was snatch'd from me so abruptly and unfortunately, that I could not gather time enough to consider what I had wrote. I found</hi> J. D.

               <l>Their heav'nly minds in equal order run,</l>
               <l>And what does move the Father, moves the Son.</l>
               <l>The Son was Mercy, Love he only knew,</l>
               <l>Wrath from his breast, as from an En'my, flew.</l>
               <l>The melting God with pit'ing look surveys,</l>
               <l>The world below, and man's unhaypy Race.</l>
               <l>He rose, and nodding his illustrious head,</l>
               <l>These words to his Almighty Father said:</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Immortal Parent of the world and Me,</l>

Hear me implore: Thee let no Passions move,</l>
               <l>Nor heavy Justice so out-weigh thy love.</l>
               <l>Let no ungodlike Rage begin to rise,</l>
               <l>Unworthy the Commander of the Skies.</l>
               <l>If we should shoot as oft as Man shall sin,</l>
               <l>How soon (alas!) our Quivers would be thin!</l>
               <l>Soon would our Lightning and our Shafts be spent,</l>
               <l>No Thunder rowling in the Firmament.</l>
               <l>Unbottom'd Hell; tho' large and unconfin'd,</l>
               <l>Would scarce contain a part of Humankind.</l>
               <l>Myriads and Myriads would unburied go,</l>
               <l>And crouded Ghosts lament for room below.</l>
               <l>Diminish'd Nature would begin to dye,</l>
               <l>And Earth, unpeopled like a Desart lye.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Are then thy Prophets false? thy Promise vain?</l>
               <l>Didst thou for this the Race of man ordain?</l>
               <l>Have we not fix'd a stated time, when All</l>
               <l>Shall in one universal Ruin fall?</l>
               <l>When the disorder'd Elements shall burn,</l>
               <l>Wither in flames, and to their Nothing turn.</l>
               <l>Till then, Great Father, let thy Thunder sleep,</l>

               <l>He ended here. Cherubs and Seraphs sung,</l>
               <l>Whilst with applause the starry Palace rung.</l>
               <l>They tun'd their golden Harps: Heav'n's Monarch smil'd,</l>
               <l>And streight became more merciful and mild.</l>
               <l>His Rage departs: He feels his thoughtful Mind</l>
               <l>Melt into Softness, and to Love inclin'd.</l>

No Sign of Anger now his looks betray'd,</l>

               <l>I'll try once More my stretching Grace, and know</l>
               <l>How far the Mercy of a God will go.</l>
