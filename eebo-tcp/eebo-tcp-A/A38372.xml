         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ENGLAND UNDECEIVED:
IN
ANSWER to a Pamphlet, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the midſt of the Great and Weighty deliberations,
wherein the Parliament are buſied to find out Expedients
to promote our preſent Security, and inſure our future
Succeſs; ſome officious Gentleman (either ſecretly warp'd
to the <hi>French,</hi> and Popiſh Intereſt, or invincibly ignorant of
the Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi>) hath Publiſh'd a Paper
ſhrowded under the Parentage of a <hi>Perſon of Quality:</hi> Which
being an Expreſſion ſomewhat ambiguous, I am inclin'd to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Honour of the Writer, and to conclude with my ſelf,
That it is no commendable <hi>Quality</hi> in him, ſo groſly to reflect
on the King, to prevaricate with the Parliament, and cajole the
People of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Some ways for raiſing of Money, humbly
offered to the conſideration of the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Author had ſubſcribed his Name, poſſibly the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of his Perſon and Principles, might convince the Reader
of his deſign, to promote the Intereſt of the late King; and
then there would be no need to refute his Poſitions, and ſly
Inſinuations for the poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> (as he tenderly calls them): But
ſince he conceals himſelf, and with ſo much boldneſs Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
himſelf to the Great Council of the Nation, in favour of
their, and our irreconcilable Enemies; and ſo unſeaſonably,
when it ſeems to be their Senſe and Judgment, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Eſtates ſhould be confiſcated; I account it my Duty, as an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſhew, at leaſt, the Errors and Miſtakes
of this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Champion.</p>
            <p>At his firſt entrance he dallies with the people, amuſing
them with unpracticable Notions about Exciſe: So they, who
go to catch <hi>Whales,</hi> do firſt tire them, by throwing among them
ſome empty Cask. I might as poſitively aſſert (in pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to him) That <hi>this way of Exciſe is not the beſt way of
all others;</hi> nor <hi>the moſt effectual: nor yet uſed by all wiſe, and
civilized Nations.</hi> I might cavil with his particular Inſtances,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96491:3"/>
and demonſtrate how improper, and how incongruous they
are; But as he intended them only as a Pretext to Uſher in a
Deſign, ſo I ſhall paſs them over without any farther Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks;
and take notice only of the <hi>two ways offered by him
to advance a preſent ſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is,</hi> A Review of the Taxes of One Shilling, and Three
Shillings in the Pound.</p>
            <p>I am unwilling to be bitter, or to fix a harſh Character up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Perſon of Quality,</hi> utterly unknown to me; but I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
when I conſider ſeriouſly the <hi>two ways</hi> offer'd to advance a
<hi>preſent Sum</hi> of Money (by a <hi>Review of the Taxes,</hi> and <hi>a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
for the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Eſtates</hi>) my Jealouſy is terminated in a plain
conviction, That the Propounder of theſe Expedients retains a
more eager inclination to embroyl us in mutiny and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
than to extricate us from the difficulties which we now
lye under: There can be no way ſo diſingenious, ſo ungrateful,
and ſo pernicious, as to make an invidious retroſpect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on things paſt and done. To Arraign the Prudence,
Integrity, and Impartial Juſtice of the Commiſſioners and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors
of the late Taxes, (which ſcrutiny will reach the whole
Houſe of Commons) muſt of neceſſity grate upon the Credit
and Reputation of the honeſt and ſubſtantial Inhabitants of
every Pariſh in <hi>London,</hi> and of the eminent Gentlemen in every
County in <hi>England;</hi> and if poſſible, and fit to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
it were but to inhance the odious Office of <hi>Informers,</hi>
and to diſoblige all Men, who have eſcaped the ſeverity of the
Impoſition by ſuch an unuſual <hi>Review;</hi> a proceeding more
agreeable to the undertaking of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> and could
better become the Accomplices of <hi>Jack C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de,</hi> or <hi>Wat Tyler.</hi>
And if the <hi>Gleanings of the Tax will come to three or four hundred
thouſand pounds,</hi> what would the whole Harveſt do? Surely this
Tax alone might ſerve to defray all Charges of the War, without
any farther Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>But I am verily perſuaded, that what has been before ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
by the Propoſer, is only to amuſe the Reader with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary
pretences; when as the main ſcope and intriegue of
the Project is to enforce the Chymera of <hi>A Compoſition for the</hi>
Iriſh <hi>Eſtates:</hi> Therefore I ſhall wave all further Cenſure upon
the precedent Paragraphs, and only apply my ſelf to the due
conſideration of that, which in naked terms is thus digeſted,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96491:3"/>
               <hi>That all King</hi> James<hi>'s Adherents in that Kingdom, who ſhall come
in by ſuch a time, be Pardon'd, and have their Lands, paying two
years Purchaſe of their true value, as it was three years agone,
ſome few of the moſt notorious and miſchievous being excepted.</hi> This
fair and ſmooth-faced Propoſal is ſupported by certain plauſible
<hi>Conſiderations,</hi> which ſhall be gradually inquir'd into.</p>
            <p>And firſt, It is ſuggeſted, <hi>That this way of Compoſition, rather
than by Confiſcation and Sale, is the more merciful, and conſequently
the more Chriſtian way.</hi> To which I muſt ſay, that Mercy,
when it is not grounded upon Inducements of Reaſon and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
doth often prove a cruelty to him that diſpenſeth it.
They who have their Portions in that unfortunate Countrey,
have had too ſenſible an experience, how often Lenity and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
have been miſapplied; and the moſt flagitious Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
bardned into an impenitency, and a deſperate repetition of
Plots and Contrivances, againſt the Lives and Eſtates of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in that Kingdom. In every Age, nay in every Reign of the
reſpective Monarchs of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the firſt Conqueſt of that
Country, the Natives have induſtriouſly endeavour'd to ſhake off
their Obedience to their Lawful Prince by Inteſtine Inſurrections
and Rebellions; which being always concluded by Victory, and
an abject ſubmiſſion of the vanquiſh'd; the Generoſity of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> hath as conſtantly defeated them of their due Advantages,
by too benign a condeſcention, and too eaſie liſtning to <hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi>
If upon the ſettlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after that horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in 1641. the Eſtates of the Rebels had been confiſcated,
and either veſted in the Crown, or diſpoſed for the ſatisfaction of
thoſe that ſuffer'd, or conquer'd; there had been in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
no opportunity for the late revival of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Barbarity, or any
neceſſity for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to extend their Mercy now in ſo <hi>Chriſtian
a way,</hi> as the Projector hath recommended. But ſince on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was wrought upon by ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(whereof the Pamphlet now before me ſeems to be the
Tranſcript) to reſtore ſome Rebels to their former Eſtates, and to
confer on others much more than ever was poſſeſs'd by their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
(paying Quit-Rent and a years value) nay, even abſolving
many of them from the payment of Quit-Rent, while it lay heavy
upon the Proteſtants.) It hath only adminiſtred an opportunity to
that ingrateful, and incorrigible Nation, to wage War with their
Benefactors, and to endeavour the utter extirpation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Blood. This indeed were but to repeat the Old Game, to make the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96491:4"/>
               <hi>Iriſh Gainers</hi> by their Rebellion, and the <hi>Engliſh the Loſers.</hi> For what
equality of reaſon can there be in it, to accept of <hi>two years value
of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Eſtates,</hi> who have for above two years enjoyed the
Profits, not only of their own, but of all the Proteſtant Eſtates
almoſt through the Kingdom? And with what face can this <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality</hi> pretend this to be the <hi>more merciful and Chriſtian
way,</hi> to indemnify the Papiſts for all their Rapine and Barbarity,
upon a ſlender <hi>Compoſition for two years Rent;</hi> and never think
of the poor Proteſtants, who have for two years been driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Exile, and forceably deprived of their Eſtates, and from whom
ſo much hath been plunder'd in Money, Plate, Houſhold-ſtuff
and Stock, and ſo much damage done in burning their Houſes
and Towns, and deſtroying their Plantation, that if all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> were ſold at ten years purchaſe,
and diſtributed toward their ſatisfaction, it would be ſo far from
affording a due Recompence and Reparation, that it would not
make amends for the fourth part, beſide the Charge of the War:
certainly no indifferent man can pronounce this to be the <hi>more
merciful, and the more Chriſtian way,</hi> to indulge our implacable
Enemies by a <hi>Compoſition</hi> (who have truckled to the <hi>French,</hi> and
abetted their Intereſt) and to project no Proviſion, or Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our Friends, who have ſuffer'd beyond Example, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to a <hi>Proteſtant King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will it be impertinent to animadvert, how the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
upon the laſt Settlement were treated in a way not ſo
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> nor ſo <hi>merciful.</hi> For King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, having
by his Declaration from <hi>Bredah</hi> confirmed to the Adventurers,
and Soldiers, all the Eſtates they were poſſeſſed of in <hi>May</hi> 1659.
Nevertheleſs many of them were diſpoſſeſt by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> (who were
reſtored by the Court of Clayms) others were turn'd out of their
Eſtates by ſuch Perſons as His Majeſty thought fit to reſtore by
Proviſoes, and Letters. Now for the ſatisfying, and repriſing ſuch
Adventurers and Souldiers, the gratifying of ſome favour'd <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
and for the hope of a future ſettlement, all Adventurers and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were forced to retrench a third part of all their Eſtates (which
at twelve years purchaſe, is worth <hi>four</hi>) and alſo to pay one years
full value of what their Eſtates were really, <hi>&amp; bonâ fide,</hi> ſet for;
which with above two years Rent, which they have lately loſt,
will amount to more than <hi>ſeven years purchaſe</hi> of the Lands they
have been lately diſpoſſeſſed of by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nay, I have ſeen it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
that the Adventurers did, <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> pay 70 <hi>five years
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96491:4"/>
Purchaſe</hi> for their Eſtates, and the Soldiers a hundred and fifteen</p>
            <p>And I would ask the Projector, how long, how often ſhall
Overtures of Mercy be given to them? Is not five hundred
years, in point of Time, and Pardons extended almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
forty years, in point of Grace, ſufficient to make an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
whether a Nation be reclaimable, or not? But if hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch Lenitives as theſe had no other effect, than to animate
them to new Rebellions; why ſhall it not be deem'd not only
Juſtice to our ſelves, but even a Mercy to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to apply more
effectual, tho more Churliſh Remedies? What he is pleaſed to
add in the illuſtration of his Argument, by Inſtances from the
<hi>French King,</hi> may perhaps be hiſtorically true (tho I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I never heard before, <hi>that he had ſubdued</hi> Savoy) but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are no way applicable to the Subject in hand, nor urged with
the relation of ſuch Circumſtances, as make the caſe quite diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
If <hi>we do not hear of Confiſcations, or Extirpations in</hi> Savoy;
I am perſuaded it is becauſe it is too ſoon to alienate, or deſtroy
that Countrey, before he be in poſſeſſion of it: ſo then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact it may not be true, that they <hi>are ſubdued;</hi> and if it
be true, it is no way pertinent; for the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> not being
Subjects to the <hi>French</hi> King, tho they may be conquer'd by him,
yet they cannot be ſubject to forfeiture, ſince they owed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor were before under his Allegiance. If the <hi>French King</hi>
hath ſo <hi>nobly</hi> indulged <hi>the Gentlemen of Eſtates,</hi> where he hath
extended his Conqueſts <hi>in Flanders,</hi> I am apt to think it proceeds
more from Policy, than Chriſtian Compaſſion, the Conqueſt of
that Countrey being not intire, and therefore unſeaſonable for
him to ſhew his Reſentments. And well may he boaſt of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Richlieus</hi> Treatment of the <hi>Proteſtants of</hi> Rochel; it is the
firſt time that ever any of his Religion expreſs'd any tenderneſs,
or humanity to the Profeſſors of the other: but alas, this is but
quoting part of the Text, without the coherence. Every man
knows, that knows Hiſtory, how indiſpenſable a neceſſity lay
upon the <hi>French King</hi> at that time, to oblige him to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with thoſe Capitulations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is offer'd, <hi>that theſe Peoples Crime is not ſo horrible,
as ſome would ſuppoſe it.</hi> And in this Argument is a manifeſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.
The Author labouring to palliate their Villany by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of inflexible <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>adherence to the Intereſt of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
King:</hi> whereas in very Deed their fighting under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>King James,</hi> was but in order to the Accompliſhment of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96491:5"/>
that long premeditated Deſign, to extirpate the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and by this means they had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to effect that by Arms, and open War, which they
could not bring to paſs by Secret Plots, and Maſſacres. King
<hi>James,</hi> by abdicating the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as is plainly
granted by the Author, did implicitly, and conſequentially ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<hi>Ireland;</hi> and the Government which he retain'd there,
firſt by his Lieutenant, and then in perſon, was after our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
King (upon the Adjudication of a vacant Throne) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
through <hi>England,</hi> and in all the Northern parts of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
In the mean time the Spontaneous Abdication of the Late King,
and his voluntary parting with the Prerogatives of the Crown, do
render the Oath of Allegiance contradictory, and unpracticable.
We do not blame Subjects for adhering to their <hi>Natural Prince</hi>
(which indefinitely taken, is a virtue) but we blame them for
adhering to him in the proſecution of ſuch a Cauſe, as did utterly
ſubvert the fundamental Conſtitution of theſe Kingdoms, which
the Subjects, as well as Prince, ſtands obliged not to violate. In
this Caſe they ought to have deſerted, as knowing, that whoever
adheres to a Prince in the abetting of a Cauſe which overthrows
the Laws, is puniſhable by the Laws of that very Prince. But
to ſay, <hi>they were hardly prevai'd upon to ingage and declare,</hi> is
directy contrary to the knowledge of the perſons that were then
upon the place. For whereas the Late King did not arrive in
<hi>Ireland</hi> till about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation were long
before fermented into outrage, and Revenge; they began an
early Violence in the County of <hi>Meath;</hi> before the precede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>February,</hi> they had plunder'd the Proteſtants in <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aught:</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>z'd the Arms and Horſes, and driven away
the perſons of the Proteſtants in <hi>Munster;</hi> and in a word, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
through the Land accepted of Commiſſions: and were
train'd up in Military Diſcipline; ſo that in <hi>December,</hi> 1688,
Thirty Nine New and Levy'd Regiments were added to the
Standing Army; and Fifty Thouſand of the Rabble, arm'd with
Half-pikes and Skeins; and obliged to it by command from the
the Prieſts, under the pain of Excommunication. And ſo far
were they from being hardly prevail'd upon to engage, and
declare, that never Chriſtians ingaged in a Cruſade for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
the Holy Land with ſo impatient a Zeal, as the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
<hi>Iriſh</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ck'd to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and adored <hi>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for Commiſſions, exchanging their Fri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96491:5"/>
and Blew, and jumping out of Brogues into Jackboots. And
in very truth, as the difference was not, ſo the Diſpute ought
not to be, Concerning <hi>Obedience to a Natural Prince;</hi> becauſe
thoſe very perſons who were robbed and plundered, were in
peaceable ſubjection to the ſame King, to whom the Robbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
an <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by <hi>this Perſon of Quality</hi>'s Logick, if we can hardly blame
them for what they have done, the whole World muſt blame
us for what we have done: It had been more ingenuous to ſay,
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been the firſt Aggreſſors; and becauſe <hi>King</hi>
James <hi>did not ſeem to forſake</hi> Ireland, <hi>but retained the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there,</hi> therefore King <hi>William</hi> is an Uſurper, and
all that contributed either in purſe or perſon, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are Rebels and Traytors. And whereas he
ſlily inſinuates, that <hi>they were left to themſelves for many Months,
and to the practices and perſuaſions of King</hi> James <hi>his Agents, that no
Power but King</hi> James<hi>'s appeared in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and we in</hi> England
<hi>were wholly taken up with ſetling our Government;</hi> it is not to be
doubted, but this Argument was skrew'd in on purpoſe to reflect
on the Government, and to arraign the King and his Council of
ſupine negligence, in not applying an early, and eaſie remedy
at the beginning of thoſe Diſtractions.</p>
            <p>The third Conſideration cannot be anſwer'd civilly. It does
not become <hi>a Perſon of Quality</hi> to obtrude upon the World ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
a Falſhood, <hi>That theſe are the Ancient Inhabitants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
of the Countrey;</hi> for howſoever among the Vulgar, and
meaner ſort of the People, there be many of the Ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction;
yet it is manifeſt, that few or none of the Lords and
Gentlemen in that Kingdom are originally <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but deſcended
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood: As for inſtance, <hi>Butler,</hi> (the Head of which
Family, the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> have in all times been
famous for their unſhaken Fidelity to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt)
<hi>Fitz-Gerald, Burgh, Fitz-Williams, Fitz-Maurice, Fitz-Patrick,
Talbot, Preſton, Bermingham, Plunket, Sarsfield, Netter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
Lutterel, Bagnal, Lucy, Dillon,</hi> and many more; tho by the
influence of their Religion, many of them have long ſince dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
into the barbarous Inclinations of the Native <hi>Iriſh.</hi> So
that if all the original Natives of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Extraction (who are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
by <hi>Mac</hi> and O) were reſtored to the Eſtates they enjoy'd
in 1688. the <hi>Compoſition for two years value</hi> would be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
But if a plenary Conqueſt (repeated upon the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96491:6"/>
of ſeveral Rebellions) a Poſſeſſion for 500 years, frequent
for forfeitures, a ſubmiſſion ſo the Laws, a Recognition of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
a derivation of their Parents for their Eſtates, and a general
incorporating of Families, be not ſufficient Arguments to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>England</hi> to the Sovereignty of that Kingdom, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are the Proprietors of it; what ſhall we ſay
of the Race of King <hi>Pepin?</hi> how injuriouſly has the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
dealt with the <hi>Moors?</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> with the <hi>Hunus?</hi> the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Kings with the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals?</hi> In a word, The Ancient
Inhabitants and Proprietors of that Countrey, who are now in
Arms againſt <hi>England,</hi> are either of the mere <hi>Iriſh</hi> Race, or of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Stock. If they are of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sort, what Obligations can
lie upon the King, or Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to own their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
or Title, who have by ſo many re-iterated Acts of Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from their Allegiance, forfeited all Pretenſions to Mercy?
If they are of the other ſort, deſcended from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I would
fain know how they came by their Eſtates: were they not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Forfeitures of the
Native <hi>Iriſh?</hi> And if it were juſt and reaſonable for their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
to take the Eſtates of the <hi>poor</hi> harmleſs <hi>Iriſh</hi> (only for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rebellion) what hardſhip is it, or what injuſtice to diſpoſſeſs
them, who have relapſed into the ſame Crime? I do think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that <hi>in time they may be reclaimed</hi> (as the Author does hint)
but not by ſuch Methods as he inſinuates; not by <hi>reſtoring them
to their Lands,</hi> and <hi>compounding for two years value;</hi> but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a yoke upon them, as they ſhall never be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to rebel again. The Interrogatory, (<hi>How many Civil Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Families are there already in</hi> Ireland <hi>of mere</hi> Iriſh <hi>Extraction</hi>)
I anſwer in one word, There is only one of any Quality, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or at leaſt three or four Families of one Name, or Sept, and
that is of the O <hi>Bryens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Conſideration is, <hi>That mens not ſubmitting to a new
Eſtabliſh'd Government, is not ſo heinous a Crime, as the rebelling
againſt a Government they were born under, or to which they have
ſubmitted.</hi> Suppoſing this Apothegm to be true, what relation
has this to the Caſe in hand? The Author muſt not think with
his Sophiſtry to impoſe upon our Reaſon ſo, that we may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between <hi>a Government,</hi> and a <hi>Governour.</hi> If the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
were not born under the <hi>Government of King</hi> William, yet they
were born under <hi>the Government of the King of</hi> England, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it. And by the Laws of that Land, whoſoever is <hi>de
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96491:6"/>
Facto</hi> poſſeſs'd of the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> and alſo
<hi>de Jure,</hi> King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And though <hi>it is not ſtrange, that ſome
differences and diſorders ſhould be upon a diſſolution of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
yet it is to be admir'd, and with everlaſting horror to be
remembred, that in full Peace, and the uninterrupted Exerciſe
of the Government, the <hi>greateſt differences and diſorders</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in <hi>Ireland</hi> that ever were known in any Chriſtian Kingdom.
Did not the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in the Reign of the late <hi>King James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> violate
the Laws of the Nation, and infringe the Act of Settlement? They
Arbitrarily diveſted the Officers of the Army, becauſe they were
Proteſtants, Caſhier'd the Soldiers, and with all the Circumſtances
of Scorn and Inhumanity, ſtript them to their Shirts, and expoſed
them to the neceſſity of Begging or Starving; they reform'd the
Privy-Council according to their own Cue; they turn'd the
Judges out of the Courts, and the Juſtices of Peace out of
the Commiſſion, and Proteſtants from acting in the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue;
they Conſtituted Popiſh Sheriffs through the Kingdom;
they applied the Revenue of vacant Biſhopricks to the ſupport of
the Popiſh Clergy; and took away ſome that were full; they
Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts in every Pariſh, Erected Fryeries and
Nunneries; and publickly celebrated Maſs in every Town; they
iſſued <hi>Quo Warranto's</hi> againſt all Corporations, and fill'd them
with Magiſtrates and Members utterly uncapable by the
Law; they Diſarm'd all Proteſtants through the Kingdom, and
ſeiz'd upon their Horſes, and by pretended Plots brought them in
queſtion for their Lives: And all this under the <hi>Government they
were born under, and to which they had ſubmitted,</hi> and in manifeſt
contempt, and rebellious infraction of the known Laws of the
Land; which enormous proceedings admit of no extenuation,
by what <hi>the Perſon of Quality</hi> alledgeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>theſe things were done
by, or under their Natural King of their own Religion, and their
conſtant Friend and Patron:</hi> So that if there was <hi>a diſſolution of
the Government,</hi> it was brought to paſs by their <hi>Natural Prince,</hi>
to whom they adhered and not by him whom they reſiſted From
all which it appears, how little Mercy is due to them on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
for though we ſhould grant it to be no Crime in them, not
to ſubmit to <hi>a new eſtabliſhed Government;</hi> yet doubtleſs it is a
Crime of the deepeſt dye, to ſubvert an <hi>old eſtabliſhed Government.</hi>
Suppoſe (as he ſuppoſeth) <hi>that a part of</hi> England, <hi>in a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
ſhould not readily conform with the reſt;</hi> why, it is very
probable, that brotherly Compaſſion and Charity would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96491:7"/>
in their excuſe: But ſuppoſe that a part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
as a part of England,</hi> ſhould overturn the Laws; ſet up
Popery, Diſarm their fellow Subjects, Plunder and Murther
their Neighbours, and call in the <hi>French</hi> to their aſſiſtance;
Would <hi>England</hi> be accounted <hi>ſevere,</hi> if they ſhould <hi>deſtroy and
extirpate</hi> ſuch Miſcreants, or <hi>make their Eſtates a Prey?</hi> No,
God and Nature require it; Law and Juſtice do enjoyn it; <hi>And
in ſuch a caſe</hi> (I do agree with him) <hi>there is as much Mercy due to</hi>
Iriſh<hi>-men, as there is to us</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Conſideration is no way cogent or perſuaſive. They
who have deſpiſed ſuch Gracious Offers of Favour from a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Prince, eluded his Protections, and reſiſted him ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
in the concluſion of his Conqueſt; will never make his
Clemency beneficial to us, though it may be of advantage to
them, in putting a ſudden end to the War, that ſo there may be
a ſufficient Stock leſt to propagate another Rebellion in the next
Generation. And it is worth the noting, what a conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation (who upon the Settlement after the laſt
Rebellion, was General Agent for the <hi>Iriſh</hi>) ſaid to a Friend, who
ask'd him not long ſince, Why he would ingage in ſo deſperate
a Cauſe, when he could not in reaſon but think, that <hi>England</hi>
would in time ſubdue them? <hi>Tuſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>We depend upon our
Allies; but if they ſhould fail, we know that at laſt we ſhall have
Terms given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not paſs by his bold reflection on the King, <hi>That ſince
the Victory at the</hi> Boyn, <hi>we have been fighting for</hi> Iriſh <hi>Lands.</hi> Not
ſo, <hi>Sir,</hi> we have been Fighting for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lands, for the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, from which by force they have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed,
and ſubjected to a Forfeiture by a formal Attainder in a
<hi>Mock-Parliament;</hi> and to which we cannot expect to be reſtored,
without the <hi>Effuſion of more Blood and Treaſure:</hi> And it is to be
hoped, that in time the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lands ſhall contribute to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſement.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Conſideration is a <hi>vae vobis,</hi> a perfect denunciation
of Ruin and Deſtruction; <hi>leſt we be deſtroyed our ſelves by the</hi>
French <hi>King, by being too obſtinately bent to deſtroy the</hi> Iriſh: But
I am neither convinc'd by his Reaſons, nor diſmay'd by his
Threats. Tho we are to encounter <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> tho the
<hi>French Turk</hi> be united to the <hi>Ottoman Turk,</hi> yet, by the Mercy
of God, the Confederate Chriſtians ſhall not fail of ſucceſs, but
triumph in time over the Aſſociation of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96491:7"/>
tho this <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> takes upon him to cenſure the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
for <hi>not making Peace with the</hi> Turk <hi>laſt Winter,</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
our King to <hi>a Voyage Royal into</hi> France; yet ſince he raiſeth
an Inference from that Error, and ſupports that advice, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the continuance of the <hi>War in Ireland;</hi> I am mightily
deceived, if he be not a ſecret Advocate for the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt;
for if the proſecution of the War in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
a haſty Peace hudled up, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentlemen <hi>reſtored to
their Eſtates,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army withdrawn; the Proteſtants
there can be in no poſſible capacity to maintain their Ground
againſt their inſolent Enemies, having no Rents to maintain
them, nor Stocks to feed them, nor Houſes to ſhelter them; but
muſt inevitably be expoſed to the Cruelty of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if their
dear Allies in <hi>France</hi> ſhould proſper in their attempts againſt the
Confederates.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Conſideration, This <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> pretends to
a great intimacy and knowledg in the preſent Councils and
Policy of <hi>Europe: That it is the paſſionate deſire of our Friends
and Confederates, that we would make up with the</hi> Iriſh <hi>upon any
reaſonable Terms.</hi> And this he enforceth with a Suppoſition,
That we might <hi>aſſail the</hi> French <hi>with all the Force we can make;</hi>
at the ſame time inculcating an implicit Danger, <hi>leſt himſelf in
the mean time may beat us out of the Sea, overbear our Confederates
at Land, and even invade</hi> England <hi>it ſelf.</hi> This is a tacit Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montade,
and is doubly fallacious; and looks more like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
than a Fear, that things ſhould ſo come to paſs. As we do not
apprehend an unavoidable Deſtruction impending over us from
the Invaſion of the <hi>French;</hi> ſo we do not underſtand any indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
neceſſity for <hi>making Terms with the</hi> Iriſh: For tho the
laſt year the <hi>great Leviathan took his paſtime in the Waters,</hi> and
inſulted on our Coaſts, (with <hi>fome ſhame</hi> to us, and <hi>no advantage</hi>
to himſelf) yet we doubt not but in a ſhort time an inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Hock will be put into his Noſe:</hi> And as for the ſhatter'd Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (whoſe late Valour did ariſe from Deſpair,
who have made ſome reſiſtance, when driven to the Wall; and
who never would ſtand a Fight, but when there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to eſcape by running away) they are not worthy of ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
a conſultation, Why ſhould the King be interrupted in the
carier of his ſucceſs? and the Victor adviſed to ſo tame a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention
to the vanquiſh'd party, when the ſurviving Body of
them are crowded into a corner of the Land, of whom the major
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96491:8"/>
Part are a Rabble of Rapperees and Tories, ill Arm'd poorly Clad,
and miſerably Fed; who in all probability cannot ſubſiſt till the
next Campagn, or upon the advance of it, muſt fall, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſubdued? Add, that this will be but a skinning of the Sore,
which after may Feſter and deſtroy the Body. For by a <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will be enabled to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> upon the firſt
fit occaſion; whereas by a <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> they will be render'd unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to abet ſuch an Attempt. I grant, that the Reduction of
<hi>Ireland</hi> is of unexpreſſible importance to <hi>England,</hi> and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of the Confederates: But let no Man think, that to effect
that, there needs ſo mighty application; I dare confidently ſay,
the King might at his pleaſure remand the greateſt part of his
Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the purſuit of his foreign Wars, and ſecurely
expect a ſpeedy and plenary Conqueſt of that perfidious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
People, by the Induſtry and Courage of the remainder,
being well ſeconded by the Proteſtants of that Kingdom well
Arm'd, which in all likelihood would not at this time be ſubject to
a diſpute, had not the Violent Rains, and approaching Winter,
intercepted the current of his Victory at <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now own the <hi>Objections,</hi> which the Author hath rais'd,
and in the maintenance of them, endeavour to enervate the force
of his reſpective <hi>Anſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>is a ſubordinate Kingdom to</hi> England; <hi>and
muſt therefore comply with whatever we do.</hi> The Reſpondent ſeems
only to Nibble at this, and granting (or not denying) Ireland <hi>to
be ſubordinate to</hi> England, he only ſnarls at the Conſequence, <hi>to
comply with whatever we do:</hi> But this Argumentation ſoon comes
to nothing, if we conſider <hi>Ireland</hi> as a Member, or Province of
<hi>England.</hi> It is granted by him, That <hi>Ireland is ſubordinate to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
(tho what this has to do with the buſineſs of Mercy, I do
not apprehend) but the Author denies the Inference, that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Ireland <hi>muſt comply with</hi> England, which, he ſays, <hi>is not true in
all Caſes</hi> (and I ſay ſo too) of which he gives an Inſtance; for, ſays
he, <hi>If</hi> England <hi>rebel, muſt</hi> Ireland <hi>rebel too?</hi> No ſurely: But tho
Ireland <hi>is not obliged to comply with</hi> England <hi>in all Caſes,</hi> yet that
Kingdom ſtands obliged to comply in ſome. The Author grants,
That <hi>what</hi> England <hi>did in theſe late Revolutions, was upon grounds ſo
righteous, as were juſtifiable to all the World:</hi> And it is in this Caſe, tho
not in every Caſe, that <hi>Ireland</hi> ought to comply with <hi>England.</hi>
And it is ſtrange, that <hi>Ireland,</hi> being <hi>a ſubordinate</hi> Conquer'd <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
ſhould not be obliged to comply with the Conquering Nation,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96491:8"/>
in all ſuch Matters, as the Author acknowledgeth to be <hi>juſt and
righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The</hi> Iriſh <hi>will never be quiet.</hi> The Author in his whole Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
has not ſo ſtumbl'd upon Ingenuity, as in his Anſwer to this
Objection. <hi>They muſt be quiet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſince they will not be in a condition
to be otherwiſe:</hi> which is as much as to ſay, it is not any Principle of
Loyalty, Juſtice, or Honeſty, that diſpoſeth them to be quiet; but
plain Neceſſity, ſince they have no ſtrength, or opportunity to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe;
and if they could be otherwiſe, <hi>they would not be quiet.</hi>
He that conſults Hiſtory, and turns over the Chronicles of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> will fully agree with the Reſpondent, and be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
That ſince the firſt Conqueſt of that Land, the Natives have
been retain'd in obedience and quiet, no longer than while they
remain'd under an incapacity to be otherwiſe. Witneſs more than
a hundred Provincial Inſurrections, or Univerſal Rebellions in the
ſpace of 500 years, ſince they firſt ſwore Fealty to the Crown of
<hi>England.</hi> Witneſs the cauſeleſs and unprovok'd Rebellion in 1641.
when by a Barbarity tranſcending the moſt exquiſite Villany of any
Age, or Countrey, they moſt inhumanly murther'd their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
Goſſips, and Fellow-ſubjects, with whom they participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
equally in the benefits of Peace, the Protection of the Laws,
and a favourable Connivence to their Religion. Witneſs their
unparallell'd Inſolence in the Reign of the Late King, when it was
not enough for them to diſplace the Magiſtrates, to change the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Liſt, to turn out the Officers, and disband the Soldiers, only
becauſe they were Proteſtants, and to fill many places with the
very Perſons attainted for their horrid Rebellion and Murthers in
1641. or their black Iſſue: when it did not ſuffice to erect Popiſh
Convents, and publickly to celebrate Maſs, contrary to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Laws of the Land; but having all in their hands, they
began to plunder, and ſeize the Goods of the Proteſtants, the
meaner ſort declaring, that, <hi>As the Lord</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>and other
Great Men, were poſſeſs'd of all Civil and Military Employments, ſo it
belonged to them to become Maſters of the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and to poſſeſs their
Eſtates and Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We cannot live with comfort, intermixt with the</hi> Iriſh. Tho
by two diſmal Experiments in 1641. and 1688. there is too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Reaſon to ſtart that Objection, yet the moſt impudent of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> cannot ſay, that the behaviour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> towards them
has ever adminiſtred the leaſt umbrage for ſuch a Suppoſition.
The Objection is coyn'd by the Author, but was never thought of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96491:9"/>
by us: <hi>We have liv'd with comfort among them, and may do ſo again,</hi>
ſo they be not Maſters, or be too powerful for us. But ſuch an
Inference as the Objector has rais'd, could never proceed from
the mouth of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> or Proteſtant. What could a <hi>French</hi>
Jeſuit ſay more, than, <hi>Truly we muſt then come away from them, and
leave them their Countrey by themſelves.</hi> That is in plain terms, we
muſt come away, and not only leave them their own, but our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
alſo. The Viſor is now taken off, and the <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi>
hath palpably diſplay'd himſelf. What! muſt we <hi>come away from
them</hi> out of wearineſs, or fear, becauſe <hi>we cannot live in comfort with
them?</hi> muſt we by a ſhameful, and unconſtrain'd Retreat own
their Title to that Countrey, and proclaim <hi>our ſelves Intruders?</hi>
for ſo he intends by that Malicious Inſinuation, <hi>That we have thruſt
our ſelves in among them:</hi> We are not <hi>Intruders,</hi> we did not <hi>thruſt
our ſelves among them;</hi> the firſt Entrance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>
was upon a fair Invitation. I have hardly patience to reflect on
this moſt injurious Expreſſion, ſo contradictory to Truth, and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.
It is now above 500 years, ſince <hi>England</hi> hath made <hi>Ireland</hi>
their Countrey, by the deareſt Acquiſition in the World, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
Treaſure, and vaſt effuſion of blood, repeated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purchaſed
in every Age and Generation. The Parliaments there
have from time to time recognized their Submiſſion, and proteſted
their Homage and Fealty to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> There is not
a man in <hi>Ireland</hi> that has a Freehold in an Acre of Land, but what
he holds mediately, or immediatly from the Crown. There are
very few of the Natural and Original <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who have a Propriety
in any Eſtate, their Anceſtors having in every Reign ſucceſſively
forfeited them by Treaſon and Rebellion. The Owners of all,
or moſt of the Eſtates there, are either the Ancient, or Modern
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> of the firſt ſort whereof, tho many have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into <hi>Iriſh</hi> manners, and apoſtatized from the Religion;
yet they cannot extinguiſh their Names, or alienate their deſcent,
or deny the honour of their Conſanguinity with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.
And now after all this, after a plenary Conqueſt by the Sword,
and an Eſtabliſhment by Law, after a long Preſcription, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed
Poſſeſſion for 500 years; Shall that be call'd <hi>their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey?</hi>
Shall the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be affronted with the opprobrious Name of
<hi>Intruders,</hi> who <hi>thruſt our ſelves in among them?</hi> This indeed is <hi>too
inſolent, and void not only of all Humanity</hi> (as he is pleaſed to ſay on
the other ſide) but repugnant to Truth, Honeſty and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96491:9"/>
Fourthly, <hi>Our Army muſt be rewarded out of their Lands.</hi> If this
had been Prophetically ſpoken, as it is invidiouſly mentioned, I
ſhould not have oppoſed my Prayers to the accompliſhment. If
it pleaſes the King and Parliament ſo to diſpoſe of the forfeited
Eſtates, I ſhall not grudge at the Exchange of the Proprietors.
But when I firſt caſt my Eye on this Cavil, I expected another ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to be made by this <hi>Perſon of Quality,</hi> ſo compaſſionate to
the <hi>poor Iriſh;</hi> and that is, not that the Army ſhould be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of their Lands, but that they ſhould be diſtributed among
the poor Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Loſs and Damage by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
plundering, and univerſal devaſtation, is almoſt irreparable.
But the Author evidently appears partial, and prejudicated in his
tenderneſs to the <hi>poor Iriſh,</hi> without any regard or ſenſe of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine of the Proteſtants. But why doth he make it ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that <hi>our Army ſhould be thus rewarded?</hi> were not the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Armies thus rewarded in the laſt Settlement? in the days of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth?</hi> and of all the preceding Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince the
Conqueſt?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>They called in the</hi> French, <hi>which is never to be forgiven.</hi>
In the Anſwer to this Objection he becomes a perfect Advocate for
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation: he ſuppoſeth that they did not <hi>call in the</hi> French;
or if they did, that it was <hi>no Capital Crime to make uſe of Foreign Ayd
for their own preſervation.</hi> To the declarative part I ſay, they did
<hi>call in the</hi> French, for by their Ambaſſadors, diſpatch'd by <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
in <hi>January</hi> 1688. they ſolemnly apply'd themſelves to the
<hi>French</hi> King <hi>for Ayd and Succor</hi> (as they formerly did to the <hi>King
of</hi> Spain, and to the <hi>Duke of</hi> Lorain) and importunately ſolicited
King <hi>James</hi> to come among them, who could no way deſcend to
their protection, but being accompanied by the <hi>French.</hi> Nay, the
King in his Proclamation declares the ſame, and the Author
knows it, as appears by his Quotation. To the Argumentative
part, I ſhall only anſwer, That if that Suggeſtion be allow'd, there
needs no Apology to be made for any inteſtine Rebellion: and I
have juſt reaſon to think, that this Perſon of Quality held ſome
Intelligence with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet laſt Summer, and would not have
oppoſed that Invaſion, but kindly <hi>made uſe of Foreign Aid.</hi> In a
word; If the <hi>Iriſh</hi> liv'd in peace, enjoy'd an equal benefit of the
Laws, and an undiſturb'd poſſeſſion of their Eſtates and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
(as is undeniable) where then was <hi>their Hazard?</hi> what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing to be done for their <hi>Preſervation?</hi> what occaſion was
there for them <hi>to make uſe of Foreign Aid?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96491:10"/>
Sixthly, <hi>There was a full pardon once granted to the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>which they
did not accept, nor come in upon it.</hi> I ſay ſo too; and with the favour
of the Reſpondent I do aver (in contradiction to what he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
that it was before <hi>King</hi> James <hi>was in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and among them,
and in Power.</hi> For the King's Proclamation bore date in <hi>February</hi>
1688. and the Indulgence of it expired about the 10th of <hi>April</hi>
following; but King <hi>James</hi> did not land in <hi>Ireland</hi> before the 11th
of <hi>March.</hi> This Perſon makes bold to reflect upon the Conduct
of the King, in that <hi>after the Victory at the</hi> Boyn, <hi>a full pardon was
not granted, or tollerable Conditions offer'd.</hi> But (if I be not as ſaucy
in giving my ſenſe of it) I would ſay, That though ſuch an Act
might have appear'd <hi>generous,</hi> it would hardly have been interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
prudent, or ſeaſonable. And tho indeed it might have been
<hi>a high Complement to our Roman-Catholick Allies,</hi> if the King (after ſo
unexampled hazard of his perſon, and the effuſion of his Royal
Blood) had embraced his Enemies, and careſſed them for their
oppoſition to his Government, it had carry'd little kindneſs to his
Friends, and Proteſtant Confederates, to <hi>receive his Enemies into
mercy,</hi> reaking with the blood, and inrich'd with the Spoil of his
martyr'd Subjects, leaving them in a condition a hundred times
worſe, than when he firſt appear'd for their Deliverance. But if
<hi>King</hi> James <hi>gave them leave to ſubmit, when he fled from them,</hi> and
they have ſince not ſubmitted, it only ſhews, that they are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
Generation, and that Rebellion is ſo rooted in them,
that they are utterly incurable. And if they be <hi>grown deſperate, as
well as obſtinate,</hi> let them take their Chance <hi>in the Event of War;</hi>
they firſt deſpoil'd the Proteſtants, drove ſome into Exile, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
over ſuch as continu'd in ſubjection to them; and if their
nefarious Crimes be recompenced by <hi>ſtripping them of their Eſtates,
and throwing them into miſery and beggery,</hi> let them thank themſelves;
they are the Authors of their own perdition. And common Equity,
as well as the Common Law of the Land, provides, that every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Aggreſſor, or Treſpaſſer, ſhall make amends, and ſatisfy the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of the Party on whom he committed the Treſpaſs. But
though he maliciouſly and mutinouſly inſinuates, that <hi>we fight to
get their Eſtates: that our Allies are run down by the</hi> French:
<hi>that we in</hi> England <hi>lye under ſuch Taxes as never were known; that
our ſevere Reſolutions were againſt His Majeſties merciful inclinations;</hi>
yet all ſerious and unprejudiced Men will underſtand, that we
fight to recover the Eſtates of the Proteſtants, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in
their late Parliament, with ſo much precipitancy and injuſtice Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96491:10"/>
Attainting all perſons of all Ages, Degrees and Sexes,
preſent or abſent, dead or alive, without Reaſon or Diſtinction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and obliging Men to impoſſibilities, to preſerve their Lives and
Fortunes: All that Love, and Favour the preſent Government,
will believe, that <hi>our Allies are not run down by the</hi> French, and will
hope there is no danger of it. Modeſt and well-principled Men
will not Grumble, or ſay, <hi>We lye under ſuch Taxes as never were
known;</hi> when the revolving of the Modern Hiſtories of <hi>England,</hi>
and appealing to the Teſtimony of many living Men, will plainly
confute the Aſſertion; by freſh Inſtances in the time of the late
Uſurpation, and the late Reign of <hi>Charles the ſecond:</hi> And tho
I will neither preſume to be privy to the King's Inclinations, or
tax the ſeverity of ſuch Reſolutions, I may modeſtly and juſtly
ſay, That as no other Methods have hitherto been proſperous in
<hi>Ireland;</hi> ſo there does not appear any way more certainly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to the everlaſting ſettlement of that Kingdom, than to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate
the Eſtates</hi> of all who have wilfully appear'd in Arms
againſt the Government of <hi>England;</hi> and to transfer them into
the hands of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>They have a perfect averſion and hatred to the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Government, and will never ſubmit.</hi> In his Objection he would fain
be taken for an <hi>Iriſh-man;</hi> in his Anſwer to it, he talks like an
<hi>Engliſh-Papiſt.</hi> For howſoever they may have accidentally <hi>an
Averſion to the Engliſh Government,</hi> becauſe it comprehends a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to their Religion (in which they are above all Nations moſt
ſuperſtitious) yet they have ever own'd a ſatisfaction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in their ſubjection to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> In the demonſtration
of which, I do not ſo much rely on Publick Declarations and
Acts of Parliament, as on the ſuffrage of that People, in their
Contentment and Joy to live under <hi>Engliſh</hi> Landlords, rather than
to be enſlav'd under their own Lords, and Heads of <hi>Clans.</hi> And
ſuppoſe the Natural <hi>Iriſh</hi> (who in Quality or Eſtate are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable)
do retain <hi>a perfect Averſion and Hatred to the Engliſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>
it does not follow, that thoſe who are of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood,
and deſcended from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (tho differing in Religion) ſhould
retain the ſame ſentiments. But what a ſnarling reflection is this,
That <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Croud into their Country, and Grow upon them, and
Cut them out?</hi> If that be ſtill their Countrey, becauſe the Mercy
of the Conquerors hath permitted ſome of the Natives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there; <hi>England</hi> muſt renounce all Title and Propriety to
<hi>Virginia, New-England,</hi> and to the Continent and Iſlands in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96491:11"/>
And tho the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not <hi>Authority and Preferments,</hi> it was
not denied them, <hi>quatenus Iriſh;</hi> when any of them were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by embracing the Proteſtant Religion, they were advanced
and intruſted without diſtinction; which being agreeable to the
Laws and Uſage of <hi>England,</hi> it is eaſie to conjecture from what
Quiver this Arrow came, and that this <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> projects
an Indulgence to Popiſh Recuſants in both Kingdoms; at leaſt it
is a provocative to the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to Rebel, ſince by the Laws of the Land they are render'd
uncapable of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Preferments.</hi> The reſt of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
is a nauſeous Repetition of what he has before urged
more than once, by an ungrateful Impeachment of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if their Proceedings were founded on <hi>Greedineſs and
Avarice,</hi> managed by <hi>Severity and Cruelty;</hi> and repreſenting them
to diſadvantage, by an impertinent and odious Compariſon with
the <hi>Dealings of the</hi> French (where by the way, if <hi>the</hi> French <hi>King
hath ſuffered the Eſtates of Proteſtants to go to the next of kin, that are,
or will turn Papiſts;</hi> May not the King of <hi>England,</hi> by the ſame
equity, give the Eſtates of <hi>Papiſts</hi> to the next of kin, that are,
or will turn <hi>Proteſtants?</hi>) But this being a Language fitter for the
Cognizance of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and the Inquiſition of a <hi>Jury,</hi>
I ſhall remit the Author to his deſerved Fate, hoping that in
due time he may be diſcover'd.</p>
