            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE enſuing Treatiſe, ſince it has lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeak Engliſh, ſeems, by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of Title, to lay a more eſpecial Claim to your Patronage, than to any others. For though the Tranſlator be a perfect Stranger to you, yet the Author, which he has ventur'd to tranſlate, is well known by all to be one you are intimately acquainted with: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs your excellent <hi>Prince Arthur,</hi> wherein you have in a great meaſure confin'd your ſelf to the Rules and Precepts which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and even our <hi>Boſſu,</hi> have preſcrib'd to the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis upon this Account, <hi>Sir,</hi> that I preſume to caſt this Tranſlation under your Protection; not queſtioning but, as the good-natur'd Critick is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Poet's Friend; ſo now, <hi>vice versâ,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Poet will ſtand the Criticks Friend, and
<pb facs="tcp:53904:3"/>
ſuffer his impartial Reflexions to appear in the Engliſh World under the Patronage of ſo great a Name.</p>
            <p>I might here run out into high and just Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums upon your late extraordinary Performance; but there is no need for it, ſince the Work loudly ſpeaks forth its own Praiſes: and I ſhould rather ſeem unjust in ſaying too little, than be thought guilty of Flattery for ſaying too much in its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>I have, <hi>Sir,</hi> in the <hi>Preface,</hi> ventur'd to make ſome few Reflexions on your <hi>Poem,</hi> and hope you have Candour enough to excuſe the Freedom I have taken therein. If I have offended, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Miſtake, I here declare my ſelf willing and ready to retract upon due Conviction; and ſhall be always forward to ſubmit my ſelf to the Sentence of better Judgments.</p>
            <p>All I have more to ſay, is, to beg Pardon for my Preſumption, in deſiring to prefix your Name before my weak Performance; which Favour I hope you will grant to,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <p>'TIS Sir <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi>'s jocular Remark in his Preface before his Engliſh <hi>Tully</hi>'s Offices, <hi>That a Man had as good go to Court without a Cravat, as appear in Print without a Preface:</hi> And therefore, becauſe my Author has none, it may be expected I ſhould Preface it for him. But ſince I undertake to perſonate ſo great a <hi>Critick</hi> as the Learned <hi>Boſſu;</hi> it may to ſome ſeem requiſite (let me be never ſo meanly qualified for ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) that I ſhould give the World ſome Account of <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> and eſpecially of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> in <hi>Particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> I ſhall not trouble my head much about it at preſent; the World has had enough on that Subject already, and by much abler Pens. <q>That its Nature is Divine, that it owes its Original to Heaven; how from ſmall Beginnings it roſe at laſt to that Luſtre we find it in, in
<pb facs="tcp:53904:4"/>
                  <hi>Homer</hi>'s and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s days; and withal what ſtrange Effects it always had upon the Minds of Men:</q> Theſe things, and much to the ſame purpoſe have been told over and over, and need not be repeated here. Not only <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> but their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators</hi> and the <hi>Criticks,</hi> not only of our own but other Nations, have made it their Buſineſs to ſet forth its Excellence, and to recommend it to Mankind as the nobleſt <hi>Humane</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Divine) Art</hi> that is. Beſides, that its true Uſe and End is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and profit the World more than to delight and pleaſe it, has been ſo fully and clearly made out, by <hi>D'acier</hi> in his Preface before his Reflections on <hi>Ariſtotle's Poeſie,</hi> and lately by our own Country-man the Learned Dr. <hi>Blackmore</hi> in his Preface before his <hi>Prince Arthur,</hi> that I think my ſelf exempted in a great meaſure from that task likewiſe.</p>
            <p>But however, it cannot but with a Bluſh be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that moſt of our <hi>Modern</hi> Poets ſeem to have diverted the true Deſign of <hi>Poetry</hi> to one of a quite contrary Nature, whilſt they ſtudy rather to pleaſe the debauch'd World in their own way, than to give them any wholeſome inſtruction to become Wiſer and Better. To ſuch as theſe therefore it would be adviſeable to conſult Dr. <hi>Blackmore</hi>'s Preface, and the third Chapter of the fourth Book in the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: And they will there find how much the being a Man of Probity and Vertue is to be preferr'd, to the being a debauch'd, complaiſant and temporizing Poet. They would do well to conſider, that all the Reproach and Scandal which is caſt upon <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Themſelves,</hi> is in a great meaſure owing to their own ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. For when the unthoughtful Many ſee Men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Principles Uſurp to themſelves the ſacred Name of Poet; when they ſee baſe, ſervile, merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Souls proſtitute their Pens to mean, ſordid, and unbecoming Subjects, ſuch as lewd and profane <hi>Plays,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abuſive and ſcurillous <hi>Farces,</hi> Laſcivious <hi>Odes;</hi> and wanton <hi>Sonnets;</hi> they think they have reaſon to look upon Poets with contempt, and to ſtile them <hi>the ſcum of mankind.</hi> And it were well if their Cenſures went no farther, and only touch'd thoſe that deſerv'd them; but they go on, and conclude that Poetry it ſelf is in all the fault, and that 'tis <hi>This</hi> that is the cauſe of ſo much extravagancy and debauchery in the World. But it does not follow, becauſe many, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Poetry, do by their infamous practices bring a ſcandal upon it; and becauſe an ill natured multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that has little or no reliſh for ſuch ſort of things, caſts dirt upon it; I ſay it does not follow from thence, that <hi>Poetry</hi> is ever the worſe. For at this rate <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, though the beſt thing in the World, yet is vilified and ſcandaliz'd by too many, and would fall under the ſame uncharitable Cenſure. In ſpite therefore of Malice, Envy, and Detraction of its Enemies, and notwithſtanding all the Contempt and Scandal caſt upon it, by its pretended Friends and Votaries, it has been, and will ſtill be accounted a Noble thing by the Wiſer and the better part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>Now whatever is ſaid in favour of <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> may in a great meaſure be applied to the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> in <hi>Particular;</hi> That being the Principal and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime part of all Poeſle, and what <hi>Rapin</hi> with a great deal of Reaſon affirms to be <hi>the greateſt Work Humane Wit is capable of.</hi> I might here ſhew at large how far it does excel the other two parts of <hi>Great Poetry, Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy:</hi> But this every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, even thoſe who are the greateſt Admirers of, and pretenders to the <hi>Drama;</hi> and 'tis this that my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſufficiently makes out in ſeveral Paſſages of his Treatiſe; ſo that I think my ſelf excus'd from that invidious task. My preſent buſineſs ſhall be only to conſider, how excellent it is in its own Nature;
<pb facs="tcp:53904:5"/>
what a vaſt, Univerſal, and Judicious <hi>Genius</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; what ſurprizing effects it has had in the World when duly perform'd; what encouragement it met with among the <hi>Ancients;</hi> and the Reaſons of its declining ſtate among the <hi>Moderns.</hi> Nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, even in this, to dictate any thing, but with all ſubmiſſion refer what I ſay to the Verdict of better Judgments.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> appears, in that, as we hinted before, 'tis the Principal, and moſt ſublime part of all <hi>Poeſie.</hi> 'Tis that on which the moſt Commendations, the higheſt Praiſes, and the largeſt, freſheſt Garlands are, and have been beſtow'd. But this only gives us a general notion of its <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> we may ſee it in its cleareſt Luſtre, if we would but take a particular view of its Nature and Deſign. And becauſe I cannot expreſs it better and more conciſely in my own, I ſhall make bold to uſe my Author's Words. <q>The <hi>Epopéa,</hi> or <hi>Epick Poem</hi> (ſays he) is a Diſcourſe or Story invented by Art to form Mens Manners by ſuch Inſtructions as are diſguis'd under the Allegory of ſome one Important Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is related in Verſe after a Probable, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, and ſurpriſing manner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you have a ſhort, but full and clear Idea of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> I ſhall not here ſpend time to explain the parts of this Definition; 'tis ſo fully and clearly done in the enſuing Treatiſe, that it needs no farther Illuſtration. Now what, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this account, can be more Great and Noble? To regulate Mens manners; to purge and refine them from the Dregs, and Corruptions of Vice; to keep their Paſſions within due bounds, and to make them the Servants, not the Maſters of right Reaſon, has in all Ages been eſteemed a piece of the higheſt Prudence, and a great perfection of Humane Nature. Hence the <hi>Moraliſt</hi> himſelf deſervedly derives all his Glory. But
<pb facs="tcp:53904:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he merits much, the <hi>Epick</hi> Poet merits much more. The one indeed by his plain, convincing Inſtructions can prevail upon thoſe, whoſe minds are unprejudic'd, and whoſe Reaſon is rightly inform'd: But the other by the Charms and allurements of his Precepts breaks through all Oppoſition, conquers all prejudice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates himſelf into the inmoſt receſſes of the Soul, and makes a thorough Convert of the moſt obſtinate Immoraliſt. The <hi>Epick</hi> Poet, to back all, makes uſe of frequent Examples, the ſtrongeſt Arguments to perſwade Men to be Vertuous; and his whole piece is an Imitation of ſuch things as may probably happen. To conclude, he like a skillful Phyſician mixes Sweet with Bitter, that which is Pleaſant with the Profitable, and gilds o'er the unſightly Pill, that ſo even the Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but wholeſome Phyſick might ſteal down the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I know there may be ſome, who utterly diſlike this way, and cry 'tis too Trickiſh, fit only to cajole Women and delude Children. But may I crave leave to tell ſuch, that they ſeem not to have ſtudied Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſufficiently, elſe they would have diſcern'd in the moſt ſage Tempers, ſome thing of the Child, that loves to be tempted and allur'd even to that which is his own Good and Happineſs. This is Conſpicuous to all, who are acquainted with the World a little, and have Read Men as well as Books: So that I need not ſtand upon proving what is ſo notoriouſly apparent. I am ſenſible much more might be ſaid to ſhew the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem;</hi> but that little which has been already alledg'd in its favour, may, I preſume, be enough to keep up its eſteem among the more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of the World: And as for others, of a more perverſe principle, Though never ſo much were ſaid, it would never ſatisfie them.</p>
            <p>But to go on; ſit is no ſmall Commendation to the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> that its nature is ſuch as requires the largeſt, moſt Univerſal and Judicious <hi>Genius</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:53904:6"/>
it. None but Men of the moſt exalted Souls, warmeſt Thoughts, livelieſt Fancies, and deepeſt Judgments, are fit for ſuch a noble Enterprize. Every Man, we ſee, who has but an Ordinary Capacity, thinks himſelf Scholar enough to be a Phyſician, a Lawyer, or a Divine: But the poor Pretender is a little more modeſt in his pretences to <hi>Epick Poetry.</hi> Here he ſtands off, and keeps at as awful a diſtance from <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> as the trembling <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old did from the burning Mount. Nay the <hi>Poetaſters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have ventur'd at all the leſſer ſorts of <hi>Poems,</hi> yet knowing their own ſtrength, have with all reverence receeded from ſo high an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>So vaſt a <hi>Genius</hi> does this ſort of <hi>Poetry</hi> require, that if we will rely on the teſtimony of <hi>Rapin,</hi> one of the ableſt and moſt impartial Criticks this Age or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> has produced, we ſhall find that there have been but only two, <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> who have wrote in this way with any tolerable ſucceſs. This Judicious Critick mentions ſeveral of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, ſuch as <hi>Coluthus,</hi> who wrote of the Rape of <hi>Hellen; Tryphiodorus,</hi> who gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the taking of <hi>Troy; Muſaeus,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of <hi>Leander; Apollonius Rhodius,</hi> who relates the Expedition of the <hi>Argonauts; Quintus Calaber,</hi> who undertook to write the Supplement to the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſeis;</hi> and <hi>Nonnus,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of the Birth, Adventures, Victories, and Apotheoſis of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> He likewiſe mentions ſeveral of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, ſuch as <hi>Lucan, Statius, Silius Italicus, Valerius Faccus,</hi> and <hi>Claudian;</hi> but withall takes Notice how far ſhort all theſe fall of the Perfections of the other two. As for the <hi>Moderns,</hi> he takes notice of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral among the <hi>Italians,</hi> namely <hi>Dante, Petrarch, Boccace, Boyardo, Oliviero, Arioſto, Taſſo, Sannazarius</hi> and <hi>Vida;</hi> but he thinks the three firſt deſerve not the
<pb facs="tcp:53904:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very name of <hi>Heroick</hi> Poets; and as for the reſt, he has obſerv'd ſo many imperfections in them, that they can ſtand in no manner of Competition with <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> whom at leaſt they have pretended to Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> he only mentions <hi>Camoens</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and ſays, <q>He only regarded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the haughtineſs of his Nation in his Poem of the <hi>Conqueſt of the Indies:</hi> And that he is fierce and faſtuous in his Compoſition, but has <hi>little Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>little Conduct.</hi>
               </q> Nor does this Ingenuous Critick favour his own Countrymen, <hi>Dubartas</hi> and <hi>Ronſard;</hi> but taxes them with ſuch imperfections that one may reaſonably diſpute with them the name of <hi>Epick</hi> Poets. If you would be ſatisfied more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this Point, I muſt refer you to the <hi>Reflections,</hi> which <hi>Rapin</hi> has made upon the <hi>Epick</hi> Poets in all Ages: And there you will perceive what a vaſt difference he makes between <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and all the reſt that wrote after them. <hi>Homer</hi> (ſays he) <hi>animates me,</hi> Virgil <hi>heats me, and all the reſt freeze me, ſo cold and flat they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has not indeed made any Reflections on our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Poets, and this <hi>Rymer</hi> preſumes proceeded from his ignorance of our Language, which he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo well, as to paſs a Judgment on what was writ in it. Whereupon <hi>Rymer</hi> himſelf has undertook to Criticiſe upon them. <hi>Chaucer,</hi> he will not allow for an <hi>Epick</hi> Poet, the Age he lived in not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a great deſign; being an Age of Tales, Ballads and Roundelays. <hi>Spencer,</hi> whom he reckons the firſt of our <hi>Heroick</hi> Poets, yet falls under his Cenſure, and is tax'd for his want of a true Idea, for this rambling after marvellous adventures, for making no Conſcience of Probability, for making his Poem a perfect <hi>Fairy-Land,</hi> and for his unlucky Choice of the Stanza, which in no wiſe is proper for our language. Sir <hi>William D'venant</hi> is the next <hi>Heroick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:7"/>
Poet our <hi>Engliſh Critick</hi> takes notice of. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that his Wit was well known; that in his Preface to his <hi>Gondibert,</hi> appear ſome ſtrokes of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Judgment; that he is ſaid to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Talent for the <hi>Manners;</hi> that his Thoughts are great; and laſtly that there appears ſomething rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noble throughout this <hi>Fragment.</hi> Yet after all, he blames him, for the ill choice of his Subject; for his bad Conduct; for a Vicious Oeconomy; and for his unhappy choice of the <hi>Tetraſtick. Cowley</hi> is the third and laſt <hi>Heroick</hi> Poet, our Author mentions, and to him he gives particular Commendations. He ſays, <q>That a more happy <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Heroick Poeſie</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>Cowley;</hi> that he underſtood the Purity, the Perſpicuity, the Majeſty of the Stile and the Vertue of Numbers; that he could diſcern what was beautiful and pleaſant in Nature; and could expreſs his Thoughts without the leaſt difficulty or conſtraint; that he underſtood to diſpoſe of the Matters, and to manage his Digreſſions; and laſtly that he underſtood <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and as prudently made his advantage of them.</q> Yet after all theſe high Commendations, he laments his not carrying on the Work ſo far as he deſign'd, and his not living to reviſe what he did leave behind him: And blames him for his ill choice of the <hi>Subject</hi> of his Poem, in that like <hi>Lucan</hi> he made choice of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and a Hiſtory where he was ſo ſtrictly ty'd up to the Truth. He likewiſe blames him for inſerting the <hi>Lyrick</hi> meaſure in the very body of his Poem. Thus far the Judicious <hi>Rymer</hi> goes, and it were to be wiſh'd he had paſſed his judgment on the famous <hi>Milton</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets; but ſince he has wav'd ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing about him, till ſome other time, I ſhall crave leave to inſert the Opinion of <hi>Dryden,</hi> a profeſs'd Poet, and as a great Judge of Poetry. He tells us in his <hi>Dedication before the Tranſlation of Juvenal,</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:53904:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That <hi>Milton</hi> had a <hi>Genius</hi> equal to <hi>Spencer</hi>'s, and greater than that of <hi>Cowley;</hi> that his Thoughts are elevated, his Words ſounding, and that no Man has ſo happily copy'd the Manner of <hi>Homer;</hi> or ſo copiouſly tranſlated his <hi>Greciſms,</hi> and the <hi>Latin Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies</hi> of <hi>Virgil.</hi> But then he ſays likewiſe, That his Subject is not that of an <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem, properly ſo called; it being the loſing of our happineſs, where the Event is not proſperous like that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Epick</hi> Works: That his Heavenly <hi>Machines</hi> are too many in proportion to the Human Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, which are but two: That he runs into a Flat of Thought, ſometimes for a hundred Lines together: That he was tranſported too far in the uſe of Obſolete Words: And laſtly that he can, by no means approve of his Choice of <hi>Blank Verſe.</hi>
               </q> By this ſhort view of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets, which I have abſtracted from <hi>Rymer</hi> and <hi>Dryden,</hi> one may clearly perceive how far ſhort even they as well as their Neighbours have fell of the Excellencies and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt not leave Matters thus. For ſince my tranſlating <hi>Boſſu,</hi> and the thoughts I had of Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the World has been honour'd with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Heroick Poem</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> done by our own Country-man the Learned and Ingenious Dr. <hi>Blackmore:</hi> Which puts us <hi>Now</hi> upon thinking that the Poems of the two <hi>Ancients</hi> are not wholly unimitable. It may therefore be expected that in a Preface of this Nature, and in this part of it where we are treating of the vaſtneſs of the <hi>Genius</hi> that is requiſite for <hi>Epick Poeſie,</hi> ſomething ſhould be ſaid on the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>'Tis far from my deſign to ſet up for a Profeſt <hi>Critick,</hi> but that I may do ſome Juſtice to the Merits of that great Man, ſince no one elſe, as I hear of, has as yet Criticis'd publickly on the <hi>Poem,</hi> I ſhall venture to
<pb facs="tcp:53904:8"/>
give the World a Taſt of the thoughts I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of it in general. And a Taſt it muſt only be, ſince the Limits of a Preface, and the Senſe I have of my own inability in paſſing a Judgment upon ſo great an Author, do ſufficiently excuſe me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more minute and particular, leaving that Task wholly to abler Judges in <hi>Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore muſt be own'd by all, that he has made a happy Choice of his <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſignalizes his own Country; which is more than any of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets have done before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Romantick Spencer.</hi> He profeſſes in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to have imitated <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Deſign, and how well he has Copy'd that great Model let us now ſee. If we will examine things according to the Rules <hi>Boſſu</hi> has laid down, his <hi>Fable</hi> will appear to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame with that of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> His <hi>Action</hi> is like that of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, <hi>One, Entire, Noble, Great,</hi> and <hi>Important Action,</hi> viz. The Reſtoration of a decay'd Church and State to its ancient ſplendor and Glory. The <hi>Intrigues</hi> he makes uſe of to hinder his Hero from accompliſhing his great and good deſigns are of the very ſame make with thoſe of <hi>Virgil.</hi> For as in the One, <hi>Juno,</hi> who had equal power both by Sea and Land, raiſes all the Obſtacles, that lay in the way of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Hero: So in the other, <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Prince of the Air, equal in Power to <hi>Juno,</hi> raiſes all the Storms by Sea, and all the Diſturbances by Land, that hindred the ſettlement of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hero. And as the <hi>Intrigues,</hi> ſo the <hi>Solution</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of theſe <hi>Intrigues</hi> are as juſt, as regular, and as natural as thoſe in the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> In his <hi>Inſcription</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> he has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> who have both inſcrib'd their Poems with their <hi>Hero</hi>'s <hi>Name.</hi> His <hi>Propoſition</hi> is as full, but withal as modeſt both with reſpect to himſelf and his Hero, as <hi>Horace</hi> requires, and <hi>Virgil</hi> has practis'd. His <hi>Invocation</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:53904:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much the ſame with that of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and therein he has like <hi>Virgil</hi> Inſerted <note n="*" place="margin">The Generous Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> his Hero's Character. The <hi>Narration</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet (bating ſome few defects, which we ſhall mention by and by) is as exact as that of the <hi>Latin:</hi> And has in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all thoſe Qualifications which <hi>Boſſu</hi> ſays are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite thereto; for it is <hi>Pleaſant, Probable, Moving, Marvellous,</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> The <hi>Manners</hi> of his human Perſonages, their Intereſts, and Deſigns, are as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly order'd, as thoſe in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poem. All the <hi>Characters</hi> are nobly drawn, and look like the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Strokes of a great Maſter; for they all tend to, and Centure in the General Character of the Poem and Hero, namely in that noble Ornament of the Soul, <hi>GENEROSITY.</hi> His <hi>Machines</hi> are very Natural, and adapted to the <hi>Genius</hi> and Notions of our times, as <hi>Virgils</hi> were to thoſe of his Age. His <hi>Expreſſion</hi> is noble and Majeſtical; his <hi>Verſe</hi> Sonorous, Maſculine, and Strong; his <hi>Thoughts</hi> are Sublime; his <hi>Similes</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; his <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> proper; and his <hi>Sentences</hi> few and regular. In a word throughout the whole he ſeems in a great Meaſure to have confin'd himſelf to the <note n="*" place="margin">Which may be one great Argument to prove that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting according to the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> is no ſuch Clog to a Poet's Fancy as ſome pretend.</note> Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> to have copy'd the beſt of any Man the Perfections of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and to have ſhewn a ſtrength of <hi>Genius,</hi> an Heighth of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and a correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that comes but a little behind that of the two <hi>Ancient</hi> Poets.</p>
            <p>But after all it muſt be ſaid (though with ſome ſort of reluctancy) that there are ſome few things which need poliſhing, and which after ſecond and more deliberate thoughts, that great Maſter would no doubt have corrected. For one may queſtion whether his <hi>Digreſſions</hi> are not too tedious, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:53904:9"/>
foreign to the Subject: Eſpecially that of <hi>Prince Arthur</hi>'s Speech to King <hi>Hoel,</hi> which takes up two whole Books. For what relation has this Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Creation of the World; of the Fall of Man; of his Redemption; of the Reſurrection; of the laſt Judgment, and the like with the main Action of the Poem; which is the Reſtoring Religion and Liberty, to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and ſettling both Church and State on their Ancient Foundations of Truth and Peace? I know it may be ſaid in favour of it, that it was neceſſary for the Converſion of <hi>Hoel,</hi> that ſuch an account of things ſhould be given him. But would not a bare Recital of a few Lines, that ſuch a Relation was given him, have been ſufficient? And would not ſuch a Conduct have been more Conformable to the Nature of <hi>Epick Poeſie,</hi> which excludes every thing that is foreign to the main purpoſe?</p>
            <p>They who think to ſalve this by ſaying, that this Speech is in Imitation of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Speech to <hi>Dido,</hi> will be owned by all that have Read and compar'd both, to be egregiouſly miſtaken, and the Author himſelf has no reaſon to thank them for making ſuch a ridiculous Compariſon. There is no manner of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between theſe two Speeches. The one, namely that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> is a ſtory of whatever had happen'd to him for ſix Years together ſince the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> and 'tis from that time the <hi>Action</hi> of the Poem begins: But the <hi>Narration</hi> of Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> is a Relation of things, wherein he had no more Intereſt than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Man and Chriſtian; and were we to reckon the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> from the time whereby the Poet begins this Speech, as all <hi>Criticks</hi> have done that of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it would not be the <hi>Action</hi> of ſix or ſeven Years, but of ſix times as many Ages. There is no Compariſon then to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Speeches; but that of our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Poet is wholly a <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> and the other neceſſary and eſſential to the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> That which our Author deſign'd to anſwer the Speech of <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Dido,</hi> is doubtleſs the Speech of one of Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, <hi>Lucius,</hi> to King <hi>Hoel:</hi> As appears if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Beginning of this Speech to the beginning of that in the <hi>Aeneid. Lucius</hi> begins thus:
<q>
                  <l>How ſad a task do your Commands impoſe</l>
                  <l>That muſt renew unſufferable Woes?</l>
                  <l>That muſt our Grief with ſad Affliction feed,</l>
                  <l>And make your generous Heart with pity bleed.</l>
                  <l>Whilſt I the diſmal Scenes of ills diſcloſe,</l>
                  <l>And bleeding <hi>Albion</hi>'s ghaſtly wounds expoſe.</l>
                  <l>The Cruel Foes in telling would relent,</l>
                  <l>And with their Tears, the Spoils, they caus'd lament.</l>
                  <l>Pity would <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Breaſts invade,</l>
                  <l>And make them mourn, o'er the dire Wounds they made.</l>
                  <l>But ſince you're pleas'd to hear our Countries fate,</l>
                  <l>I'll pay Obedience, and our Woes relate.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this is an exact Copy of the Beginning of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Speech to <hi>Dido,</hi> which runs thus:
<q>
                  <l>Infandum, Regina, jubes renovare dolorem:</l>
                  <l>Trojanas ut opes &amp; lamentabite regnum</l>
                  <l>Eruerint Danai, quaeque ipſe miſerrima vidi,</l>
                  <l>Et quorum pars magna fui. Quis talla fando,</l>
                  <l>Myrmidonum, Dolopûmve, aut duri miles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſel,</l>
                  <l>Temperet à Lacrymis? Et jam nox humida coelo</l>
                  <l>Praecipitat, ſuadentque cadentia Sydera ſomnos.</l>
                  <l>Sed ſi tantus amor caſus cognoſcere noſtros,</l>
                  <l>Et breviter Trojae ſupremum audire laborem,</l>
                  <l>Quanquam animus meminiſſe horret, luctuque refugit: Incipiam.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:10"/>
In this Speech <hi>Blackmore,</hi> in my opinion, is more lucky in the Choice of his Speaker than <hi>Virgil</hi> was; For doubtleſs 'tis more for the Honour of the Hero, at leaſt more agreable to the Notions and Religion of our times, and greater advantages might be drawn from another perſon's telling his Adventures, than if he himſelf were the Relater of them. But even in this Speech our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet ſeems not to be ſo regular as is requiſite. <hi>Lucius</hi> begins too high in his Narration. <note n="*" place="margin">Fracti bello, ſatiſ<expan>

               <hi>Aeneas</hi> begins his recital at the building of the <hi>Wooden Horſe,</hi> and the taking of <hi>Troy;</hi> this is regular, and anſwers exactly to what <hi>Dido</hi> had deſir'd of him. But <hi>Lucius,</hi> though <hi>Hoel</hi> only deſir'd him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Prince Arthur's Story, and King <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter's Fate,</hi> tells him of the Decay of old <hi>Rome;</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke; how they were invaded by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> that at laſt they were forc'd to ſend to the <hi>Saxons</hi> for their Aſſiſtance, who inſtead of Friends became their Maſters; and then he comes to relate what was requir'd. Now all that is ſaid before the account of King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter</hi>'s fighting with the <hi>Saxons</hi> and his overthrow, is, preliminary and wholy fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the main Action. For if we will compute the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Action</hi> of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> according to the Rules by which we compute the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> we muſt reckon, that it laſted from the Death of King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter,</hi> and the overthrow of his Army, which put Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> upon travelling into <hi>Neuſtria;</hi> untill the Death of <hi>Tollo,</hi> which wholly made way for the reſettlement of Prince <hi>Arthur.</hi> Theſe are my thoughts, but perhaps the Author had other deſigns in his head, particularly that of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Morality and Religion to an Immoral and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious Age; which ſeems in a great meaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his long Digreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Again one may queſtion whether moſt of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> are not too long, and whether if our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet had beſtow'd as much pains, and ſpent as much time about his Poem, as <hi>Virgil</hi> did about his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> he would not have ſhortn'd his <hi>Deſcriptions,</hi> avoided. Repetitions of the ſame things, and been more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect throughout the whole.</p>
            <p>Laſtly it is urg'd by ſome, that he has but a few <hi>Epiſodes</hi> in Compariſon to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me, that this Thinneſs of <hi>Epiſodes</hi> has oblig'd him to be ſo long and tedious in his <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> and <hi>Digreſſions;</hi> elſe his Poem would have taken up but a little Compaſs. Theſe are all the faults that I think are worth taking notice of; there are indeed other little ſlips, which touch not the Eſſence and Bottom of the <hi>Fable</hi> and <hi>Poem,</hi> therefore I ſhall not mention them. Nor are thoſe I have mention'd ſuch as caſt any great diſcredit upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that has been ſaid, ſpight of Ill-nature, Envy, and Detraction, he may juſtly be reckon'd the <hi>Next</hi> to, though not an <hi>Equal</hi> with <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus taken a ſhort View of the Poets of all Ages, and of almoſt all the polite Countries in the World, and having found how far ſhort all of them, even <hi>Blackmore</hi> himſelf, fall of the Perfections and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the other <hi>Two,</hi> it may ſeem neceſſary to decide a Controverſie that has aroſe among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> had the greater <hi>Genius,</hi> and which of them deſerv'd the greater Applauſe. We find them divided into Parties about it, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in favour of the <hi>One,</hi> ſome in favour of the <hi>Other.</hi> But without detracting from either, we may venture to ſay that each of them had their peculiar Excellencies, which the other had not. If <hi>Homer</hi> was the firſt Model of this way, yet <hi>Virgil</hi> was under ſuch Circumſtances as gave him not only the Glory of well copying ſo great a Pattern, but even of a primary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
<pb facs="tcp:53904:11"/>
If the <hi>Firſt</hi> had more Flame, the <hi>Laſt</hi> had more Phlegm, and tho the Poems of the one had more Spirit in them, yet the <hi>Aeneid</hi> of the other was more Correct. On the other hand, if we do not meet with thoſe perfect Hero's, and thoſe noble Ideas of Vertue in <hi>Homer,</hi> as are to be ſeen in <hi>Virgil,</hi> 'tis to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted more to the unhappineſs and Imperfections of the times the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet liv'd in, than to any want of Judgment and skill. In a word they are both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their kind, and if <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems better than <hi>Virgil,</hi> 'tis becauſe it was his fortune to be born firſt: As on the contrary, if any one thinks the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet to be beſt, 'tis becauſe he had ſo excellent a Model to imitate. However the caſe is, yet 'tis evident they both had large <hi>Genius's,</hi> and ſuch as no others, as we know of, could ſtand in Competition with.</p>
            <p>Now it is not to be wonder'd at, if by the great performances of ſuch an extraordinary <hi>Genius</hi> as ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> many great, extraordinary and almoſt miraculous <hi>Effects</hi> were produc'd. Love, Admiration, and Eſteem were the common Tributes which the Vulgar paid to the Venerable Name of Poet. They were ſo charm'd with the ſweetneſs of all Poetical Compoſures, that they look'd upon what the Poet ſaid as Divine, and gave the ſame credit to it, as to an Oracle. Hence it came to paſs that all the Poets Writings were among the Heathen reckon'd as ſo many <hi>Leſſons</hi> or <hi>Sermons of Morality,</hi> which poliſh'd the Manners, ſmooth'd the Temper, and civiliz'd the Diſpoſition of the moſt Barbarous Nations. Nor is it unreaſonable to Imagine that even the Refinedneſs of <hi>Athens</hi> was owing more to the <hi>Poets,</hi> than to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> Inſtructions. Of all that has been ſaid in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Poets, <hi>Homer</hi> may claim a great ſhare, ſince if we will believe <hi>Horace</hi> in the Caſe, his <note n="*" place="margin">Plenius ac melius Chryſippo aut Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore dicit. <hi>Ep. ad Loll.</hi>
               </note> Writings were more inſtructive and uſeful,
<pb facs="tcp:53904:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the Conduct of human Life, than the Precepts of even the beſt Moral Philoſophers. 'Tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, we are in the dark, as to what <hi>Effects</hi> his two Poems had in the Age he liv'd in: But this we know, that in after Ages they have been had in univerſal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and will always be admir'd as long as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Good-Manners have any repute in the World. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Virgil.</hi> For the more any Age increaſes in Sound Knowledge, and Ingenious Literature, the more to be ſure will his Poem be had in Admiration. Beſides it ſeems to have had a ſtrange and peculiar Effect in the Age, and upon the State he liv'd under. For 'tis more than Probable that the publiſhing of his <hi>Aeneid</hi> conduc'd very much to the ſettling <hi>Auguſtus</hi> on the Imperial Throne. We know what a ſtrange A verſion the <hi>Romans</hi> had to the very name of Monarchy, and 'tis not likely they would ſo ſoon have exchang'd their belov'd <hi>Democracy</hi> for that which they ſo much hated, had they not been work'd over to it by the Inſtructions of <hi>Virgil:</hi> who informs them, <q>That when Heaven decrees to ſettle a State upon ſuch or ſuch a Foundation, 'tis Athoiſm and Irreligion to oppoſe its deſigns; and ſuch an Affront to the divine Majeſty and Wiſdom as ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet with ſpeedy, and condign Puniſhment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what <hi>Encouragement</hi> the <hi>Epick</hi> Poets have met with. As for <hi>Homer,</hi> the Times he liv'd in are ſo obſcure, that we can gather nothing of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from <hi>Hiſtory</hi> about him. But 'tis by moſt concluded that he was as Poor as he was Ingenious: And that though many Cities after his Death claim'd him for their own; yet none of them gave the blind Bard, that encouragement he merited whilſt alive. 'Tis likely he was admir'd and eſteem'd by all, but receiv'd no other reward that we know of, for his Deſerts, but what our poor <hi>Spencer</hi> did, namely a Courtiers Smile; inſignificant Promiſes, and a few fawning. Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb facs="tcp:53904:12"/>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> had the luck to live in better times, for he met with a <hi>Maecenas,</hi> who honour'd him with his favour, encourag'd him with his Gifts, and introduc'd him into the Eſteem of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf. This indeed was ſomething more than the empty Breath of popular Applauſe; and <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> at that time was not ſuch a ſtarving, barren Soil, as before and afterwards it prov'd. Then Poets were had in admiration, and every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that recompence, which was their due. This was the Poets Golden Age, and all other Polite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with ſuch ample Encouragement, as made it flouriſh more under the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> than in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, even to the Honour and Admiration of thoſe, and to the diſgrace and reproach of ſucceeding times. There have been indeed ſome intervals ſince, wherein Poets have met with their due Rewards. <hi>Arioſto</hi> and <hi>Taſſo</hi> are ſaid to have met with their <hi>Patrons,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of their Pieces, and recompenc'd their Labours. And in <hi>France, Richlieu</hi> was a great and never-failing Friend to the <hi>Muſes</hi> and their Votaries. But at other times the poor Bards have been left to feed upon the empty Air of Vulgar Fame. For a proof of this, we need only have recourſe to the Poets of our own Nation, who whilſt living have moſt of them met with the ſame fate as their fore-Father <hi>Homer;</hi> tho' when Dead they have like him been even Idoliz'd. But this <hi>Poſthumous Fame</hi> is but a poor Subſiſtence for a living Poet: And this gives us a juſt occaſion to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reaſons of the declining State of <hi>Epick Poetry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Moderns,</hi> eſpecially in our own Nation.</p>
            <p>One would wonder how it comes to paſs, that in ſuch an Age as this, wherein all manner of Polite Learning ſhines with as great a Luſtre, as it did in the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus, Epick Poetry</hi> ſhould be the only ſlighted and neglected thing. But for all our Wonder, Experience ſhews us, that 'tis ſo far diſregarded by the Learned World, that few or none, tho' duly qualified, will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:53904:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon ſuch an Undertaking; and there are but a few likewiſe that underſtand the true nature and deſign of an <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been many Reaſons brought to prove it next to impoſſible for one of our <hi>Modern</hi> Poets to write a true <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem, ſuch a one as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have wrote. Some of theſe Reaſons I ſhall juſt mention, and prove them to be only pretences at the beſt; and then I ſhall make bold to propoſe ſome other Reaſons of the declining State of <hi>Heroick Poetry</hi> in our times, which perhaps may ſeem to the unprejudic'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be of more weight and conſequence, than any that have as yet been alledg'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all 'tis objected by ſome, <hi>That we want due Matter for an Heroick Poem:</hi> That is, the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of our Nation is not able to furniſh us with an <hi>Action</hi> or an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> that is fit for ſuch a Poem. Were we indeed to judge of this by the Practice of Sir <hi>William D'Avenant</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> who have each of them made choice of a <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> that has nothing to do with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Nation, we might then be inclin'd to ſuppoſe it was for want of due and juſt <hi>Matter</hi> in our own <hi>Annals.</hi> But I think they had no need of ſearching into Foreign <hi>Hiſtory</hi> for their <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Hero's,</hi> ſince they might with more Credit to themſelves and with more Honor to their Country, have met with both nigher Home. 'Tis certain our own <hi>Hiſtory</hi> could have furniſh'd them with as juſt a <hi>Subject</hi> for <hi>Heroick</hi> Poetry, as any other. Experience has ſhewn us ſince, by the happy Choice Dr. <hi>Blackmore</hi> has made of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> that our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> are not ſo barren of Great and Noble <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Heros</hi> as ſome would pretend. It argues then great Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or at leaſt great Negligence in the ſearch of our <hi>Records</hi> to ſay, <hi>That we want due Matter for an Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again 'tis objected by others, <hi>That we want a Genius for ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking.</hi> This indeed is a weightier
<pb facs="tcp:53904:13"/>
Reaſon than the former, and if true, would ſilence all our pretences to <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry. Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> in his <hi>Eſſay of Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> preſſes this Argument very ſtrongly againſt the <hi>Modern Poets.</hi> But without any offence to that great Man, it may be juſtly affirm'd, That this laſt Age has produc'd as many great and noble <hi>Genius</hi>'s, as any other Age before it: So that had they been inclin'd to <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry, and received any encouragement that way, they might no queſtion have come off with the ſame ſucceſs as they have in the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> will not allow our <hi>Moderns</hi> to be any more than <hi>Dwarfs</hi> in Learning, when compar'd to the <hi>Ancients;</hi> and then, by a pretty ſort of Allegory, he goes about to prove, that they with all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of writing after the <hi>Ancients,</hi> cannot make ſo great a Progreſs in Learning as thoſe did. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with refuting his Aſſertion, ſince that is done already by Mr. <hi>Wootton</hi> in his <hi>Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> wherein he ſufficiently proves the <hi>Moderns</hi> to be as tall in Learning, if not taller than Sir <hi>William's Gaints</hi> were; and that 'tis not want of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> but ſome Accidental Circumſtances, which make the Men of this Age come behind thoſe of former times in <hi>Oratory</hi> and <hi>Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Objection is, <hi>our defect of Numbers, and that our Language is not proper for Heroick Poetry.</hi> This is what <hi>Wootton</hi> himſelf urges in his <hi>Reflections,</hi> when he will not allow the former Reaſon to hold good. He tells us there, <q>That the <hi>Greek</hi> was ſo ſmooth, ſoft, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile, that <hi>Homer</hi> had great encouragement even from his Language, to ſet about an <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem: That the <hi>Latin</hi> was majeſtical and ſtately, but withal ſo rough, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had much ado to run it down to Verſe: But that our <hi>Modern</hi> Languages are all ſo harſh and unmalleable, that the Poets have no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to form any thing that is great out of them.</q> This, if I miſtake not his ſenſe, is the force of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
<pb facs="tcp:53904:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But it may be reply'd, That tho'our Language is not ſo ſmooth and ſonorous as the <hi>Greek,</hi> yet it comes the next to it of any Language. 'Tis well known how it has been refining ever ſince <hi>Waller</hi>'s and <hi>Cowley</hi>'s time, and it ſeems at preſent to be almoſt arriv'd to its Purity and Perfection. <note n="*" place="margin">Dryd. Dedic. to the E. of <hi>Orrery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rival La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> 
               <hi>Dryden</hi> calls it a <hi>Noble Language,</hi> and is only ſorry we have not a more certain meaſure of it, as they have in <hi>France,</hi> where they have an <hi>Academy</hi> erected for that purpoſe, and endowed with large Privileges by the preſent King. <hi>Rapin</hi> himſelf acknowledges the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of our Language, <hi>which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is proper for great Expreſſions: Rymer</hi> compares the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> to our Language, and prefers the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to all the reſt; which, he ſays, has a weight, fullneſs, vigour, force, gravity, and fitneſs for <hi>Heroick Poeſie,</hi> above all other Languages. How true this is, appears from the daily Writings of our Poets, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from ſome of <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Poems, and <hi>Blackmore</hi>'s Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> where their Expreſſion is lofty and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtical, the Verſe ſmooth and ſtrong, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers truly harmonious, and befitting their reſpective deſigns. I ſhall only add the Opinion of <hi>Roſcommon</hi> in the Caſe, who ſpeaking in Commendation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, makes it by much to be Superiour to the <hi>French.</hi> His words are theſe:
<q>
                  <l>But who did ever in <hi>French</hi> Authors ſee</l>
                  <l>The Comprehenſive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Energy?</l>
                  <l>The weighty <hi>Bullion</hi> of one <hi>Sterling</hi> Line,</l>
                  <l>Drawn to <hi>French</hi> Wire, would through whole Pages ſhint.</l>
                  <l>I ſpeak my Private, but Impartial Sence,</l>
                  <l>With Freedom, and (I hope) without offence:</l>
                  <l>For I'll Recant, when <hi>France</hi> can ſhew me Wit,</l>
                  <l>As ſtrong as <hi>ours,</hi> and as ſuccinctly writ.</l>
               </q>
               <bibl>[Roſcommon'<hi>s Eſſay on Tranſlated Verſe.]</hi>
               </bibl>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:14"/>
Laſtly, 'tis Objected, <q>
                  <hi>That we want the Benefit of Machines;</hi> which the Heathen Poets made ſo great uſe of, and with which their Poems were full from one end to the other: That the Notions and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our times exclude all manner of Miracles, and the extraordinary preſence of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods from having any thing to do in the ordinary Courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs, which we believe now to be govern'd only by one common <hi>Providence;</hi> and that upon this account it ſeems altogether unpracticable for any of our <hi>Modern</hi> Poets to write an <hi>Heroick</hi> Poem like to thoſe of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </q> This Objection is duly ſtated, and fully anſwer'd by Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in his <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Tranſlation of Juvenal.</hi> There he tells us, That our Religion does indeed debar the Poet from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Venus,</hi> or any others of the <hi>Heathen Deities:</hi> But that this is made up to the Poet another way; that 'tis not contrary to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to believe that there are good and bad Spirits which have ſome ſort of influence over humane Affairs: And that the Poet may form as juſt <hi>Machines</hi> out of theſe, as the <hi>Ancients</hi> did out of their <hi>Divinities.</hi> This is what <hi>Blackmore</hi> has done even to Admiration, and his Practice and Conduct has put it beyond all diſpute, that we may very ſafely and regularly make uſe of <hi>Machines,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they are ſuch as are ſuited to the Notions and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our times.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal Objections I thought fit to mention, which are not ſuch ſolid Reaſons as ſome may imagine: I ſhall now according to my promiſe propoſe ſome others, which I think to be more ſubſtantial; but withal I muſt reſerve to my ſelf my firſt Caution, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I deſign to dictate nothing herein, but to lay down my Thoughts as plainly and as clearly as poſſible, and to refer all to the Verdict of better Judgments.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I ſay, that one great Reaſon of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſeſteem which <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry lies under, and of its
<pb facs="tcp:53904:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declining ſtate among the Moderns, ſeems to be <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of the preſent Age.</hi> We are fall'n at laſt into ſuch unhappy times, wherein Men are as averſe to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Morality,</hi> which the <hi>Epick Poet</hi> writes, as they are to the Leſſons of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which the <hi>Preacher</hi> every Day inculcates. We do indeed read <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> but then 'tis not with a deſign, like the Bee, to ſuck the Honey out of them, but in imitation of more ſordid Creatures, to extract all the Venom we can, in order to corrupt our Manners, and give a Guſt to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries. We are glad to find any paſſage in them that may ſeem to favour our Licentiouſneſs, and even thoſe that are deſign'd to be our Phyſick, we like Men of a Sick Stomach, turn all into rank Poyſon. Now no wonder if when our Palates are thus vitiated we have no Reliſh for the wholeſome Inſtructions of <hi>Epick Poetry.</hi> Poets then, to pleaſe the Humour of the Age, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to write in their way, eſpecially ſuch of them as have not Souls great enough to ſtem the Torrent of ſo univerſal a Vice. Hence it comes to paſs that we have ſo many vile <hi>Plays</hi> Acted on the Stage, wherein Vice is ſet off with all the Luſtre, and recommended with all the Endearments that a corrupted <hi>Poet's Wit</hi> can invent, or the moſt looſe <hi>Debauché</hi> could have deſir'd. Thus both <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Audience,</hi> by an unheard of Complaiſance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Ruine and Corruption of each others Manners.</p>
            <p>Another great Reaſon of the declining State of <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry, and of the Degeneracy of all other ſorts of Poetry, is <hi>the want of due Encouragement.</hi> This is the true Ground of all our Grievances, and till this be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt, 'tis to be fear'd nothing that is Great, Noble, Vertuous, and truly Good, will ever be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by our Modern Poets. <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> made their Poets the Penſioners of their State, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them honourably out of the Publick Treaſury. Hence it was they never ventur'd, at leaſt not in the
<pb facs="tcp:53904:15"/>
moſt Primitive times of Poetry, to write any thing which might reflect upon the Government they liv'd under, or upon the Gods they Worſhip'd. But now with us the Poet meets with no Encouragement, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>One Lawreat</hi> is maintain'd at the publick Charge. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account it is that Men of Large Souls, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condeſcend to humour the Vulgar in their Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, turn the bent of their Studies another way, and fly <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> as they would the moſt dangerous Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Others of a more pliable Temper take up with the <hi>Stage,</hi> and that they may receive ſome Profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſtudy not to profit, ſo much as they do to pleaſe their Audience, and that in their lewd way too. But is it not a burning ſhame that ſuch a Noble <hi>Genius</hi> as <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and others, that ſeem to be made for greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſhould be forc'd to a fatal Dilemma, either to truckle to a <hi>Playhouſe</hi> for the uncertain Profit of a <hi>third Day,</hi> or to ſtarve for want of other reaſonable Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement? But 'tis hop'd on all hands, that under the Reign of one that may truly be term'd another <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> and under the Patronage of one that may as juſtly be ſtil'd a <hi>Second Mecoenas, Poetry</hi> will regain its ancient Privileges, and <hi>Epick Poets</hi> receive that publick and due Encouragement they really deſerve.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Reaſon I ſhall mention for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining State of <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry among the <hi>Moderns</hi> is, <hi>their notorious neglect of following the Rules which</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>and</hi> Horace <hi>have preſcrib'd:</hi> This, and not want of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> has been the true Cauſe why ſeveral of our <hi>Engliſh Epick Poets</hi> have ſucceeded ſo ill in their Deſigns, <hi>Rymer</hi> urges this very ſtrongly againſt <hi>Spencer</hi> himſelf, whom at the ſame time he acknowledges to have had a large Soul, a ſharp Judgment, and a <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Heroick</hi> Poeſie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps above any that ever writ ſince <hi>Virgil.</hi> For no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but his following an unfaithful Guide, his Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling after Marvellous Adventures, his making no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Probability, and almoſt all his other faults
<pb facs="tcp:53904:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proceeded from one and the ſame Cauſe, namely, his neglect of following the Rules of Poetry. The ſame may be ſaid of Sir <hi>William D' Avenant,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley:</hi> For all the Defects <hi>Rymer</hi> charges them with, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the ſame Cauſe. 'Tis likewiſe upon this very account that the Pieces of our <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poets, which are reckon'd to be the beſt performances of the preſent Age, can ſcarce any of them ſtand the Teſt of a Judicious Eye: And a Man of ſenſe that knows <hi>the Art of Poetry,</hi> and has read the Performances of former Ages, cannot but pity the conceited Ignorance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Pride of our <hi>Modern Poets,</hi> who ſcorn to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the <hi>Rules of Art.</hi> They have been told of this often and often, but they think their own Wit is the beſt Judge in the Caſe; and as long as 'tis ſo there is no hopes of any Amendment, or of any great Productions in Poetry. I know they bring ſeveral Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Writing according to the Rules, but they are ſo trifling that I think it not worth while to examine them here: Beſides, all their Objections, at leaſt the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt of them, have been ſtated, examin'd, and refuted in the <hi>Preface before the laſt Tranſlation of</hi> Terence'<hi>s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;</hi> ſo that I am ſufficiently excus'd from that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Task.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhut up all that has been ſaid on <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry, with giving you the Thoughts of a very eminent Perſon of Quality of this preſent Age and Nation; who ſeems to have comprehended all that has been ſaid on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in theſe few Verſes.

            <p>After what has been ſaid in favour of <hi>Epick Poetry,</hi> it may be expected I ſhould ſay ſomething in behalf of my <hi>Author,</hi> and give the World ſome account of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that induc'd me to Tranſlate it: But before I do either, I muſt beg leave to premiſe a word or two, which to the more Judicious may not ſeem to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Criticiſe</hi> upon any Author, is no ſuch eaſie matter as ſome may imagine: But to paſs a true and impartial Judgment upon the Writings of the <hi>Poets,</hi> may be juſtly reckon'd one of the hardeſt parts of <hi>Criticiſm.</hi> Every little Pretender is not fit for ſuch an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. It requires a large but regulated Fancy, a ſound, ſolid, and penetrating Judgment, deep, piercing, and ſteady Thoughts, a long and obſtinate Courſe of Study, much and certain Experience, a clear and perfect inſight into Poetry and all its parts; but above all, the utmoſt ſtretch of Humanity and good Nature. Every one that reads <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> cannot be preſum'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them perfectly: Nor are all that underſtand theſe Authors to be admitted as competent Judges of
<pb facs="tcp:53904:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Excellencies and Failures. They muſt firſt be Maſters of the foremention'd Qualities, and then they may begin to <hi>Criticiſe</hi> and <hi>Reflect</hi> upon what they read and thorowly underſtand. Then they will be able to ſeparate the Droſs from the <hi>Or,</hi> to diſcern the falſe glittering of the Tinſel from the true Luſtre of the Jewel, and to know what is praiſe-worthy and what is not.</p>
            <p>How Synonymous ſoever the words may ſeem at firſt hearing, yet unqueſtionably there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Cenſuring</hi> and <hi>Criticiſing,</hi> as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a corrupted, ill-natur'd, and a fair impartial Judge. A little Wit, arm'd with a great deal of Malice, will go a great way towards the compoſing a <hi>Cenſurer:</hi> Such a one, I mean, that Carps at ev'ry thing he meets with, that would find faults where there are none, and take ſome ſort of Complacency and Delight in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſmalleſt ſlips of an Author. But now the true <hi>Critick</hi> is quite another thing; he brings all he reads and reflects on to the <hi>Criterion</hi> of right Reaſon, and to the Standard of Truth. What is excellent and beautiful, he not only acquits, but highly applauds and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends: What is weak he does all he can in juſtice to conceal or defend; and like a compaſſionate Judge, 'tis with ſome ſort of Reluctance and Regret that he is forc'd at laſt to paſs a <hi>Black</hi> Sentence upon the moſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Pieces. Such a <hi>Critick</hi> as this is of vaſt uſe to the Commonwealth of Learning, not only for encouraging and countenancing the <hi>Good,</hi> but likewiſe for diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deterring the <hi>Bad</hi> Writers: Since the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the one will be ſure to meet with a due eſteem; and the <hi>Faults</hi> of the other will in ſpite of the <hi>Criticks</hi> good Nature, fall under a juſt and ſevere Cenſure. This is that Notion I have of a true and accompliſh'd <hi>Critick:</hi> All others may be term'd <hi>Cenſurers, Carpers, Momus</hi>'s, or by what other Name of ignominy you pleaſe to give them, but are by no means to be
<pb facs="tcp:53904:17"/>
allow'd competent Judges of any Author's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>This ſort of Learning was in no ſmall eſteem among the Ancients; as is manifeſt from the many Curious <hi>Reflections</hi> and uſeful <hi>Criticiſms,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> among the <hi>Greeks, Horace</hi> and <hi>Petronius</hi> among the <hi>Latins</hi> (not to mention any more) have left behind them. Of latter date the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have fet up for great <hi>Criticks;</hi> but thoſe among them that have prov'd beſt, are ſuch as have follow'd the Rules and Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and other great Maſters of Antiquity; whilſt others that have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of their own, have come off with leſs Judgment and Applauſe. Among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there have been but few that merit the Name of <hi>Critick,</hi> in that Senſe I take the Word. Moſt of them are only <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> in the worſt Senſe; that is, ſuch as expoſe the <hi>Faults,</hi> but take no notice of the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of Authors. The <hi>Judicious Rymer,</hi> who ſeems to have a particular Talent for <hi>Criticiſing,</hi> yet in my Opinion falls ſhort of being a true <hi>Critick:</hi> And if he will ſtill diſpute that Title with the World, yet he muſt be contented with being reckon'd one of the meaner ſort; ſince'tis more difficult and honourable to diſcern and commend the <hi>Excellencies,</hi> than'tis to find out and expoſe the <hi>Failings</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpear, Fletcher,</hi> or any other Author. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>French,</hi> ſince the great encouragement they at firſt receiv'd from the Learned <hi>Richlieu,</hi> ſeem to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in this ſort of Learning: And how dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid ſoever they are ſaid to be in other parts, yet in <hi>Criticiſms</hi> they are full of curious Thoughts, and refin'd Reflections. <hi>Rapin,</hi> in all the Reflections he has made, comes off with univerſal Applauſe; but thoſe on <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Poeſie</hi> ſeem the moſt Correct of any. He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on all the parts of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and deſcends to the more minute and leſſer pieces of it; which is ſomething more than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf has left us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53904:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As for my Author, whom <hi>D'Acier</hi> in his Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ariſtotle's Poeſie</hi> calls the <hi>Ingenious and Judicious Boſſu;</hi> he, I ſay, has enlarg'd himſelf upon only one part of <hi>Poeſie,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Epick.</hi> And herein he ties himſelf ſtrictly to a Method, which he as ſtrictly purſues. He profeſſes at the very firſt, to have follow'd the Rules and Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Upon ſuch ſure grounds as theſe he builds all his Notions; and having ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Patterns to go by, Who can doubt of his Succeſs? What he takes from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> he explains, improves, and refines: What is his own, though never ſo judicious and rational, he lays down not in a Dogmatical Magiſterial way, but by way of Problem: And what he aſſerts with an Air of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though not his Maſters Thoughts, yet ſeem to be natural Deductions from what they have wrote about it. 'Tis not to be queſtion'd, but in many Things he diſſents from moſt Mens Opinions; but 'tis to be hop'd, no judicious Perſon will condemn him till he has ſeriouſly weigh'd his Reaſons, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Arguments he uſes to maintain his Cauſe: and then if our <hi>Critick</hi> can be convinc'd of any Error, he is too modeſt not to ſubmit to the Suffrage of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgments. But if, on the other hand, he has Reaſon on his ſide, it may with Juſtice be expected, that he will be a means of opening the Eyes of a great many unprejudic'd Perſons.</p>
            <p>His main Deſign of writing theſe <hi>Reflexions</hi> was, as he tells us himſelf, for the ſake of thoſe that read <hi>Virgil;</hi> and to ſuch I dare affirm, that this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> will be of more Uſe than all the Notes and Comments they have hitherto ſeen. They are uſually ſtuff'd with idle and unprofitable <hi>Remarks</hi> upon <hi>meer Words;</hi> but this full of ingenious <hi>Criticiſms</hi> upon the moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and important <hi>Things.</hi> How well he has diſcharg'd himſelf, thoſe who carefully read over this Tract of
<pb facs="tcp:53904:18"/>
his, will no doubt diſcover; and they will without doubt from thence form a nobler Idea of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and his Deſign, than hitherto they have conceiv'd. If he ſeems, like his Country-men, to be too Verboſe, 'tis only upon the account of his ſtudying to make all things as plain and as intelligible as may be; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be a real Fault, I leave others to judge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the uſeful <hi>Reflexions</hi> he makes upon the Conduct of <hi>Virgil</hi> in particular, you will find many others of no leſs uſe upon the Practice of <hi>Homer,</hi> and upon <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry in general; and now and then ſome that will give you no ſmall Light into the other two Parts of Great Poetry, <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy.</hi> In a word, he has throughout the whole acquitted himſelf like a true, judicious, and impartial <hi>Critick.</hi> He commends the Excellencies of the Good, and cenſures the Failings of the Worſt Poets with ſuch a Juſtneſs and Moderation, as deſerves a particular Eſteem and Admiration. Tho <hi>Statius, Claudian, Lucan, Seneca,</hi> and others, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Laſh, yet he meddles with their Faults no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Subject requires, and upon occaſion he gives them their full Commendations: And on the contrary, tho he beſtows on <hi>Homer</hi> and his admir'd <hi>Virgil</hi> very high and large Encomiums, yet they are no more than the moſt invidious part of the World have allow'd them; and he often blames both when he cannot in Juſtice excuſe their Failings.</p>
            <p>'Tis now high time I ſhould give you ſome Account of the Reaſons that induc'd me to the Tranſlating this Author. One, and not the leaſt, is the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of theſe Reflexions, which are too good to be confin'd to a Foreign Language. 'Tis true, <hi>French</hi> is now become faſhionable and common, and ſeems to be as univerſally ſtudied, as <hi>Latin</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and ev'ry Pretender to Gallantry and good Breeding, pretends at leaſt to be a perfect Maſter and Judge of this Language. But however, I believe the
<pb facs="tcp:53904:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Language is not ſo familiar, but by a modeſt Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it may be affirm'd, That a tenth part of thoſe that read <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> underſtand but very little of it. To ſuch as theſe, this Tranſlation may be of ſome Uſe; and perhaps others who think they alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy underſtand the <hi>French Tongue,</hi> may be glad to ſee ſo beneficial a Treatiſe in a more familiar and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Language.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon that inclin'd me to this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is, the Notice I receiv'd that <hi>Virgil</hi> was now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by an eminent hand. Before therefore that that Tranſlation came out into the World, I could not but think it proper and uſeful to uſher it in by the <hi>Reflections</hi> of ſo able a Critick. And perhaps it may be of ſome Uſe to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Virgil,</hi> when read in our Mother-Tongue. Beſides, it has the Fortune to come out juſt after Dr. <hi>Blackmore's Poem,</hi> and may be of great Uſe to thoſe who have an Inclination to Poetry; for by it they will be able to judge of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> you muſt not expect a verbal one; for to that I neither think my ſelf nor any body elſe oblig'd. I have kept as nigh my Author's Sence as poſſible; and perhaps ſome may think I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him too cloſe. However, I did all I could to render him with all the Perſpicuity which a <hi>Didactick</hi> Stile requir'd: and if that be granted me, I have all I aimed at. Some Terms of Art which <hi>Boſſu</hi> borrow'd from the <hi>Greek,</hi> I was oblig'd to retain as I found them: but doubtleſs, whoever attentively reads what he has ſaid about them, will ſoon find them to be no Myſtery. The <hi>Citations</hi> in the <hi>Margent</hi> (as many as I thought good to make uſe of) are all left in their <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Languages: but ſuch as are in the <hi>Text,</hi> I thought would appear beſt in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> unleſs when the Subject requir'd the contrary. For this purpoſe, ſome I made bold to borrow from the Tranſlations that were ready
<pb facs="tcp:53904:19"/>
done to my hands by ſeveral. Wits of the Age: Of the reſt, ſome I Tranſlated my ſelf; and others more difficult, I got an ingenious Friend of mine to turn for me.</p>
            <p>This is all the Account I think fit to give you of my Reaſons for Tranſlating <hi>Boſſu,</hi> and of the Method I have taken therein. Whatever Pains and Precaution I have us'd, I do not expect I ſhall pleaſe every body, and 'tis a Wonder if I ſhould. Some will cenſure the Author, others the Tranſlation, and a third ſort per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſtirr'd up with a generous kind of Envy call'd <hi>Emulation,</hi> will either endeavour to Tranſlate it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves, or elſe vent ſome new Notions of their own. However it happen, the World will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it, and my Author and I ſhall have this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, That the Commonwealth of Learning will be then engag'd to thank us not only for our own mean, but even for their more elaborate Productions.</p>

                     <hi>ARTS,</hi> as well as <hi>Sciences,</hi> are founded upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and in both we are to be guided by the <hi>Light of Nature.</hi> But in <hi>Sciences,</hi> neither the <hi>Inventers,</hi> nor the <hi>Improvers</hi> of them, are to make uſe of any other Guides but this <hi>Light of Nature:</hi> Whereas on the other hand, all <hi>Arts</hi> depend upon a great many other things, ſuch as the <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of thoſe, who firſt invented them, or of thoſe who have labour'd at them with an Univerſal Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poetry</hi> is of this Nature: And thò <hi>Reaſon</hi> might have firſt founded it, yet it cannot be deny'd but that the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Poets,</hi> and the <hi>Choice</hi> they have been pleas'd to make, have added thereto both its <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form.</hi> 'Tis then in the excellent Pieces of Antiquity we are to look for the Fundamentals of this Art: And, they are only to be rely'd on, to whom all others yield the Glory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53904:22"/>
of having either practis'd with the moſt Succeſs, or collected and preſcrib'd Rules with the greateſt Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> have furniſh'd us with Examples of both kinds. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> left behind them ſuch Rules, as make them by all Men of Learning, to be look'd upon as perfect Maſters of the Art of <hi>Poetry:</hi> And the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are, by the Grant of all Ages, the moſt perfect Models of this way of Writing, the World ever ſaw. So that if ever a Juſt and Supreme Authority had the Power to preſcribe Laws and Rules to any Art, one cannot queſtion but theſe four Perſons had all Authority on their ſide, with reſpect to the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> And this is the only kind we ſhall treat of at preſent.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Men of our Times may have as much <hi>Spirit</hi> as the Ancients had; and in thoſe things which depend upon <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Invention,</hi> they may likewiſe have as juſt and as lucky <hi>Fancies:</hi> But then it would be a Piece of Injuſtice to pretend that our new Rules deſtroy thoſe of our firſt Maſters; and that they muſt needs condemn all their Works, who could not foreſee our Humours, nor adapt themſelves to the <hi>Genius</hi> of ſuch Perſons as were to be born in after-Ages, under different Governments, and under a different Religion from theirs; and with Manners, Cuſtoms, and Languages, that have no kind of relation to them.</p>
                  <p>Having no Deſign then by this Treatiſe to make <hi>Poets</hi> after the Model of our Age (with which I am not ſufficiently acquainted) but only to furniſh my ſelf with ſome ſort of Foundation in the Deſign I have of explaining the <hi>Aeneid</hi> of <hi>Virgil;</hi> I need not concern my ſelf with every new Invention of theſe laſt Times. I am not of Opinion, that what our late Authors think is univerſal Reaſon, and ſuch a common Notion as Nature muſt needs have put into the Head of <hi>Virgil.</hi> But leaving Poſterity to determine whether theſe Novelties be well or ill devis'd, I ſhall only acquieſce in what I think may be prov'd from <hi>Homer, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> I will interpret the one by the Other, and <hi>Virgil</hi> by all Three, as having the ſame <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poeſie.</hi>

                  <p>THE moſt conſiderable difference my Subject preſents me with between the Style of the Ancients, and that of the laſt Ages, is, That our way of Speaking is plain, proper, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53904:22"/>
the <hi>Turn:</hi> Whereas theirs was full of Myſteries and Allegories. The Truth was mask'd under theſe ingenious Inventions, which for their Excellence go under the name of <hi>Fables,</hi> or <hi>Sayings;</hi> as if there were as much difference between theſe fabulous Diſcourſes of the Wiſe, and the ordinary Language of the Vulgar, as there is between the Language that is proper to Men, and the Sounds brute Beaſts make uſe of to expreſs their Paſſions and Senſations.</p>
                  <p>At firſt the <hi>Fables</hi> were employ'd in ſpeaking of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> according to the Notion they then had of it. This ſublime Subject made the firſt <hi>Poets</hi> to be ſtil'd <hi>Divines,</hi> and <hi>Poetry the Language of the Gods.</hi> They divided the Divine Attributes as it were into ſo many Perſons; becauſe the Infirmity of a Humane Mind cannot ſufficiently conceive, or explain ſo much Power and Action in a Simplicity ſo great and indiviſible as is that of God. And perhaps they were jealous of the Advantages they reap'd from ſuch excellent and refin'd Learning, and which they thought the vulgar part of Mankind was not worthy of.</p>
                  <p>They could not tell us of the Operations of this Almighty Cauſe, without ſpeaking at the ſame time of its Effects: So that to <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> they added <hi>Phyſiology,</hi> and treated thereof, without quitting the Umbrages of their Allegorical Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Man</hi> being the chief and the moſt noble of all the Effects which God produc'd, and nothing being ſo proper, nor more uſeful to <hi>Poets</hi> than this Subject, they have added it to the former, and treated of the Doctrine of <hi>Morality</hi> after the ſame manner as they did that of <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> And from Morality thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of, has Art form'd that kind of <hi>Poem</hi> and <hi>Fable,</hi> which we call the <hi>Epick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What the <hi>Divines</hi> made their <hi>Divinity,</hi> that did the <hi>Epick Poets</hi> make their <hi>Morality.</hi> But that infinite Variety of the Actions and Operations of the Divine Nature (to which our Underſtanding bears but little proportion) did as it were force them upon dividing the ſingle <hi>Idea</hi> of the only one God into ſeveral Perſons, under the different Names of <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,</hi> and the reſt. And on the other hand, the Nature of <hi>Moral Philoſophy</hi> being ſuch as never lays down a Rule for any particular thing, the <hi>Epick Poets</hi> were oblig'd to unite in one ſingle <hi>Idea,</hi> in one and the ſame Perſon, and in an Action that appear'd ſingular, all that look'd like it in different Perſons, and in various Actions, which might be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as ſo many <hi>Species</hi> under their <hi>Genus.</hi>

                  <p>But all this, being divine and ſurprizing, may quite ruine all <hi>Probability:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Poet</hi> ſhould take ſpecial care as to that Point, ſince his chief aim is to inſtruct, and without <hi>Probability</hi> any Action is leſs likely to perſwade.</p>
                  <p>To all this the <hi>Poets</hi> are oblig'd by the ſubſtance of the Things they propoſe to themſelves as the ſubject Matter of their Poems and Inſtructions. The manner of teaching them uſefully and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, has likewiſe oblig'd them to add ſeveral other Rules.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epopéa</hi>'s buſineſs is with the <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Habitudes</hi> more than the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Theſe riſe on a ſudden, and their Heat is ſoon over; but the <hi>Habitudes</hi> are more calm, and come on, and go off more leiſurely. Therefore the <hi>Epick Action</hi> cannot be contain'd in one ſingle day, as the <hi>Dramatick</hi> can: It muſt have a longer and more juſt ſpace allow'd it, than that of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which is only allow'd for the <hi>Paſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſtinction makes the <hi>Tragedy</hi> and the <hi>Epopéa</hi> differ very much. The violence of <hi>Tragedy</hi> requires a great deal more lively and brisk Repreſentation than that of a <hi>Recital:</hi> beſides it is all Action, and the <hi>Poet</hi> ſays never a Word, as he does in the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> where there are no Actors.</p>
                  <p>But if in this the <hi>Epopéa</hi> is inferiour to the <hi>Drama,</hi> yet 'tis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to both <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> becauſe 'tis a great deal more active than bare Philoſophy, and the Recitals of <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> And thô it does not preſent Actors to the Eyes of the Spectators, yet it ought at leaſt more frequently than <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> to break off the Thread of its Diſcourſe by the Speeches of its Perſonages. This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> orders, when he ſays, that <hi>the Narration of the Epick ought to be Dramatick,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>very active.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has likewiſe its <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which give it no ſmall Advantage over <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> But in this it is inferiour to <hi>Tragedy.</hi> For thô it has a mixture of all the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> yet <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> are the moſt eſſential to it. Theſe indeed contribute moſt towards the making us wiſe Men: <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Curioſity</hi> are the Cauſe of <hi>Sciences;</hi> and nothing engages us ſo forcibly as <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> So that theſe two Paſſions muſt never be wanting to any invented Piece, if we would be inform'd in what we are indiſpenſibly oblig'd to know.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. The Definition of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THat which we have obſerv'd concerning the Nature of the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> gives us a juſt Idea of it, which we may expreſs thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The <hi>EPOPEA</hi> is a Diſcourſe invented by Art, to form the Manners by ſuch Inſtructions as are diſguis'd under the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories of ſome one important Action, which is related in Verſe. after a probable, diverting, and ſurprizing Manner.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This here is the Definition of the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and not of <hi>Poetry</hi> it ſelf. For that is an Art of making all ſorts of Poems, of which the <hi>Epick</hi> is but a part. The <hi>Epopéa</hi> then is not an Art, but an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial thing, as 'tis expreſs'd in the Definition, which ſays 'tis <hi>a Diſcourſe invented by Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe one ſort of <hi>Poem,</hi> as 'tis intimated in the Definition by its being call'd <hi>a Diſcourſe in Verſe:</hi> And the reſt diſtinguiſhes it from all other ſorts of <hi>Poems.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Action of <hi>Comedy</hi> is not very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and beſides the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Poet</hi> ſays nothing, but only the Perſons he introduces, ſay and act All, juſt as in <hi>Tragedy.</hi> For this reaſon both This and That is ſtil'd a <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poem. And thus it is plain the <hi>Epopéa</hi> is neither <hi>Tragedy</hi> nor <hi>Comedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it a piece of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> as the Poems of <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Lucretius:</hi> Nor a Treatiſe of Husbandry, and the like, as the <hi>Georgicks</hi> of <hi>Virgil:</hi> Becauſe theſe Pieces are not deſign'd to form Men's Manners, and the Inſtructions contain'd in them are naked, ſimple, and proper, without Diſguiſe and Allegories.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53904:24"/>
This ſecond reaſon, which more eſpecially concerns the Eſſence and Nature of Poeſy, does likewiſe exclude from the number of <hi>Epick Poems,</hi> any Piece of <hi>Morality</hi> writ in Verſe, and a plain <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Lucan's Pharſalia, the Punick War of Silius Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus,</hi> and ſuch like real Actions of ſome ſingular Perſons without a <hi>Fable,</hi> and in ſhort every thing that is deſcrib'd in Verſe after this manner.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not trouble my head to take notice how the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the <hi>Satyr,</hi> the <hi>Eclogue,</hi> the <hi>Ode,</hi> the <hi>Elegy,</hi> the <hi>Epigram,</hi> and other leſſer Poems: For this is ſelf-evident.</p>
                  <p>But it will not be amiſs to reflect upon what has been already ſaid, and from thence to conclude that the <hi>Epopéa</hi> has ſome rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Four Things; <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Poem,</hi> to the <hi>Fable,</hi> to <hi>Moral Philoſophy,</hi> and to <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has a relation to <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> becauſe as well This as That relates one or more Actions: But the Actions of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> are ſingular and true, ſo that the <hi>Epopéa</hi> is neither a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> nor a Species of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has a neceſſary relation to <hi>Morality,</hi> ſince both one and the other inſtructs Men in their Morals; but the Action and the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories which are proper to it, is the cauſe why properly ſpeaking it is not <hi>Moral Philoſophy,</hi> although it may be ſtil'd a <hi>Species</hi> of it; and in ſhort, it has a great deal more relation to this than to <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it belongs altogether to the <hi>Poem</hi> and the <hi>Fable,</hi> ſince it is properly and truly a <hi>Poem</hi> and a <hi>Fable;</hi> and is only diſtinguiſh'd from other Poems and Fables, as ſeveral <hi>Species,</hi> which equally partake of the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi> are diſtinguiſh'd from one another. Beſides, the Definition does exactly include both, ſince <hi>a Poem is a Diſcourſe in Verſe,</hi> and <hi>a Fable is a Diſcourſe invented to form Men's Morals by Inſtructions diſguis'd under the Allegories of an Action.</hi> So that one might abridge the Definition we have given of the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> and only ſay, <hi>that it is a Fable gracefully form'd upon an important Action, which is related in Verſe after a very probable and ſurpriſing manner.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Parts of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> The Diviſion of this Treatiſe.</head>
                  <p>THE Parts of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> contain'd in the former Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition are its <hi>Nature,</hi> its <hi>Matter,</hi> its <hi>Form,</hi> and its <hi>Manner of propoſing Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Nature</hi> is twofold; for the <hi>Epopéa</hi> is both a <hi>Fable</hi> and a <hi>Poem.</hi> But theſe two ſeveral <hi>Genus</hi>'s agree very well together, and compoſe a Body, that is no Monſter. One may likewiſe very well ſeparate theſe two Natures from one another, and ſay, that the <hi>Fable</hi> is that which conſtitutes the Nature of the <hi>Epopéa;</hi> and that the <hi>Poem</hi> tells us how to manage the <hi>Fable,</hi> and comprehends the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> the <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Verſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of it is an <hi>Action</hi> feign'd with probability, and drawn from the Actions of Kings, Princes, and Gods. This tells us two Things, the <hi>Action</hi> and the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and therein it does not at all differ from <hi>Tragedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Form</hi> of it is, that the Perſons are not here introduc'd to the Spectator's view, acting by themſelves without the Poet, as in <hi>Tragedy:</hi> But that the Action is recited by the Poet.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> is to lay down <hi>Moral Inſtructions</hi> for all ſorts of People both in <hi>general</hi> and in <hi>particular.</hi> This part belongs to the Poem as it is a <hi>Fable.</hi> It contains the <hi>Moral</hi> which ſerves for the Foundation of the <hi>Fable;</hi> and beſides that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Manners</hi> of thoſe Perſonages who make ſome conſiderable Figure in the Poem.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as the <hi>Form</hi> includes the Perſon of the Poet who makes the Rehearſal: So does the <hi>End</hi> comprehend the Perſons of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for whom the Poet deſigns his Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Things will make up the Subject-Matter of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: But 'tis not neceſſary they ſhould be all handled with the ſame particularity and exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>Some will very naturally fall under others, as that will, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which we have to ſay concerning the Poet and his Audience.</p>
                  <p>To treat of the <hi>End</hi> and the <hi>Moral</hi> a-part would require too vaſt a Compaſs; I ſhall content my ſelf to ſpeak thereof in ſpeaking of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and in other Places, where the neceſſary connexion of that Part with the reſt will afford me juſt Occaſions of ſpeaking as much of it as is requiſite for my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> divided the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions</hi> into two Parts, as was very requiſite: But ſo many Authors have handled theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53904:25"/>
Things, and ſo copiouſly too, that I think my ſelf excuſed from repeating and copying thoſe Things, which are under the Juriſdiction of other Arts. I will leave theſe Things then to the <hi>Rhetoricians, Grammarians,</hi> and to thoſe who have writ ſo much about them even in <hi>Poetry</hi> it ſelf. So that the little I have to ſay will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd in one part. And my Unwillingneſs to be copious, is the Reaſon which obliges me to ſpeak ſtill leſs of the <hi>Poem</hi> and <hi>Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I ſhall write very fully of the <hi>Fable,</hi> as being the moſt eſſential part of the <hi>Epopéa.</hi> So likewiſe I ſhall concerning it a <hi>Form,</hi> and its <hi>Matter.</hi> Nay more, I ſhall handle diſtinctly the <hi>Morals</hi> of the Perſons. And laſtly, I ſhall diſtinguiſh the <hi>Gods</hi> from the <hi>Men.</hi> The <hi>Gods</hi> are uſually expreſs'd by the Name of <hi>Machines,</hi> becauſe the Poets make uſe of ſuch to let them down upon the Theatre; from whence the <hi>Epopéa</hi> has likewiſe borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Name.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A Poem is a Diſcourſe in Verſe; and a Verſe is a part of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe meaſur'd by a certain number of long and ſhort Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, with a grateful Cadence, that is conſtantly repeated. This Repetition is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the Notion we have of Verſe, from that of Proſe. For in Proſe as well as Verſe, every Period and Clauſe are ſo many parts of a Diſcourſe meaſured by a certain number of long and ſhort Syllables; but Proſe is ever and anon altering its Cadences and Meaſures, which Verſe never does.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53904:26"/>
The Repetition, which the Poets make uſe of, ſeems ſtill the ſame in the way of Writing: for, when one Verſe is finiſh'd, they come back again to the beginning of another Line to write the next Verſe. And this coming back again, is that which gives it the Name of <note n="‖" place="margin">Verſus.</note> 
                     <hi>Verſe;</hi> and this Name in <hi>Latin</hi> is common to Verſes, and ſeveral other things that are rang'd, as they are, in different Lines; as Trees, for inſtance, which are ſet in Rows.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Latins</hi> call Verſes likewiſe by the Name of <hi>Carmina;</hi> but this is an Equivocal Term: for beſides its ſignifying Verſes, or Poems, it may be uſed to expreſs other things. 'Tis a Term that is given to the <note n="*" place="margin">Ramoque ſedens miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile <hi>Carmen</hi> Integrat. <hi>Virg.

                  <p>For the making of Verſes, 'tis not enough to take care of the Meaſure and Quantity of the Syllables, and to place ſix Feet juſt after one another in the ſame Line; there muſt be likewiſe ſome grateful Cadences, of which there are ſeveral Rules laid down in treating about <hi>Caeſura's, Synalepha's, the Length of Words,</hi> and the like. Beſides this, there muſt be ſome <hi>Tenſes of Verbs, ſome Moods, ſome Regiments, ſome Conſtructions,</hi> and ſome Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to Verſe, and which Proſe knows nothing of.</p>
                  <p>But above all, there muſt be in Verſe the <hi>Turn,</hi> and ſome ways of ſpeaking that are elevated, bold, and metaphorical; which are ſo proper to this kind of Writing, that without them the moſt exact placing of long and ſhort Syllables is not ſo much Verſe as Proſe in Metre: And, on the contrary, theſe bold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſo proper to Verſe, when uſed in a Diſcourſe that has not Feet nor Poetical Numbers, do give it ſuch an Air of Verſe, that it is not ſo properly Proſe, as a kind of Poeſie without Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, <hi>Disjecti Membra Poetae.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Nature</hi> does not inſpire into us the Rules of Poetry and Verſe; ſo neither does <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Study</hi> help us to that Air, that Force, and that Elevation, in which <hi>Horace</hi> diſcovers ſomething that is Divine, and which only makes a Man deſerve the Name of Poet. This is an Accompliſhment a Man ſhould be born with, owing either to the

                  <p>From what has been ſaid, we may conclude that the <hi>End</hi> of Poetry is to pleaſe: that its <hi>Cauſe</hi> is either the Excellency of the Poet's Nature, or the Poetick Frenſie, and theſe Tranſports of Spirit, that are to be govern'd by Judgment. Its <hi>Matter</hi> is the long and ſhort Syllables, the Numbers it is made up of, and the Words which <hi>Grammar</hi> furniſhes it with, as well as Proſe. And its <hi>Form</hi> is the ranging of all theſe Things in ſuch exact and charming Verſes, as may beſt expreſs the Thoughts of the Author after the manner we have been deſcribing.</p>
                  <p>But after all, how confin'd is all this, if we conſider the great Name of Poet in the Honour <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> did it, and in all the Extent it is capable of! What we have ſaid about it has nothing of Praiſe-worthy in it, but what ev'ry pitiful Tranſlator may pretend to, and what the War of <hi>Catiline</hi> turn'd into Verſe might beſtow upon him, that would tranſpoſe the Proſe of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt</hi> after this manner. 'Tis with Reaſon then that we diſtinguiſh theſe mean Subjects from <hi>great Poetry,</hi> by giving them the name of <hi>Verſification;</hi> and that we make, as it were, two diſtinct Arts of <hi>Verſification</hi> and <hi>Poetry.</hi> In a word, there is as much Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Art of Making Verſes, and that of Inventing Poems, as there is between <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great Art conſiſts chiefly in the <hi>Fable,</hi> in the manner of Expreſſing Things by Allegories and Metaphors, and in the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome probable Matter; that is, of ſome Actions, under which the Poet very charmingly diſguiſes the Truths he would have us learn. This is ſo proper to the Poet, that even in the <hi>Expreſſion</hi>

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends nothing ſo much as the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi> Which agrees very well with that which we have already ſaid about the Nature of Poetry. For the <hi>Fables</hi> are ſo many Allegorical Diſguiſes, and an Allegory is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Series and Chain of Metaphors linked together.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and theſe important Matters in the Sequel of this Treatiſe. We ſhall here only make this one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; That the true Poems, and ſuch as have more of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Nature of <hi>Great Poetry</hi> than any other, are the <hi>Epapcit,</hi> the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and the <hi>Comedy;</hi> for they are all Allegorical and Fabulous.

three ſorts. If we compare them together, the <hi>Epopéa</hi> will excel the other two by that great Liberty it takes of uſing Metaphors and perpetual Alluſions in the Fables. Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions would be more obſcure upon the Stage, and would have ſomething that is leſs probable in the Mouth of the Actors we hear ſpeak, than in the Narration of a Poet, who writes purely to be read. <hi>Comedy</hi> muſt likewiſe yield to <hi>Tragedy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has little of Elevation, and the manner of its Actors Speaking, is too Natural and Familiar.</p>
                  <p>This very Thing has made ſome People queſtion whether <note n="†" place="margin">Idicirco quidam Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia necne Poema eſſet quaeſivere: quod acer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ac vis nec Verbis nec rebus ineſt; niſi quod pede certo differt ſermoni ſermo Merus. <hi>Hor.

                     <hi>Comedy</hi> were a true <hi>Poem</hi> or no. Which Difficulty is wholly grounded upon this general Notion, <hi>That a Poem is a Diſcourſe in Verſe.</hi> Now in the <hi>Latin Comedy,</hi> the Diſcourſe has nothing in it of Verſe, but Feet and Numbers. This indeed is enough for ſuch a Poetical Subject as <hi>Comedy</hi> is. And we ſuppoſe in this we are of <hi>Horace</hi>'s Opinion, at leaſt he attributes this Doubt to a very few Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But this meaſure only, without any Air to diſtinguiſh the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from Proſe, makes no Verſes: And for this Reaſon has. <note n="‡" place="margin">Primum ego meillorum dederim quibus eſſe Poë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Excerpam numero; neque enim concludere Verſum Dixeris eſſe ſatis; neque ſi quis ſcribat uti nos Sermoni propiora, putes hunc eſſe Poëtam. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Caſe is not the ſame with Subjects that are not Poetical, but writ in Verſe, and adorn'd with Fables and Allegories; as, the <hi>Georgicks</hi> of <hi>Virgil, Lucan</hi>'s <hi>Pharſalia, the Punick War of Silius Italicus,</hi> and the like. The truth on't is, theſe Fables and Allegories are not ſufficient for an <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and its main Action, that ought to be a <hi>Fable;</hi> ſo that we do not take the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks</hi> or the <hi>Pharſalia</hi> to be an <hi>Epopéa;</hi> but yet this ſhould not hinder us from thinking them to be true Poems for all that.</p>
                  <p>But if a Man writes an <hi>Epopéa</hi> in Proſe, would it be an <hi>Epick Poem?</hi> No, I think not; for a Poem is a <hi>Diſcourſe in Verſe.</hi> But yet this would not hinder its being an <hi>Epopéa;</hi> juſt as a <hi>Tragedy</hi> in Proſe is ſtill a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> though it be not a <hi>Tragick Poem.</hi> They who have queſtion'd whether the <hi>Latin Comedy</hi> were a <hi>Poem</hi> or no, never doubted but it was a <hi>Comedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſaid leſs upon ſuch trite Matters, but that I was aſham'd to take no notice at all what a <hi>Poem</hi> or a <hi>Verſe</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to treat ſo largely about the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>

                     <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>The Fable is the principal Part of the Poem, and that 'tis as it were the very Soul of it.</hi> Therefore we muſt look for the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> in that of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and conſider <hi>That</hi> as the chief Foundation of the Poem, as the Principle that gives Life and Motion to all its parts, and ſets all its Faculties on work. We have indeed begun to define the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péa</hi> by the Definition we gave of the <hi>Fable;</hi> for the <hi>Fable</hi> is a Diſcourſe invented to form Mens Manners by Inſtructions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd under the Allegories of one ſingle Action.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fables,</hi> which one may treat after very different ways. The <hi>Poet</hi> forms his from that which is moſt excellent in each of theſe ſorts.</p>
                  <p>There are reckon'd three ſorts of <hi>Fables.</hi> The firſt fall under the Names of Men and Gods, and are call'd <hi>Rational;</hi> the ſecond are only compriſed under the Names of Beaſts, and derive their Name of <hi>Moratoe</hi> from the humane Manners, which are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them; and the laſt are a Mixture of theſe two ſorts of Perſonages, and are call'd <hi>Mix'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epick Fables</hi> are <hi>Rational.</hi> Nor do I think that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>Homer</hi> has taken of making a Horſe ſpeak only once in his <hi>Iliad,</hi> ought to make this <hi>Fable</hi> be counted a <hi>mix'd</hi> one. I ſhould rather reckon this incident among the <hi>Machines</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;</hi> as we read in the <hi>Roman Hiſtory</hi> it ſometimes happen'd, and as we know it did in <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Aſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'twas ſuch a common thing in thoſe times to make uſe of theſe ſorts of <hi>Fables,</hi> and to bring in brute Beaſts, and even Trees ſpeaking: and this Cuſtom was ſo generally look'd upon as Mark of Learning, a Genius, and Eloquence; that had <hi>Homer</hi> us'd it oftner, I do not ſee how any one could blame this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> for any Irregularity. But in ſhort, this Cuſtom of making Beaſts ſpeak is ſo little reliſh'd by theſe laſt Ages, that even <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's</hi> Example would not make it excuſable in any of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers.</p>
                  <p>However 'tis, this inconſiderable Incident, which does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but the <hi>Epick Fable</hi> may be reckon'd among the <hi>Rational</hi> ones, will not hinder it from being plac'd among the <hi>Probable</hi> ones; though this Qualification be not at all neceſſary for the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in general.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53904:28"/>
In fine, the Action of a <hi>Fable</hi> may be ſerious, great, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, or familiar, low, and vulgar. It may be either perfect or defective; writ in Verſe or Proſe; ſwell'd to a large Diſcourſe, or expreſs'd in a few Words; recited by the Author, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Perſons who are the ſole Actors in it. And all theſe different ways make no Alteration in the Eſſence, and in the Nature of the <hi>Fable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Excepting the Repreſentation, which the <hi>Epick Poet</hi> leaves the Stage to be Maſter of, he takes always the moſt excellent, and the moſt noble Method. So that the <hi>Epick Action</hi> is grave, important, compleat, and rehearſed in a long train of Verſes.</p>
                  <p>One may add to this, that there are ſome <hi>Fables</hi> which conſiſt leſs in Action than in Speaking; as that <hi>Fable,</hi> for inſtance, which ridicules the fooliſh Vanity of thoſe Men, who attribute all the Glory of an Event to themſelves, for the producing of which they contributed nothing but their own unprofitable Preſence. The <hi>Fable</hi> repreſents them under the Allegory of a <hi>Fly,</hi> which lighting upon a Chariot, and ſeeing her ſelf in the midſt of a Cloud of Duſt, which the Chariot-Wheels and the Horſe-Feet rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Air, cries out; <hi>O Gemini! What a Duſt do I make?</hi> The <hi>Epick</hi> is not of this ſort of <hi>Fables,</hi> but of thoſe which imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate an Action.</p>
                  <p>Theſe then are the Differences which ſpecifie the <hi>Epick Fable,</hi> and diſtinguiſh it from all others. It is <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Probable;</hi> it imitates an Action that is compleat and important; it is long and rehears'd in Verſe; but neither of theſe Properties change its <hi>Nature,</hi> nor make it leſs a <hi>Fable,</hi> than thoſe which are publiſh'd in <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Name.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Sorts and Differences of the <hi>Epick Fable,</hi> now for its Parts.</p>

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Fable</hi> is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſeveral Things. And in truth two Things do compoſe it, which are as it were its two eſſential Parts. The one is <hi>Truth,</hi> which ſerves as a Foundation to it; and the other is <hi>Fiction,</hi> which Allegorically diſguiſes this <hi>Truth,</hi> and gives it the <hi>Form of a Fable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Truth</hi> lies conceal'd; and is that piece of <hi>Morality</hi> the Poet would teach us. The <hi>Romans</hi> made uſe of this very Expreſſion, when they ſaid to <note n="†" place="margin">Vel qui Praetextas, vel qui docuere Togatas. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Teach Fables</hi> and <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> inſtead of ſaying to <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> them. The <hi>Fiction</hi> is the Action or the Words, whereby theſe Inſtruction are veil'd. In the Inſtance we juſt now propos'd, the <hi>Truth</hi> is this, that it is ridiculous to brag of any thing we have no hand in: and the <hi>Fiction</hi> is that pleaſant Thought of a Fly riding upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53904:28"/>
a Chariot, and crying, <hi>Bleſs me! what a Duſt do I make?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Truth</hi> lies under no Difficulty here, ſince the <hi>Moral</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ought always to be true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But ſuppoſe the imitated Action be taken out of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> would this paſs for a <hi>Fiction?</hi> The Difficulty is the ſame, if it be taken from a <hi>Fable</hi> that is already known, ſince after this manner, the Poet would at little invent and feign it, as if he had found it in <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> And yet if the Author feigns nothing, we may well diſpute with him the Name of Poet.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, that the Poet ought to feign one General Action; then he ſhould look for the Names of ſome Perſons (to whom a parallel Action has either truly or probably happen'd) in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or ſome well-known <hi>Fables:</hi> And laſtly, he ought to place his Action under theſe Names. Thus it will be really feign'd and invented by the Author, and yet will ſeem to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of ſome very ancient <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Fable.</hi> This we ſhall explain by what follows: we will begin to do ſo by the Inſtance of a <hi>Fable</hi> compos'd after this Method.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt thing we are to begin with for Compoſing a <hi>Fable,</hi> is to chuſe the Inſtruction, and the point of Morality, which is to ſerve as its Foundation, according to the Deſign and End we propoſe to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>I would, for Inſtance, exhort two Brothers, or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who hold an Eſtate in Common, to agree well together, the better to preſerve it: And this is the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and the firſt thing I thought on.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe I endeavour to imprint upon their Minds this Maxim; <hi>That a Miſunderſtanding between Friends is the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of Families, and of all ſorts of Societies.</hi> This Maxim which I make choice of, is the Point of Morality, and the <hi>Truth</hi> which ſerves as a Foundation to the <hi>Fable</hi> I would compoſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place this <hi>Moral Truth</hi> muſt be reduc'd into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a general Action muſt be feign'd in Imitation of the true and ſingular Actions of thoſe who have been ruin'd by a Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that has happen'd among them. I ſay then, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons were engaged together to look after an Eſtate, which they hold in Common. They fall out with one another, and this Difference leaves them defenceleſs to the Will of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who ruins them.</p>

This is the firſt <hi>Platform</hi> of a <hi>Fable.</hi> The Action, which this Recital preſents us with, has four Qualifications: it is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> it is <hi>Imitated,</hi> it is <hi>Feign'd,</hi> and it contains <hi>Allegorically, a Moral Truth.</hi> This <hi>Model</hi> then comprehends the two Eſſential Parts which compoſe the <hi>Fable, viz.</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Fiction.</hi> All this is common to all ſorts of <hi>Fables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Names that are given to the Perſonages do firſt ſpecifie a <hi>Fable. Aeſop</hi> gives them the Names of Beaſts. <q>Once upon a time (ſays he) two Dogs were ſet to keep a Flock of Sheep, they fight with one another, and leave the Sheep without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Mercy of the Wolf, that commits what Ravage he pleaſes among them.</q> Theſe Names are the meaneſt of any. The <hi>Action</hi> is ſtill <hi>General,</hi> and the <hi>Fiction</hi> is altogether apparent.</p>
                  <p>We may diſguiſe the <hi>Fiction,</hi> render the Action more ſingular, and make it a <hi>Rational Fable</hi> by the Names of Men invented at Pleaſure. <q>
                        <hi>Pridamant</hi> and <hi>Orontes,</hi> two Brothers by a ſecond Marriage, were left very rich by their Father's laſt Will and Teſtament. They could not agree in ſharing their Eſtates, and were ſo obſtinately bent one againſt the other, that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their common Intereſt againſt <hi>Clitander</hi> (their elder Brother by a former Marriage) was the very leaſt of their care. He very dextrouſly foments their Quarrel, and keeps them from minding the Deſign he has upon them, by pretending he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing but a ſmall Gratuity by the Accommodations, which he daily propoſes, but never urges home to them. In the mean time he gains upon the Judges, and all others, who were intruſted with this Affair; he procures the Will to be cancell'd, and becomes Maſter of all that Eſtate he pretended he would have gratified his Brothers with, though to his own prejudice.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>In the War King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair had with the <hi>Flemings</hi> in the Year 1302, he ſent out his Army under the Command of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Artois</hi> his General, and <hi>Ralph</hi> of <hi>Neſle</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.

This Precipitation, and the Duſt they rais'd, hinder'd them from diſcovering a large and deep River, beyond which the <hi>Flemings</hi> were poſted. The French were miſerably caſt away in the Torrent. At this Loſs the Infantry were ſo ſtartled, that they ſuffer'd themſelves to be cut in pieces by the Enemy.</q>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> at the bottom, is nothing elſe but that which I juſt now propos'd. I will treat of it here at large, becauſe I cannot give you a greater light into this Doctrine, than by the Practice of <hi>Homer.</hi> 'Tis the moſt exact Model of the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and the moſt uſeful Abridgment of all the Precepts of this Art;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53904:30"/>
ſince in truth, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf has extracted them out of the Works of this great Poet.</p>
                  <p>In every thing which a Man undertakes with Deſign, the <hi>End</hi> he propoſes to himſelf is always the firſt thing which occurs in his Mind, and upon which he grounds the whole Work, and all its parts. Thus, ſince the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> was invented to form the Manners of Men, 'tis by this firſt View the Poet ought to begin.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>School-men</hi> treat of Vertues and Vices in general. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they give are proper for all ſorts of People, and for all Ages. But the Poet has a nearer Regard to his own Country, and the Neceſſities he ſees his own Nation lie under. 'Tis upon this account that he makes choice of ſome piece of Morality, the moſt proper and fitteſt he can imagine: and in order to preſs this home, he makes leſs uſe of Reaſoning, than of the force of Inſinuation; accommodating himſelf to the particular Cuſtoms and Inclinations of his Audience, and to thoſe which in the general ought to be commended in them. Let us now ſee how <hi>Homer</hi> has acquitted himſelf in all theſe Reſpects.</p>
                  <p>He ſaw the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for whom he deſign'd his Poem, were divided into as many States as they had Capital Cities. Each was a Body Politick, and had its Form of Government independent from all the reſt. And yet theſe diſtinct States were very often oblig'd to unite together in one Body againſt their common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And here we have two very different ſorts of Government, ſuch as cannot be very well comprehended in one Body of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and in one ſingle Poem.</p>
                  <p>The Poet then has made two diſtinct <hi>Fables</hi> of them. The <hi>One</hi> is for all <hi>Greece</hi> united into one Body, but compos'd of Parts independent on one another, as they in truth were: and the <hi>Other</hi> is for each particular State, conſider'd as they were in time of Peace, without the former Circumſtances, and the neceſſity of being united.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt ſort of Government obſervable in the Union or rather in the Aſſembling of many Independent States: Experience has always made it appear, <q>That there is nothing like a due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and a right Underſtanding between Perſons to make the Deſigns that are form'd and carried on by ſeveral Generals to proſper. And on the other hand, an univerſal Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Ambition of a General, and the Under-Officers refuſing to ſubmit, have always been the infallible and inevitable Bane of theſe Confederacies.</q> All ſorts of States, and in particular the <hi>Grecians,</hi> have dearly experienc'd this Truth. So that the moſt uſeful and the moſt neceſſary Inſtructions that could be given them, was, to lay before their Eyes the Loſs which both the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Princes themſelves ſuffer'd by the Ambition and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of theſe laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53904:30"/>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> then has taken for the Foundation of his <hi>Fable</hi> this great <hi>Truth;</hi> viz. <hi>That a Miſunderſtanding between Princes is the Ruin of their own States.</hi> 
                     <q>I ſing (ſays he) the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo pernicious to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the Cauſe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heroes Deaths, occaſion'd by the Diſcord and Parting of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and this Prince.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that this <hi>Truth</hi> may be compleatly and fully known, there is need of a ſecond to back it. For it may be queſtion'd, whether the ill Conſequences which ſucceed a Quarrel were cauſed by that Quarrel; and whether a right Underſtanding does re-adjuſt thoſe Affairs which Diſcord has put out of Order: that is to ſay, theſe Aſſembled States muſt be repreſented firſt as labouring under a Miſunderſtanding, and the ill Conſequences thereof; and then as United and Victorious.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee how he has diſpos'd of theſe Things in one General Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Several Princes, independant on one another, were united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Common Enemy. He, whom they had Elected their <hi>General,</hi> offers an Affront to the moſt Valiant of all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates. This offended Prince was ſo far provok'd, that he withdrew himſelf, and obſtinately refuſed to fight for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe. This Miſunderſtanding gives the Enemy ſo much Advantage, that the Confederates are very near quitting their Deſign very diſhonourably. He himſelf who is withdrawn is not exempt from ſharing in the Misfortunes he brought upon his Allies. For having permitted his intimate Friend to ſuccour them in a great Neceſſity, this Friend is kill'd by the Enemies <hi>General.</hi> Thus being both made wiſer at their own Coſt, are reconcil'd. And then this Valiant Prince gets the Victory, and revenges his own Wrongs by killing with his own hands him who had been the Death of his Friend.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt <hi>Platform</hi> of the Poem, and the <hi>Fiction,</hi> which reduces into one important and univerſal Action, all the Particulars upon which it turns.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it muſt be render'd <hi>Probable</hi> by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Times, Places,</hi> and <hi>Perſons;</hi> that is to ſay, If we would come up to the Precepts of our Maſters, we muſt ſeek for ſome Perſons already known by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or other ways, by whom we may with Probability repreſent the Perſonages of this <hi>Fable. Homer</hi> has made choice of <hi>the Siege of Troy,</hi> and feign'd that this Action happen'd there. He has given the Name of <hi>Achilles</hi> to a valiant and angry Phantom; that of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to his General, that of <hi>Hector</hi> to the Enemies Commander, and others to the reſt, as is to be ſeen in his Poem.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, he was oblig'd to accommodate himſelf to the Manners, Cuſtoms, and Genius of the <hi>Greeks</hi> his Auditors, the better to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53904:31"/>
make them attend to the Inſtruction of his Poem, and to gain their Approbation by praiſing them, as far as the Faults he muſt of neceſſity make his Perſonages fall into, would admit. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably diſcharges all the Duties, by making theſe Brave Princes, and thoſe Victorious People, to be <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the Fathers of thoſe he had a Mind to Commend.</p>
                  <p>But in that Length and Extent which is given to theſe <hi>Fables,</hi> if we would not ſtuff up the reſt with uſeleſs Ornaments and foreign Incidents, we muſt do ſomething elſe beſides propoſing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal point of Morality that is made uſe of. We muſt extend this Moral by its neceſſary Conſequences: as for inſtance, in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us, 'tis not enough to know, that a good Underſtanding ought always to be maintain'd among Confederates: 'tis likewiſe very material to know, that if there happens any Diviſion, great Care is to be taken, that it be kept from the Enemies Knowledge, that ſo they being ignorant of this Advantage, may not venture to make uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, when this Concord is but counterfeit, and only in appearance, one ſhould never preſs the Enemy too cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor oblige them to make uſe of all their Forces: for this would diſcover the Weakneſs that ought to be concealed from them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Patroclus</hi> does even to Admiration furniſh us with theſe two Inſtructions. For when he appear'd in the Arms of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who took him for <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelf, now reconciled and re-united to the Confederates, gave ground, and quitted the Advantages they had over the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> who ſhould have been contented with this Succeſs, preſſes upon <hi>Hector</hi> too boldly, and by obliging him to fight, diſcovers that it was not the true <hi>Achilles</hi> that was clad in his Armour, but a much more feeble Hero. So that <hi>Hector</hi> kills him, and re-gains the Advantages which the <hi>Trojans</hi> had loſt upon the Conceit that <hi>Achilles</hi> was reconcil'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis by ſuch ſort of <hi>Fictions</hi> that this great Poet has fill'd his Poem with Inſtructions ſo excellent for their Deſign, and whereby he has merited thoſe Praiſes which <hi>Ariſtotle, Horace,</hi> and all the <hi>Ancients</hi> have beſtow'd upon him.</p>

                  <p>THE better to make it appear that an <hi>Epopéa</hi> is a true <hi>Fable;</hi> and that this Term we give it is not Metaphorical or Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but Proper and Natural; and that the Senſe is the ſame, as when we give the Name of <hi>Fables</hi> to the <hi>Fictions</hi> of <hi>Aeſop:</hi> I ſhall here draw a Parallel between the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and that of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> which I have already mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then I ſay, that the <hi>Moral Truth</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction</hi> is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the ſame in both. <hi>Aeſop</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> would have us learn, <hi>that a miſunderſtanding between thoſe of the ſame Party, expoſes them to the Inſults of their Enemies, and their own Ruin: and that Concord preſerves and renders them Victorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fiction</hi> is likewiſe the ſame. Both have feign'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of ſeveral Perſons together, for the Maintenance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Intereſt againſt the Common Enemy. Again, both have feign'd ſome diſturbance that happen'd at firſt in this Union; and that thoſe who quarrell'd met with an equal ſhare of misfortune. Laſtly, both have reſtor'd to the Party of theſe United Perſons, the Concord and Victory which was the conſequence of their Re-union.</p>
                  <p>There's nothing remains now but to give Names to thoſe feign'd Perſons. As for the Nature of the <hi>Fable,</hi> it matters little whether the Names of <hi>Beaſts</hi> or of <hi>Men</hi> be made uſe of. <hi>Homer</hi> has made choice of theſe laſt; and has given the Quality of Kings to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages. He has call'd them <hi>Achilles, Agamemnon, Hector, Patroclus,</hi> and has expreſſed by the name of <hi>Grecians,</hi> that Intereſt which the Confederates were obliged to maintain. <hi>Aeſop</hi> in his way, has given the Names of <hi>Beaſts</hi> to all his Perſonages: The <hi>Dogs</hi> are the Confederates, the <hi>Wolf</hi> is their Enemy, and he has called the <hi>Sheep,</hi> what the Poet has term'd the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> has ſtretch'd out his <hi>Fable</hi> by long Harangues, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, by Similitudes, and by particular Actions: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, might one amplify that of <hi>Aeſop</hi> without ſpoiling it.

                  <p>One ſhould not likewiſe omit the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of theſe <hi>Heroes.</hi> The <hi>Wolf</hi> ſhould boaſt of his Deſcent from <hi>Lycaon;</hi> and one of the <hi>Dogs</hi> ſhould have iſſu'd in a direct line from the great <hi>Celeſtial Dog,</hi> and the <hi>Canicula.</hi> This ſhould be the <hi>Hero</hi> of the Poem, for he would be very hot and Cholerick. He would do well to repreſent the Perſonage of <hi>Achilles;</hi> and the Folly of a certain <hi>Ajax</hi> his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would be a handſom Proof of this Nobility, and of an Origin ſo Divine as that is.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Odyſſëis</hi> was not deſign'd as the <hi>Iliad,</hi> to inſtruct all the States of <hi>Greece</hi> join'd and confederated in one Body, but for each State in particular. A State is compos'd of two parts; The <hi>Head</hi> which commands is the firſt, and the <hi>Members</hi> which obey make up the other. There are Inſtructions requiſite for the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> and ſome likewiſe neceſſary for the <hi>Subjects:</hi> for him to rule well, and for them to be rul'd by him.</p>
                  <p>There are two Vertues neceſſary to one in Authority; <hi>Prudence</hi> to order, and <hi>Care</hi> to put in Execution the Orders he has given. The <hi>Prudence</hi> of a <hi>Politician</hi> is not acquir'd but by a long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all ſorts of Buſineſs, and by an Acquaintance with all the different Forms of Governments and States. The <hi>Care</hi> of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſuffers not him that has order'd it, to rely upon others, but it requires his own Preſence; and Kings who are abſent from their States are in danger of loſing them, and give way to great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Points might be eaſily united in one and the ſame Man. <note n="*" place="margin">Dic mihi Muſa virum captae poſt tempora Trojae, Qui Mores hominum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum vidit &amp; urbes. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>A King abſent from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom viſits the Courts of ſeveral Princes, where he learns the Cuſtoms of different Nations. From hence there naturally ariſes a vaſt number of Incidents, of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and of Paſſages, that are very uſeful for a Political Inſtruction: And on the other ſide, this abſence gives way to the diſorders which happen in his own Kingdom, and which end not till his return, whoſe ſole Preſence can re-eſtabliſh all things.</q> Thus the <hi>Abſence</hi> of a King is the ſame, and has the ſame effect in this <hi>Fable,</hi> as the <hi>Diviſion</hi> had in the former.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subjects</hi> have ſcarce any need but of one general Maxim, which is <hi>to ſuffer themſelves to be govern'd by, and to obey faithfully ſome Reaſon or other which ſeems to them contrary to the Orders they have received.</hi> It were eaſie to join this to what we have already ſaid, by beſtowing on this Wiſe and Induſtrious Prince ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as in his abſence would obey, not the Orders they receiv'd, but what appear'd to them more reaſonable: And by demonſtrating
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53904:33"/>
from the Misfortunes this Diſobedience draws upon them, the Evil Conſequences which almoſt infallibly attend theſe particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, which are diſtinct from the general Notion of him who ought to Govern.</p>
                  <p>But as 'tis neceſſary that the Princes in the * <hi>Iliad</hi> ſhould be Cholerick and Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: <note n="†" place="margin">Ira quidem commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter urit utrumque. <hi>Hor.</hi>
                     </note> So 'tis neceſſary in the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> that the chief Perſonage ſhould be. Sage, and Prudent. This raiſes a difficulty in the <hi>Fiction;</hi> becauſe this Perſonage ought to be abſent for the two reaſons aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, which are Eſſential to the <hi>Fable;</hi> and which conſtitute the principal part thereof: But he cannot be abſent from his own home without offending againſt another Maxim of equal importance; <hi>viz. That a King ſhould never leave his own Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, there are ſometimes ſuch neceſſities as ſufficiently excuſe the <hi>Prudence</hi> of a <hi>Politician:</hi> But ſuch a neceſſity is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enough to ſupply matter for another Poem, and this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the Action would have been Vicious. To prevent this, firſt this neceſſity and the departure of the <hi>Hero</hi> muſt be disjoin'd from the Poem: And in the ſecond place, the <hi>Hero</hi> having been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to abſent himſelf for a Reaſon antecedent to the Action, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the <hi>Fable;</hi> he ought not to embrace this opportunity of inſtructing himſelf, and ſo abſent himſelf voluntarily from his own Government. For at this rate, his abſence would have been ſtill vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and one might with reaſon lay to his Charge, the diſorders which might have happen'd thereon.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the conſtitution of the <hi>Fable,</hi> the Poet ought not to take for his Action, and for the Foundation of his Poem, the Departure of a Prince from his own Country, nor his voluntary ſtay in any other Place; but his <hi>Return,</hi> and this Return hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd againſt his Will. This is the firſt Idea the Poet gives us of it. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>. Calyſſ. 5.</note> His <hi>Hero</hi> appears at firſt in a deſolate Iſland, ſitting upon the ſide of the Sea, which with Tears in his Eyes he looks upon as the obſtacle, that had hinder's him ſo long from returning home, and viſiting his own dear Country.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, ſince this forc'd delay has ſomething in it that is moſt Natural and uſual to ſuch as make Voyages by Sea: <hi>Homer</hi> has judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly made choice of a Prince whoſe Kingdom was in an Iſland.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then how he has feign'd all this Action, allowing his <hi>Hero</hi> a great many Years, becauſe he ſtood in need of ſo many to inſtruct himſelf in Prudence and Policy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>A Prince had been oblig'd to forſake his Native Country, and to head an Army of his Subjects in a Foreign Expedition. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gloriouſly perform'd this Enterprize, he was for marching
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53904:33"/>
home again, and thither would have conducted his Subjects. But ſpite of all the attempts, which his eagerneſs to return home again put him upon, There are Tempeſts which ſtop him by the way for ſeveral Years together, and caſt him upon ſeveral Countries very different from one another as to their Manners and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the dangers he was in, his Companions, not always following his Orders, periſh'd through their own fault. The Grandees of his Country do very ſtrangely abuſe his abſence, and raiſe no ſmall diſorders at home. They conſume his Eſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to make away with his Son, would conſtrain his Queen to choſe one of them for her Husband, and indulge themſelves in all theſe Violences ſo much the more, becauſe they were perſwaded he would never return. But at laſt he returns, and diſcovering himſelf to his Son and ſome others, who had continu'd Loyal to him, he is an Eye-witneſs of the Inſolence of his Enemies, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them according to their deſerts, and reſtores to his Iſland that Tranquility and Repoſe, which they had been ſtrangers to during his abſence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Truth,</hi> which ſerves as a Foundation to this <hi>Fiction,</hi> and which with it makes the <hi>Fable, is, That the abſence of a Perſon from his own Home, or who has not an Eye to what is done there, is the cauſe of great diſorders:</hi> So the principal Action, and the moſt Eſſential one, is the <hi>abſence of the Hero.</hi> This fills almoſt all the Poem: For not only this bodily abſence laſted ſeveral Years, but even when the <hi>Hero</hi> return'd, he does not diſcover himſelf; and this prudent diſguiſe, from whence he reap'd ſo much advantage, has the ſame effect upon the Authors of the Diſorders, and all others who knew him not, as his real abſence had; ſo that he is abſent as to them, till the very moment he puniſh'd them.</p>
                  <p>After the Poet had thus compos'd his <hi>Fable,</hi> and join'd the <hi>Fiction</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> he then makes choice of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> the King of the Iſle of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> to maintain the Character of his chief Perſonage, and beſtow'd the reſt upon <hi>Telemachus, Penelope, Antinous,</hi> and others, whom he calls by what names he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here inſiſt upon the many excellent Advices, which are as ſo many parts, and natural Conſequences of the Fundamental Truth; and which the Poet very dexterouſly lays down in thoſe Fictions, which are the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> and Members of the entire Action, ſuch for inſtance are theſe Advices: <hi>Not to intrude ones ſelf into the Myſteries of Government, which the Prince keeps ſecret to himſelf,</hi> This is repreſented to us by the Winds ſhut up in a Bull-hide, which the miſerable Companions of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> muſt needs be ſo fooliſh as to pry into: <hi>Not to ſuffer ones ſelf to be lead away by the ſeeming Charms of an idle and lazy life,</hi> to which the <note n="*" place="margin">Improba Siren deſidia. <hi>Hor.</hi>

                  <p>This Poem is more uſeful to the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> than the <hi>Iliad</hi> is, where the Subjects ſuffer rather by the ill Conduct of their Princes, than through their own fault. But in the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> 'tis not the Fault of <hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN the <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> we are not to expect that <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> eſteem'd ſo Divine in <hi>Homer.</hi> But tho' the Fortune of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> envied the Poet this Glory, yet the vaſt extent of the Matter it furniſhes him with, ſtarts up ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as require more Spirit and Conduct, and has put us upon ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is ſomething in the <hi>Aeneid</hi> more Noble than in the <hi>Iliad</hi> Theſe very difficulties we are to ſolve, and they call upon us for our utmoſt care and attention.</p>
                  <p>There was a great deal of difference between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> Theſe laſt were under no obligation, as were the former, either of living in ſeparated and independent States; or of frequent confederating together againſt the common Enemy. If in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, we would compare our two Poets together, <hi>Virgil</hi> had but one Poem to make, and this ought to be more like the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> than the <hi>Iliad,</hi> ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> State was govern'd by only one Prince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53904:34"/>
But (without mentioning the Inconveniences the <hi>Latin Poet</hi> might meet with in forming a <hi>Fable</hi> upon the ſame Foundation, which the <hi>Greek</hi> had laid before him) the <hi>Roman</hi> State furniſh'd him with Matter different enough to help him to avoid treading in the footſteps of him that went before him, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to him the glory of a primary invention. <hi>Homer</hi> in the <hi>Ody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeïs</hi> ſpoke only for States already eſtabliſh'd, and the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was but of a new date. It was the change of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> (to which <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Subjects had been always extreamly biggoted) into a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which till then they could never endure. Thus, the Inſtructions, which the Poet ought to give both to Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were quite different from thoſe <hi>Homer</hi> left his Countrymen.</p>
                  <p>He ought to inſtruct <hi>Auguſtus</hi> as the Founder of a great Empire, and to inſpire into him as well as his Succeſſors, the ſame Spirit and Conduct which had rais'd this <hi>Empire</hi> to ſuch a Grandeur. A very expert <hi>Roman,</hi> and a great <hi>Politician</hi> (no leſs than <note n="*" place="margin">Eventus bellorum erant aut mites, aut neceſſarii, &amp;c. <hi>Cic. 2. de offic.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf) informs us, <q>That good Humour and Humanity was ſo far Eſſential to this State, that it was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant even in the very midſt of War; and that nothing but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity could put a ſtop to its good effects.</q> And he adds, <q>That when this Conduct was loſt, and this Genius, which gave life to the State, was gone, there was nothing left but bare Walls, and what in propriety of Speech might be term'd a dead Carcaſe.</q> In ſhort, he ſhews the Advantages which a mild and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Government has over a cruel and ſevere Conduct, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires Men with nothing but a ſlaviſh fear.</p>
                  <p>This then is the Inſtruction <hi>Virgil</hi> would give the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> who began in the Perſon of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to be ſettled upon the Throne. This Inſtruction has two parts, as each of <hi>Homer</hi>'s had. The firſt comprehends the Misfortunes which attend a Tyrannical and Violent Reign: And the ſecond the Happineſs, which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a mild Government. <hi>Homer</hi> has plac'd both the parts of each <hi>Fable</hi> in one and the ſame Perſon, <hi>Achilles</hi> at firſt is at variance with the Confederates, and afterwards is reconcil'd to them: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is abſent from home, and at laſt returns thither: and in all this there is nothing of difficulty. But <hi>Virgil</hi> could not repreſent in one and the ſame Perſon, a <hi>Hero,</hi> who by his Violence and Impiety was the Ruin of his Country; and who afterwards by his Piety and Juſtice, reſtor'd it to its former Glory. This inequality of Manners and Conduct would have been intolerable, and eſpecially in that Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which the Recital of an <hi>Epick Poem</hi> requires; beſides, ſuch a ſudden change is never to be rely'd on; Men would think it Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, and fear a very quick return of the old Tyranny. The Poet then is oblig'd to make uſe of two different Perſonages, to maintain the two parts of his exemplary inſtruction.</p>

Beſides, ſeveral weighty Reaſons did indiſpenſibly oblige him to put Humanity and Good-Nature in the Manners of his <hi>Hero,</hi> and to make <hi>Piety</hi> his predominant Quality, and the very Soul of all his Vertues. One of theſe great Reaſons is the deſire and neceſſity he lay under of pleaſing his chief Auditor, who alone was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than all the reſt. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> did nothing to ſettle himſelf upon the Throne, but what his <hi>Piety</hi> put him upon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; or at leaſt he had a mind the World ſhould think ſo. This is the Judgment which the moſt Prudent paſt upon him, even after he was dead, when he was no longer the ſubject of Mens Flatteries, or their Fear.

                     <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> informs us of.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons why the Poet ſpoke thus of the new Eſtabliſhment, were owing to the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who made up the other part of the Audience; and the ſecond Object of his Morality. He was oblig'd to make them lay aſide the old Antipathy they had to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to convince them of the Juſtice, and the legal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> to divert them from ſo much deſiring to oppoſe his deſigns, and to raiſe in them a Love and Veneration for this Prince.</p>
                  <p>Religion has always had a moſt powerful influence over the minds of the Vulgar. The firſt <hi>Roman Kings,</hi> and the new <hi>Emperors,</hi> made uſe thereof, by joyning the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> to the <hi>Regal</hi> Office. The Poet likewiſe us'd his utmoſt care in ſearching for all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he could derive from thence, by making it the chief Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his whole deſign. He makes it appear, <q>That the great Revolutions, which happen in States, are brought about by the appointment and will of God: That thoſe who oppoſe them are Impious, and have been puniſh'd according to their Demerits, For Heaven never fails to protect the Heroes it makes choice of, to carry on and execute its great deſigns.</q> This <hi>Maxim</hi> ſerves for the Foundation of the <hi>Aeneid;</hi> and is that firſt part of the <hi>Fable</hi> which we call the <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Poet was oblig'd to repreſent his <hi>Hero</hi> free from all manner of Violence, and elected King by brave and generous People, who thought it an Honour to obey him, tho' they might lawfully have been their own Soveraigns, and have choſen what form of Government they pleas'd. In ſhort it was requiſite that the Juſtice of his Cauſe, like that of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhould have been grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Rights of War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, the <hi>Hero</hi> ſhould have been like <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> a <hi>New Monarch, the Founder of an Empire, a Lawgiver, a Pontifex, and a great Commander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:53904:35"/>
The neceſſity of reducing all theſe things into one Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Allegories of a ſingle Action, makes it appear how great a difference there is between the deſigns of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that of <hi>Virgil:</hi> And that if the <hi>Latin Poet</hi> did imitate the <hi>Greek,</hi> yet the applicaaion of it is ſo remote and difficult, that it ſhould never make his Poem paſs for a new Copy, nor rob him of the glory of the invention.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee then the Collection which <hi>Virgil</hi> has made of all theſe Matters; and the general <hi>Fiction,</hi> which together with the <hi>Truths</hi> it diſguiſes, makes up the <hi>Fable</hi> and Life of the Poem.</p>

                     <q>The Gods preſerve a Prince amidſt the Ruin of a mighty State, and make choice of him to be the maintainer of their Religion, and the Eſtabliſher of a more great and glorious Empire than the firſt. This very <hi>Hero</hi> is likewiſe elected King by the general conſent of thoſe, who had eſcap'd the univerſal Wrack of that Kingdom. He conducts them through Territories from whence his Anceſtors came, and by the way inſtructed himſelf in all that was neceſſary for a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and the <hi>Founder of a Monarchy.</hi> He arrives and likewiſe finds in this new Country, the Gods and Men diſpos'd to entertain him, and to allow him Subjects and Territories. But a neighbouring Prince, blinded by Ambition and Jealouſie, could not ſee the Juſtice and the Orders of Heaven, but oppoſes his Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and is aſſiſted by the Valour of a King, whoſe Cruelty and Impiety had diveſted him of his States.

                  <p>The model being thus fram'd, there was nothing wanting but to look into <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or into ſome Authentick <hi>Fables,</hi> for <hi>Hero's</hi> whoſe Names he might borrow, and whom he might engage to repreſent his Perſonages. The obligation he lay under of accommodating himſelf to the Manners and Religion of his Country, invited him to look after them in the <hi>Roman Hiſtory.</hi> But what Action could he take thence, which might furniſh him with a Revolution and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Government, that was proper to his purpoſe? <hi>Brutus</hi> had expelled the Kings, and placed the People in that which they then called <hi>their Liberty:</hi> But this Name was Odious and Prejudicial to <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and this Action was quite oppoſite to the Deſign which the Poet had of confirming the Re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>Monarchy. Romulus</hi> firſt founded <hi>Rome,</hi> but he laid the Walls thereof in his Brother's Blood; and his firſt Action was the Murder of his Uncle <hi>Amulius,</hi> for which none could ever find a ſatisfactory excuſe: And then, it was very difficult to ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Heroes</hi> to have taken Voyages.</p>

Beſides, theſe two Eſtabliſhments were made before the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the States which preceded them, and were the cauſe of their ruin. The Kingdom of <hi>Alba</hi> flouriſh'd during the Reign of the two firſt <hi>Roman Kings,</hi> but was eraſed by the Third: And <hi>Monarchy</hi> was extirpated by <hi>Brutus,</hi> and his Succeſſors in the <hi>Conſul-ſhip.</hi> It was of dangerous Conſequence, to inſtil this Notion into the Subjects of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and to put the People upon thinking, that this Prince had ruined the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and baniſhed their <hi>Liberty.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> furniſhed him with a thought more favourable to his deſign; ſince in reality <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> do both inform us, <q>That before this Prince made the leaſt ſhew of what he was about to do, there was no <hi>Commonwealth</hi> in being. All the vigour of the <hi>Empire</hi> was ſpent, the Laws were invalid, the <hi>Romans</hi> were nothing elſe but the Dregs of a State; and in ſhort, there was nothing left of <hi>Rome</hi> but bare Walls, which were not able to laſt much longer.</q> Thus <hi>Auguſtus</hi> deſtroyed nothing, he only re-eſtabliſhed a tottering State.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Roman Hiſtory, Virgil</hi> did not meet with a Prince, who could with any probability keep up the Character of his chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage; he was obliged to look out for one ſome where elſe. <hi>Homer</hi> had this Advantage, that the <hi>Heroes</hi> of his <hi>Fables</hi> were <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that his own Country was the Theatre whereon moſt of the Fabulous Actions were tranſacted: So that he had liberty enough to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the Manners and Religion of thoſe for whom he wrote.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> of the <hi>Latin Poet</hi> helped him to that which <hi>Fortune</hi> denied him.

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Horace'<hi>s Thoughts of the</hi> Epick Fable.</head>
                  <p>'TIS time now to join <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and to ſee whether the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of our two <hi>Maſters</hi> about the <hi>Nature of the Epick Fable</hi> agree with the <hi>Practice</hi> of our two <hi>Poets.</hi> We will begin with <hi>Horace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Word <hi>Fable</hi> there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it; he gives it to the <note n="*" place="margin">Neve minor quinto, neu fit productior actu Fabula. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dramatick,</hi> he gives it to the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> and in plain Terms calls the <note n="†" place="margin">Fabula quae Paridis nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur propter amorem Graecia Barbariae lento colliſa ducllo. <hi>Epiſt. ad Loll.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ilida a Fable.</hi> The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to know what he means by this Word, and what in his Opinion the <hi>Epick Fable is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be granted that this kind of <hi>Fable</hi> is of the ſame Nature with thoſe of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> as we juſt now obſerved: Then we cannot ſay that an <hi>Epopéa</hi> is the <hi>Panegyrick of a Hero;</hi> of whom is rehearſed ſome illuſtrious Action or other; nor that the <hi>Epick Fable</hi> is only the Diſpoſition of the different Parts of that Action, and of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Fictions</hi> with which 'tis garniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Three Things may clear up this difficulty: The <hi>firſt</hi> is the Choice and Impoſition of the Names, which are given to the Perſonages of the <hi>Fable:</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is the Deſign which the Poet has of teaching Morality under an Allegory: And the <hi>third</hi> is the Virtue and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the chief Perſonage.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is moſt deciſive: For if the Action be feigned, and the <hi>Fable</hi> prepared before the Poet has ſo much as thought of the Name he is to give to his chief Perſonage; without doubt he does
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53904:37"/>
not undertake the <hi>Elogy</hi> of any particular Man. But we do not find that <hi>Horace</hi> has concerned himſelf in the buſineſs of impoſing Names: Therefore we refer this to the following Chapter, where we ſhall enquire into the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Point about Morality is expreſly in <hi>Horace.</hi> This Critick is entirely for the way I propoſed. He ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Qui quid ſit pulchrum quid turpe, quid utile, quid non: Plenius ac melius Chryſippo, &amp; Cantore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q>That <hi>Homer</hi> lays down admirable Inſtructions for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Humane Life, and herein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Odyſſei's</hi> to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the moſt excellent Philoſophers.</q> This is ſelf-evident, and having ſaid as much already, we wave ſaying any more about it: The Reader may conſult his Epiſtle to <hi>Lollius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But what ſignifies it (may ſome one ſay) if <hi>Homer</hi> had a mind to lay down Inſtructions of Morality? This does not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but he might have made choice of a <hi>Hero</hi> whom he might have praiſed, and this <hi>Elogy</hi> rightly managed might be a <hi>Fable.</hi> He was willing then to praiſe <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> as <hi>Xenophon</hi> did his <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </q> Is not this plainly the Deſign of <hi>Virgil?</hi> 
                     <q>And if <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was leſs ſucceſsful, ought we not to pardon the Imperfection of theſe firſt Ages, which did not furniſh him with thoſe great Ideas of Vertue, and thoſe perfect <hi>Heroes</hi> which after-Ages did produce?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hero</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> is indeed a true Hero in <hi>Morality</hi> as well as <hi>Poetry;</hi> and repreſents to Kings a compleat Model of all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which conſpire to make a great Prince. This might have given that <hi>Idea of the Epick Fable,</hi> which we are now examining. For the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is better read and underſtood than the <hi>Iliad.</hi> And Men are eaſily perſwaded, that the Deſign of theſe leſs known Pieces is the ſame with that which they are ſo well acquainted with. Beſides, this Judgment is backed by that noble <hi>Idea</hi> Men commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and of the conſummated Prudence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> Theſe are almoſt the two only Things which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the World are acquainted with in the <hi>Greek Poems:</hi> Which may have induced them to believe that the <hi>Fables of Homer</hi> are the <hi>Panegyricks of</hi> Achilles <hi>and</hi> Ulyſſes.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Horace,</hi> of whom we now ſpeak, had been of this Mind; and if he had believed that the Deſign of an <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> ſhould be to eſtabliſh the Merit of a <hi>Hero,</hi> and to propoſe him to others as a Model of Perfection; it neceſſarily follows, that either this great Critick was not well acquainted with conſiderable Defects in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> or elſe that he did not think <hi>Homer</hi> was a good Pattern to imitate.</p>
                  <p>Yet we ſee he knew the one, and believed the other. He knew no Vertue in <hi>Achilles,</hi> nor any Action that deſerved Praiſe. On the contrary, he ſays, <q>That in all the <hi>Iliad,</hi> both in the <hi>Grecians

                  <p>'Tis a material Point to take notice, that a thing muſt be done after one way or other, for its being either abſolutely good, or for its being only probable, no matter whether it be good or bad. <hi>Xenophon</hi> has feigned the Actions of his <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the firſt way; and ſo have all the Poets, who in imitation of him have undertaken to deſcribe the Actions of a great Prince <hi>panegyrically.</hi> On the other hand, the <hi>Hecuba</hi> of <hi>Seneca</hi> ſhould not have made ſuch fine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections

upon the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Priam.</hi> Not but theſe Reflections in themſelves are very juſt and uſeful; but only 'tis not probable, that a Woman lying under ſuch a weight of Afflictions, ſhould have ſuch Thoughts, as were only becoming the Tranquility of a great Philoſopher, who had no manner of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of theſe ancient Times.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in this laſt ſence, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> orders Poets to feign their Actions ſuch, as they either probably or neceſſarily ought to have been. If there ſtill remains any doubt what he means by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, 'tis very eaſie to give an entire ſolution of it. One need only conſider the Inſtance of an Action that is juſt, and feigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly by the greateſt of all the Poets: 'Tis that of the <hi>Iliad.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt he knew that the Action of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> made choice of by <hi>Homer,</hi>

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not only not blame him for forgoing ſuch a glorious Subject, and making choice of a more defective Theme: But he ſays that herein he has done ſomething that is divine.</p>
                  <p>He is then perfectly of the ſame mind with <hi>Horace,</hi> who would have <hi>Achilles</hi> repreſented as cholerick, paſſionate, and unjuſt; juſt as <hi>Homer</hi> has made him. But that wherein <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive than <hi>Horace,</hi> is his Method of giving Names to the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, that are introduced in a Poem. For how could one prepare the Ground-work of a particular Action of ſome illuſtrious <hi>Hero,</hi> that is not feigned; when one does not ſo much as know whether the <hi>Hero</hi> be <hi>Achilles, Aeneas, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes, Diomedes,</hi> or any other? And yet this is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> orders in the Compoſition of the <hi>Epick Fable,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>that one ſhould not give Names to Perſonages till after the Action is invented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One ſhould indeed do that juſt before the forming of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes:</hi> For if thoſe, whoſe Names we borrow, have done any known Actions; the beſt way is to make uſe of them, and accommodate theſe real Circumſtances to the <hi>Ground-work</hi> of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and to the Deſign of the Poet; to fill the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> with them; and to draw from them all the Advantages poſſible according to the Rules of Art. This management renders the feign'd Action more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53904:39"/>
and may likewiſe make it look like true Hiſtory. Beſides, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had ſaid, that the Poet in giving particular Names to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which at firſt he made general, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <q>That when you have feigned an Action, if it be mild and moderate, you muſt not repreſent the chief Perſonage thereof under the Name of <hi>Achilles, Tydeus, Medea,</hi> or any other whoſe paſſionate Tempers are well known.</q> In this Doctrine, we ſhall with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> meet with three ſorts of Actions which the Poets make uſe of. In the firſt, the <hi>Things</hi> and the <hi>Names</hi> of the Perſons are <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and not feigned or invented by the Poet. The <note n="‡" place="margin">Secuit Lucilius Urbem, Te Lupe, te Muti.</note> 
                     <hi>Satyriſts</hi> make uſe of this ſort. In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> both the <hi>Things</hi> and the <hi>Names</hi> are <hi>feigned</hi> and <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by the Poet; and this is the Practice of <hi>Comedians.</hi> We have laid down an Inſtance thereof in the <hi>Fable</hi> we made uſe of under the Names of <hi>Orontes, Pridamant,</hi> and <hi>Clitander.</hi> In the <hi>third</hi> ſort, the <hi>Things</hi> are invented, but the <hi>Names</hi> are not. They are noted either by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or by ſome <hi>Tradition</hi> or other. This is manifeſt in the <hi>Fable</hi> we propoſed under the Names of <hi>Robert Earl of Artois,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Count of Neſle.</hi> We might ſay the ſame of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> the <hi>Odyſseïs,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> This ſort of Action is proper for <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and the <hi>Epopéa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor need we feign Inſtances to prove theſe things, or ſeek for them in <hi>Greece</hi> and old <hi>Italy;</hi> ſince we have enough of them nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer home, in the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> the <hi>Comedies,</hi> and the <hi>Tragedies,</hi> which are daily to be ſeen in the World.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſo important, that it deſerves to be conſulted in the Original. After he had informed us that the <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Action is not <hi>ſingular,</hi> but <hi>general</hi> and <hi>univerſal;</hi> and after he had explained what he means by theſe Terms, as we obſerved at the beginning of this Chapter, he then goes on after this manner:</p>

                     <q>This in <hi>Comedy</hi> is very manifeſt. For after the Poet has prepared his <hi>Fable,</hi> upon what is <hi>probable,</hi> he then gives his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53904:39"/>
Actors what Names he pleaſes: And he does not as the <hi>Satyriſts,</hi> who ſpeak only of <hi>particular</hi> Things. But in <hi>Tragedy</hi> they make uſe of Names ready made to their hands. This makes us more readily believe the thing to be <hi>poſſible;</hi> for Things that have never yet been done, we are not obliged to think <hi>poſſible:</hi> But what has been already done, is without all Diſpute <hi>poſſible;</hi> ſince it would never have been done, had it been impoſſible. Yet in ſome <hi>Tragedies,</hi> there is but one or two known Names, and all the reſt are feigned.

And yet it came off with Applauſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In favour of our Subject 'tis, that we cite what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in this paſſage, concerning the <hi>Tragick Fable.</hi> Nor is this a wreſting of the Text, ſince this great Maſter lays it down as his firſt <note n="*" place="margin">

The better to perſwade the World of the Truth of what they ſay, they name the <hi>Places</hi> and the <hi>Perſons;</hi> and the more theſe Names are known, the more Credit they meet with. <hi>Homer</hi> has acquitted himſelf ſo very handſomely in this Matter, that the Art he had of <hi>feigning</hi> the beſt of any Man in the World, is one of the Commendations he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the mouth of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>We conclude then that <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Precepts,</hi> are exactly of the ſame mind; that <hi>Homer</hi> had no other Deſign but to form the Manners of his Country-men, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to them, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſays, what was profitable or unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what was honourable or diſhonourable: But that he did not undertake to rehearſe any particular Action of <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> He made his <hi>Fable,</hi> and laid the Deſign of his Poems, without ſo much as thinking on theſe Princes; and afterwards, he did them the Honour to beſtow their Names on the <hi>Heroes</hi> he had feign'd.</p>
                  <p>In other <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the <hi>Trojan War</hi> we do not indeed read of this Quarrel between <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> has taken for the Subject-Matter of his <hi>Iliad:</hi> And what is no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53904:40"/>
is, that this very Deſign and Action which the Poet has form'd under the name of <hi>Achilles</hi> at the <hi>Siege of Troy,</hi> might with the ſame <hi>Probability</hi> have went under the Name of <hi>Tydeus, Capaneus,</hi> or any other at the <hi>Siege of Thebes.</hi> One might have made <hi>Adraſtus</hi> the General, and given him ſome occaſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating the cholerick Nature of <hi>Capaneus.</hi> He, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Tent only for a few days, might have given the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> ſome Advantages over his Party. Afterwards one might have made this furious Perſon return to his Duty: and then fighting with the reſt, he might have gain'd the Victory to his own ſide, and reveng'd in one ſingle day, the Affront and Loſs they had ſuffer'd the three or four days before: And this is all we contend for in the <hi>Iliad.</hi>

In the mean time his Family is in diſorder, his Eſtate is made away with by his Wives Suitors, and his Son is plotted againſt. But at laſt, after many Storms at Sea, he returns home, diſcovers himſelf to his Friends, conceals himſelf from others, ſets all things to rights again, and puts his Enemies to death. This (concludes <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> is all that is proper, the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> make up the reſt.</q> This, in my mind, gives us abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſuch an Idea of a <hi>Fable</hi> as I propoſed: And in this Model <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſeems to have as little to do as any other.</p>
                  <p>But after the <hi>Model</hi> is pitch'd upon, the <hi>Action</hi> invented, and the <hi>Names</hi> given, then if thoſe whoſe Names are borrow's have done any known Actions, the Poet ought to make uſe of them, and to accommodate theſe true Circumſtances to his own Deſign. With theſe he muſt fill his <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> and from theſe he ſhould draw all the Advantages poſſible, according to the Rules of Art. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives no Orders for making the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> till the Names are pitch'd upon.</p>
                  <p>He therefore tranſgreſſes the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and ſpoils the Eſſence of the <hi>Epick Fable</hi> in particular, as well as of other <hi>Fables</hi> in general, who begins by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53904:40"/>
looking for his <hi>Hero</hi> in ſome Hiſtory or other, and undertakes to rehearſe a particular Action this <hi>Hero</hi> has done, as we ſee in <hi>Silius Italicus, Lucan, Statius,</hi> and in the Authors of the Adventures of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theſeus,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> takes notice of. They did not make any <hi>general</hi> or <hi>univerſal Platform</hi> without Names, but made it altogether <hi>ſingular.</hi> For how could any one write like <hi>Silius,</hi> without thinking on the particular Action and Name of <hi>Hannibal?</hi> Call him as much as you will, in your <hi>Platform,</hi> a <hi>Cortain Man,</hi> yet ſtill this <hi>Certain Man</hi> is determinately <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi> You are ſo far from taking away his Name, that after you have once nam'd him, you afterwards uſe a Pronoun or ſome other Word which ſignifies him, inſtead of the Term <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which you are loth to repeat. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not order the Names to be taken away (which can never be done) but he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders to feign an Action without Names, to make it at firſt univerſal, as he inſtances in the <hi>Odyſseïs</hi> and <hi>Iphigenia.</hi>

                  <p>But without concerning our ſelves with <hi>Sacred Things,</hi> we know what a Father did to perſwade his Children to Unity. He might have only told them, that a Man very eager of breaking all the Arrows in his Quiver, ſtriv'd to ſnap them all in pieces at once; but after many fruitleſs Tryals, he was forc'd to part them, and then breaks them one after another without the leaſt trouble. He might have related a thing that was falſe, and only probable. But he did ſomething more: he put a bundle of Rods, tied cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, into the hands of each of his Children, and bid them ſee if they could break them: They uſed their utmoſt Endeavour, but to little purpoſe. Then he gave them the Rods one by one, and the weakeſt of theſe young Creatures broke them eaſily.

                     <hi>Sertorius</hi> made uſe of the ſame Artifice to his Soldiers. He order'd the Tails of a couple of Horſes to be pull'd off before them.

look out for Materials, and then form his Deſign according to what the Diſpoſition of his Materials may ſuggeſt to his Fancy.</hi>

                     <hi>Poetry</hi> is like <hi>Painting.</hi> The Poet is frequently oblig'd to ſuit himſelf to the Diſpoſitions of his Matter: which is found to be true, eſpecially in the Compoſition of the <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which are made after the General Perſonages are ſingulariz'd by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Names. It may likewiſe ſo happen that ſome Perſon in Hiſtory may furniſh an Author with fine Fancies, and as exact a Moral as that which <hi>Homer</hi> teaches. And in this Caſe, the Poet does not at all tranſgreſs his Art, though he ſhould apply all his Moral to the Action.

                  <p>We ſtill maintain, <q>That the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> is a <hi>Fable;</hi> that is, not the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> of the <hi>Action</hi> of ſome one <hi>Hero,</hi> in order to form Mens Manners by his Example; but, on the contrary, a Diſcourſe invented to form the Manners by the <hi>Recital</hi> of a <hi>feign'd Action,</hi> and deſcrib'd at pleaſure under the borrow'd Name of ſome Illuſtrious Perſon or other, that is made choice of, after the <hi>Platform</hi> of the Action, that is aſcrib'd to him, is laid.</q>

                  <p>AS there are <hi>True</hi> Actions, the <hi>Recitals</hi> whereof are exact and regular <hi>Fables;</hi> ſo on the other hand, there are <hi>Feign'd</hi> Actions, the <hi>Recitals</hi> whereof are <hi>Hiſtorical.</hi> Nothing is to be eſteem'd Fabulous in them, but a downright Falſhood, and that has as little to do with the <hi>Fable,</hi> as the Truth of Hiſtory. The Reaſon of this is, that the moſt eſſential part of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and that which muſt indiſpenſibly ſerve for its Foundation, is the <hi>Truth</hi> ſignified. 'Tis eaſie to explain our ſelves by thoſe very Examples we have already made uſe of; we need only cut off ſome neceſſary Circumſtances of them in order to illuſtrate the Doctrine we would add here.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Dogs</hi> that were ſet to keep the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and whoſe Falling out gave the <hi>Wolf</hi> an opportunity of ſeizing upon ſome of them; if they, I ſay, follow the <hi>Wolf</hi> before they end their Quarrel; and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

overtaking him, they are as fierce againſt one another, as againſt their Common Enemy: in this caſe, though the <hi>Wolf</hi> quit his Prey, fly for it, or though he die of the Wounds they give him; yet this <hi>Fiction</hi> will no longer ſignifie, <hi>That Concord re-eſtabliſhes what Diſcord deſtroys;</hi> ſince the Calamity would have been ended, though the Diſcord ſtill continued.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if <hi>Achilles</hi> being provok'd at the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> had ſet upon and kill'd <hi>Hector</hi> without being reconcil'd to <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> the Omiſſion of this <hi>Incident,</hi> would have ſpoil'd the <hi>Fable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We add farther, that if <hi>Achilles</hi> had been leſs inexorable, and had ſubmitted to the Offers of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> before the Death of <hi>Patroclus;</hi> and if this Quarrel had not coſt him the Life of his Friend, the <hi>Fable</hi> would have been ſpoil'd: For ſince the Quarrel would have been only prejudicial to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> this Example would have ſhew'd us, in the Perſon of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that one might Quarrel, and be at Variance, without loſing any thing: which is quite contrary to the <hi>Moral</hi> of the Poet.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould deprive the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> of its very Soul, and ſpoil its <hi>Fable;</hi> ſhould we retrench from it the Diſorders which the Suitors of <hi>Penelope</hi> rais'd in the Iſle of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> during the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes:</hi> becauſe this Poem would no longer inform us of the miſchievous Effects which the Abſence of a Commander, a King, or a Father of a Family, does produce.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Take away from the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> the Choice which the Gods made of <hi>Aeneas</hi> for the re-eſtabliſhing of the Empire; his Divine Arms; the Care <hi>Jupiter</hi> took to engage <hi>Mezentius</hi> in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, where he was to be puniſh'd for his Impieties; and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors with which this God affrights <hi>Turnus:</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid</hi> will no longer inform the <hi>Romans</hi> in favour of <hi>Auguſtus, That the Founders of Empires, ſuch as this Prince was, were the</hi> Choſen <hi>of Heaven, that Divine Providence protects them from all manner of Violence, and ſeverely puniſhes the Impious, who oppoſe their Deſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Recitals</hi> want their <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and that Inſtruction, which is the moſt eſſential part of the <hi>Fable.</hi> When a Poet goes this way to work, he does not make ſuch <hi>Epick Poems</hi> as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> preſcribes Rules for, nor ſuch as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> has left us ſuch exact Patterns of. It is not much matter whether theſe <hi>Recitals</hi> are of true Things, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Silius Italicus;</hi> or whether they are feign'd and drawn from <hi>Fables,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Statius</hi> in his two Poems. He relates a <hi>Fiction,</hi> they <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> but all three write more like <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> than <hi>Epick Poets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, they have all a Mixture of <hi>Divinities</hi> and <hi>Machines,</hi> which carry a <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Poetical</hi> Air in them: but ſince theſe

                     <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> beſtows large Commendations on <hi>Homer</hi> for the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of his Deſign, becauſe he has included in one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle part all that happen'd in the <hi>Trojan War.</hi> And to him he oppoſes the Ignorance of certain Poets, who imagin'd that the <hi>

                  <p>His <hi>Achilleid</hi> is a Model of all the Adventures which the Poets have feign'd under the Name of <hi>Achilles</hi>

                  <p>All this cannot be conſider'd, but as an <hi>Hiſtorical Recital,</hi> and without the leaſt Glimpſe of a <hi>Fable.</hi> Nor can I repreſent the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53904:43"/>
Idea I have of this Deſign better, than by comparing it with the <hi>Fables of Aeſop.</hi> I have already compar'd the <hi>Iliad</hi> with one of theſe <hi>Fables:</hi> and ſure I may take the ſame liberty in a Poem that is leſs Regular; and make a Compariſon between the <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leid</hi> which comprehends ſeveral Actions under one and the ſame Name, and ſeveral <hi>Fables</hi> which likewiſe go under one Name. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> diverted themſelves with their Poems of the <hi>Gnat,</hi> and of the <hi>Battel between the Frogs and the Mice:</hi> nor ſhall I ſtoop lower, when, upon the like occaſion, I ſhall enlarge my ſelf as far as the Deſign of <hi>Statius,</hi> and the Neceſſity of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine require me.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe then and Author, who is as well vers'd in the <hi>Fables of Aeſop,</hi> as <hi>Statius</hi> was in the <hi>Epick Fable;</hi> and who has read the <hi>Batrachomyomachia,</hi> as well as <hi>Statius</hi> has the <hi>Iliad.</hi> He ſhall have diſcover'd in this <hi>Battel between the Mice and the Frogs,</hi> the great Commendations which <hi>Homer</hi> beſtows on the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of one of the <hi>Heroes</hi> in this <hi>Fable,</hi> upon <hi>Meridarpax</hi> for inſtance; whoſe Bravery made <hi>Jove</hi> and all the Gods wonder no leſs, than that of <hi>Capaneus</hi> in the <hi>Thebaid.</hi> And as <hi>Statius</hi> has read of ſeveral Actions of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which are not in the <hi>Iliad;</hi> this Author likewiſe ſhall have read of many Adventures attributed to the <hi>Mouſe,</hi> which are not in the <hi>Batrachomyomachia</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſhall know what paſſed between the <hi>City-Mouſe</hi> and the <hi>Country-Mouſe;</hi> in order to teach us, <hi>That a little Eſtate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd quietly is better than a copious one, that expoſes us to continual fears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſhall know that a <hi>Lion</hi> having ſpared the Liſe of a <hi>Mouſe,</hi> was afterwards ſaved by this very <hi>Mouſe,</hi> who gnaw'd aſſunder the Toils in which he was caught; whereby he might inform us, <hi>That the good Offices we do to the moſt Infirm and Ignoble, are not always loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſhall know the Story of the <hi>Mountains,</hi> which after great Groans, and much ado, were deliver'd of a <hi>Mouſe; like thoſe who promiſe much, but perform little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſhall have read in the <hi>Battel between the Cats and the Mice,</hi> that the <hi>Mice</hi> being defeated and put to flight, thoſe amongſt 'em, who had put Horns upon their Heads as a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Note of their being the <hi>Commanders,</hi> could not get into their Holes again, and ſo were all cut off: Becauſe in the like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, <hi>the Chief Leaders, and Men of Note, do commonly pay Sawce for all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And upon theſe Diſcoveries, when he has conceiv'd the Idea of a Piece more ſurprizing than the <hi>Batrachomyomachia,</hi> or than any other particular <hi>Fable of Aeſop,</hi> he ſhall undertake a Poem of all the <hi>Fables</hi> of the <hi>Mouſe:</hi> as <hi>Statius</hi> undertook one about every
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53904:43"/>
thing that Story or the Poets ever ſaid of <hi>Achilles.</hi> He might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin after the ſame manner, as <hi>Statius</hi> did his <hi>Achilleid:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Inſpire me, O my Muſe, what I ought to ſay concerning the Magnanimous <hi>Meridarpax,</hi> which <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf cannot look upon without trembling. <hi>Homer</hi> indeed has celebrated ſome of his Actions in his Poem; but there are a great many ſtill untouch'd; and I am reſolved to omit nothing that my <hi>Hero</hi> has done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He, as well as <hi>Achilles,</hi> had a <hi>Mortal</hi> for his Sire, to wit, the Redoubted <hi>Artepibulus,</hi> and a Mother far above his Rank and Quality, no leſs than a lofty <hi>Mountain.</hi> His Birth is foretold by the Oracles, and the People Hocking together from all parts to be Witneſſes of this miraculous Labour, beheld <hi>Meridarpax</hi> creep out of his Mothers Belly, with ſo much Surprize and Delight, that their joyful Shouts and loud Laughter carried the News thereof to the Gods.</p>
                  <p>In the War his Aſſociates maintain'd againſt the <hi>Amazonians of the Lakes,</hi> he ſignaliz'd himſelf in the Death of <hi>Phyſignathus.</hi> He would have utterly deſtroy'd all his Enemies, had not the Gods put a ſtop to his Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>To refreſh himſelf after the Fatigues of this War, he was for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Air in ſome Country-Seat or other. But by the way he is ſurprized by a furious <hi>Lion,</hi> who is juſt ready to tear him to pieces: but <hi>Meridarpax</hi> was no leſs eloquent than ſtout. The <hi>Lion</hi> admir'd his parts, and let him go.</p>
                  <p>He was welcom'd in the Country by an old Friend of his Sire's. This <hi>Villager</hi> thought of making him a delicate Repaſt with his Country-Fare: but theſe old, dry, and unſavoury Morſels would not down with our nice Stranger. Whereupon bepitying the ſorry Life of his Friend, he invites him to a more pleaſant one, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon him to jog along with him.</p>
                  <p>They were ſcarce got half-way to their Journey's end, but they heard a moſt terrible noiſe. <hi>Meridarpax</hi> perceiv'd 'twas the <hi>Lion's</hi> Roar which before had ſpar'd his Life. He made that way, and in ſhort found him ſo fetter'd in the Nooſe, that he expected nothing elſe but Death: the <hi>Mouſe</hi> freed him from that fear, by gnawing aſunder ſeveral Knots; and put the Priſoner in a Capacity of freeing himſelf from the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meridarpax</hi> re-joyns his <hi>Country-Friend,</hi> conducts him to Town, and receives him very ſplendidly in a Pantry well furniſh'd. This new <hi>Citizen</hi> was bleſſing himſelf at his happy Change; when on the ſudden in ſteps the Houſekeeper, and at her Heels one of the moſt formidable Enemies theſe two Gueſts had. The <hi>Domeſtick</hi> betook himſelf preſently to his Cittadel: but the poor <hi>Stranger,</hi> ſeiz'd with Fear, and every Limb about him in an Ague, ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a long time expos'd to the Claws of a mercileſs Enemy. In
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53904:44"/>
ſhort he eſcap'd; and without minding the good Cheer, as ſoon as the Danger was over, and he came to himſelf, he takes his <hi>Congé</hi> of his Hoſt, and tells him, <hi>That he preferr'd his quiet Poverty to all that Plenty which was ſo attended with frights and fears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meridarpax</hi> ſtomachs this Affront, calls together a great many of his Allies, and prevails ſo effectually upon them, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Confederacy with him, and offer to ſerve him in the War. He, the better to maintain his Grandeur, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more conſpicuous than all the reſt, claps two great Horns on his Forehead. At the firſt opening of the Pantry he had a great deal of Succeſs againſt ſome of the young Rangers, who firſt came in. But no ſooner had their ſqueaking call'd in their Sires and their Dams, and the Wawling of a great many others at a diſtance, gave notice of a new Reinforcement, that was ready to pour in upon the Aſſailants, but they preſently thought of a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. The reſt with eaſe ſlunk into their Holes, and none left upon the ſpot but <hi>Meridarpax</hi> embaraſs'd with the Enſigns of his Grandeur, which made the Avenues too ſtrait for him to eſcape at. One of his Party bid him lay aſide his Regalities, but he had ſcarce time to reply, <hi>That he had rather die like a King, and make his Exit gloriouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Poem made up of theſe Stories joyn'd together, and which we might compare with one of the <hi>Fables of Aeſop</hi> or the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trachomyomachia,</hi> is very much like the Idea I have of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeid,</hi> the <hi>Heraclid,</hi> the <hi>Achilleid,</hi> and other ſuch like Poems, when compar'd with thoſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Homer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was in the right, when he call'd a certain little <hi>Iliad</hi> the whole <hi>Trojan War</hi> ſqueez'd into the compaſs of one ſingle Poem. This <hi>Iliad</hi> indeed was very ſmall, ſince it was all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in a very narrow Compaſs. It was not at all like the <hi>Iliad</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> a ſmall part of which fill'd ſo many Books. We may ſay as much of the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Statius,</hi> who is comprehended at his full Length within the Compaſs of <hi>twelve Books.</hi> And the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> is ſo vaſt, that a few days of his Anger and Paſſion have taken up <hi>four and twenty Books</hi> compleatly.</p>
                  <p>According to the old <note n="*" place="margin">Ex ungue Leonem.</note> 
                     <hi>Adage</hi> it muſt needs follow, that this <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> was of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſize, ſince ſo large a Table could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more than one ſingle Paw, which had been the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſo many <hi>Heroes.</hi> And on the other ſide, that the <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>Statius</hi> was but of a very ſmall ſize, ſince all his Parts could be comprehended and included in a Table leſs by half than that of <hi>Homer's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee then the ill Effects of <hi>Polymythia,</hi> or a <hi>Vicious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Fables.</hi> The <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Dogs</hi> and the <hi>Wolf</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53904:44"/>
how beautiful and regular the <hi>Iliad</hi> is; and the <hi>Narration</hi> of the Adventures of the <hi>Mouſe</hi> ſhews the contrary in the <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leid.</hi> If my two Parallels are of equal juſtneſs, the Difference that appears to be between the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and that of <hi>Statius</hi> ought to be attributed to nothing elſe but the different Conduct of theſe two Authors.</p>
                  <p>There is ſtill another way of <hi>irregularly multiplying Fables.</hi> without making a Rehearſal of the <hi>Hero's</hi> whole Life: and that is, by mixing with the <hi>main Action</hi> other <hi>foreign Actions,</hi> which have no manner of Relation thereto. This belongs to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action,</hi> and the Art of making the <hi>Epiſodes:</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak in the next Book.</p>
                  <p>The Poem of <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſes</hi> is of another kind. If (as I have already laid down the Idea I conceiv'd of the <hi>Achilleid</hi> of <hi>Statius,</hi> of the <hi>Heraclid,</hi> of the <hi>Theſeid,</hi> and of other ſuch like Pieces of the Ancient Poets) I had a mind likewiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the World with an Example of <hi>Aeſop's Fables</hi> compar'd with <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſes;</hi> I ſhould be forced to put all the <hi>Fables of Aeſop</hi> into one Body: Becauſe <hi>Ovid</hi> is not contented to rehearſe all that ever happen'd either to <hi>Achilles,</hi> or to <hi>Hercules,</hi> or to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> or to any other ſingle Perſonage; but he makes a <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> of all that ever happen'd to all the Perſons of the <hi>Poetical Fables.</hi> This <hi>Recital</hi> is by no means an <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> but a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all the <hi>Fables</hi> that were ever writ in Verſe, with as much Connexion and Union, as the Compiler of ſo many Incidents could deviſe.</p>
                  <p>And yet I do not ſee how any one can condemn this Deſign, and tax its Author with Ignorance: provided none pretend that he deſign'd to make an <hi>Epopéa,</hi> nor compare it to the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as <hi>Statius</hi> has done his <hi>Achilleid</hi> and <hi>Thebaid.</hi>

                     <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> likewiſe makes his firſt Rule.</p>
                  <p>According to theſe Rules then, it will be allowable to make uſe of ſeveral <hi>Fables;</hi> or (to ſpeak more correctly) of ſeveral Incidents which may be divided into ſeveral <hi>Fables;</hi> provided they are ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I will explain my ſelf more diſtinctly by the practice of our Poets.</p>
                  <p>No doubt but one might make four diſtinct <hi>Fables</hi> out of theſe four following Inſtructions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Diviſion between thoſe of the ſame party expoſes them to the fury of their Enemies.</item>
                     <item>2. Conceal your weakneſs, and you will be dreaded as much, as if you had none of theſe Imperfections, which they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of.</item>
                     <item>3. When your ſtrength is only feign'd, and founded only in the Opinion of others; never venture ſo far, as if your ſtrength was real.</item>
                     <item>4. The more you agree together, the leſs hurt will your Enemies do you.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>'Tis plain, I ſay, that each of theſe particular <hi>Maxims,</hi> might ſerve for the <hi>Ground-work</hi> of a <hi>Fiction,</hi> and one might make four diſtinct <hi>Fables</hi> out of them. May not a Man therefore put all theſe into one ſingle <hi>Epopéa?</hi> No: Our Maſters forbid that, unleſs he could make one <hi>ſingle Fable</hi> out of them all.</p>
                  <p>But they do not at all forbid it, if the Poet has ſo much skill as to unite all into one Body, as Members and Parts, each of which taken aſunder would be imperfect; and if he joins them ſo, as that this Conjunction ſhall be no hinderance at all to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and the <hi>Regular ſimplicity</hi> of the <hi>Fable.</hi> This is what <hi>Homer</hi> has done with ſuch ſucceſs in the Compoſition of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1. The Diviſion between</hi> Achilles <hi>and his Allies tended to the ruin of their Deſigns.</hi> 2. Patroclus <hi>comes to their Relief in the Armour of this</hi> Hero, <hi>and</hi> Hector <hi>retreats. 3. But this young man puſhing the Advantage, which his Diſguiſe gave him, too far, ventures to engage with</hi> Hector <hi>himſelf; but not being Maſter of</hi> Achilles'<hi>s ſtrength (whom be only repreſented in outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) he is killed, and by this means leaves the</hi> Grecian <hi>Affairs in the ſame diſorder, which he in that Diſguiſe came to free them from.</hi> 4. Achilles <hi>provoked at the Death of his friend, is reconciled, and revenges his loſs by the Death of</hi> Hector. Theſe various <hi>Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53904:45"/>
being thus <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> together, do not make different <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Fables,</hi> but are only the uncompleat, and unfiniſhed Parts of one and the ſame <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Fable,</hi> which alone can only be ſaid to be <hi>Compleat</hi> and <hi>Entire:</hi> And all theſe <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Moral,</hi> are eaſily reduc'd into theſe two parts, which in my opinion cannot be ſeparated without enervating the force of both. The two parts are theſe, <note n="*" place="margin">Concordia res parvae creſcunt: diſcordiâ magnae dilabuntur. <hi>Saluſt. de Bell. Jug.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That a right underſtanding is the Preſervation, and Diſcord the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' then our Poets have made uſe of two parts in their Poems, each of which might have ſerv'd for a <hi>Fable,</hi> as we have obſerv'd: Yet this <hi>Multiplication</hi> cannot be call'd a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>irregular Polymythia,</hi> contrary to the neceſſary <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Fable;</hi> but it gives the <hi>Fable</hi> another <hi>Qualification,</hi> altogether as neceſſary and as regular, namely <hi>its Perfection and finiſhing ſtroke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Fable;</hi> which naturally contain in them a great many parts, each of which might make an exact <hi>Fable:</hi> And there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Actions</hi> of the very ſame nature. The ſubject Matter of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> is of this kind; for <hi>Homer</hi> being willing to inſtruct a Prince and his Subjects, could not do it without <hi>Multiplying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions;</hi> and this Prince's Travels into Countries quite different from each other are likewiſe different <hi>Actions.</hi> This <hi>Multiplication of Inſtructions</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> is extremely approv'd of by <hi>Horace.</hi> He commends the <note n="†" place="margin">Ut ſpecioſa dehine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racula promat, Antipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Scyllamque, &amp; cum Cyclope Charybdim. <hi>Hor.

                  </p>
                  <p>One might likewiſe <hi>multiply the Fable</hi> another way, by mixing with it ſome other <hi>Fable</hi> which ſhould not be a part of the Principal one, but only a <hi>Species</hi> of it. This might be done by applying to ſome Point that is chiefly ſpecified the <hi>Moral Inſtruction,</hi> which the Action contains in general. <hi>Homer</hi> has left us an Example of this in the <hi>Fable of Vulcan,</hi> at the End of his firſt Book of the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>General Inſtruction</hi> is, <hi>That Diſcord is a prejudice of the Affairs of them who quarrel:</hi> And this ſtory of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Fable,</hi> and the <hi>Regular</hi> or <hi>Vicious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> that may be made thereof, depends in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action,</hi> and upon the <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> ſo we we ſhall ſpeak more thereof in another place: But in this and many other Points, the <hi>Examen</hi> of our Authors, and thoſe particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions one might deſcend to for an exact Underſtanding of this Doctrine, would never be at end. And tho I ſhould fill ſeveral Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes with what I have to ſay about it, yet I ſhould ſtill leave enough to employ the <hi>Imagination,</hi> the <hi>Genius,</hi> and the <hi>Judgment</hi> of both <hi>Criticks</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> which <hi>Art</hi> without <hi>Nature</hi> never brings to Perfection. Nor are we to fanſie that <hi>Nature</hi> alone, and the Advantages of a happy <hi>Genius,</hi> can make us capable of paſſing a Judgment upon the Ancient Poets; unleſs <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Study</hi> acquaint us with the Taſt and the Manners of their Auditors, and of the times they liv'd in.</p>
                  <p>The Reliſh which all Antiquity, both <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Profane, Greek</hi> and <hi>Barbarian,</hi> had for <hi>Fables, Parables,</hi> and <hi>Allegories</hi> (which are one and the ſame in this place) gave the Ancient Poets a great deal more Liberty than the Moderns have; and make things in <hi>Homer</hi> paſs for Beauties, which would look but ill in a Piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poetry. This likewiſe expoſes our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poet to ſuch Cenſures, as bewray our Ignorance oftner than his faults. The <note n="*" place="margin">Vobis datum eſt noſſe myſteria, caeteris in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolis tantum. Qui poteſt capere capiat.

                     </note> Cuſtom of that time was to conceal their Myſteries from Vulgar View, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Allegories. Men of Learning made it a particular Study to diſcover theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Meanings, and this Penetration of thought made a Conſiderable part of their Learning. Our Age, which in other things pretends to ſo much Light and Curioſity, is very negligent of theſe ſorts of Knowledge, ſince they no longer agree with our Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53904:46"/>
'Tis perhaps this very Neglect, which conceals from our Eyes the greateſt Beauties of <hi>Homer,</hi> and which inſtead of his Skill, only ſhews us a very mean and groſs Outſide, which hinders us from judging favourably of his Spirit and Conduct. However he had reaſon to make uſe of this way, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the <note n="*" place="margin">Poetae officium in eo poſitum ut quae vera ſunt in alias ſpecies obliquis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurationibus cum decore aliquo converſa traducat. <hi>Lactant. Inſtit. l. n.</hi>
                     </note> Mode of his Age. He knew well enough, that thoſe, who did not penetrate him would admire him as much as others; becauſe every one was perſwaded that what appear'd to the Eye of the World, was in effect nothing elſe but the Shell, which contained the Profitable and Pleaſant parts of his Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> was a great deal harder put to it, becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> of his time did not ſo frequently uſe <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Allegories. Cicero</hi> did not treat of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> did, upon whom they Father <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s <hi>Fables.</hi> And S. <note n="*" place="margin">Familiare eſt Syris &amp; maxime Palaeſtinis ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſermonem ſuum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolas jungere. <hi>Hieron. in Matth.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Jerom</hi> takes notice that <hi>Parables</hi> were in greateſt vogue in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> So that when <hi>Virgil</hi> was minded to ſhroud his Inſtructions and Doctrine under <hi>Allegories,</hi> he could not be contented with ſuch a plain outſide as <hi>Homer</hi>'s was, which gravels thoſe who cannot penetrate it, and who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that he ſpeaks figuratively. But he has ſo compoſed his <hi>Out-ſide,</hi> and his <hi>Fictions,</hi> that thoſe very perſons who can go no farther, may, without ſeeking for any thing elſe, be very well ſatisfied with what they find there.</p>
                  <p>This Method is wholly conformable to our Way, and very much to our Palates. But I fanſie, the ſatisfaction we ſo eaſily find in theſe <hi>External Fictions</hi> alone, does us ſome Prejudice. The more we fix there, the leſs ſearch do we make into the Bottom and Truth of things. This makes us perhaps Equivocate upon the Word <hi>Fable,</hi> which we apply ſo differently to the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and to the <hi>Fictions of Aeſop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prepoſſeſſion of Mind does <hi>Homer</hi> a great deal of Diskindneſs; for we are often willing to find ſuch Vertues and good Manners there, which are not there, and which we ſuppoſe ought regularly to have been there: Becauſe we are ſo little acquainted with his way of teaching <hi>Morality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it comes to paſs that we meet with ſo great Obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> who commend <hi>Homer</hi> ſo much for that, which we are ſo little acquainted with, eſpecially if we examine it according to the Ideas of Perfection, which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally form to our Selves. By this means we ſhall be ſubject to great Confuſions and many Contradictions. Before ever then we paſs a judgment upon theſe things and upon <hi>Homer,</hi> who is the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53904:47"/>
Author and firſt Model of them, 'tis requiſite we rightly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his <hi>Allegories,</hi> and penetrate into the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Phyſical Truths</hi> of the <hi>Fable,</hi> with which his Poems are ſo full.</p>
                  <p>As little inſight as I have in theſe Matters; yet I fanſie, I have ſaid enough to explain what a <hi>Fable</hi> is, and to demonſtrate the Idea I have of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>

The Nature of the <hi>Fable</hi> will not admit us to doubt hereof; ſince all the Actions that are there rehears'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Names of a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Wolf,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> and the like, are not deſign'd to inform us of the Nature of theſe Animals to which they are applied; or to tell us of ſome Adventure that happen'd to them: For the Author of a Fable does not mind any ſuch thing.

                  <p>So likewiſe have thoſe been condemn'd, who have taken the <hi>Heroes</hi> for the <hi>ſubject Matter</hi> of their Poems. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> finds fault with the Poets who under the name of the <hi>Theſeid,</hi> and the <hi>Heraclid,</hi> have writ the Lives of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> in Verſe. <hi>Statius</hi> is likewiſe to blame in his <hi>Achilleid,</hi> becauſe he does not ſing of <hi>Achilles</hi> who did ſuch or ſuch an Action, as <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have done; but he ſings <hi>Achilles</hi> himſelf, and this <hi>Achilles</hi> at his full length.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> call their Poem by their <hi>Heroe</hi>'s Name: But this is no more than what is ordinary in <hi>Fables.</hi> Thus the Titles run, the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Lyon</hi> and the <hi>Mouſe, &amp;c.</hi> and yet no one imagines, that theſe Fables were written to inform us of the Nature of theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,

or to tell us what a certain <hi>Wolf</hi> has done or ſaid. The ſame Judgment ought to be made of the <hi>Epick Fables,</hi> and the Application thereof is eaſie.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine may eaſily render us capable of judging what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is allowable to the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Poem; of what <hi>Incidents</hi> it is compos'd; and whether 'tis lawful to inſert ſuch as belong not to the main Matter.</p>
                  <p>Since then the <hi>Action</hi> is the <hi>Matter</hi> of a <hi>Fable,</hi> it is plain that whatever Incidents are neceſſary to the <hi>Fable,</hi> and make up a part of it, are likewiſe neceſſary to the Action, and are parts of the <hi>Epick Matter,</hi> none of which ought to be omitted: Such, for inſtance, are the Quarrel of the <hi>Dogs;</hi> and that of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles:</hi> The havock which the <hi>Wolf</hi> made among the <hi>Sheep;</hi> and the Slaughter which <hi>Hector</hi> made in the Confederate Army: The re-union of the <hi>Dogs</hi> with each other; and that of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes: And laſtly, the Re-ſettlement and Victory which was conſequent to this Re-union in each of theſe <hi>Fables.</hi> Thus all things being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, you ſee the Fable, and the whole <hi>Action,</hi> with which the Poem ought to conclude. If leſs had been ſaid about it, it had not been enough.</p>
                  <p>But can an Author put nothing into his Poem, but what is purely the Matter of it? Or has he not the Liberty of inſerting what he pleaſes, and of talking to it, as <note n="*" place="margin">Purpureus larè qui Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat unus &amp; alter Aſſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pannus. <hi>Hor.

                  <p>Examples and Authority will juſtifie this Doctrine, and make it more intelligible.</p>
                  <p>If in the Fable we mention'd, <hi>Aeſop</hi> had related that the <hi>Wolf</hi> ranging one day in the Foreſt prick'd his Foot with a Thorn, of which after a great deal of Pain he was at laſt cur'd; doubtleſs he would have quite ſpoil'd his Fable: And <hi>Homer</hi> too had ſpoil'd his, if he had made an ample Narration of ſome Adventure that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to <hi>Hector,</hi> which had no manner of dependance on his deſign. They would have been more conſiderably to blame, had they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted any Incident, which had not happen'd to theſe chief Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, but which they only ſaw or heard. On the other ſide <hi>Aeſop</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53904:49"/>
had ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe, if, to amplifie his Fable, he had related that the <hi>Woolf</hi> was wounded in the Foot, and being not quite cur'd, the Pain or the Weakneſs of that part hinder'd his Running, and expos'd him a Prey to the <hi>Dogs.</hi> So <hi>Homer</hi> has very regularly related, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had formerly been wounded in the Leg, as he was hunting on the top of <hi>Parnaſſus:</hi> For this Wound ſerv'd to diſcover this <hi>Hero,</hi> and this diſcovery is part of the <hi>Action,</hi> and of the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Poem.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> that undertakes to write of one ſingle Action, as the War of <hi>Catiline,</hi> or the Reign of a King, as <hi>Saluſt</hi> has done that of <hi>Jugurtha;</hi> has not for his <hi>ſubject Matter</hi> the Wars and Actions which went before, or happen'd after.

                  <p>THE better to know what an <hi>Epiſode</hi> is, and to comprehend what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſaid about it, we muſt look back for it in its firſt beginning, and in the Riſe of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> whereby it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. I ſpeak of it here thô <hi>Monſieur Hedelin</hi> has formerly writ about it.</p>
                  <p>Tragedy at firſt was only a Song in honor of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which was performed by ſeveral perſons (who made up the <hi>Muſical Chorus)</hi> with dancing and playing upon Inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>Since this was too tedious, and might fatigue the ſingers, as well as diſguſt the Audience; they thought of dividing the Song of the <hi>Chorus</hi> into ſeveral parts, and of making ſome kind of <hi>Narrations</hi> between theſe Intervals. At firſt one ſingle perſon ſpoke them: Then they brought in two ſpeakers, becauſe Dialogues are more diverting: And at laſt they increas'd the number to three, to give way for more Action. Thoſe who made theſe <hi>Narrations</hi> upon the Scene or Stage were call'd <hi>Actors.</hi> And what they ſaid being adventitious to the Song of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> theſe Narrations were no more than Ornaments added to a Ceremony, of which they were not a neceſſary part: And for this reaſon were they call'd <hi>Epiſodes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, as they were only added to refreſh the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and their Aſſiſtants; it follows that the <hi>Chorus</hi> had ſung before, and were to ſing after them: So that theſe <hi>Epiſodes</hi> were always to be plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Songs of the <hi>Chorus.</hi> Whatever was ſaid before the firſt, or after the laſt Song, was not look'd upon as an <hi>Epiſode:</hi> But theſe new Additions were made for Reaſons diſtinct from thoſe which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53904:50"/>
were urg'd for introducing <hi>that.</hi> The deſign of them was, either to welcome the Company, and prepare them for what was to be Acted; and this was call'd the <hi>Prologue:</hi> or elſe to thank and take leave of them; which was call'd the <hi>Exode</hi> or <hi>Epilogue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this made up the four parts of <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms it: viz. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, the Epiſode, the Exode, and the Chorus. The Prologue is all that precedes the firſt Enorance of the Chorus; the Epiſode is all that is between the Songs of the Chorus; the Exode is that which is ſaid after the Chorus has done ſinging; the Chorus was the Company of thoſe who ſang the praiſes of</hi> Bacchus: <hi>And at firſt that was the only Tragedy in being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this Narration of the Actors was inſerted in ſeveral places, and made at ſeveral times: So one might conſider it Entire, as one ſingle <hi>Epiſode</hi> compos'd of ſeveral parts; and one might likewiſe call each part an <hi>Epiſode.</hi> In this laſt ſenſe a <hi>Tragedy</hi> had ſeveral <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> and in the firſt it had but only one. Theſe different <hi>Epiſodes</hi> of one and the ſame <hi>Tragedy</hi> might be deduc'd from as many different Subjects: Or be all taken from the ſame Subject, that was divided into as many Recitals or Incidents as the Poet had a mind to allow Intervals for the <hi>Chorus</hi> to take breath in. If we conſider the firſt Inſtitution of theſe foreign Pieces, there was not the leaſt neceſſity of deducing all of them from one and the ſame ſubject. Three or four Recitals of different Actions, that had no relation to one another, could refreſh the ſingers well enough, and keep the Audience from languiſhing, as much as if they had all been only different parts of one and the ſame Action, very cloſely connected together.</p>
                  <p>But theſe foreign Beauties ſoon took off from the luſtre of thoſe others which ſo charitably gave them Entertainment: And that which at firſt was only an Addition to <hi>Tragedy,</hi> afterwards became the Principal part of it. Then, they were conſider'd as a Body, whoſe Members ſhould not be Heterogeneous, and independant on one another. The beſt Poets made uſe of them thus, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd their <hi>Epiſodes</hi> only from one ſingle Action. This was ſo far eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s time, that he made a ſtanding Rule of it, He ſays, that the moſt defective <hi>Tragedies</hi> are ſuch, whoſe <hi>Epiſodes</hi> have no manner of Connexion. He calls them <hi>Epiſodical,</hi> that is to ſay, overcharg'd with <hi>Epiſodes:</hi> Becauſe theſe leſſer <hi>Epiſodes</hi> cannot make one ſingle one, but of neceſſity remain in a Vicious Multiplicity.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:53904:50"/>
Actions, that were moſt ſimple, and had leaſt of Intrigue, were moſt of all liable to this Irregularity, becauſe having fewer Incidents, and fewer parts than others, they afford ſo much the leſs <hi>Matter.</hi> A <hi>Poet</hi> of no great Conduct, very often quite ſpends himſelf at the firſt or ſecond coming on of his Actors between the Songs of the <hi>Chorus:</hi> And then he finds himſelf oblig'd to ſeek out for other Actions to fill up the Intervals behind. Our firſt <hi>French</hi> Poets did ſo. They took to fill up each Act juſt as many different Actions of a <hi>Hero,</hi> which had no manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, ſave that they were done by one ſingle perſon.

                  <head>CHAP. III. An Explication of the foregoing Doctrine by an Inſtance.</head>
                  <p>AS for what has been ſaid, you may conſult what the Practice of the <hi>Poets</hi> was, when they compos'd the Works we have been ſpeaking of. After the <hi>Fable</hi> was invented, and the <hi>Names</hi> impos'd on the Perſonages, the Author was to conſider all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Action, and what parts were fineſt and moſt ſuitable to the Movements of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> and to his own deſign; and then he was to make as many parts of his Repreſentation, as there were diſtinct Narrations between the Songs of the <hi>Chorus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To give you a famous Inſtance of this, and ſuch an Inſtance as is well known to the whole World, we will make uſe of <hi>Seneca's Oedipus,</hi> without minding the ſeveral Abſurdities that are therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oedipus</hi> begs the Gods to tell him the means of putting a ſtop to the Plague that then rag'd at <hi>Thebes:</hi> The Oracle returns him this Anſwer, <hi>That the Death of King Laïus his Predeceſſor muſt be Reveng'd.</hi> He makes enquiry after the Murderers, and finds, that he was not only guilty of this Man's Death, but beſides was the very Son of <hi>Laïus,</hi> whom he had Murder'd, and of <hi>Jocasta</hi> his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53904:51"/>
Widow, whom he had Marry'd. He puniſhes himſelf ſeverely for it, and by this means reſtores the Health of his Country.</p>
                  <p>You ſee then this Famous <hi>Fable,</hi> and in truth the moſt juſt, and the beſt invented, as to the <hi>Moral,</hi> and the <hi>Theatral</hi> part, of any Antiquity can boaſt of.</p>

                     <hi>Grecians,</hi> for whom it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, were extremely pleas'd to ſee the Crimes and the Misfortunes of Kings: And the Moral inſtruction, that was moſt in Vogue at that time, was ſuch a one as did beget in Men an Averſion to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and a love to <hi>Democracy,</hi> which they call'd liberty. What the <hi>Poets</hi> feign'd of <hi>Oedipus</hi> contain'd all theſe things; and was very proper to prevent the Grandees from Aſpiring to Tyranny, and to inſpire others with a Reſolution never to endure it.</p>
                  <p>This Fable being thus conceiv'd has very naturally theſe five parts. The firſt comprehends the Misfortunes of the People. The ſecond is the Enquiry into the Cauſe and the Remedy of theſe Misfortunes. The third is the Diſcovery thereof. The fourth is the Effect of this Diſcovery, and the performance of what the Gods requir'd, namely the puniſhing thoſe Crimes, that had been the Cauſe of the Ills which the People ſuffer'd. And the fifth is the Cure and Joy that ought to be the Conſequence of the Repentance and Puniſhment of <hi>Oedipus.</hi>

                  <p>But this laſt part was very improper for the <hi>Theatre.</hi> The Calm and Languiſhing Paſſions, of which the ſpectators upon this occaſion were hardly capable, would have enervated and ſpoil'd the Beauty of thoſe violent Paſſions ſo proper to <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and with which the Audience were to be inſpir'd. The <hi>Poet</hi> then was not to make an exact <hi>Epiſode</hi> of this laſt part. On the other hand, he has divided the ſecond part into two, and has ſupply'd his five Acts in the following Method.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Plague rag'd in the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and brought ſo many Miſeries and dreadful Deaths upon them, that King <hi>Oedipus,</hi> touch'd with the Misfortune of his Subjects, would freely have left the Kingdom: But he hopes for ſome Relief from the Oracle he has ſent to conſult, and attends its Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Creon</hi> brings him the Anſwer, and informs him, That the Cauſe of the <hi>Thebans</hi> Misfortunes, is the Murder committed upon the perſon of his Predeceſſor King <hi>Laïus:</hi> And that the Remedy is the puniſhing of the Murderer. <hi>Oedipus</hi> ſets himſelf upon his duty of puniſhing the Offence: And to diſcover who this Murderer was, whom no body as yet knew, he orders <hi>Tireſias</hi> to be ſent for. This Prieſt began by a Sacrifice, but that made no diſcovery of the thing in queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He then had recourſe to more powerful means. He calls up from the ſhades below the Ghoſt of <hi>Laïus,</hi> who diſcovers to him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53904:51"/>
that King <hi>Oedipus</hi> is the Aſſaſſin that ought to be puniſhed; and moreover, that this Prince, who thought himſelf innocent, was at the ſame time guilty of Inceſt and Parricide. But <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> inform'd of this only by <hi>Creon,</hi> and ſuppoſing he was born at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Son to King <hi>Polybus</hi> and Queen <hi>Meropa,</hi> is very confident of his own Innocence, and gives no Credit to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>Creon</hi> made him. He is perſwaded 'tis a Falſhood invented to out him of the Kingdom, to which <hi>Creon</hi> was next Heir.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But at laſt he underſtands that he did kill <hi>Laïus,</hi> and was his Son, and <hi>Jocaſta's,</hi> whom he had ignorantly married.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He puniſhes himſelf ſeverely, plucks out his own eyes, goes into Exile, and ſo reſtores Health and Quietneſs to his People.</p>

                     <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> makes between them is, that the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes</hi> of <hi>Tragedy</hi> are ſhorteſt, and the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes</hi> in theſe great Poems are by much the longeſt. So ſlight a Difference ſhould be no hinderance to our ſpeaking of both after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>This Word, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is capable of three diſtinct Meanings. The firſt ariſes from that Enumeration of all the parts of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which we mention'd. For if there are only four parts, viz. <hi>The Prologue, the Chorus, the Epiſode, and the Epilogue;</hi> it follows, that the <hi>Epiſode</hi> in <hi>Tragedy</hi> is whatever does not make up the other three; and that if you ſubſtract thoſe three, the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſode</hi> neceſſarily comprehends all that remains. And ſince in our times they make <hi>Tragedies</hi> without either <hi>Chorus, Prologue,</hi> or <hi>Epilogue;</hi> this Term <hi>Epiſode</hi> ſignifies all the <hi>Tragedy</hi> which is made now-a-days. So likewiſe the <hi>Epick Epiſode</hi> will be the whole Poem. There is nothing to be ſubſtracted thence, but the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> and the <hi>Invocation,</hi> which are inſtead of the <hi>Prologue.</hi> In this ſenſe the <hi>Epopéa</hi> and <hi>Tragedy</hi> have each of them but one ſingle <hi>Epiſode,</hi> or rather, are nothing elſe but an <hi>Epiſode:</hi> and if the Parts and Incidents of which the Poet compoſes his Work have an ill Connexion together, then the Poem will be <hi>Epiſodical</hi> and defective, as we hinted before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53904:52"/>
But as all that was ſung in <hi>Tragedy</hi> was, according to <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Expreſſion, call'd the <hi>Chorus</hi> in the Singular Number; and yet its being in the Singular was no reaſon why each part (when it was divided into ſeveral) ſhould not be call'd the <hi>Chorus</hi> too; and ſo ſeveral <hi>Chorus</hi>'s be introduc'd: juſt ſo in the <hi>Epiſode,</hi> each Incident, and each part of the Fable and the Action, is not only ſtil'd a part of the <hi>Epiſode,</hi> but even an <hi>Entire Epiſode.</hi> 'Tis in this ſenſe that <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us of a third ſort of <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> when he ſays, that whatever is comprehended and expreſt in the firſt Platform of the Fable is <hi>Proper,</hi> and the other Things are <hi>Epiſodes.</hi>

                        </gap> Ibid.</note> This is what he ſays juſt after he had propos'd the Model of the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> We muſt then in the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> it ſelf examine what this third ſort of <hi>Epiſode</hi> is, the better to know wherein it differs from the ſecond. We ſhall ſee how the Incidents he calls <hi>proper,</hi> are abſolutely neceſſary: and how thoſe, which he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes by the Name of <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> are in one ſenſe neceſſary and probable; and in another ſenſe not at all neceſſary, but ſuch as the Poet had liberty to make uſe of, or not.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Homer</hi> had laid the firſt Ground-work of the Fable, and prepar'd the Model, ſuch as we have obſerv'd it to be, it was not then at his Choice to make or not make <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> abſent from his Country. This Abſence was Eſſential: <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtiles and places it among thoſe things that are proper to the Fable. But the Adventure of <hi>Antiphates,</hi> that of <hi>Circe,</hi> of the <hi>Sirens,</hi> of <hi>Scylla,</hi> of <hi>Charybdis,</hi> &amp;c. he does not call ſuch. The Poet was left at his full liberty to have made choice of any other, as well as theſe things. So that, they are only probable, and ſuch <hi>Epiſodes</hi> as are diſtinct from the main Action, to which in this ſenſe they are neither proper nor neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſee in what ſenſe they are neceſſary thereto. Since the Abſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was neceſſary, it follows, that not being at home, he muſt be ſomewhere elſe. Though then the Poet had his liberty to make uſe of none of theſe particular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures we mention'd, and he made choice of; yet had he not an abſolute liberty of making uſe of none at all: but if he had omitted theſe, he had been neceſſarlly oblig'd to ſubſtitute others
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53904:52"/>
in their room; otherwiſe he would have left out part of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> contain'd in his Model, and his Poem would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</p>
                  <p>This laſt ſenſe of the Word <hi>Epiſode</hi> is not ſo different from the ſecond as it ſeems at firſt ſight, ſince it ſtill informs us that an <hi>Epiſode</hi> is a neceſſary part of the <hi>Action.</hi> The difference between them lies in this, that an <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the ſecond ſenſe is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Ground-work of the <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the third Senſe: and that this third Senſe adds to the ſecond the probable Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Places, Princes, and People, where and among whom he was caſt by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and abode during his Abſence from <hi>Ithaca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt likewiſe take notice, that in this third Senſe, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which ſerves as a Foundation to an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> ought to be of ſome Extent and Compaſs, and that without this an Eſſential part of the Action and Fable is not an <hi>Epiſode.</hi> As in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Oedipus</hi> which we propos'd; the Cure of the <hi>Thebans</hi> is a part proper and eſſential to the Fable, and would be an <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the ſecond Senſe. But becauſe the Poet has not amplified this Incident by any Circumſtance, therefore 'tis not an <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the third Senſe: 'tis only the Foundation of ſuch an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> which the Poet made no uſe of. This Obſervation makes it clear, that in reality the firſt Platform of the Action contains only what is proper and neceſſary to the Fable, and has not any <hi>Epiſode;</hi> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays of the Model he has given us of the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore in this third Senſe we are to underſtand the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which orders us not to form the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> till after we have made Choice of the Names we would give our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages. <hi>Homer</hi> could not have ſpoken of a Fleet and Navy, as he has, if inſtead of the Names of <hi>Achilles, Agamemnon,</hi> and the <hi>Iliad,</hi> he had made choice of thoſe of <hi>Capaneus, Adraſtus,</hi> and the <hi>Thebaid,</hi> as he might have done without ſpoiling the Eſſence of the Fable.</p>
                  <p>If one ſhould form an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> whereof not only the Names and Circumſtances were not neceſſary, but whoſe very Ground-work and Foundation was not a part of the Action, that ſerves for the Subject-Matter of a Poem: then this <hi>Epiſode</hi> would have a ſorry Connexion, and would render the Fable <hi>Epiſodical.</hi> This Irregularity is diſcernable, when one can ſo take away a whole <hi>Epiſode,</hi> without ſubſtituting any thing in its room, that this Subſtraction ſhall make no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> nor Defect in the Poem. The Story of <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> inſerted in the <hi>Thebaid,</hi> is an Inſtance of theſe defective <hi>Epiſodes.</hi> If the whole Narration of this famous Matron were taken away, the Sequel of the main Action would be but ſo much the better; one ſhould not perceive that the Poet had forgot any thing, or wanted the leaſt Member of the Body of his Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:53904:53"/>
But ſuppoſe any one ſhould ſay, <q>That if theſe particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents were natural and neceſſary Members, it would thence follow, that they would not be foreign, extraneous, additional, and inſerted Pieces.</q> To this I anſwer, that all this is true; but withall, that the Thing has retain'd its original and native Name, though it has quite loſt its Nature. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who as well as others has retain'd this dubious Term, preſcribes the Rules of <hi>Tragedy</hi> under the Name of <hi>Epiſode.</hi> Therefore in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, wherein I only follow his Precepts, I am oblig'd to take every thing in his ſenſe, and not ſpoil the Nature of the Things, which he explains, by a ſuperſtitious adhering to a Word that has chang'd its Nature ever ſince its firſt Riſe.</p>
                  <p>I will maintain then that the Word <hi>Epiſode</hi> in the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> does not ſignifie in extraneous foreign Peice, even in <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> opinion: but that it ſignifies the whole Narration of the Poet, or a neceſſary and eſſential part of the Action and the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, extended and amplified by probable Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>This Concluſion deſerves a more particular Examination.</p>

enrag'd and pacified perſon, where every thing was tranſacted in one and the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>This Length of the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> compar'd to that of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> would ſtill hold good, though we ſhould ſubſtract from it the ſeveral Years which precede the opening of the Poem; and began the Action only at the time of the firſt Council of the Gods.

                     <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf the Lye, who ſays, <hi>That his Subject contains the Voyages and Travels of a Man, who after the taking of</hi> Troy, <hi>ſaw ſeveral Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and knew the Cuſtoms of a great many States and People:</hi> he ſays, that <hi>he ſuffer'd much by Sea, and did all he could to ſecure the Return of his Attendants as well as of himſelf.</hi> Now all this did not happen ſince the firſt Council of the Gods. Then, there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whole Years, in which he never ſo much as thought of his Attendants, for they were all deſtroy'd. And ſince that, there happen'd but one Tempeſt, and he viſited no more than one City. Theſe ſeven Years then, and all the Adventures, the Travels, and the Tempeſts which preceeded, from the Ruin of <hi>Troy</hi> down to that time, are not extraneous, foreign, or additional Pieces; but are with the reſt the Subject of the Poem. And yet they are <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſerts in theſe Words, <hi>The reſt are Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes:</hi> for this <hi>Reſt</hi> is all that he did not name in particular. Now he ſpoke only in general, of the Abſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> of the Storms he met with, of the Diſturbances of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and of the Re-eſtabliſhment of this Prince.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, when we diſcours'd of the Nature of the Fable, we there took notice of the abſolute Neceſſity the Poet lay under of keeping <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> from his Country a very long time; of ordering his Abſence as cauſed by the Storms he met with; of caſting this Hero upon ſeveral different Countries; of raiſing great Diſorders in <hi>Ithaca;</hi> of making an Example of his Enemies by puniſhing them; and of re-eſtabliſhing the Prince himſelf. This was ſo far neceſſary to the Subject, that the Poet was not left to his Liberty of changing it, without deſtroying his Deſign, ſpoiling his Fable, and making another Poem of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:53904:54"/>
But though it was neceſſary that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſhould be with ſtrange Princes for ſeveral Years; yet it was not neceſſary that one of theſe Princes ſhould be <hi>Antiphates,</hi> another <hi>Alcinous;</hi> nor that the Nymph <hi>Calypſo,</hi> and the Enchantreſs <hi>Circe</hi> ſhould be his Hoſteſſes. One might have changed theſe Perſons and States into others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing the Deſign and the Fable. Thus, though theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures were part of the Subject after the Poet's Choice of them, yet they were not proper to the Subject.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe neceſſary to the Subject, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and puniſh his Wife's Courtiers; but 'tis neither proper nor neceſſary that he ſhould kill them with Javelins, as they were at Supper in his Houſe, at Night too, and none to aſſiſt him but his Son and two or three of his Domeſtics. He might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at the Head of an Army, and without the leaſt Surprize have kill'd them with his drawn Sword at their own Houſes, or in the open Field. But yet will any Man ſay, that his killing them with Javelins is not part of the Subject?</p>
                  <p>In a word, the Revenge he takes, and the puniſhing of theſe Miſcreants, expreſt in ſhort, as we ſee it in the Model <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has left us, is a ſimple Action proper and neceſſary to the Subject. It is not an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> but the Foundation and Soul of an <hi>Epiſode:</hi> and this ſame Puniſhment explain'd and amplified with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Times, Places, and Perſons, is not a ſimple and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Action, but an <hi>Epiſodiz'd Action,</hi> and a true <hi>Epiſode:</hi> And though the Poet is left at his Freedom and Choice therein, yet it does not follow that the <hi>Epiſode</hi> is form'd upon a leſs proper and neceſſary Foundation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in this laſt Senſe, and of this only ſort of <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> we ſhall generally ſpeak.</p>

                  <p>AFter what has been ſaid, we may very well infer, <hi>That</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes <hi>are neceſſary Parts of the Action, extended by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Circumſtances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Epiſode</hi> is but a part of an Action, and not an entire one; like that of <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> in <hi>Statius,</hi> which renders this Poem defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and <hi>Epiſodical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That part of the Action which ſerves for a Foundation to the <hi>Epiſode,</hi> ought not to continue in its Simplicity; ſuch as it is in the General related in the firſt Draught of the Fable. <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53904:55"/>
having recounted the Parts of the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> ſays expreſly, that <hi>they are proper:</hi> and in this Caſe diſtinguiſhes them from the <hi>Epiſodes.</hi> Thus in the Inſtance of <hi>Oedipus</hi> which we produc'd, we ſaid, that the Cure of the <hi>Thebans</hi> is not an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Foundation and Subject of an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> which the Poet made no uſe of. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (by ſaying that <hi>Homer</hi> in the <hi>Iliad</hi> has taken but a few Things for his Subject, but that <hi>he has made uſe of a great many Epiſodes)</hi> does inform us, that the Subject contains in it ſelf a great many <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which the Poet may or may not make uſe of. That is, it contains the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, which one may leave in its general and ſimple Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Seneca</hi> has done the Cure of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> or which one may enlarge and explain, as the ſame Author has done the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of <hi>Oedipus.</hi> In this laſt way 'tis that the Poet makes uſe of them, and forms juſt <hi>Epiſodes</hi> out of them.</p>
                  <p>The Subject of a Poem may be long after two ways: the firſt is, when the Poet makes uſe of a great many of its <hi>Epiſodes:</hi> and the other is, when he gives to each a conſiderable Extent. 'Tis by this Method, that the <hi>Epick</hi> Poets extend their Poems a great deal more than the <hi>Dramatick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt likewiſe take notice, that there are ſome parts of an Action which of themſelves do naturally preſent us but with one ſingle <hi>Epiſode;</hi> as, the Death of <hi>Hector,</hi> that of <hi>Turnus,</hi> &amp;c. There are likewiſe more fertile parts of the Fable, which oblige the Poet to form ſeveral <hi>Epiſodes</hi> of each part, though in the firſt Model they are expreſt in as ſimple a manner as the reſt. Such are, the Fight between the <hi>Trojans</hi> and the <hi>Grecians;</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> the Travels of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the Abſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> from his own Country during ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years together, does neceſſarily require his Preſence elſewhere; and the Deſign of the Fable obliges him to be caſt into ſeveral Dangers, and upon ſeveral States. Now each Danger, and each State, furniſhes Matter for an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> which the Poet may make uſe of, if he pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>We conclude then, that <hi>Epiſodes</hi> are not Actions, but the parts of an Action: That they are not added to the Action, and the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Poem; but that they conſtitute this Action and this Matter, as the Members of the Body conſtitute the Matter of it: That upon this Account they are not deduc'd from any thing elſe, but the very Foundation of the Action: That they are not united and connected to the Action, but to one another: That all the parts of an Action are not ſo many <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> but only ſuch as are amplified and extended by particular Circumſtances, and in the manner whereby the Poet rehearſes a Thing: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this Union between each other, is neceſſary in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Epiſode,</hi> and probable in the Circumſtances.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the <hi>Action.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are four Qualifications in the <hi>Epick Action:</hi> the firſt is its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> the ſecond its <hi>Integrity;</hi> the third its <hi>Importance;</hi> and the fourth its <hi>Duration.</hi> We will begin with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>In this place we ſhall conſider the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the firſt Draught and Model of the Fable, but in the extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>Epiſodiz'd Action.</hi> And in truth, if the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> are not added to the Action, but on the contrary are the neceſſary parts thereof; it is plain, that they ought to be comprehended in it, and its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> ſtill preſerv'd: And the Fables which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Epiſodical</hi> are ſuch, wherein ſome <hi>Epiſodes</hi> that are foreign, and not duly connected, add ſome Actions to the Action of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, and ſo ſpoil the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Epick Action,</hi> as well as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Fable,</hi> does not conſiſt either in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Hero,</hi> or in <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Time:</hi> This is what we have already taken notice of. But 'tis eaſier to tell wherein it does not conſiſt, than 'tis to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover wherein it does.</p>
                  <p>From the Idea I have conceived thereof by reading our Authors, theſe three things, I ſuppoſe, are neceſſary thereto. The firſt is, to make uſe of no <hi>Epiſode,</hi> but what ariſes from the very Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and Foundation of the Action, and is as it were a Natural Member of this Body. The ſecond is, exactly to unite theſe <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes,</hi> and theſe Members, with one another. And the third is, never to finiſh any <hi>Epiſode</hi> ſo as it may ſeem to be an entire Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but to let each <hi>Epiſode</hi> ſtill appear in its own particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Member of a Body, and as a Part of it ſelf not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                  <p>We have already eſtabliſhed the firſt of theſe three Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the Doctrine we laid down concerning the <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> and perhaps enough has been ſaid about it: but yet we will clear up this Doctrine by ſome Inſtances taken from the principal <hi>Epiſodes</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Scheme we have drawn of the Fable and Action of this Poem, we have obſerved, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ought of neceſſity to be a King newly elected, and the Founder of an Empire rais'd upon the Ruins of a decay'd State: that this Prince ſhould be oppos'd by wicked Men: and laſtly, that he ſhould be eſtabliſhed by Piety and the Force of Arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53904:56"/>
The firſt part of this Action is the Alteration of a State, of a King, and of a Prieſt. And this is <hi>Virgil</hi>'s firſt <hi>Epiſode,</hi> contain'd in his ſecond Book, wherein the <note n="*" place="margin">Sacra ſuoſque tibi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat Troja penates: Hos cape fatorum comites, his moenia quaere, <hi>&amp;c. Aeneid.</hi> 2.</note> Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Subverſion of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Empire in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Death of King <hi>Priam,</hi> and of the Prieſt <hi>Panthus.</hi> To all this he adds the Choice which both Gods and Men make of <hi>Aeneas</hi> to be the Succeſſor of theſe two deceaſed Perſons, and to re-eſtabliſh the Empire of the <hi>Trojans</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Action begins, when <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſets himſelf upon his Duty, executes the Orders he receives, and marches for <hi>Italy. Virgil</hi> has plac'd almoſt all this ſecond <hi>Epiſode</hi> in his third Book: the reſt lies in the firſt, in the fifth, and in the beginning of the ſeventh.</p>
                  <p>The third part of the Action is the Eſtabliſhing <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws. Religion</hi> conſiſts in Sacrifices, in Funeral Rites, and Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Sports. <hi>Aeneas</hi> performed all theſe; and the <note n="†" place="margin">Hac caſti maneant in relligione Nepotes. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 3.</note> Poet took care from time to time to advertiſe his Readers, that theſe Ceremonies were not to be conſider'd as ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Actions, or as the ſimple Effects of the Hero's Piety upon ſome particular Occaſions; but as ſacred Rites, which he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <note n="‡" place="margin">Hinc maxima porro Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit Roma, &amp; patrium ſervavit honorem. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 5.</note> transfer into <hi>Italy</hi> under the Quality of the <hi>Founder of the Roman Empire.</hi> By this means, no body can doubt of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor take theſe Acts of <hi>Religion,</hi> and theſe <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> for any thing elſe but the neceſſary and eſſential Parts of his <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi> This Part furniſhes the Poet with ſeveral <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which he diſtributes into ſeveral parts of his Work; as in the third Book, where <hi>Aeneas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from <hi>Helenus</hi> the Ceremonies which hereafter he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to inſtitute: in the fifth, where he celebrates the Sports hard by his Father's Tomb: And elſewhere almoſt throughout the whole Poem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> deſign'd his ſixth Book for the other part about <hi>Laws,</hi> viz. for the Morality, for the Politicks, and for the forming ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius as was to animate the Body-Politick of the <hi>Roman</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>After theſe parts of the <hi>Action,</hi> which contain the performance of the Hero's Deſigns, we are to conſider likewiſe the Obſtacles he meets with, which make up the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of the Action. Theſe Obſtacles are the Effects of <hi>Juno</hi>'s Paſſion. And we might ſay, that this Oppoſition is no leſs proper to the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Neptune</hi> is to the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> Now we obſerv'd that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placed the Anger of this God in the firſt Draught of the Greek Poem among the Incidents that are proper to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53904:56"/>
The firſt of theſe <hi>Intrigues,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable Obſtacle of all, is that of <hi>Dido,</hi> which takes up the firſt and fourth Book. The ſecond is the Burning of his Fleet in the fifth Book. The third is the Love, the Ambition, and the Valour of <hi>Turnus.</hi> This laſt ſupply'd him with a great many <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> being the Cauſe of all the War <hi>Aeneas</hi> met with in <hi>Italy.</hi> It begins at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book, and is not over till the End of the Poem. 'Tis thus that the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> are deduc'd from the Fable and the very Eſſence of the Action.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Thing we ſaid was neceſſary for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action,</hi> is the Unity and the Connexion of the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> with one another. For beſides that Relation and Proportion which all the Members ought to have with one another, ſo as to conſtitute but one Body, which ſhould be homogeneous in all its parts; 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd farther, that theſe Members ſhould be, not contiguous as if they were cut off and clap'd together again, but uninterrupted and duly connected. Without this, the natural Members would not make up that Union, which is neceſſary to conſtitute a Body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Continuity</hi> and Situation of <hi>Epiſodes</hi> is not exact, when they only follow one another: but they ſhould be plac'd one after another ſo as the firſt ſhall either be neceſſarily or probably the Cauſe of that which follows. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> finds fault with Incidents that are without any Conſequence or Connexion; and he ſays that <hi>the Poems, wherein ſuch ſorts of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodes are, offend againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> He brings, as an Inſtance of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Wound which <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> receiv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> and the Folly he counterfeited before the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes: becauſe one of theſe Incidents could not have happen'd as a Conſequence of the other; <hi>Homer</hi> could not have given them a neceſſary Connexion and Continuity: nor has he ſpoil'd the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> by ſuch a Mixture.</p>
                  <p>But he gives us a compleat Inſtance of the <hi>Continuity</hi> we ſpeak of, in the Method whereby he has connected the two parts of his <hi>Iliad;</hi> which are the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> againſt <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and the Anger of the ſame Hero againſt <hi>Hector.</hi> The Poet would not have duly connected theſe two <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> if before the Death of <hi>Patroclus, Achilles</hi> had been leſs inexorable, and had accepted of the Satisfaction <hi>Agamemnon</hi> offer'd him. This would have made two Angers and two Revenges quite different from, and independent of one another. And though both had been neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and eſſential to the Fable, to make it appear what Miſchiefs Diſcord, and what Advantages Concord is the Cauſe of: Yet the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> would have been only in the Fable, but the Action would have been double and <hi>Epiſodical:</hi> becauſe the firſt <hi>Epiſode</hi> would
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53904:57"/>
not have been the Cauſe of the ſecond, nor the ſecond a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two parts of the <hi>Ilaid</hi> are joyn'd together very regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If <hi>Achilles</hi> had never fell out with <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> he would have fought in perſon, and not have expos'd his Friend ſingly againſt <hi>Hector,</hi> under thoſe Arms that were the cauſe of this Young man's Raſhneſs and Death. And beſides, the better to joyn theſe two parts with one another, the ſecond is begun a great while before one ſees what Event the firſt ought to have. All the Articles of the Reconciliation are propos'd, and one might ſay, that this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, with reſpect to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> is made before the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and even before it was ever thought of expoſing him to a Battel. There was nothing more wanting but <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Conſent: and ſince that was not given till the Death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> had made him reſolve upon that of <hi>Hector;</hi> it may be truly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Anger and the Revenge of <hi>Achilles</hi> againſt <hi>Hector,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the ſecond part of the Poem, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe of the Reconciliation, which finiſh'd the firſt part.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of a Body, it is not enough that all its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be natural, and duly united and compacted together; 'tis far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requiſite, that each Member ſhould be no more than a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; an imperfect Part, and not a finiſh'd compleat Body. This is the third Qualification we ſaid was neceſſary to preſerve <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Epick Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this Doctrine, we muſt take notice that an Action may be entire and compleat two ways: The firſt is, by perfectly compleating it, and making it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entire with reſpect to the principal Perſons that are intereſted therein, and in the principal Circumſtances which are employ'd about it. The ſecond way is by compleating it only with reſpect to ſome Perſons, and in ſome Circumſtances that are leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. This ſecond way preſerves the Action in its regular <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> the other deſtroys it. We will give you an Inſtance of each.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> were aſſembled together to revenge the Affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> and to force the <hi>Trojans</hi> to reſtore him his Wife, whom <hi>Paris</hi> had ſtollen away. There happens a Difference between <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles.</hi> This laſt being highly incens'd, abandons the Common Cauſe, and withdraws himſelf; ſo that in his Abſence <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Army was worſted by the <hi>Trojans.</hi> But the Boldneſs of the King of Kings puts him upon engaging the Enemy without <hi>Achilles.</hi> Away he marches to give them a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſault with all his Forces.</p>
                  <p>The Fight began with the Duel between <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi> They ſight without Seconds, upon Condition that <hi>Helen</hi> ſhould be the Conquerour's; and the War decided by this Combat. Tho' the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> was the Cauſe of this Combat, and whatever Intereſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53904:57"/>
he might have therein; yet 'tis plain, that <hi>Menelaus, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> are ſo far the principal Perſonages concern'd, that if this Action had been finiſhed with reſpect to them, it would have been quite finiſh'd: it would not have made a part of the Action and of the Revenge of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but a compleat Action; which would have put an End to the Revenge, and render'd the Anger of this Hero ineffectual. Therefore <hi>Homer</hi> has not finiſh'd this Action: <hi>Paris</hi> being hard put to it eſcapes, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> is wounded with a Dart by <hi>Pandarus;</hi> by this means <hi>Achilles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be reveng'd, and this Incident becomes an exact <hi>Epiſode.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has manag'd the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Dido</hi> another way. He has finiſh'd it ſo, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of his main Action is as Regular as the Art of Poetry requires. The Addreſs of this great Poet conſiſts in ordering it ſo, that <hi>Dido,</hi> in whom this Incident is compleat, was not the chief Perſonage; and her Marriage was only a ſimple Circumſtance of an Action, that is not finiſh'd, and yet is the Soul and the only Foundation of this particular Action: in a word, <hi>Aeneas</hi> is the Hero of this <hi>Epiſode,</hi> which is only invented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the Settlement of this Hero in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is manifeſt, if we would but reflect on what the Skill and Care of the Poet has left us about it. <hi>Juno,</hi> who carried on all this Intrigue, was very little concern'd for <hi>Dido</hi>'s Happineſs. If ſhe had lov'd her ſo well, ſhe ſhould have diverted the <hi>Trojan</hi> Fleet from her Coaſts; upon which place ſhe her ſelf did caſt them, <note n="*" place="margin">Foelix, heu! nimium foelix, ſi littora tantum, Nunquam Dardaniae teti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſſent noſtra carinae. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 4.</note> which was the only Cauſe of this Queens Miſeries. When ſhe propoſes the Match to <hi>Venus</hi> with ſo much Ardency, 'twas only the top of her Countenance. <note n="†" place="margin">Senſit enim ſimulatâ mente locutam, Quo regnum Italiae Liby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas averteret oras.</note> Her whole Aim was to keep <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and to beſtow on <hi>Carthage</hi> the Empire of the World, which belonged only to <hi>Italy,</hi> and depended upon the Stars of this Hero. You ſee then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing ſhe drives at, the reſt is only counterfeit, and a Means whereby ſhe endeavours to accompliſh this End.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dido</hi> her ſelf makes it appear how leſs conſiderable her Perſon is than that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and that ſhe is only brought in to hinder the Deſigns of this Prince. 'Tis ſhe, that courts him, and would have him for her King, Husband, and Protector, againſt the Rage of her Brother and the Incurſions of <hi>Iarbas.</hi> But ſhe could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain a Marriage for a Month or ſo, as was cuſtomary now and then in thoſe times. <hi>Aeneas</hi> tells her plainly, that the Name of Husband ſhould be no Hinderance to his Departure, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for <hi>Italy:</hi> and he declares, that this Condition of not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Carthage</hi> was not in the Articles of their Alliance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53904:58"/>
The more an <hi>Epiſode</hi> may ſeem to be a compleat Action, the more care ſhould the Poet take to prepare the Reader's mind, before he engages him in it. This is what <hi>Virgil</hi> did in the <hi>Epiſode</hi> we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. All the beginning of the firſt Book does ſufficiently inform the Reader, that the Stay of <hi>Aeneas</hi> at <hi>Carthage</hi> was only a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance and conſtraint which he was forced to ſubmit to. The Poet is likewiſe obliged to repeat this Advertiſement at the beginning of theſe <hi>Epiſodes;</hi> that ſo the Reader may know to what the Poet engages him. Thus the <hi>Trojans</hi> were ſcarce got to <hi>Carthage,</hi> but they give out that their Deſign is for <hi>Italy.</hi> And before <hi>Dido</hi> made the leaſt ſhew of her Deſigns upon <hi>Aeneas;</hi> the Poet ſpends the ſecond and third Books to inform us of this Hero's Deſign, and the neceſſity of his going to <hi>Italy,</hi> according to the Orders he received from the Oracles and the Gods. All this is declar'd in his Speech to <hi>Dido</hi> her ſelf. To conclude, All this <hi>Epiſode</hi> is ſo full of this main Deſign, that the Poet is not willing we ſhould loſe the ſight of it for a Moment. Therefore <hi>Aeneas</hi> is doubtleſs the Hero of this <hi>Epiſode:</hi> and we ought to look upon this Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rather as an Obſtacle laid to hinder the Settlement of the <hi>Trojans</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> as the Hiſtory of <hi>Dido,</hi> in whom it is a compleat Action.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that is corrupted by <hi>Epiſodes</hi> that are irregular all theſe three ways: that is, firſt ſuch as are deriv'd from ſomething elſe beſides the Action; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuch as have no Connexion with the reſt of the Poem, nor with the Members and Parts, which are the Matter thereof; and laſtly, ſuch as are compleat Actions, independent from the Subject. Theſe vicious and ſuperfluous <hi>Epiſodes</hi> may be met with not only in the <hi>Middle</hi> of the <hi>Poem,</hi> but at the <hi>Beginning</hi> and the <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Thebaid</hi> of <hi>Statius</hi> furniſhes us with all theſe Inſtances, as his <hi>Achilleid</hi> has already afforded us an Inſtance of that falſe <hi>

                     <hi>Action</hi> our Poet would relate, and the <hi>Subject-Matter</hi> of the <hi>Thebaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But obſerve another Action, or rather another Story. The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Venus</hi> is offended with the Inhabitants of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> becauſe in all that Iſland ſhe had neither Temple, Altar, nor Sacrifice. At firſt ſhe puts the Men out of conceit with their Wives; and then ſhe makes the Women ſo mad, as to conſpire the Death of all their Husbands. This Barbarous Reſolution is moſt unmercifully put in Execution. <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> was the only Woman who had ſecretly ſaved her Father King <hi>Troas,</hi> and ſo ingeniouſly diſſembles the having Murder'd him, that the reſt confer the Kingdom upon her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Family.</p>
                  <p>A little after the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> going in queſt of the Golden-Fleece, are forc'd by a Storm to call in and recruit themſelves at <hi>Lemnos.</hi> They were very kindly entertain'd there, and the badneſs of the ſeaſon gave <hi>Jaſon,</hi> the chief of theſe <hi>Hero's,</hi> an opportunity of leaving <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> big with Twins, before he put off to Sea.</p>
                  <p>She was ſcarce brought to bed, but 'twas told her Subjects, that they had been cheated, and that King <hi>Troas</hi> was alive, and reign'd in the Iſle of <hi>Chios,</hi> whither <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> had convey'd him, tho' ſhe had pretended ſhe had murder'd him. This made the Princeſs ſo odious, that fearing the fury of thoſe Women ſhe fled to the Sea-ſhore, where ſhe was ſeiz'd on and carry'd off by Pirates. They beſtow her on King <hi>Lyeurgus,</hi> who makes her the Nurſe of his Son <hi>Archemorus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The State of this Prince border'd upon <hi>Thebes,</hi> and lay in the Road the Army of <hi>Adraſtus</hi> was to paſs thither. The <hi>Greeks</hi> met with this famous Nurſe as ſhe was alone with her Nurſery in a Wood. They were extreme thirſty, all the Wells being dry'd up by the ſcorching Seaſons. They intreat her to give them ſome relief; ſhe grants their requeſt, and brings them to a Fountain that never was drain'd. She was ſo forward, that to make the more haſt to this wiſh'd for Stream, ſhe eaſes her ſelf of her precious burden with which ſhe was intruſted, and leaves <hi>Archemorus</hi> all alone upon the Graſs.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53904:59"/>
She goes to quench the <hi>Grecians</hi> Thirſt; and then to ſatisfie the deſire they had of knowing who ſhe was, that had been the ſaving of them, ſhe makes a large Recital of her own Life.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe had made an end, and receiv'd the Compliments of <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> ſhe returns back to her Prince. But a frightful Serpent had kill'd him by a blow with his Tail. The <hi>Greeks</hi> kill the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and in honour of the Dead Prince make a ſplendid Funeral, and inſtitute moſt magnificent ſports, which take up a whole book of the <hi>Thebaid.</hi> The Recitals of <hi>Hypſipyle,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Archemorus</hi> fill up another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are foreign <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> and if they are Regular, I cannot imagine what uſe the Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> can be of in this buſineſs. But let us ſee whether theſe Incidents have ſo much as one ſingle Qualification of thoſe which I propos'd as neceſſary to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Qualifications is that an <hi>Epiſode</hi> be proper and drawn from the very Eſſence of the Fable and the Subject. It would be hard to invent an Adventure more foreign to the War of the <hi>Theban</hi> Brothers, than all this ſtory of <hi>Lemnos.</hi> For what Affinity has the Anger of <hi>Venus,</hi> the butchering of the <hi>Lemnians,</hi> the Deſigns of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and the Amours of <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Hypſipyle,</hi> with the Quarrel between <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices?</hi> To make a mix'd medly of ſuch various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, is juſt like forming one of <note n="*" place="margin">Humano capiticervicem pictor equinam Jungere ſi velit, &amp; varias inducere plumas, Undique collatis membris, &amp;c. <hi>Hor.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi>'s Monſters: And never would a Woman's Head clap'd on to a Horſe's Neck appear more Monſtrous, than does this <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> tack'd to the War of <hi>Thebes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this Poem. This is the firſt and moſt Eſſential fault of this <hi>Epiſode.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is in the Connexion, which is not at all in the <hi>Thebaid,</hi> things being clap'd together without the leaſt neceſſity or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. For pray what part of the ſubject of the <hi>Thebaid</hi> is either the Cauſe, or the Effect of the Maſſacre at <hi>Lemnos?</hi> Or of any of the Adventures of <hi>Jaſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true <hi>Hypſipyle</hi> makes this Recital to the <hi>Argives,</hi> as they were going to infeſt <hi>Thebes;</hi> but there is a great deal of difference between connecting the Recital of an Action to ſomething, and connecting the very Action to it. If for the Introducing a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into the Body of a Poem, and connecting it thereto, ſo as to make a juſt <hi>Epiſode</hi> of it, 'tis enough that this Narration be made in the Preſence of the Hero, by ſome body that has ſome Intereſt therein; there would be no more need of Rules for the due <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting of Epiſodes.</hi> For a Poet to fail of making this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> exactly, it would not be enough that he were Ignorant and Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but he ſhould be ſomething more; he ſhould be Malicious, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53904:59"/>
declare poſitively againſt all Connexions whatever. For without 'twere ſo, he would not be eaſily inclined to ſtuff a whole book with the impertinent Deſcription of a Story that was nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſports of the ſixth Book of <hi>Statius</hi> are no leſs irregular. There is nothing in the Action to give them the leaſt Countenance. They have no reference to the War of <hi>Thebes,</hi> to the deſigns of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> nor to the mad Practices of <hi>Lemnos.</hi> Nor is it a Conſequence of the Stories of <hi>Hypſipyle;</hi> but rather a Conſequence of the Recital ſhe made of theſe Stories. They are tack'd to her Recital at one end, and at the other to the March of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> without the leaſt Neceſſity and Probability. And how could the fiery Tempers of <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Capaneus,</hi> and the hot Spirits of the other Commanders away with ſuch languiſhing and Godly Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and by conſequence ſo oppoſite to the very Soul of the Poem, which conſiſts altogether in Violence and Impiety?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true the March of the <hi>Argives</hi> was the Cauſe of his Death for whom they inſtituted theſe ſports: But that it ſhould not have been; and ſince this cauſe is no way neceſſary, and offends againſt all probability, 'tis rather a freſh Fault, than any Excuſe. <hi>Hypſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyle</hi> had ſo little a way to go from the place where ſhe left her Prince, to that whither ſhe conducted the <hi>Grecians;</hi> that from thence <note n="*" place="margin">Moriens vagitus in auras Excidit, &amp; ruptis immutuit ore querelis, Qualia non totas peragunt inſomnia voces. Audiit Hypſipyle.—</note> ſhe hears this Infant's ſhrill cry, when Death had almoſt ſtop'd his Mouth. Therefore if ſhe had had any concern for leaving <hi>Archemorus,</hi> ſhe ſhould not have ſtaid from him a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But could not a Souldier have leave to paſs a Compliment upon her for a few Minutes or ſo? To conclude, who did ever know a Nurſe ſo inconſiderate, as to leave her Child alone for ſeveral hours in the midſt of a Foreſt, to the mercy of wild Beaſts, expos'd to ſo many other Dangers; and to leave him in this manner without a Guard, thô ſo many Thouſands were at hand, to whom ſhe had done ſuch a ſingular piece of ſervice? How could ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Princes endure this Unworthy and Fooliſh expoſing of a Child without the leaſt neceſſity for it? But what ſignifies it? <hi>Virgil</hi> had: his ſports, and 'twas but requiſite <hi>Statius</hi> ſhould have his too.</p>
                  <p>The third fault that may be committed againſt the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Main <hi>Action,</hi> is to compleat an Action entirely, which ſhould ſerve for an <hi>Epiſode.</hi> This is likewiſe one of the Conditions of the Story of <hi>Hypſipyle:</hi> Nothing is more compleat in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. It makes no part of any other Action: 'Tis an entire Action, that has no dependance on any of the <hi>Theban</hi> Worthies, or the other <hi>Grecians</hi> of this Poem; of whom not one has the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in what paſs'd at <hi>Lemnos.</hi> Thus, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Action</hi> is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53904:60"/>
entirely ſpoil'd in the <hi>Thebaid</hi> by this Adventure, the Recital where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes the Poem <hi>Epiſodical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This fault of <hi>Statius</hi> is in the very midle of his Poem. It has cut the Action of it into two parts, moſt monſtrouſly divided by this large <hi>Hiatus,</hi> which is ſo miſerably fill'd up with foreign Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or rather foreign Bodies. But, as I before hinted, theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities corrupt the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> as much when they are plac'd at the <hi>Beginning</hi> or <hi>End,</hi> as when they are in the <hi>Middle</hi> and Body of the Poem. <hi>Statius</hi> affords us inſtances of this kind of fault likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>Had he <note n="‡" place="margin">Limen mihi Carminis eſto Oedipodae confuſa domus. <hi>Theb.</hi> 1.</note> begun the War of <hi>Thebes</hi> with the Inceſtuous Birth of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> he would have imitated thoſe, who began the War of <hi>Troy</hi> with the Birth of <hi>Helen,</hi> thô even that met with <note n="†" place="margin">Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab Ovo. <hi>Hor.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi>'s Cenſure. But <note n="‡" place="margin">Gentiſque canam pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordia dirae, Sidonios raptus, &amp; inexorabile pactum Legis Agenoreae, ſcrutantemque aequora Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum. <hi>Stat. Theb.</hi> 1.</note> he carries matters ſtill higher, goes back as far as the firſt founding of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and opens his Poem with the Rape of <hi>Europa,</hi> which was the firſt Cauſe of building that City.</p>
                  <p>He ends juſt as he begun. The Quarrel of the two Brothers was manifeſtly decided by their Deaths, there remained no more difficulty, the Siege was rais'd, and all over. And when the Reader expects no more, the Poet, who has quite drained his <hi>Matter,</hi> gives us notice of his joyning another ſtory thereto, which was the Conſequence thereof, juſt as the Return of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Hector</hi>'s death, and the taking of <hi>Troy;</hi> and as the Reign of <hi>Aſcanius</hi> is the Conſequence of the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Aeneas. Thebes</hi> has no longer the <hi>Argives</hi> but the <hi>Athenians</hi> for its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; 'tis no longer defended by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> but by <hi>Creon;</hi> and not aſſaulted by <hi>Polynices,</hi> but by <hi>Theſeus.</hi> The Diſpute is no longer about a Kingdom, but a Tyrant to be puniſhed. 'Tis no more a Siege but the taking of a City. And now no longer is Cruelty, Ambition, and Violence predominant there; but Valour, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and Piety, which in the laſt Book deſtroy the Character of the whole Poem. So that the Action is quite Another, in the Cauſe, in the End, in the Perſons, in the Manner, and in all the other Circumſtances. Theſe are the faults which manifeſtly ſpoil the <hi>

That therein he was very Judicious; and that thoſe who inſtead of Imitating him, have taken this <hi>Whole</hi> for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Poems, have taken too much Matter, and have been very indifferent Artiſts.</q> Does he pretend by this Doctrine, and by theſe Inſtances to overthrow what we have cited out of that very treatiſe of Poetry? Would he teach us that the Subject and <hi>Matter</hi> of a Poem ought not to be a <hi>Whole, and an Entire and Compleat Action,</hi> but only a part of an Action? Sure 'tis not likely he ſhould contradict himſelf thus.</p>
                  <p>We may reconcile this, that appears ſo contradictory in the Terms, by making this Reflection: That one and the ſame Action may be conſider'd as in the Fable, where the Poet makes uſe of it; or elſe as in the Hiſtory, whence he took it. When the Poet is upon the ſearch after <hi>Matter</hi> for his Fable, he lights upon ſeveral ſorts of Actions. Some have ſeveral parts which may be regularly connected in one Body; and then he may take one of theſe Actions, entire as it is. But there are others whoſe parts are ſo independent to one another, that a Man cannot with any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility joyn them together ſo as they ſhall ſeem to be the Cauſes and the Conſequences of each other. And this is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns under the Name of Many-limb'd Fables. To which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes thoſe which have but one only part.</p>
                  <p>He does not abſolutely forbid the Multiplicity of Parts; but he commonly takes ſuch ſorts of Words in the worſt Senſe, which might of themſelves be underſtood in a more favourable one. Thus we obſerv'd, that he condemned the vicious Plurality of Fables and <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> under the Terms of <hi>Polymythia,</hi> and <hi>Epiſodical,</hi> altho' a Man may lawfully put ſeveral <hi>Fables</hi> into a Poem, and there is none but has ſeveral <hi>Epiſodes</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore 'tis in this Sence that he condemns the Plurality of the Parts in an <hi>Epick Action.</hi> We are not to ſuppoſe that he condemns it abſolutely, and that this Action made uſe of cannot be a <hi>Whole.</hi> He explains his own meaning ſufficiently in the following Words.

                     <hi>As,</hi> ſays <hi>he, in other Imitations, that which a Man Imitates is one ſingle thing: So likewiſe, The Fable being the Imitation of an Action, 'tis requiſite that this Action be One, Entire, and a Whole, and that the parts be ſo joyn'd to, and dependent on each other, that one cannot ſo much as remove any one out of its Place, either to tranſpoſe, or retrench it quite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a Change in the whole. For whatever can be ſo placed or omitted, that one cannot perceive the Alteration, can by no means be a part of the Action.</hi> So then, 'tis only the Plurality of parts in this laſt Sence which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> condemns. And he has commended <hi>Homer</hi> for having taken only a Part of all that paſſed in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War.</p>
                  <p>But yet we are to take ſpecial notice that this Retrenchment of all the other parts does not hinder the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which is only retain'd, from being a <hi>Whole</hi> in the Poem. 'Tis only a Part with reſpect to the whole War, and in the Hiſtory whence <hi>Homer</hi> took it: But 'tis an Entire and Compleat <hi>Whole</hi> in the Fable and Poem, which <hi>Homer</hi> has made of it. You ſee then how theſe oppoſite Expreſſions of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are eaſily reconciled in their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Poet may take out of Hiſtory an Entire Action, or but a Part of one: but ſtill he muſt put in his Poem an entire Action, and not a Part only. The Diſpoſition of his Matter regulates this Point, and makes a regular <hi>Whole</hi> of whatever he ſhall have met with and made choice of. He muſt make uſe thereof Variouſly, according to the Hiſtorical Plurality, or Singularity of the Parts, ſo as to make thereof the Subject of his Poem.</p>
                  <p>When he takes an Entire Action, as <hi>Homer</hi> has done for his <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> for the <hi>Aeneid;</hi> there is nothing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, nor any meaſure to be taken to make this Action appear a <hi>Whole,</hi> and not the Part of another Action. The Reader is already inſtructed by Hiſtory, and is in little danger of being miſtaken therein. 'Tis enough that the Poet tell wherein his Action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, without ſaying wherein it does not. <hi>Homer</hi> propoſes the Return of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who after the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> came back again to his own Country: <hi>Virgil</hi> propoſes the Change of a State which is ruin'd at <hi>Troy,</hi> and re-eſtabliſhed in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Each of theſe Adventures have the Conditions of a <hi>Whole</hi> as well in the Hiſtory whence they were taken, as in the Fables where they are made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>But when the Poet chuſes only a Part, and out of this Hiſtorical Part makes a <hi>whole</hi> in his Fable; he muſt take care to give his Readers notice of it, for fear that they, applying the knowledge
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53904:62"/>
they have of the Hiſtory to what they Read in the Poem, ſhould blame the Author, as if he had ſaid but little on his Subject, or rather had ill managed his deſign, having only deſcribed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Action.</p>
                  <p>The Poet's not knowing how to change a Part into a <hi>Whole,</hi> has perhaps contributed very much to the fault of thoſe Men, whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> blames for having loaded themſelves with too much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the Knowledge <hi>Homer</hi> had of this Secret, and his Skill in practiſing it, has made him merit thoſe Praiſes which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives him. He does not only tell us in his <hi>Iliad</hi> that the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> is his Subject; but beſides that, in expreſs Words he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the other parts of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War.

                  <p>Beſides, the Poet has given neither a <hi>Beginning</hi> nor an <hi>End</hi> to the <hi>Siege of</hi> Troy: Nay there is ſcarce a <hi>Middle</hi> that is proper to it.

                  <p>On the other hand, all the parts of this Anger, that are requiſite to make it a Whole, are very Conſpicuous. It has its <hi>Beginning,</hi> its Cauſes, its Effects, and its <hi>End.</hi> This is what the Poet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to make out as he had begun; that is, in the Perſon of his Hero. <hi>Achilles</hi> is not reconcil'd with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> with a Deſign to revenge all <hi>Greece</hi> upon <hi>Troy,</hi> or <hi>Menelaus</hi> upon <hi>Paris:</hi> As long as nothing elſe was on foot he was inexorable. But <hi>Hector</hi> kills <hi>Patroclus;</hi> then he is reconcil'd, that he may revenge his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular injury upon <hi>Hector</hi> alone. Thô he is the Death of other <hi>Trojans,</hi> yet 'tis only becauſe he meets not with <hi>Hector</hi> himſelf: 'Tis to fight his way through to this particular Enemy; 'tis becauſe thoſe he kills are his Relations, or his Souldiers; juſt as before he reveng'd himſelf on all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for the Affront which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> alone had put upon him.</p>

By this means, the Poet makes his Hero, after he was glutted, as I may ſo ſay, by the miſchief he had done to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> by the Death of <hi>Hector,</hi> and the Honour he did his Friend, by inſulting o'er his Murderer; he makes him, I ſay, to be moved by the Tears and Misfortunes of King <hi>Priam.</hi> We ſee him as calm at the <hi>End</hi> of the Poem, during the Funeral of <hi>Hector,</hi> as he was at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Poem, whilſt the Plague raged among the <hi>Graecians.</hi> This <hi>End</hi> is juſt, ſince the Calmneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Achilles</hi> re-enjoy'd, is only an Effect of the Revenge which ought to have went before; and after this no body expects any more of his Anger. Thus has <hi>Homer</hi> been very exact in the <hi>Beginning, Middle</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of the Action he made choice of for the Subject of his <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Deſign in the <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> was to deſcribe the Return of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> from the Ruin of <hi>Troy,</hi> and his Arrival at <hi>Ithaea.</hi> He opens this Poem with the Complaints of <hi>Minerva</hi> againſt <hi>Neptune,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Return of this Hero, and againſt <hi>Calypſo,</hi> who detained him in an Iſland far from <hi>Ithaca.</hi> Is this a <hi>Beginning?</hi> No; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs 'tis not. The Reader would fain know why <hi>Neptune</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and how this Prince came to be with <hi>Calypſo.</hi> He has a mind to know how he came from <hi>Troy</hi> thither. The Poet anſwers his Demands out of the Mouth of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> himſelf, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates theſe things, and begins the Action by the recital of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels from the City of <hi>Troy.</hi> It ſignifies little whether the <hi>Beginning</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53904:64"/>
of the Action be the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Poem, as we ſhall take notice in the following Book, where we ſhall treat expreſly of the Order our Poets have obſerved in their Narrations. The <hi>Beginning</hi> of this Action then is that which happens to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> when upon his leaving of <hi>Troy</hi> he bends his Courſe for <hi>Ithaca.</hi> The <hi>Middle</hi> comprehends all the Misfortunes he endured, and all the Diſorders of his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The <hi>End</hi> is there inſtanting of this Hero in the peaceable Poſſeſſion of his Kingdom, where he diſcovers himſelf to his Son, his Wife, his Father, and ſeveral others. The Poet was ſenſible he ſhould have ended ill, had he went no farther than the Death of theſe Princes, who were the Rivals and Enemies of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> becauſe the Reader might have looked for ſome Revenge which the Subjects of theſe Princes might have taken on him, who had kill'd their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns: But this Danger over, and theſe People vanquiſhed and quieted, there was nothing more to be expected. The Poem and the Action have all their Parts and no more.</p>
                  <p>The Order of the <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> differs from that of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> in that the Poem does not begin with the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Action. That of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is ſtill more different, ſince the very <hi>End</hi> of the Poem is not the <hi>End</hi> of the Action of <hi>Aeneis.</hi> But we ſhall ſay no more of this at preſent.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of <hi>Virgil</hi> is to conduct <hi>Aeneas</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> there to eſtabliſh his Gods and Religion, and lay the Foundations of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi> There is this difference between the Return of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and the Voyage of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that no one ever queſtions why a Man returns to his own Country: Though <hi>Homer</hi> had made no mention of the natural Affection he bore to his Country, yet the Readers would never have fell out with him for this Omiſſion. This is a well known Cauſe; 'tis neither an Action, of which one ought to make a Narration, nor a thing which precedes this Return. But <hi>Aeneas</hi> acts contrary to this natural Affection; he abandons his own Country, to go in ſearch after a ſtrange Land. The Reader then would have the Poet tell him why this Hero leaves <hi>Troy.</hi> Beſides <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was born a King, but <hi>Aeneas</hi> was not. So that the embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is ſufficiently the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs:</hi> But the embarking of <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Troy,</hi> on Board the Admiral of a Fleet of Twenty Sail; cannot be the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Action of <hi>Aeneas. Aeneas</hi> abandons <hi>Troy,</hi> becauſe it was taken by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and is King of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> becauſe <hi>Priam</hi> was dead, and he elected in his room.</p>
                  <p>But if the taking of <hi>Troy</hi> be the Conſequence of a ten Year's Siege, ſhould not this War have been related as the neceſſary Cauſe of the taking and ruine thereof? This is what the Poet has admirably provided for by bringing it about, that neither the War, nor the long and tedious Siege, ſhould be the Cauſe of the taking of this
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53904:65"/>
City. <note n="*" place="margin">Fracti bello, fatiſque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſi Ductores Danaum tot jam labentibus annis. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid. l.</hi> 2.</note> Therefore he ſays at firſt, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were worſted, that they utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of being Maſters of the City by any of thoſe Meaſures they had hitherto taken; and that ſo many Years ſpent in the War was but ſo much time loſt. So that the Taking of <hi>Troy</hi> depends not upon any thing that went before. The <hi>Greeks</hi> form another Deſign, which is an exact <hi>Beginning</hi> of an Action; for it ſuppoſes nothing before it. The Poet gives it likewiſe the other Qualification of a <hi>Beginning,</hi> which is the requiring Something after it. Before ever the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> became Maſters of the City, and before ever King <hi>Priam</hi> was kill'd, <hi>Aeneas</hi> is deſtin'd to re-eſtabliſh a more noble Religion, and a more illuſtrious Empire elſewhere. Wherefore the Burning of <hi>Troy</hi> is not an entire Action, nor the Downfall of an Empire, but the Cauſe and the firſt Part of the Alteration of a State; and it requires a new Eſtabliſhment to ſucceed it.</p>
                  <p>The Shipping off of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> his Voyages, his Battels, and all the Obſtacles he met with, compoſe a juſt <hi>Middle;</hi> they are a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and of the Choice they made of him to tranſport them into <hi>Italy;</hi> and theſe ſame Incidents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an <hi>End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> comprehends the Death of <hi>Amata,</hi> that of <hi>Turnus,</hi> the Change of <hi>Juno</hi>'s Mind, and the Terms of the Peace, which contain'd all that <hi>Aeneas</hi> pretended to for his Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>But for the better judging of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of the Action (of which we have already ſpoke) we muſt add, that there are two ſorts of Deſigns: The firſt ſort have no manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, but end with the Action; the others, beſide the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have likewiſe ſome neceſſary Conſequences: And in this laſt Caſe theſe Conſequences muſt be related, if one would have the Poem be as <hi>Entire</hi> and as <hi>Compleat</hi> as it ought to be. Our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets furniſh us with Inſtances of both theſe Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>The Anger and Revenge of a Man requires neceſſarily nothing more after it: when it is ſatisfied and over, all is at an end. When <hi>Achilles</hi> was reveng'd, when he had receiv'd Satisfaction for the Affront put upon him, and when he was once quiet, a Man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enquires what becomes of him afterwards. 'Tis the ſame caſe with the Return of a Prince into his own Country: when he is come thither, has put an End to thoſe Diſorders which his Abſence had cauſed, and enjoys Peace again, the Reader is ſatisfied. Nor has <hi>Homer</hi> made any <hi>Epiſode</hi> that has tranſgreſſed theſe Bounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Practice has been otherwiſe, becauſe he undertook a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of another Nature. The Eſtabliſhment of any State does of neceſſity draw great Conſequences after it. If the Poet had taken them all for his Action, it would have been of a monſtrous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Government was not fully ſettled till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53904:65"/>
the Ruin of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had ſo long diſputed with it for Empire and Liberty: and this very State arrived not to its Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Perfection till under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who was its laſt, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> was its firſt, Founder. Therefore <hi>Virgil</hi> has not taken this for the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Poem; but <note n="†" place="margin">Super &amp; Garamantas &amp; Indos Proferet Imperium; jacet ex via Sydera tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, <hi>&amp;c. Aen.</hi> 6.</note> he relates it by ſuch Recitals as <hi>Homer</hi> makes uſe of in his <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> when he tells us of the Wound <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> receiv'd on the top of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> Upon this Account we obſerved, that the Poet may relate ſuch Incidents as were neceſſary to the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Poem, but which notwithſtanding were not the Matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 'Tis thus that <hi>Virgil</hi> practices in the Machines, making <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in the firſt, and <hi>Anchiſes</hi> in the ſixth Book, to make theſe Prophetical Recitals.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething ſtill more Noble in the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Dido,</hi> where by an Allegory and a Conduct, which one can never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire, he brings into the Body of his Action all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Hiſtory of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and this ſo naturally too, that one would think the Poet ſhould have made <hi>Dido</hi> ſay and act, juſt as ſhe did, though there had never been any Quarrel between theſe two States, and though there had never been ſuch a Man as <hi>Hannibal.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Cauſes of the <hi>Action.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AN Hiſtorian does not make his Subject-Matter himſelf, he ſpeaks nothing but what he knows; and in the Conduct of a State, we often ſee Effects, whoſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> are never known. Thoſe who act in it, keep all things in private; and the more they do ſo, the greater <note n="*" place="margin">Qui neſcit diſſimulare neſcit regnare.</note> Politicians are they accounted. So that on one ſide the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian is obliged to declare all the <hi>Cauſes</hi> he knows, becauſe theſe Circumſtances are very inſtructive: but on the other hand, he is juſtly diſpenſed from relating ſeveral <hi>Cauſes,</hi> becauſe he cannot come to any Knowledge of them.</p>
                  <p>A Poet has the ſame Reaſons to tell all the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he is likewiſe more oblig'd to it than an Hiſtorian, ſince 'tis more proper and eſſential for Poetry to inſtruct, than 'tis for Hiſtory. But the Poet has not the ſame Reaſons to excuſe his Omiſſion of any <hi>Cauſe</hi> whatever. He makes his <hi>Matter</hi> himſelf, and if he takes any thing from Hiſtory, 'tis but ſo far as Hiſtory
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53904:66"/>
ſuits thereto. He muſt feign whatever is not there, or elſe change what is not ſuited to his purpoſe. If 'tis propoſe that ſome Things may lie concealed from him, becauſe no Man can know every thing; he then is inſtructed by the Gods who do know every thing. <hi>Virgil</hi> is my Warrant in the Caſe before us, <note n="†" place="margin">Muſa, mihi cauſas me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 1.</note> he invokes a Deity, that he may come to the Knowledge of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of his Action: and he relates ſuch things, as he could never know but by Revelation; ſince he ſays they happen'd to <hi>Dido</hi> alone, and which ſhe never made any one, no not ſo much as her Siſter, acquainted with. Thus is the Poet oblig'd to tell all the <hi>Cauſes</hi> not only that he may inſtruct, as we hinted before, but likewiſe that he may pleaſe; for without doubt this is very grateful.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>Cauſes;</hi> ſome are more general and undetermin'd, ſuch as the <hi>Humours</hi> of any one; for 'tis upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that every one commonly regulates his Conduct, and acts upon Occaſion. Others are more preciſe, ſuch as the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of thoſe that Act. And laſtly, there are others which are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, ſuch as the <hi>Deſigns</hi> which one takes to promote or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any thing. Theſe different <hi>Cauſes</hi> of an Action are likewiſe frequently the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of one another: every one taking up thoſe <hi>Intereſts,</hi> which his <hi>Humour</hi> engages him in, and forming ſuch <hi>Deſigns</hi> as his <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> prompt him to.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Humours</hi> and the Inclinations belong to the Doctrine of the <hi>Morals,</hi> which we ſhall treat of particularly in the fourth Book. We only joyn them here to the two other <hi>Cauſes</hi> we mention'd; and of all three we affirm this in general, That the Poet ought to inform his Readers of them, and make them conſpicuous in his principal Perſonages, when he introduces them, or even before he makes them appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> has ingeniouſly begun his <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> with the Tranſactions at <hi>Ithaca</hi> during the Abſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> If he had begun with the Travels of his Hero, he would ſcarce have ſpoken of any one elſe, and a Man might have read a great deal of the Poem without conceiving the leaſt Idea of <hi>Telemachus, Penelope,</hi> or her Suitors, who had ſo great a ſhare in the Action. But in the <hi>Beginning</hi> he has pitch'd upon, beſides theſe Perſonages, whom he diſcovers, he repreſents <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> in his full Length. And from the very firſt Opening of the Action, one ſees the <hi>Intereſt</hi> which the Gods had therein.</p>
                  <p>The Skill and Care of the ſame Poet may be ſeen likewiſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing his Perſonages in the firſt Book of his <hi>Iliad;</hi> where he diſcovers the <hi>Humour,</hi> the <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and the <hi>Deſigns</hi> of <hi>Agamemnon, Achilles, Neſtor, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and ſeveral others, nay, and of the Gods too. And in his ſecond Book he makes a Review of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Trojan</hi> Armies; which is full evidence, that all we have here ſaid is very neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53904:66"/>
But laſtly, Since the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> is doubtleſs much longer than the <hi>Dramatick;</hi> and ſince 'tis eaſier to manage the Incidents and the Preſence of the Perſonages in that than in the other: one is not obliged to introduce all of them at the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> with as much Exactneſs, as in the firſt Act of a <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral Piece,</hi> where at leaſt one is obliged to give ſome Item of all thoſe who have any conſiderable part in the <hi>Intrigue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I mention this upon the Account of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Practice. He has been leſs exact than the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet; for he ſays nothing of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Latinus, Amata,</hi> and other <hi>Italians,</hi> till the middle of his Poem. But 'tis true likewiſe, that he has ſo diſpoſed his Action as ſeems to juſtifie this Delay. He has divided the <hi>Aeneid</hi> into two parts more ſenſibly than <hi>Homer</hi> has his <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> He not only makes this Diviſion at the firſt, and in his Propoſition, by ſaying that <note n="*" place="margin">Multum ille &amp; terris jactatus &amp; alto: Multa quoque &amp; bello paſſus. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſuffer'd much when he was toſs'd about from this Sea to that, and from one Province to another; and ſuffer'd alſo a great deal more in the Wars he was engag'd in:</q> but he likewiſe, when he begins his ſecond Part, advertiſes his Reader of it, and <note n="†" place="margin">Major return mihi na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcitur ordo, Majus opus moveo. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 8.</note> propoſes the things he is about to mention, as all new, and quite of another Make from the former. Thus in the firſt Book he introduces the principal Perſonages of his firſt part; and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks of thoſe, who were to appear afreſh in the ſecond Part, in his ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth Books. And here, in my mind, he was leſs fortunate than the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe more general <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Action and of the main <hi>Intrigues;</hi> there are ſtill ſome Incidents, and ſome <hi>Epiſodes</hi> more particular, of which the Poet muſt give an Account. This happens commonly not in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Action, but only when the Poet is about to make one of his leſſer Recitals. The Reader could not gueſs, how the Wound of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> came, which diſcover'd him to his Friends; not why <hi>Camilla</hi> ſhould be in love with War; nor how it came to paſs that <hi>Aeneas</hi> met with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons in the Shades below, who were to come into the World many Ages after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Poet muſt tell him the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of all this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> muſt be good, and ſuitable to the Subject. All the Action of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is founded upon the Anger of <hi>Achilles.</hi> The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this Anger is the Diſpleaſure <hi>Apollo</hi> conceiv'd againſt <hi>Agamemnon;</hi> becauſe <hi>Agamemnon</hi> likewiſe in his Anger had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted the Prieſt of this God. All theſe Paſſions have probable <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and ſuch as are ſuitable to the General Subject of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. For as this <hi>General Cauſe</hi> is <hi>Heten</hi>'s being raviſh'd from <hi>Menelaus;</hi> ſo the other <hi>Cauſes</hi> are of the ſame Nature.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53904:67"/>
                     <hi>Chryſeïs</hi> is raviſh'd from her Father, and <hi>Briſeïs</hi> from <hi>Achilles.</hi> In ſhort, all are ſtamp'd with the ſame Character of Injuſtice and Violence in theſe Heroes.</p>
                  <p>If the Hero be a Man of Probity, the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of all his Deſigns ſhould be juſt and commendable, as thoſe in the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid:</hi> And the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Perſecution he meets with, muſt not leſſen the Eſteem which the Poet would raiſe of his Probity. <hi>Neptune</hi> perſecutes <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had blinded his Son <hi>Polypheme.</hi> But this Monſter had already devour'd ſix of the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and was juſt upon ſerving <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> himſelf and the reſt the ſame Trick. <hi>Aeneas</hi> makes a more particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Piety, and accordingly <hi>Virgil</hi> uſes him more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably. The <hi>Cauſes Juno</hi> had to perſecute him, did either not touch his Perſon, or elſe were much to his Glory; ſince the only one which concern'd him, was the Choice which Fate made of him to lay in <hi>Italy</hi> the Foundation of the Empire of the World. <note n="*" place="margin">Liceat Phrygio ſervire marito, Dotaliſque tuae Tyrios permittere dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Juno</hi> is ſo far from having any ſcornful or hateful Thoughts for this Hero's Perſon, that ſhe was willing to truſt him with all that was moſt dear to her on Earth, and make him Lord over her own <hi>Carthage.</hi> She could never have given a more conſiderable Token of her Love and Eſteem for any Man.</p>

                  <p>IN what was ſaid about the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Action, one might have obſerv'd two oppoſite Deſigns. The firſt and moſt principal is that of the Hero: The ſecond comprehends all their Deſigns, that oppoſe the Pretenſions of the Hero. Theſe Oppoſite <hi>Cauſes</hi> produce likewiſe Oppoſite Effects; <hi>viz.</hi> the Endeavours of the Hero for the accompliſhing his Deſign, and the Endeavours of thoſe who are againſt it. As theſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> and Deſigns are the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Action; ſo theſe contrary Endeavours are the <hi>Middle</hi> of it, and form a Difficulty and <hi>Intrigue,</hi> which makes up the greateſt part of the Poem.

The firſt Part of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is for revenging himſelf upon <hi>Agamemnon</hi> by the means of <hi>Hector</hi> and the <hi>Trojans.</hi> The <hi>Intrigue</hi> comprehends the three Days Fight which happen'd in the Abſence of <hi>Achilles:</hi> and it conſiſts on one ſide in the Reſiſtance of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and on the other, in the revengeful and inexorable Humour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which would not ſuffer him to be reconcil'd. The Loſs of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the Deſpair of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> prepare for a <hi>Solution</hi> by the Satisfaction which the incens'd Hero receiv'd from it. The Death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> joyn'd to the Offers of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> which alone had proved ineffectual, remove this Difficulty, and make the Unravelling of the firſt Part.</p>
                  <p>This Death is likewiſe the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the ſecond Part; ſince it puts <hi>Achilles</hi> upon the Deſign of revenging himſelf on <hi>Hector.</hi> But the Deſign of <hi>Hector</hi> is oppoſite to that of <hi>Achilles:</hi> This <hi>Trojan</hi> Hero is Valiant, and reſolved to ſtand in his own Defence. This Valour and Reſolution of <hi>Hector,</hi> are on his Account the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Intrigue.</hi> All the Endeavours <hi>Achilles</hi> uſed to meet with <hi>Hector,</hi> and be the Death of him; and the contrary Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Trojan</hi> to keep out of his Reach and defend himſelf, are the <hi>Intrigue:</hi> which comprehends the Battel of the laſt Day. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> begins at the Death of <hi>Hector;</hi> and beſides that, it contains the inſulting of <hi>Achilles</hi> over his Body, the Honours he paid to <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the Intreaties of King <hi>Priam.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets of this King, and the other <hi>Trojans</hi> in the ſorrowful Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies they paid to <hi>Hector</hi>'s Body end the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling;</hi> they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Satisfaction of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and demonſtrate his Tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> is the Return of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> into <hi>Ithaca. Neptune</hi> oppoſes it by raiſing Tempeſts, and this makes the <hi>Intrigue.</hi> The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> is the Arrival of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> upon his own Iſland, where <hi>Neptune</hi> could offer him no farther Injury. The ſecond Part, is the re-inſtating this Hero in his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Princes, that are his Rivals, oppoſe him, and this is a freſh <hi>Intrigue.</hi> The <hi>Solution</hi> thereof begins at their Deaths, and is compleated as ſoon as the <hi>Ithacans</hi> were appeaſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two parts in the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> have not one common <hi>Intrigue,</hi> as is to be obſerved in the two other Poems. The Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> forms both the <hi>Intrigues</hi> in the <hi>Iliad;</hi> and it is ſo far the <hi>Matter</hi> of this <hi>Epopéa,</hi> that the very <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Poem depend on the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Anger. But let the Deſire <hi>Achilles</hi> had to revenge himſelf, and the Deſire <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had to return to his own Country be never ſo near a-kin: yet we cannot place them under one and the ſame Notion: For the Love of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is not a Paſſion that Begins and Ends in the Poem with the Action; 'tis a natural Habit, nor does the Poet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it for his Subject, as he does the Anger of <hi>Achilles.</hi>

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has divided his Poem as <hi>Homer</hi> did his <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> The firſt Part is the Voyage and Arrival of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> the ſecond is his Eſtabliſhment there. But he has connected theſe two great <hi>Epiſodes</hi> better by giving them a Common <hi>Intrigue.</hi> He did not take for his firſt <hi>Intrigue</hi> a Deity, who could act no where but by Sea, as <hi>Neptune:</hi> but <note n="*" place="margin">Nec Teneris addita Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Unquam aberit. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 6.</note> makes Choice of <hi>Juno,</hi> the Goddeſs of the Air, who had an equal Power over Sea and Land. She oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Voyage of this Hero, and 'tis ſhe likewiſe that oppoſes his Settlement. This Oppoſition then is the General <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the whole Action. The <hi>Solution</hi> is over when <note n="†" place="margin">Annuit his Juno &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem laetata retorſit. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 12.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The principal <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the firſt Part, is the Deſign of <hi>Dido,</hi> and the Endeavours ſhe uſed to keep <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſtill at <hi>Carthage.</hi> The Complaints of <hi>Iarbas,</hi> the Orders <hi>Mercury</hi> brought <hi>Aeneas</hi> to be gone, and the re-fitting of the <hi>Trojan Fleet,</hi> are Preparations for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling,</hi> which begins at the Departure of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when he <note n="‡" place="margin">Vaginaque eripit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem Fulmineum, ſtricto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ferit retinacula Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> cut the Cables which held his Ships at Anchor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dido</hi> might have done more Miſchief to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> either by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him as an Enemy to be reveng'd on him, or by following him as his Wife. And though ſhe ſtay'd ſtill at <hi>Africk,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Liberty Men had in thoſe days of putting away one Wife and marrying another, yet the Poet had made him too honeſt a Man than to allow him two Wives living at the ſame time. Let Caſes ſtand how they would, yet <hi>Aeneas</hi> had reaſon to be afraid of <hi>Dido,</hi> and to apply the Prophecy of <hi>Sibyl</hi> to himſelf, <note n="*" place="margin">Cauſa mali tanti con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jux iterum hoſpita Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris, Externique iterum thalami. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 6.</note> which ſaid, that the Cauſe of the Misfortunes he was to ſuffer ſhould be another foreign Wife, that ſhould entertain the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and be raviſh'd from another Man's Bed.

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. The Way of forming the <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Intrigue.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already obſerv'd what is meant by the <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> thereof; let us now ſay ſomething of the manner of forming both: and this we ſhall meet with in the Practice of our Poets; which tells us that theſe two things ſhould ariſe naturally out of the very Eſſence and Subject of the Poem, and that they are to be deduced thence. Their Conduct is ſo exact and natural, that it ſeems as if their Action had preſented them with whatever they inſerted therein, without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Trouble of a farther Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>What is more Uſual and Proper among Warriours, than Anger, Heat, Paſſion, and Impatience of bearing the leaſt Affronts and Diſreſpects? This is what forms the <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the <hi>Iliad:</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing we read there, is nothing elſe but the Effect of this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and theſe Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>What more Natural and Uſual Obſtacle do they who take Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges meet with than the Sea, the Winds, and the Storms? <hi>Homer</hi> makes this the <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the firſt part of the <hi>Odyſſeïs:</hi> and for the ſecond, he makes uſe of the almoſt infallible Effect of the long Abſence of a Maſter, whoſe Return is quite deſpair'd of; <hi>viz.</hi> the Inſolence of his Servants and Neighbours; the Danger his Son and Wife were in; and the Sequeſtration of his Eſtate. Beſides, an Abſence of almoſt 20 Years, and the inſupportable Fatigues joyn'd to the Age <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was then of, might induce him to believe that he ſhould not be own'd by thoſe that thought him dead, and whoſe Intereſt it was to have him be really ſo. Therefore if he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently declar'd who he was, and had call'd himſelf <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> they would eaſily have made away with him as an Impoſtor, before he had had Opportunity to make himſelf known to them.</p>
                  <p>There could be nothing more Natural, nor more Neceſſary, than this ingenious Diſguiſe, to which the Advantages which his Enemies had taken of his Abſence had reduc'd him, and to which his long Misfortunes had inur'd him. This allow'd him an Opportunity, without hazarding any thing, of taking the beſt Meaſures he could againſt thoſe Perſons who could not ſo much as miſtruſt any harm from him. This Way then was afforded him by the very Nature
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53904:69"/>
of his Action, that he might execute his Deſigns, and overcome the mighty Obſtacles it preſented him with: And 'tis this Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prudence and the Diſſimulation of a ſingle Man on one hand, and the ungovernable Inſolence of ſo many Rivals on the other, which makes up the <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the ſecond Part of the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conduct of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, in the <hi>Intrigues</hi> he forms, has the ſame Simplicity. The Tempeſts are made uſe of in the firſt Part of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> juſt as in the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this very part of the <hi>Aeneid, Virgil</hi> ſuits himſelf to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his Hero, as <hi>Homer</hi> does himſelf to the Humour of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> He <hi>(Achilles</hi> I mean) was teſty and paſſionate, <hi>Agamemnon</hi> provokes him by very ſenſible Affronts. <hi>Aeneas</hi> was of a ſoft Diſpoſition; the Poet makes uſe of good Turns, kind Treats, and the moſt melting, moſt endearing Paſſions, to engage him to ſtay at <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Second Part, the Oppoſitions of <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Mezentius</hi> are no leſs exact. For Love and Reſpect oblig'd <hi>Aeneas,</hi> not to abandon a Queen to whom he ow'd ſo much; and theſe oppos'd his Embarking for <hi>Italy:</hi> and the Impiety of <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was an Obſtacle to the Eſtabliſhment of the Gods and Religion at that place. In fine, the Love <hi>Turnus</hi> had for <hi>Lavinia,</hi> and the Eſteem <hi>Amata</hi> had for this <hi>Italian</hi> Hero above <hi>Aeneas,</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe other natural Obſtacles, derived from the very Subject; ſince <hi>Amata</hi> was oblig'd to prefer her Relation to an unknown Stranger; and ſuch an accompliſh'd Princeſs as <hi>Lavinia,</hi> who was ſole Heireſs to a Kingdom, could not but have her Suitors.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we obſerved that <hi>Homer</hi> made uſe of the Anger of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and that of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> to ſtir up the ſame Paſſion in <hi>Achilles;</hi> and that the Cauſe of the War, and the Cauſe of theſe Paſſions, are the Raviſhment of three Women. <hi>Virgil</hi> forms his general <hi>Intrigue</hi> after the ſame manner: He oppoſes to the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of a Kingdom in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Eſtabliſhing of another Kingdom in <hi>Africk.</hi> This Oppoſition is ſuited to Policy in general, and to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in particular. <note n="*" place="margin">Tantum in medio cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcéntem noctem ſibi ac poſteris ſuis metuebant. <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> in its Infancy ſees all her Neighbours conſpiring againſt her; for new Governments caſt always a Shade upon the old ones.</p>
                  <p>But in theſe Intrigues of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> there are a great many other Circumſtances, wherein <hi>Virgil</hi> makes Allegories and Alluſions ſo correſpondent to Hiſtory and Truth, that without bating any thing of his Quality as Poet, he ſeems to merit likewiſe that of an Hiſtorian. A Man may ſee in the Perſons of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> the very Spirit and Conduct of two great Empires, of which they are Founders. There one may obſerve the greateſt Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53904:69"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> ever met with: and this great <hi>Intrigue</hi> in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is a Truth in Hiſtory. Was it only Fiction, that there was a Deſign of tranſlating in <hi>Africk</hi> the Empire of the World, which was deſtin'd for <hi>Italy?</hi> And the Means uſed to accompliſh that End, was it not that Treachery with which the <hi>Romans</hi> have always upbraided the <hi>Carthaginians? Dido</hi> caſts this Reproach upon her ſelf; and <note n="*" place="margin">Nullus amor populis nec foedera ſunto. Exoriare aliquis noſtris ex oſſibus ultor, Qui face Dardani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os ferroque ſequare colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 4.</note> makes the Application thereof to <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> ordering them to make uſe of it always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to violate their moſt ſolemn Treaties, as oft as they ſuppos'd they could do it to their own Advantage. This is the Genius and Conduct ſhe inſpires her Commonwealth with. <hi>Mercury</hi> likewiſe adviſes the Founder of <hi>Rome</hi> not to truſt to the Inconſtancy of this Woman, which was like the Inconſtancy of her City. And when <hi>Juno</hi> made the Propoſal to <hi>Venus</hi> of an Alliance between theſe two States, <hi>Venus</hi> ſaw well enough 'twas only a Trick of Diſſimulation, to which her preſent Intereſts compell'd her to condeſcend. But I am too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute in a General Treatiſe of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> We end all with ſaying, that the Event is the ſame both in the Hiſtory and the Poem. <note n="†" place="margin">Extincti te meque, ſoror, populumque patreſque Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donios, urbemque tuam. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 4.</note> 'Tis <hi>Dido</hi>'s Breach of Faith that had almoſt ruin'd <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and which at laſt became the Ruin of this Foundreſs of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> 'Twas this very ſame Perfidiouſneſs in <hi>Hannibal</hi> that brought <hi>Rome</hi> into ſo much Danger, and was at laſt the Ruin of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his City.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with the three Methods of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the Poem. One is, to deduce it from the Deſign of the Hero and the Action, which we have already taken notice of. The ſecond is, to deduce it from the Fable and the Deſign of the Poet; and this is what we obſerv'd in the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of two oppoſite Perſons and two oppoſite Empires. The third is to form the <hi>Intrigue</hi> ſo, as that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> may be prepar'd for it. I have ſaid nothing as yet of this third Way, and ſhall explain it by ſome Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>'Tis worth taking notice, how the Poet prepares the Departure of <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Dido.</hi> The Hero does not come deſignedly into <hi>Africk,</hi> but is forced thither againſt his Will by a Storm. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts not the Offer <note n="‡" place="margin">Vultis &amp; his mecum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter conſidere regnis? Urbem quam ſtatuo, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra eſt. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Dido</hi> made him of her City, if he would ſtay there: <note n="*" place="margin">Fugae nec conjugis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Praetendi taedas, aut haec in foedera veni. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 4.</note> And in the Marriage it ſelf he takes care to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to nothing that might hinder him from making a Voyage into <hi>Italy</hi> by the firſt fair Wind. All theſe Precautions prepare the Reader, that ſo without the leaſt Surprize
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53904:70"/>
he ſees <hi>Aeneas</hi> leave <hi>Carthage:</hi> This is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of that <hi>Intrigue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond part the Poet oppoſes none againſt his Hero, but ſuch perſons as he could deal well enough with, when a Peace was clap'd up. King <hi>Latinus</hi> was to be his Father-in-Law, <hi>Lavinia</hi> his Wife, and the <hi>Latins</hi> his Subjects. It would have been hard for all theſe perſons to have become ſuch upon his Account, after they had been his profeſs'd Enemies. The Poet has provided for that too. In <hi>Lavinia</hi> there is not to be obſerv'd either an Inclination for <hi>Turnus,</hi> or an Averſion to <hi>Aeneas:</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Multaque ſe incuſat, qui non acceperit ultro Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danium Aeneam, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque aſciverit turbem. <hi>Aen. lib.</hi> 11.</note> The King profers this Princeſs his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Hero as an Article of the Peace, and conſtantly perſiſts in this Deſign: The <hi>Latins</hi> only fight againſt <hi>Aeneas</hi> becauſe they are forc'd to it. Their Legates give ſuch ample teſtimonies of their Love and Eſteem for him, <note n="†" place="margin">Quin &amp; fatales murorum attollere moles; Saxaque ſibvectare humeris Trojana juvabit. <hi>Aen.</hi> 10.</note> that they declared, <hi>they ſhould think it an Honour to build the City for him which he demanded in</hi> Italy. The Poet then oppoſes none againſt him but <hi>Amata</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> who both periſhed by their own faults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juno</hi> indeed could not die; but ſhe is well enough diſpoſed of, by inſinuating that all ſhe hopes for, is not abſolutely to hinder the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Aeneas</hi> (for that ſhe confeſſed ſhe could not do): <note n="*" place="margin">At trahere, &amp; tantis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras licet addere rebus, Sanguine Trojano &amp; Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulo dotabere, Virgo. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 7.</note> But only to put a ſtop to it a little, and make the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> pay very dear for it. Thus, having accompliſhed theſe two deſigns, 'twas no hard matter for <hi>Jupiter</hi> to chear up her Spirits, and make her conſent to the reſt.</p>

                  <p>IF the <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Intrigue</hi> muſt be natural, and ſuch as ſprings from the very Subject, as has been already urg'd: Then the <hi>Winding up of the Plot,</hi> by a more ſure claim, muſt have this Qualification, and be a probable Conſequence of all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of the <hi>Plots</hi> of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is the Ceſſation of the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who was incenſed at firſt againſt <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and laſtly againſt <hi>Hector.</hi> There is nothing but what is Natural in the Appeaſing of this Anger. The Abſence of <hi>Achilles</hi> is the Reaſon why the <hi>Greeks</hi> are worſted by the <hi>Trojans.</hi> He abſented himſelf on purpoſe, and 'twas a pleaſure to him to ſee the Loſs they underwent; that ſo he might be reveng'd on <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> who was the only perſon, that had affronted him. Among the wounded he believes he ſees one of his Friends. For his better ſatisfaction therein, he ſends thither his dear <hi>Patroclus.</hi> But this Favourite of <hi>Achilles</hi> had not the ſame Paſſions with him. He could not but be extremely concern'd at the miſerable condition his Allies were reduc'd to by the Common Enemy. Theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Princes, who had done <hi>Achilles</hi> no wrong, importune <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troclus</hi> to work him into a better Temper; and to perſuade him not to ſuffer they ſhould be ſo unworthily us'd any longer, ſince he could defend them from the Diſgrace. <hi>Patroclus</hi> prevails upon <hi>Achilles</hi> to lend him his Men and Armour, and under this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance beats back the Enemy. It is likewiſe Natural that this young Hero, intoxicated with ſo glorious a ſucceſs, ſhould puſh on his Victory farther than <hi>Achilles</hi> had order'd him, and ſo force <hi>Hector</hi> to fight with and kill him. But ſhall <hi>Achilles</hi> endure, that ſo near and dear a Friend ſhould be butcher'd before his face, and in his Armour too, without revenging the Deed? That can never be. So then the Death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> is the Cauſe why <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is otherwiſe well enough ſatisfied and revenged upon <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> ſhould be now reconcil'd to him, and accept of his ſubmiſſion, his preſents, and the Oath he made that he had never to do with <hi>Briſeïs.</hi> This firſt <hi>Intrigue</hi> then is naturally <hi>unravell'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond could not be brought about by a Reconciliation with <hi>Hector.</hi> It was not in this <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince's power to reſtore <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had <hi>Briſeïs.</hi> Nothing but <hi>Hector</hi>'s death could be a ſatisfaction for that of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> 'Tis by this that <hi>Achilles</hi> begins his Revenge. Beſides, the many Indignities which he offered to the Body of this innocent <hi>Homocide,</hi> and the great Honours he paid to that of his Friend, muſt needs Naturally mollifie his Grief, and aſſwage his Paſſion. To conclude, as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> repented, and wholly ſubmitted to what he pleas'd; ſo likewiſe we find King <hi>Priam</hi> proſtrate at his feet in as miſerable a Condition as a Father could be, that takes on for the Death of his Son. So that there is nothing in the pacified Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and in the Winding up of the Plots of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> but what Naturally ariſes from the Subject and the very Action.</p>

We ſhall find the ſame in the <hi>Odyſſeïs. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> by a Tempeſt is caſt upon the Iſland of the <hi>Phaeacans,</hi> to whom he diſcovers himſelf, and deſires they would further his Return to his own Country, which was not very far from thence. One cannot ſee any Reaſon why the King of this Iſland ſhould refuſe ſuch a reaſonable requeſt to a Hero whom he ſeems to have in great eſteem. The <hi>Phaeacans</hi> had heard him tell the ſtory of his Adventures: In this fabulous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital conſiſts all the advantage they could derive from his preſence; for the Art of War which they admir'd in him, his undauntedneſs under Dangers, his indefatigable Patience, and ſuch like Vertues, were ſuch as theſe <hi>Iſlanders</hi> were not uſed to. All their talent lay in Singing and Dancing, and whatſoever a ſoft and quiet life eſteem'd Charming. And here we ſee how dextrouſly <hi>Homer</hi> prepares the Incidents he makes uſe of. Theſe People could do no leſs for the Account <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had given them of his Life, and with which he had ingeniouſly entertain'd them, than conduct him home by furniſhing him with Shipping which would ſtand them in little or nothing.</p>
                  <p>When he came home, his long Abſence, and the Travels which had disfigur'd him, made him altogether unknown; and the danger he would have incurr'd, had he diſcover'd himſelf too ſoon, forc'd him to a diſguiſe, as we hinted before. Laſtly, this Diſguiſe gave him an Opportunity of ſurprizing thoſe young Gallants, who for ſeveral years together had been only us'd to ſleep well, and fare daintily.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, all the hinderance <hi>Aeneas</hi> met with was from <hi>Turnus.</hi> The turbulent Spirit of this Rival drew out the <hi>Italians</hi> to fight the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and coſt our Hero as many Subjects, as there were Souldiers ſlain in both parties; ſince he was already King of the one, and within a while was to be King of the other. What is to be done then in this caſe by a Prince ſo valiant as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and ſo affectionate and tender towards his Subjects? <note n="*" place="margin">Aequius huic Turno fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erat ſe opponere morti. <hi>Aen.</hi> 11.</note> Is it not the moſt natural thing in the World, that he ſhould declare he was ready to put a ſtop to the Quarrel <hi>Turnus</hi> had cauſed, by fighting ſingly with him? <note n="†" place="margin">Turnus ut infractos adverſo marte Latinos De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feciſſe videt, ſua nunc promiſſa repoſci, Se ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari oculis. <hi>Aen.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Turnus</hi> for his part ſees the <hi>Latins</hi> vanquiſh'd and dejected; he is ſenſible of the Reproaches they caſt upon him for having expoſed them in his Quarrel, and not daring to anſwer the demands of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Can he ſhift off the Challenge <hi>Aeneas</hi> had ſent him? By this means the Duel and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of all the Action happens naturally, and is as it were a neceſſary Conſequence of the Diſpoſition of the Fable.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of the Plot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and the different States to which it reduces the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, divide the Actions into ſo many ſorts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> of the <hi>Intrigue</hi> may be by changing of any one's fortune from good to bad, as that of <hi>Oedipus;</hi> or from bad to good, as that of <hi>Cinna. Oedipus</hi> ſeems to be innocent; and in the very moment he thought himſelf Maſter of two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, he finds himſelf guilty of Inceſt and Parricide, and becomes miſerable, blind, and an exile. <hi>Cinna,</hi> on the other hand, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and look's for nothing elſe but a cruel puniſhment; and contrary to his expectation he is freed from Death, reſtabliſh'd in his preferments, and made Maſter of <hi>Aemylia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes theſe two Contrary Turns of Fortune happen in one and the ſame Action, as in <hi>Heraclius. Phocas</hi> is dethron'd, when he thought himſelf ſettled in a ſure Poſt: And <hi>Heraclius</hi> ſteps into the place of the Tyrant who was gone to viſit the other World.</p>
                  <p>But let this <hi>Turn</hi> be what it will, double or ſingle, fortunate or unfortunate, 'tis ſtill call'd a <hi>Peripetia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes it happens by the Diſcovery of one or more perſons, which till then were unknown, as in <hi>Oedipus</hi> and <hi>Heraclius:</hi> Sometimes without any diſcovery, as in <hi>Cinna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let the <hi>Matter</hi> end which way it will, whether it be a <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petia</hi> without a Diſcovery, or a Diſcovery without a <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petia,</hi> or both together; this makes a ſort of Action which we call <hi>Implex</hi> or <hi>mix'd.</hi> But if the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> be without a Diſcovery, and without a <hi>Peripetia;</hi> if it be a ſimple paſſing from trouble and Action, to quiet and Repoſe, then theſe Actions and Fables are call'd <hi>ſingle Ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes likewiſe by a ſub-diviſion of the Fables wherein is a <hi>Peripetia, Ariſtotle</hi> has call'd thoſe <hi>Single,</hi> where the <hi>Peripetia</hi> is

                  </p>
                  <p>According to this laſt Diviſion, the Fable of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> is double, becauſe the <hi>

                  <p>There is neither a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> nor a <hi>Peripetia</hi> in the <hi>Iliad.</hi> Two Generals of the ſame party fall out, and then agree, after they had both ſuffered conſiderable loſſes: <hi>Achilles</hi> loſes his friend <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> his Glory and Authority: He is vanquiſh'd by the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and forc'd to ſubmit to his Inferiour <hi>Achilles,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his fault, and to give him Satisfaction. In the ſecond part, too Enemies fight, and he who was the weakeſt and knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo, is at laſt vanquiſh'd and kill'd. This Action then is wholly Single.</p>
                  <p>There is no more <hi>Complexedneſs</hi> in the <hi>Plots</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than in thoſe of the <hi>Iliad.

                  </p>
                  <p>Not that the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is abſolutely without a <hi>Peripetia;</hi> there are ſome in the leſſer <hi>Epiſodes.</hi> In the fighting with whirl-bats, <hi>Entellus</hi> is knock'd down at the feet of his Antagoniſt; ev'ry one looked upon him as vanquiſh'd, and <hi>Dares</hi> began to triumph. But when Rage had reſtored this old Combatant the Force which Age had robb'd him of, on a ſudden he leaps up, and <hi>Dares</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo over-match'd, and ſo confounded, that he could not make the leaſt reſiſtance.

                  <p>THAT which we call here the <hi>Concluſion of the Epick Action</hi> is the very laſt paſſage from Agitation and Trouble, to Quiet and Repoſe: So that there is a great deal of difference between the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> and the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of an Action. This laſt is nothing elſe but a kind of moment without Extent and Duration: But the firſt is of ſome length, ſince it Comprehends all that happens after the <hi>Plot.</hi> Beſides, there are a great many <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravellings</hi> in a Poem, becauſe there are a great many <hi>Intrigues:</hi> All that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt make no kind of Ceſſation, but ſtart up new Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which is quite contrary to the <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The <hi>Concluſion</hi> then is the End of the laſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling,</hi> ſo that there can be no more than <hi>One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine is a Conſequence of that which we laid down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Epiſodes.</hi> None of them, as we urg'd, ſhould be <hi>Entire;</hi> and only the laſt can be regularly finiſh'd. A great many <hi>Concluſions</hi> then is no where to be found but in <hi>Epiſodical</hi> Poems, as in the <hi>Thebaid</hi> of <hi>Statius,</hi> where he has finiſh'd the Story of <hi>Hypſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now for ſome better Inſtances in the practice of our two Poets.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poem is the Voyage of <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Troy</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Plot</hi> is the Difficulty of getting thither, and the oppoſition of <hi>Juno</hi> who raiſes Storms, and other obſtaoles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> begins at the laſt Voyage of the Hero from <hi>Sicily</hi> (which he leaves in the fifth Book) to <hi>Italy</hi> and the Mouth of <hi>Tyber,</hi> where he arrives in the ſixth and Seventh Book. This <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ea vox audits laborum Prima tulit finem. <hi>Aen.</hi> 7.</note> puts an End to the Labours and hazards of the Voyage. But
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53904:73"/>
does it put an End to all the Troubles and Dangers of <hi>Aeneas?</hi> No: <note n="†" place="margin">O tandem magnis pelagi defuncte periclis, Sed terra graviora manent. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it caſts him upon greater. It leaves him not in Repoſe, but puts him upon more Action and more buſineſs than ever he had before. And therefore 'tis not the <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> is not always joyn'd to the <hi>Solution</hi> of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue</hi> which ſeems to be moſt general, as was the Deſign of <hi>Juno</hi> in the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> This Goddeſs gives over acting, but <hi>Aeneas</hi> does not. He has ſtill <hi>Turnus</hi> to deal withal. In a word, ſince the Poet does not ſing the Action of <hi>Juno,</hi> but of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Poem and the Action remain ſtill unfiniſh'd, even when this Divine Enemy has given over. All the <hi>Concluſion</hi> then is included in the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> becauſe that puts an End to the Action of <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true that even then <hi>Aeneas</hi> had not quite executed his deſigns, he had not built his City, nor eſtabliſhed his Religion, nor Married <hi>Lavinia.</hi> But it muſt be obſerv'd that theſe things are not neceſſary. 'Tis enough that all Obſtacles were remov'd, and that the Reader be no longer in doubt of what follows. And this is the Caſe of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> In this particular it is very compleat, and needs no ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If one Inſtance is not enough to juſtifie this Doctrine, we can have recourſe to the <hi>Theatre.</hi> Marriage is very commonly the very End of <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poems: And yet that is not always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd before the Spectators. The Actors ſtep in to perform this Ceremony within doors: No body expects they ſhould come out again upon the Stage; or that they ſhould tell the Audience of it, as <note n="†" place="margin">Ne expectetis, ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, dum illi hue ad vos excunt. Nemo exibit, omnes intus conficiunt Negotium. Ubi id erit factum, ornamenta ponent. Poſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea loci, Qui deliquit vapulabit, Qui non deliquit biber. <hi>Plaut. Cistell.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Plautus</hi> has done in one of his Plays, more to make People laugh, than becauſe he was forc'd to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> has concluded his <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> by the league which <hi>Pallas</hi> makes between <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and his Neighbours. And yet he does not make it appear by the Continuation of the Poem, whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were faithfully kept or no.</p>
                  <p>He has not us'd the ſame Method in the <hi>Iliad.</hi> The obſervation of the Truce depended upon <hi>Achilles.</hi> The Poet had good reaſon to preſume that all his Readers were not perſuaded of the Moderation of ſo paſſionate a Man. It was a buſineſs of the higheſt Importance for the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of this Action to convince them that his Anger was appeas'd. This Hero in the whole ſeries of the Poem had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo teſty, unreaſonable and unjuſt, that thô the Poet's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution was very great and exact, yet one might diſtruſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant humour, as long as the Body of his Enemy was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of being inſulted over. They were then ready to beſtow ſuch Honours upon this Corps, as one might fear would put our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53904:73"/>
Hero into a Paſſion. So that the Poet thought himſelf oblig'd to carry on the Funeral and the Obſervation of the Truce to the very End of his Poem: That ſo he might abſolutely convince us of his tranquillity and repoſe, whoſe Action and Anger he had undertook to Sing.</p>
                  <p>After having obſerved what the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the Action is, and when it ought to be made, there remains ſtill a third queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. And that is to know whether the <hi>Concluſion</hi> ought to leave the Hero in a happy State, or whether 'tis allowable to leave him in a miſerable Condition.</p>
                  <p>Our Poets have not given us any Examples of a Hero, that is left in a Miſerable and forlorn Condition. Sad <hi>Concluſions</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for <hi>Tragedy:</hi> But in that they were more in Vogue formerly. than they are now a days: Becauſe in the Popular States of <hi>Greece,</hi> where Monarchy was Odious, nothing was heard with greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Ardency than the Misfortunes of Kings. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſtill another reaſon for preferring this kind of Cataſtrophe to a more happy one. The <hi>Tragical Scene</hi> is the Throne of the Paſſions, where Terror and Compaſſion ought to rule over all the reſt. Now theſe two Paſſions ariſe naturally from ſad Events: And the Spectators going from the Theatre with their minds full of the misfortunes they were Eye-witneſſes of, do doubtleſly preſerve their tenderneſs a great deal longer, and reſent more ſuch forcible Effects, than if their tears were dryed up, and their ſighs abated by the ſatisfaction of a more proſperous Cataſtrophe.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Reaſons will not ſerve for the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> ſince 'tis not ſo much for refining the Paſſions, as for making Men put off ill habits, and put on good ones. 'Tis likewiſe as true, that this does not exclude ſad Events. Beſides the Nature of the Fable is as capable of Good as Bad perſons for its chief Actors. The ſad Adventure of the <hi>Lamb</hi> unjuſtly butcher'd by the <hi>Wolf</hi> is as juſt, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and as regular a Subject, as the Generoſity of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> who quitted his Anger upon the Innocence of the ſame <hi>Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true if the Poets in the perſon of their Hero propoſed an Example of Perfection for Imitation, the misfortunes into which this Hero falls, and his unſucceſsful Enterprizes, would ſuit very ill with the deſigns of theſe Authors. But the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliad,</hi> and the Approbation given him by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> for the ſame, will not permit us to think that the deſign of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> ſhould be to give us theſe fine Ideas of a perfect Hero. Theſe three great men did certainly never pretend that <hi>Achilles,</hi> the Hero of the Fable, was a Model of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>We cannot then from any of theſe Principles determine any thing concerning the fortunate or unfortunate End of an <hi>Epick Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if any heed be to be given to Authority, I do not know any one Inſtance of a Poet, who finiſhes his piece with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53904:74"/>
of his Hero. Our three Poems afford us quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Inſtances; and <hi>Statius</hi> himſelf has quite ſpoil'd the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of his Action,</hi> becauſe he would not leave upon the minds of his Readers that miſerable Fratricide, which was the true <hi>Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it. So that all the Poets ſeem to conſpire for a happy Cataſtrophe.</p>
                  <p>In a word, ſince the <hi>Epick Poem</hi>'s Action is of a larger extent than that of the Theatre; it would perhaps be leſs ſatisfactory to the Readers, if, after ſo much pains and ſo long Troubles with which this kind of Poem is always fill'd, it ſhould at laſt bring them to a doleful and unhappy end. <hi>Achilles</hi> as unjuſt and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as he was, yet in his Valour ſhew'd ſuch an Air of Greatneſs, which dazles our ſight, and will not let us ſee his faults ſo, as to wiſh him any greater puniſhment than what he ſuffer'd by the Death of his friend. In ſpeaking of the Fable, I hinted upon what account the <hi>Iliad</hi> ſhould end thus, becauſe it redounded more to the happineſs and the Glory of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> had the ſame reaſon to pleaſe his Audience. The <hi>Romans</hi> would have been diſguſted and offended, if he had ill uſed their Founder and Anceſtors: And beſides in the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid</hi> the Poets would have been unjuſt, and the Readers diſſatisfied, if ſuch brave Princes and ſuch noble Souls as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> had been ſuffer'd to ſink under any misfortune. <hi>Achilles,</hi> who fell far ſhort of their Vertue, was likewiſe but little leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</p>
                  <p>Let the Caſe be how it will, yet I fanſie there needs a great deal of skill to give the Hero of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> a ſad and mournfull End, which might be received with a general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
                  <p>This is what we had to ſay concerning the <hi>Integrity</hi> of the Epick Action. There remain ſtill two of its Qualifications behind, its <hi>Duration,</hi> and it's <hi>Importance:</hi> Of each of which briefly.</p>

                     <hi>This laſt</hi> (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle) ſhould takeup as much time, as the Sun does in going about the Earth, or thereabouts. But the Epopéa has no fixed time, and in that it differs from the Dramatick Poem.</hi> Theſe are all the Rules he has left us upon this head. They conſiſt in two Things: The Firſt, That the <hi>Epick Action</hi> is longer than the <hi>Dramatick;</hi> and, Secondly, That the <hi>Epick Actions</hi> may be ſome longer than others.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is a Compariſon between the <hi>Epopéa</hi> and the <hi>Drama:</hi> Concerning which we ſay that an uninterrupted <hi>Duration</hi> is a great deal more neceſſary in an Action, which one ſees and are preſent at; than in one which we read, or only hear repeated. It is not natural to imagine one can ſpend Days and Nights without Sleeping, Eating and Drinking, purely to mind the Event of Things; and that, without moving out of the place, one can be conveyed to ſeveral places: And hence ariſes the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> ſo neceſſary to the <hi>Drama.</hi> But neither of theſe two <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nities</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> becauſe we read it as an Hiſtory which we may leave off when we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Tragedy</hi> being full of Paſſions, and conſequently full of ſuch a Violence as cannot laſt long, requires a ſhorter time; and the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> requires a longer time for to give leiſure to the Habits, if good, to ſink deep into the Minds and Souls of the Readers; or to be rooted thence, if bad. Theſe two Reaſons conſtitute the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Epick</hi> and the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Action, as to their <hi>Duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Difficulty is to know how long theſe Actions of the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péa</hi> ſhould laſt; and, whether, ſince as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, this does not cauſe ſome difference between the Actions of the ſame kind. All we can do in the Caſe, is to lay down the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Poets, and to make ſuch Reflexions therein, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has given us liberty to make.</p>
                  <p>This Philoſopher ſays, <hi>Whatſoever is violent cannot laſt long;</hi> and, in his Poeſie he tells us, <hi>That the Manners of the Perſonages
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53904:75"/>
are either</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. C. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>violent and ſtrong, or calm, ſedate and ſoft.</hi> The firſt cannot laſt ſo long as the other. A Man can be good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, peaceable, and prudent all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and no body will find fault with it: But one would wonder to ſee him keep up his Anger, and be in a violent agitation of body and mind all that time.</p>
                  <p>And though this long train of Paſſions were probable; yet it would not be neceſſary in a Poem that is deſigned to root out, or plant in Habits: Since the Habits are ſooner received and impreſſed by violent Actions, than by ſuch as are gentle and moderate. We ought to conclude then, that the more violence any Action has, the leſs time it ought to laſt.</p>
                  <p>This is what we ſee in the Practice of our Poets.</p>
                  <p>The <note n="*" place="margin">Stultorum regum &amp; populorum continet aeſtus. <hi>Hor. Ep. ad Lollium.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Iliad</hi> contains not only the Anger and Paſſion of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but likewiſe of the Kings and People that are the Perſonages of it. The Poet allows this Action ſeven and forty days only. Nor is this little time deſigned all for the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> though the moſt principal and the moſt violent. We muſt ſubſtract at one End the nine days of the Plague, which were before his Quarrel with <hi>Agamemnon:</hi> And at the other, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days of the Truce which he granted to King <hi>Priam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, theſe ſeven and twenty days of Anger are not all ſpent in the Action. The eleven firſt are allowed for the curing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and the eleven laſt for the Funeral-Pomp which <hi>Achilles</hi> beſtowed on the Body of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> So that the Fight begins and ends in five days time. Nor does the Fight laſt all the time; but on the ſecond day there was a Ceſſation of Arms for burning the dead on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Achilles,</hi> the chief Hero of the Poem, and the very Life of all the Violence that reigns there; he, I ſay, who being tranſported with it more than the reſt, ought likewiſe to continue in this Exceſs leſs time, fought only one day. By this means all the Poem founded upon Violence laſts but a little while: And the <hi>Duration</hi> of that which was moſt violent is judiciouſly retrenched by the Poet.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> is quite different from that of the <hi>Iliad;</hi> ſo likewiſe is the management of it, as to its <hi>Duration.</hi> The Character of the Hero is Prudence and Wiſdom. And this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration gives the Poet liberty to extend his Action to as long a time as he pleaſes, and his political Inſtructions required. Therefore he did not allow this Action ſome Weeks as he had that of the <hi>Iliad;</hi> but he takes up eight years and a half, from the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> at which it begins, to the Peace of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> where it ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53904:75"/>
The <hi>Aeneid</hi> is like the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> The <note n="*" place="margin">Sum pius Aeneas, <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> Character of the Hero is Piety and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and Politicks are likewiſe eſſential thereto. Therefore the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Action is continued after the ſame manner. The Poet makes the recital thereof begin at the building of the Wooden Horſe, juſt before the taking of <hi>Troy.</hi> This City was taken a great while before the beginning of Summer, ſo that <hi>Aeneas</hi> had time enough to fit out a Fleet. <note n="†" place="margin">Jam prima incooperat aeſtas, Et pater Anchiſes dare fatis vela jubebat. <hi>Aen.</hi> 3.</note> He quits <hi>Troy</hi> at the beginning of the firſt Summer: <note n="*" place="margin">Septima poſt Trojae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidium jam vertitur aeſtas. <hi>Aen.</hi> 5.</note> arrives at <hi>Sicily</hi> by the end of the ſeventh, and immediately after comes to <hi>Italy,</hi> where his Action continues one or two Months longer to the Death of <hi>Turnus.</hi> All this makes up a little more than ſix Years and a half, and not quite ſeven. This is the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Action of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſtill another way of reckoning the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> 'Tis to compute only what the Poet himſelf relates. By this means the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> begins at the firſt meeting of the Gods; and the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> at that time when the Storm caſt the <hi>Trojans</hi> upon <hi>Carthage.</hi> As for all that went before, we only reckon ſo much time as was requiſite for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> to make the Narration of their Adventures in, <hi>viz.</hi> a Night. This way of computing the Time, reduces the Action of ſeveral Years into the ſpace of a few Months, and this Computation is no leſs neceſſary than the other. But becauſe this belongs rather to the <hi>Narration</hi> than the <hi>Action,</hi> we reſerve it for the enſuing Book.</p>
                  <p>Here we only regard the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> as being the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Poem. For this reaſon we reckon not the Incidents which are added thereto: Such as the Wound of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> upon <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> and the ſequel of the <hi>Italian</hi> Hiſtory from <hi>Aeneas</hi> down to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi>'s Reign.</p>
                  <p>'Tis enough that we have ſhown the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Actions of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and the difference between them; which is ſo great even in <hi>Homer,</hi> that one of his Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains leſs than two Months, and the other more than eight Years.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Epick</hi> Poet cannot inſinuate himſelf into the mind of his Hearers by the Diverſions of <hi>Comedy;</hi> nor by the force and vivacity of <hi>Tragedy.</hi> Let him uſe never ſo much Artifice to ſeize upon a Paſſion, yet if one compares his Recitals with the Action of the Theatre, one may apply thereto what <hi>Horace</hi> ſays: <hi>That the Soul is leſs affected</hi>

                     <hi>with what it hears, than with what it ſees.</hi> So that beſides the Reaſons drawn from the Nature of theſe Poems, we may likewiſe from hence conclude, that the <hi>Epick Poet</hi> lies under a greater Obligion than the <hi>Dramatick,</hi> of ſurprizing the minds of his Readers by Admiration, and by the <hi>Importance</hi> of the things he treats of; and of taking for his Subject a Great, Noble, and Important Action. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this Grandeur, and this Luſtre in the <hi>Epick Action,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Action may be <hi>important</hi> two ways: Either of its ſelf independently from him that executes it; or by the Quality of the Perſons, the Poet is pleaſed to make uſe of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Horace</hi> excludes mean Perſonages, and would have them be Crowned Heads: But neither he nor <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays any thing to ſhew that the Action in its own Nature ought to be great and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant.</hi> And in truth they could not require this Qualification without condemning the Poet, that in their Opinion is the leaſt to blame of any in the World, and without rejecting the Model they propoſed. If one conſiders the two Actions of <hi>Homer</hi> without the Names and their <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have them be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared at firſt, one ſhall find nothing in them but what is common, and which requires no higher Qualities, than thoſe a Merchant, a burgomaſter, or at moſt a plain Country-Squire is capable of. You need only reflect upon the two Models we have given of them, one of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf drew. One ſhall find nothing there but what might have happened to ordinary Perſons. 'Tis this, <q>A Man returns to his own Country, and finds a great many diſorders in his Family. Two others fall out about a Captive Wench, and break the neck of their Affairs.</q> This teaches us that to make
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53904:76"/>
Action <hi>important,</hi> 'tis enough that it be the Action of noble and important Perſons.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, <hi>Horace</hi> makes mention of Wars: But there is no need for them, 'tis only by accident that they are in the Poem. I might urge, that this is only upon the Account of the <hi>Hero</hi> who ought to be a Warrior, ſuch as <hi>Achilles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas. Homer,</hi> who is cited by <hi>Horace</hi> in this point, ſhall teſtifie it. There is ſo little War in the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> that there is not the leaſt colour to think <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> meant to affirm that Wars were the <hi>ſubject Matter,</hi> or a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part thereof. The Poet mentions but three Rencounters, that of the <hi>Ciconians,</hi> that of the <hi>Leſtrygons,</hi> and that of ſome <hi>Ithacans,</hi> who were for revenging of their Maſters, whom <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had murdered at his Houſe. The recitals of theſe three Battles, if a Man may call theſe Adventures ſo, are made in leſs than forty Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in all.</p>
                  <p>But however 'tis, yet the Return of a Man to his own home, and the Quarrel of two others, that have nothing that is great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, become noble and <hi>important</hi> Actions; when, in the choice of the Names, the Poet tells us that 'tis <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who returns back into <hi>Ithaca;</hi> and that 'tis <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> who fall out with one another at the famous Siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> 'Tis then theſe Affairs become Matters of State.</p>
                  <p>But there are Actions that of themſelves are very <hi>important,</hi> ſuch as the Eſtabliſhing, or the Downfall, of a State or a Religion. Such then is the Action of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> There can nothing be imagined more great, noble, and auguſt, ſince it comprehends both the Civil State and Religion.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another way of making an Action great, by the Grandeur of the Perſonages under whoſe Names we repreſent it.</p>
                  <p>This way is to give a higher <hi>Idea</hi> of theſe Perſonages than that which the Readers conceive of all they know to be great. This is performed by comparing the Men of the Poem, with the Men of the preſent time in which the Poet writes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> ſays that two Men of his time could not carry the Stone, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> with eaſe threw at <hi>Aeneas;</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> ſays that the Stone <hi>Turnus</hi> flung at the ſame <hi>Aeneas,</hi> would have been too heavy a burden for twelve Men in the time of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> In ſhort, according to <hi>Homer</hi>'s Account, who lived one or two Ages after <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and who pretends that Men's ſtrength was abated to a Moiety of what it was before, this ſame ſtrength may well be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the pitch <hi>Virgil</hi> would have it ten Ages after. 'Tis by this means theſe two Poets were willing to render the Subjects of their Poems more great and auguſt by the Strength and Grandeur of their Perſonages, and by theſe great <hi>Ideas</hi> which they ſuper-added to thoſe which the Men of their Times conceived.</p>

This very reaſon obliged them not to repreſent their Heroes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to thoſe of former Ages: But the probable diminution from Age to Age, as they ſuppoſed, ought on the contrary to give the Fathers the preference over their Children. <hi>Homer</hi> makes no difficulty of it; and <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>It ſeems <hi>Statius</hi> had the ſame mind to repreſent the ſtrength of his Heroes, as far ſurpaſſing that of <hi>Homer</hi>'s and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Heroes, though in truth the Heroes of the one were only the Children of the Heroes of the other two; ſo prodigious are the Actions he would attribute to ſome. But 'tis more likely, that herein his whole aim was to amplifie to a Prodigy whatſoever he handled. For if by this extraordinary Strength he had a mind to heighten the Grandeur and Importance of his Action, he forgot himſelf in ſeveral Places, and has done ſomething worſe than ſleep, when he debaſed it ſo much in his firſt Book. 'Tis there, where to ſhew the Baſeneſs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the Kingdom of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he compares it to the Power and Riches of the greateſt Empires that have flouriſh'd ſince. Is it not pleaſant in him to declaim himſelf againſt the Deſign he beſtows upon his <hi>Heroes,</hi> and to ridicule the great labour he puts them upon for a wretched and pitiful Kingdom?</p>

                  <p>THere are two ways of Relating an Action that is paſt: The one is Simple and Hiſtorical, when a Man makes the Rehearſal of it to his Audience without forcing their Imagination, only leaving them under a Senſe that they are reading a Book, or hearing ſomething or other related. The other is more Artificial, where the Author makes no Appearance, nor ſays any thing of himſelf. But, by a kind of innocent Magick, he raiſes from the Dead, and brings upon the Stage, thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have done the Action he would repreſent. He makes them ſpeak and act over again the ſame Words and Actions they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53904:78"/>
ſpoke and did before, and in ſome ſort tranſports his Auditors to the Times when, and the Places where the Action was done. By this means he does not declare it to them after a plain, ſimple Way, as the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> but makes them Witneſſes of it, and the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becomes its own Diſcoverer.</p>
                  <p>The Actions which Poets imitate, are ſuch Things as are in an equal degree capable of two Forms, each of which conſtitute a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species. Such as fall under the moſt <hi>Artificial</hi> and <hi>Active</hi> Form are call'd <hi>Dramatick Poems,</hi> denoting their Nature by their <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Whatſoever regard the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poet has to his Spectators, yet the Perſons he introduces in his Poem, who are the only Actors therein, are not in the leaſt acquainted with thoſe before whom the Poet makes them ſpeak: nay more, they don't know what they ſhall do themſelves, nor what the Iſſue of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be; and therefore they cannot either advertiſe the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators thereof, or beg their Attention, or thank them for it. So that this kind of Poem, properly ſpeaking, has no parts exempt from the Action that is repreſented. This alone makes the <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy</hi> entire and perfect, ſuch I mean as are in uſe now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; that is, without <hi>Prologue, Epilogue,</hi> and thoſe other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, which being loſt, or left to the Choice of the Poet, have alter'd nothing of the Nature and Integrity of the Poem. When they are made uſe of, <note n="‡" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> they have nothing to do with the <hi>Tragedy</hi> and Action, ſince they are not made by the Actors.</p>
                  <p>But in the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> where the Poet ſpeaks, he ſays nothing but what is a part of the Poem. So likewiſe an <hi>Orator</hi> not only alledges his Reaſons, and refutes thoſe of the adverſe Party; but beſides that, prepares his Auditors, begs their Attention, and at laſt raiſes the Paſſions that are proper to his Cauſe. Nothing of all this is look'd upon as foreign to his Subject: the <hi>Exordium, Propoſition,</hi> and <hi>Peroration,</hi> are true parts of it, though leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than the <hi>Narration</hi> and the <hi>Confirmation.</hi> 'Tis juſt the ſame in the <hi>Epopéa.</hi> Before the Poet begins the large Recital of his Action, he propoſes it in general, and invokes the Gods that are to inſpire him. This makes up three parts that have been always look'd upon as neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> the <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and the <hi>Narration.</hi> We may add to them a fourth, which is no leſs neceſſary, nor leſs uſual; and that is, <hi>the Title</hi> or <hi>Inſcription</hi> of the Poem.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral others, which ſignifie nothing to the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> There is a Preface before the <hi>Aeneid,</hi>

which they ſay was made againſt the Plagiaries, who might have tranſcrib'd this Poem, and have had the Credit of it to <hi>Virgil</hi>'s prejudice. It is contain'd in the following Verſes, where he ſpeaks of his other Works.

                  <p>I queſtion whether theſe Verſes are proper for a Beginning, where the Reader's mind, not being as yet in a Heat, requires ſomething more mild and juſt, than in the Sequel, where 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tranſported.

                     </note> Laſtly, after he had finiſh'd his Treatiſe in four Books, he ends with an <hi>Epilogue</hi> deſign'd againſt the Plagiaries, as the Preface of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is; but with an Air ſo different, that theſe Verſes ſeem to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by another ſort of Genius.

                  </p>
                  <p>But neither He nor <hi>Homer,</hi> in their <hi>Epick Poems,</hi> have made uſe of any of theſe unneceſſary parts; ſo that I ſhall ſay nothing more about them.

                  </head>
                  <p>WE here examine Things upon the Principles we laid down in ſpeaking concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> We obſerved that it is a <hi>Fable;</hi> and we ſee nothing in the Practice of our Poets that gives us any other Idea of the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of their Poems, than of the <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Aeſop's Fables.</hi> They have for their <hi>Title</hi> the Names of the Perſons that act in them. There lies this Difference, that all the Perſonages are nam'd in the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Aeſop's Fables,</hi> becauſe they are but few, and one is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as another; but in the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> there is commonly One who is a great deal more conſiderable than the reſt, and the others are too many to be all nam'd. Therefore they only affix the Name of the principal Perſonage to it. Thus the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid</hi> bear only the Name of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Example of <hi>Homer</hi> in the <hi>Inſcription</hi> of the <hi>Iliad</hi> informs us, that the <hi>Title</hi> of the Poem may be deriv'd from ſomething elſe beſides the Name of the Perſonages. Perhaps he did not call it the <hi>Achilleid,</hi> becauſe <hi>Achilles</hi> does not act therein, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> do in the other two Poems. He has as many Sharers in his Dignity as there are Princes in his Alliance. He has a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to whom he ſhould ſubmit, and refuſing to do that, he makes but little or no Figure in the whole Action, of which the Subject of the Poem is but a part. He is but little better than a Caſhier'd Officer. He is doubtleſs the moſt Valiant; but the Poet ſings his Anger, not his Valour. And even there, the Anger which the Poet ſings is rather that which makes <hi>Achilles</hi> to abſent himſelf from fighting, than that which puts him upon killing of <hi>Hector.</hi> To conclude, the Fable conſiſts leſs in this Anger, than in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and Reconciliation, wherein <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had as great a ſhare as he. So that the Poet makes no Scruple to mention them both in his <hi>Propoſition,</hi> when he comes as near the Fable it ſelf as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>I ſing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Anger of</hi> Achilles, <hi>that has done ſo much miſchief to the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and cauſed the death of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heroes;</hi>

                     <hi>ſince the time that</hi> Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <hi>and he fell out and parted.</hi> Theſe Conſiderations ought not to degrade <hi>Achilles</hi> from the Honour of being the chief Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, which <hi>Homer</hi> has doubtleſs made him: but they may ſerve to prove, that though he is the chief Hero of this Fable, yet he is not the only Hero, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> are in the Fables that go under their Names.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:53904:79"/>
                     <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Lucan</hi> have each of them two Heroes; and they have, like <hi>Homer,</hi> given their Poems the Names of the Places where the Actions were done, and not of the Heroes who did them. But the <hi>Thebaid,</hi> and the <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> are ſuch defective Poems, that there's no relying upon their Authority.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Tragedies,</hi> where the Name of the Perſonage is made uſe of for the <hi>Title,</hi> the Poet adds ſomething elſe to it, when he makes ſeveral pieces under the Name of the ſame Hero. <hi>Seneca</hi> has done this in his two Tragedies of <hi>Hercules.</hi> The <note n="*" place="margin">Hercules Furens.</note> One he names from the Madneſs which tranſported him, and the <note n="†" place="margin">Hercules Oetus.</note> Other from the Place, where he was burnt. This is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why more than one Name is requiſite for the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Aeſop's Fables;</hi> for there is ſcarce an Animal, but what is a Hero in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fables. But this ſignifies little to the <hi>Epick Poem:</hi> 'Tis rare that an Author makes two of theſe Fables under the Name of one and the ſame Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Nor do Poets uſe to denote the Action in the <hi>Title</hi> of the Poem. Several Things happen'd to <hi>Medea, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes, Aeneas,</hi> and <hi>Troy;</hi> and one might feign a great many under the Names of the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> which the <hi>Title</hi> alone would never inform us of. This ſignifies nothing; the Authors are well enough ſatisfied with theſe plain <hi>Inſcriptions, Medea, the Odyſſeïs, the Aeneid, the Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, the Lamb and the Wolf.</hi> And they refer us to the Diſcourſe it ſelf to know what the Action is that is recited.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Epick Propoſition</hi> is that firſt part of the Poem, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author propoſes briefly, and in the General, what he has to ſay in the Body of his Work. And here two Things offer themſelves to our Conſideration; firſt, What the Poet propoſes; and ſecondly, After what manner he does it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> ſhould only comprehend the Matter of the Poem; that is, the Action, and the Perſons that Act, whether Divine or Humane. We find all this in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Action <hi>Homer</hi> propoſes in the <hi>Iliad</hi> is <hi>the Revenge of Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> that of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> is <hi>the Return of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> and that of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is <hi>the Empire of</hi> Troy <hi>tranſlated into</hi> Italy <hi>by</hi> Aeneas.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhould any one be ſurpriz'd at <hi>Homer</hi>'s way of expreſſing

himſelf in his firſt Words, where he ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">

He would not then have made the Rehearſal of an Action, but of a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We are not to ſtop here, ſince in truth he himſelf does not. He ſays, he ſings this <hi>Anger</hi> which had been the Cauſe of ſo much Slaughter among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of ſo many brave Mens Deaths. He propoſes an Action then, and not a mere Paſſion, for the Subject of his Poem; and this Action is, as we already hinted, <hi>the Revenge of Achilles.</hi>

                  <p>If <hi>Homer</hi>'s Deſign had been to propoſe the two parts of each Poem; his Deſign was not to do it very diſtinctly. Yet we may conceive the firſt part of the <hi>Iliad</hi> by the Misfortunes of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and the ſecond by the illuſtrious Deaths of ſo many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes. The <hi>Grecians</hi> are greater Sufferers than the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and there are fewer Heroes kill'd on their ſide, but almoſt all are wounded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> ſpeaks plainly enough of the Travels of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> but it leaves us rather to infer his Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in <hi>Ithaca,</hi> than diſcovers it to us.

                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Poets chiefly inſiſt upon the Perſon of the Hero. It ſeems as if he alone were more properly the Subject-matter of the Poem than all the reſt. <hi>Homer</hi> names <hi>Achilles</hi> particularly, and adds <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to him, as we hinted in the former Chapter. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> are not nam'd, but only implied; and that in ſuch general terms, that we ſhould not know them, had we not Information otherways, that they are the Perſons.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Practice might have perhaps ſome Reſpect to the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Invention of the Poet, who ought at firſt to feign his Action without Names, and relates not the Action of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays; nor conſequently the Actions of <hi>Achilles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes Aeneas,</hi> or any other in particular: but of an Univerſal, General,

And in truth what can be more <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Modeſt</hi> than the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> which does not promiſe us any great Action of this Hero, but only the dangers, and the continual Fatigues of his Voyages, and the loſs of his miſerable Companions?</p>
                  <p>We ſhall find the very ſame <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Modeſty</hi> in the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> The Poet does not ſay his Hero had done much, but only that he had ſuffered much. Thô he ſpeaks of <hi>Alba</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; yet he propoſes neither as parts of his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but as Conſequences which other Heroes had brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection a great while after. So <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> has ſpoken of the deſtruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> but withal as an Action already done, and which his Readers were not to expect would be rehears'd in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of the Poem.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is ſomething more lofty, in that it mentions the Deaths of ſo many Heroes: But this is ſo far the Matter of this Poem, that it ſeems as if it could not have been wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And beſides, Art might oblige the Poet to make ſome kind of Conformity between the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and that of the whole Poem, which is nothing elſe but a long ſeries of Heat and Violence. But to conclude, the Poet acquitted himſelf of theſe Obligations with ſo much <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> that one cannot charge upon him the Tranſgreſſing of <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule. For he does not ſay that theſe Heroe's Deaths were the Effect of his Heroe's Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Courage: He only ſays that he ſings the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> which had brought ſo many diſaſters upon the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and had been the Cauſe of the Death of ſo many Homes, who were expoſed as a Prey to Birds and Beaſts. Certainly if there is any thing of Grandeur here, 'tis not ſo much in any Glory or Splendor, as in that Trouble and ſmoke, which will ſcarce let us ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Beſide this ſort of Bombaſt, which things, propoſed with too much glazing produce; or which ariſes from the Dignity of the Perſonages, that at the very firſt are praiſed unſeaſonably, and ſet off with too great Ideas; there is yet another that reſpects the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Poet. He ſhould ſpeak as Modeſtly of himſelf, as of his Hero or his Subject. <hi>Virgil</hi> in plain terms ſays that he ſings the Action of <hi>Aeneas. Homer</hi> begs his <hi>Muſe</hi> to inſpire the Action into him, or to ſing it for him; this was all. <hi>Claudian</hi> has not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed theſe Exemplars. <note n="*" place="margin">Audaci promere cantu Mens congeſta jubet. Greſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus removere profani. Jam furor humanos noſtro de pectore Senſus Expulit, &amp; totum ſpirant praecordia Phoebum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> He ſays, <hi>his Song ſhall be full of Boldneſs: That the Poetical Fury, and the whole Divinity of</hi> Apollo <hi>had ſo ſwell'd his Mind and poſſeſs'd his Senſes, that they had not left any thing Human about him: That the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were profane, whoſe converſation he could no longer endure:</hi> With a great deal of ſuch like ſtuff.</p>

Theſe Raptures well manag'd, would look well enough in an <hi>Ode,</hi> a <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> or ſome ſuch Piece, that is ſhort enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them to the laſt, and where we may ſuppoſe them to have been uttered all in a Breath.</p>
                  <p>But a Poem ſo long as an <hi>Epopéa,</hi> admits not theſe Rhapſodical <hi>Propoſitions</hi> from a Poet that is well in his Wits. This is <hi>Horace</hi>'s Doctrine, who would have the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> be <hi>ſimple and Modeſt;</hi> and yet he ſticks not in one of his <note n="*" place="margin">Odi Profanum vulgus &amp; arces.

                     <hi>Odes</hi> to do what <hi>Claudian</hi> does in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> we cited. This Poem of <hi>Claudian</hi> that begins ſo ill juſtifies the Rule, which <hi>Horace</hi> has drawn from the Practice of <hi>Homer.</hi> One may even there obſerve, that thoſe, who are ſo daring in what they propoſe, are ſo more out of Lightneſs and Vanity, than out of any knowledge of their Abilities and Art; and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are the leaſt able to keep up to it. <hi>Claudian</hi> was not able to carry the Terrors which he propoſed as the Subject of his Poem any farther than the middle of his firſt Book: And that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Darkneſs, which ſhould have eclipſed the light of the Sun, could not take off from the luſtre of the Ivory Walls, and Amber Columns of <hi>Proſerpina</hi>'s fine Palace.</p>
                  <p>But we will not leave this Chapter without producing ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that are contrary to the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> We may reckon ſix of theſe ſorts of faults. The firſt is when any thing is propoſed that is foreign to the Subject: The ſecond is, the giving too large an Idea of the Subject Matter: The third is, when the Hero appears too dazling in the <hi>Propoſition:</hi> The fourth, when the Poet ſpeaks too favourably of himſelf: The fifth is the omitting the Preſence of the Deity: And the ſixth is, when nothing is ſaid that may give a light into the Character of the Hero.</p>
                  <p>There is ſcarce one of theſe faults but may be met with in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>Achilleid.</hi>

                  <p>He ſpeaks of the Gods in this Propoſition, but 'tis more by Chance, than in Imitation of <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil;</hi> ſince if he had been perſwaded that Art required ſo much, he would not have fail'd doing it in the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the <hi>Thebaid.</hi>

                  <p>To conclude, he has given a very ſorry Character of his Hero, when he ſtiles him <hi>Magnanimous. Achilles</hi> was certainly very Impatient, Cholerick, and Revengeful. <hi>Homer</hi> made him ſo, and <hi>Statius</hi> ſhould have kept up the ſame Character, which this firſt Poet had given him. <note n="*" place="margin">Scriptor, honoratum ſi forte reponis Achillem, Impiger, iracundus, iners, inexorabilis, acer, &amp;c. <hi>Hor.

In the <hi>Propoſition</hi> he contradicts this Character of <hi>Magnanimous</hi> which he had beſtow'd upon <hi>Achilles</hi> at firſt: For immediately after, among the Actions he was to mention of his Hero, he mentions one, that is far from <hi>Magnanimity;</hi> namely his cruel Uſage of <hi>Hector</hi>'s body, when after he had kill'd him, he bound him by the heels to his Charriot, and drag'd him a great many times round the Walls of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the Tomb of <hi>Patroclus.</hi>

                     <hi>HOMER</hi> in his two Poems inſerts the <hi>Invocation</hi> in the <hi>Propoſition.</hi> He does not ſay that he will relate what <hi>Achilles,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> has done; but intreats his <hi>Muſe</hi> to make the Recital. <hi>Virgil</hi> has theſe two parts diſtinct: He firſt <note n="†" place="margin">Arma virumque cano.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes what he would ſing, and then he <note n="‡" place="margin">Muſa, mihi cauſas me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora.</note> begs his <hi>Muſe</hi> to inform him about it. In this ſecond part he <note n="*" place="margin">Infignem pietate virum.</note> inſerts the <hi>Character</hi> of his Hero, which more properly belongs to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53904:83"/>
firſt. And this makes it appear, that it ſignifies little whether they are diſtinct from each other, or joyn'd together.</p>
                  <p>But let the way be how it will, the Poet cannot omit the <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He ſpeaks of things which he would know nothing of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome God or other had reveal'd them to him. He owes his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this Example of Piety and Veneration, which is the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the Moral, and the Inſtructions he pretends to lay down from the Fable: And laſtly, ſince the Gods muſt be concern'd in it, 'tis unreaſonable to dare to bring them upon the Stage, without craving their leave firſt. So that with reſpect to the Gods, the Auditors, and the Poet himſelf, the <hi>Invocation</hi> becomes an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible and neceſſary part.</p>
                  <p>The Poet likewiſe addreſſes himſelf to the Gods very often in the ſequel of his Work: <note n="*" place="margin">Nune agé qui Reges Erato, quae tempora, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Quis Latio antiquo fuerit Status, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Sometimes when he enters upon a new matter, as <hi>Virgil</hi> does, when in his Seventh Book he enters upon the ſecond part of his deſign: <note n="†" place="margin">Quis Deus, ô Muſae, tam ſaeva incendia Teucris A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit; tantos ratibus quis depulit ignes, Dicite Priſca fides facti, ſed fama perennis. <hi>Aen.</hi> 9.</note> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when he relates ſome miraculous Action, that is above common probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as in the transformation of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Ships into Nymphs: <note n="‡" place="margin">Die, quibus Imperium eſt animarum umbraeque filentes, Et Chaos &amp; Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geton, loca nocte ſilentia latè: Sit mihi fas audita loqui, fit numine veſtro Pandere res altâ terrâ &amp; caligine merſas. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> Sometimes when he reveals thoſe Myſteries, which God ſeems to have been willing to keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the Curioſity of Men, ſuch for inſtance is that which happens in the ſhades below, whither <hi>Aeneas</hi> is conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Sibyl:</hi> And laſtly at other times upon other occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But the Principal <hi>Invocation</hi> is that at the Beginning. And here we are to take notice of two things. The firſt is what the Poet deſires: And the ſecond, to what Deity he makes his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>That which we demand in the firſt Queſtion, is whether the Poet ſhould deſire that all his Matter ſhould be inſpir'd into him, or only a part of it. The different practice of our Authors obliges us to make this Reflection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> has ſo well connected his <hi>Propoſition</hi> in the <hi>Iliad</hi> with the <hi>Invocation,</hi> that he implores his <hi>Muſe</hi> for all that he propoſes without exception.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> he has begun after the ſame way; but after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning ſeveral things which he begs his <hi>Muſe</hi> to aſſiſt him in, he at laſt retrenches ſome; and only intreats her to tell him a part of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> follows this laſt method. That which is particular in him is, that he does not in the general deſire one part of his Subject, but preciſely determines what part he would have his <hi>Muſe</hi> inſpire into
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53904:83"/>
him. 'Tis that which was the moſt ſecret and hardeſt to know. After he had very exactly propoſed all his Matter, he then addreſſes himſelf to his <hi>Muſe,</hi> and prays her to inform him of the Cauſes of all.</p>
                  <p>There is a very natural reaſon to be given for this Conduct: For ſince the Poet ſuppoſes that his Action is true, and writes as if he would have it paſs for ſuch; he muſt likewiſe ſuppoſe that ſuch an Illuſtrious and Important Action could not have been buried in Oblivion. By this means <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Report</hi> might have informed him of one Part. This is the Idea he would have the Readers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when he does not deſire the <hi>Muſes</hi> for all.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps likewiſe our Poets did this to divide the buſineſs ſo, that they might have the Honour of ſinging a part with the Gods. This is what <note n="*" place="margin">Haec Damon: vos, quae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponderit Alpheſiboeus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Pierides: Non omnia poſſumus omnes.</note> 
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> does in his eighth <hi>Eclogue:</hi> He ſings the one half of his Matter; and prays the <hi>Muſes</hi> to go on and ſing the other part, becauſe he could not do all.</p>
                  <p>However the caſe ſtands, we ſee by this Practice what the Poet is allowed to do. Thus much for what he deſires; now let us ſee to whom he makes his Addreſſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Invocation</hi> is proper to the Poem, when 'tis either addreſſed to the God, who preſides over the Subject he treats on; or to the God, who preſides over Poetry in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <note n="*" place="margin">In nova fert ani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatas dicere formas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora. Di coeptis (nam vos mutaſtis &amp; illas) Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate meis.</note> 
                     <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> makes uſe of the firſt ſort of <hi>Invocation.</hi> He names no God in particular, but addreſſes himſelf to all who had contributed to the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Transformations he was about to deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>The Poet <note n="†" place="margin">Quae quoniam rerum Naturam ſola gubernas, Te ſociam ſtudeo ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundis verſibus eſſe, Quos ego de rerum naturà pandere conor.</note> 
                     <hi>Lucretius</hi> does the ſame in his Poem concerning <hi>the Nature of things.</hi> He calls upon <hi>Venus,</hi> becauſe ſhe preſides o'er the Productions of Nature.</p>
                  <p>This is likewiſe what <hi>Virgil</hi> has done in his <hi>Georgicks.</hi> He names in particular all the Gods who were concern'd with <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and as if he had been affraid of omitting any one <note n="*" place="margin">Diique, Deaeque omnes Studium quibus arva tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri.</note> he calls upon them all in General.</p>
                  <p>But both he and <hi>Homer</hi> have left us another kind of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in their <hi>Epick Poems.</hi> They have call'd upon the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and ſo they have diſtinguiſhed the Deities which preſide over Poeſie, from thoſe that preſide over the Actions of the Poems, and are the Perſonages that act in them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we are not to imagine that theſe Divirities, which they invok'd, were look'd upon by the Poets themſelves, as Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53904:84"/>
from whom they expected any real Aſſiſtance. Under this Name of <hi>Muſe,</hi> they wiſh'd for that Genius of <hi>Poeſy,</hi> and all thoſe Qualifications and Circumſtances, that were neceſſary for executing their deſign. This is nothing elſe but an Allegorical and Poetical way of expreſſion: As when they ſay, <hi>the God of Sleep, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Fame,</hi> and the like. There are likewiſe <hi>Muſes</hi> of all Ages, Countries, and Religions. There are <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as <hi>Pagan</hi> Muſes. There are <hi>Greek, Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Muſes.</hi> There are New ones too, which begin every day to appear in behalf of thoſe who diſdaining the thread-bare Antiquities, are ſo bold as to invent things wholly new.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote his <hi>Eclogues,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd the <note n="*" place="margin">Sicelides Muſae, paulo majora canamus. <hi>Vir. Ecl.</hi> 6. Extremum hunc, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſie, mihi concede labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. <hi>Ecl.</hi> 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicilian Muſes,</hi> becauſe he imitated <hi>Theocritus:</hi> And this <hi>Sicilian Poet</hi> coming off ſo well put the <hi>Latin Poet</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wiſhing for as lucky a Genius as this Iſlander had.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſes</hi> of the Philoſopher <hi>Lucretius</hi> were <note n="†" place="margin">Avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante Trita ſolo: juvat integros ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere fontes, Atque hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire; juvatque novos de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepere flores; Inſignem<expan>

                  <p>But the Doctrine of this Author leaves no room to doubt what ſort of Gods they were, that he invok'd. At the very beginning of this Poem, when he had addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Venus,</hi> as a Goddeſs who managed the whole concern of Natural things, about which he was going to treat: He preſently-informs us, <note n="*" place="margin">Omnis enim per ſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vûm natura neceſſe eſt.

                     <hi>that the Gods never concerned themſelves with what was done below.</hi> This is the main Principle of his whole Treatiſe: and <note n="‡" place="margin">Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum.</note> Religion, in his account, is an Error that impoſes upon us. What then are theſe <hi>Muſes,</hi> and this <hi>Venus</hi> to which he addreſſes himſelf?

And did he intreat them to teach him, that 'tis an Error to pray to them, and a miſtake to expect any thing from them?

We will conclude this Chapter by a ſhort recapitulation of all that has been obſerv'd about the <hi>Invocation;</hi> and from thence it may be ſaid, That the <hi>Invocation</hi> may be mixed with the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or may be ſeparated from it: That it is always a neceſſary part of the <hi>Epick Poem:</hi> And that 'tis a prayer addreſſed to the Allegorical Genius of Poeſy, under the name of <hi>Muſe,</hi> or ſome one elſe, by whom the Poet begs to be inſpir'd, either in the whole, or only in a part of that which he has undertaken to relate.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of the Body of the <hi>Poem,</hi> or the <hi>Narration</hi> properly ſo called.</head>
                  <p>ALL the parts of the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> which we have already diſcours'd of, are nothing but Introductions into it. Let us now enquire into the Body of the Poem, and into that which is properly called the <hi>Naration.</hi> And in ſhort this <hi>Narration</hi> is the Recital which the Poet makes of his entire Action, <hi>Epiſodiz'd</hi> with all its Circumſtances and all its Decorations. 'Tis in this part we are to look for the <hi>Beginning, the Middle,</hi> and <hi>the End</hi> of the Action: This is it which informs us of the Cauſes of all we read: In this are propoſed, in this are unravelled all the Plots and Intrigues: In this the Perſonages, whether Divine or Humane, ought to demonſtrate their Intereſts, their Manners, and their Quality, by their Actions and Diſcourſes: And all this muſt be deſcribed with the Beauty, the Majeſty, and the Force of Verſe, of Stile, of Thoughts, of Similes, and of other Ornaments, that are ſuitable to the Subject in general, and to each ſingle thing in particular.</p>
                  <p>We have ſpoken already to ſome of theſe things, and ſhall ſay ſomething more about them in the remaining parts of this Treatiſe. But in this we ſhall conſider, Firſt, the Qualifications of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Secondly, the Order our Poets have obſerv'd therein: And Thirdly, its <hi>Duration;</hi> that is, how long time they have aſſigned to the Adventures which they themſelves have related in each of their Poems. For we have already obſerv'd how much time they aſſign'd to the Entire Actions.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with the Qualifications of the <hi>Narration.</hi> It muſt be <hi>Pleaſant, Probable, Moving, Marvellous,</hi> and <hi>Active.</hi> We prov'd the neceſſity of theſe Properties, when we treated of the Fable, and of the Nature of the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> from whence we took them. So that without inſiſting any longer upon theſe proofs, we ſhall in this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53904:85"/>
place only conſider, wherein theſe Qualifications do conſiſt, and what we are perſwaded <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have done to eſtabliſh them in the Poem.</p>

                     <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Profitable</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> in ſuch a manner, that he ſeems to treat of them both alike. But we fanſie, if that had been his deſign, he had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Poeſie in general, than to the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> in particular. With reſpect to the laſt we ſay, that the <hi>Profitable</hi> is a Property Eſſential to the <hi>Epick Narration,</hi> whereas the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> is only a Mode or Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. For it muſt be granted, that the Fable, which is the very Soul of the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> was only invented to inſtruct Men: That the <hi>Profitable</hi> is not made uſe of to pleaſe People; but that on the other hand the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> is inſerted to procure a more favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Inſtructions which the Fable contains.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Profitable</hi> belongs not to any particular part of the Poem, but to the very Nature of the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and of the Fable in general. I am ſatisfied then with what I ſaid about it in the firſt Book, where I think it was more proper to ſpeak of it, than to joyn it with the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> here. Beſides, it being Eſſential, as I have already ſaid, it will be met with in a great many Paſſages, ſince all ſuppoſe it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>PLeaſantry in the <hi>Epick Narration</hi> is a neceſſary Qualification, which engages us to read the Poem with ſome ſort of Delight, thô excited by the moſt Terrible, the moſt Violent, and the moſt afflicting Paſſions. The Effect may ariſe, either from the Poem alone; or from that Relation which the Poet makes between his Auditors and his Perſonages, and the Intereſt which he makes the firſt to have in the Action he relates. <hi>Statius</hi> rob'd himſelf of this Advantage, when not regarding the <hi>Romans</hi> for whom he wrote, he muſt needs hunt for his Subjects in Countries and States, whoſe Manners and Cuſtoms bore no relation to thoſe of his Readers, and wherein they had not the leaſt Intereſt. <hi>Homer</hi> has made a better choice, and has better diſpoſed of his Actions. And if <hi>Virgil</hi> has not been more careful than <hi>Homer,</hi> yet at leaſt he has
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53904:85"/>
had infinitely more luck than him. But we ſaid enough of this in the firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pleaſantries</hi> which the Poem affords in its own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently from the Auditors, are of three ſorts. The firſt ariſe from the Beauty of the Verſe, of the Stile, and of the Thoughts: Others depend upon the Perſons that are introduced into the Poem, upon their Manners, their Paſſions, and their Intereſts rightly manag'd: And the third ſort conſiſt in the things which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, and in the way of propoſing them.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall ſpeak of the firſt ſort in our laſt Book, wherein we ſhall treat of the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions.</hi> In this Book, we ſhall allow a whole Chapter to the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and all the next Book will be about the <hi>Manners.</hi> As for the reſt let us conſider them here.</p>
                  <p>It is not neceſſary that all the perſons introduc'd into a Poem ſhould have divided and particular <hi>Intereſts</hi> therein: Not only their great Number exempts them from it, but likewiſe a multitude of <hi>Intereſts</hi> would too much annoy and ſubvert the Pleaſure we are diſcourſing of. It confounds the Hearer's mind, it over charges his Memory; and makes him leſs capable of thoſe Motions with which we would have him affected. The greater variety of things we have to take notice of and remember, the more ſedate and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive ought we to be, for fear of loſing any neceſſary thing; and when any ſuch thing eſcapes us, we take but little pleaſure in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which we have no farther underſtanding of.</p>
                  <p>But there muſt be care likewiſe taken, that no Action or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of any length be deſcrib'd without intereſted perſons. <note n="*" place="margin">Aeneid. l. 3.</note> The Recital, which <hi>Achemenides</hi> makes of that which happened to <hi>

This wretched <hi>Grecian</hi> had a great Intereſt therein; but ſince he is but a very inconſiderable Perſonage in this Poem, <hi>Virgil</hi> provides that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſhould not be at a Diſtance from the Borders of the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> where he might in ſafety hear this Adventure: But all this is told in the Port, and upon the very Coaſt, where the <hi>Trojans</hi> were in danger of ſuffering the ſame Fate with the Companions of <hi>

But the Readers are very deſirous to know what any perſon ſhall ſay or do in an Adventure wherein he has ſome Intereſt. This is more apparent in the <hi>Theatre,</hi> from whence the want of Intereſt has excluded the <hi>Narrations</hi> of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and of ſuch Actors as were only to tell what paſſed behind the Scenes. After <hi>Oedipus</hi> was come to the knowledge of his Parents and his Crimes, the Spectators were not very eager to know what the thoughts of the old <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and the <hi>Theban Phorbas</hi> are, nor do they take any delight in hearing them. But they cannot hear <hi>Oedipus</hi> and <hi>Jocaſta</hi> without application and attention.</p>
                  <p>As much might be ſaid concerning the <hi>Manners</hi> and the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which are the ſecond ſor of <hi>Pleaſantries.</hi> There is nothing more cold and diſguſtful than to ſee Perſonages of no <hi>Character.</hi> Good Painters give this to all their Draughts; and repreſent them either Paſſionate, or Attentive upon ſome thing or other. Such as are moſt lively, and have moſt of the <hi>Character</hi> upon them, are the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Eye, and get moſt credit to their Maſters. <note n="*" place="margin">Ut Pictura Poeſis erit.</note> 'Tis juſt with Poetry as with Painting.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort comprehends the <hi>Pleaſantries</hi> which the things themſelves furniſh us with. There are ſome things that in their own Nature are <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> namely ſuch as are Important and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous,</hi> as Wars, and other great Adventures, provided they are not collected without Choice and Judgment, nor carried on to an extreme, but judicious and well managed.</p>
                  <p>Others there are that are cold and inſipid; and great skill muſt be uſed to manage them with ſucceſs.

                  <p>Dogmatical things are generally dry and inſipid. Of this nature is the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> has touch'd upon in his ſixth Book with ſo much ſucceſs. 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that this great Poet, ſhould give us Inſtances of all ſorts of perfections. Upon this account we might ſay, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> upon another Occaſion ſays of <hi>Homer,</hi> that had an ordinary Poet manag'd this Subject, he would have been inſufferable. The Art which I diſcover in him is what follows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, he makes this Doctrine neceſſary for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Wonders which follow. Beſides, he goes farther, for he makes it a neceſſary part of his Fable, and his Subject; ſince
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53904:86"/>
tis the Foundation of the Religion, the Laws, and the Morality, which <hi>Aeneas</hi> went to eſtabliſh in <hi>Italy</hi> under the Character of a <hi>Pantifex</hi> and a <hi>Legiſlator.</hi> In the third place, before ever he propoſes it to the Readers, he puts them upon deſiring it as much as <hi>Aeneas</hi> did; for without doubt they are mov'd with the ſame Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, which the Poet beſtows ſo naturally on his Hero: They ſee with the ſame Amazement, that he does, perſons that were to be born ſome Ages after: And what this Hero asks <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> that they ask <hi>Virgil.</hi> [<note n="*" place="margin">O Pater, anne aliquos ad coelum hinc ire pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum eſt Sublimes ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, iterumque ad tardá reverti Corpora?</note> 
                     <hi>Is it poſſible, that there ſhould be any Souls here ſo fond of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again upon the Earth, and of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned once more in a body?]</hi> And 'tis with delight that they hear the <note n="†" place="margin">Dicam equidem, r<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

The Author does not dogmatize at all himſelf: But he brings it about, that it ſhould be diſcours'd of by two perſons of the greateſt importance in his Poem, and who were both very highly intereſted therein. Laſtly, he is very ſhort upon this Subject: He does not ſo much as ſpend thirty Verſes about it.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſual and proper way for Poeſie, is to lay down theſe pieces of Doctrine diſguiſed under the Allegories of ſome Action or other. <hi>Homer</hi> does this often in ſome Phyſical points. The Age <hi>Virgil</hi> lived in obliged him to be more reſerv'd therein; by which means he has more examples of leſſons in <hi>Morality.</hi> We have ſaid ſomething already about this in the firſt Book: And ſhall ſay more of it in the Book about <hi>Machines</hi> and the <hi>Gods:</hi> And likewiſe in this Book, when we come to ſhew, how the <hi>Epick Narration</hi> ought to be <hi>Active.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meeting of Councils may be reckoned among thoſe things which make the <hi>Narration</hi> languiſh, and render it unpleaſant. Quietneſs, Moderation, and arguing of Debates ought naturally to preſide there, and all this is oppoſite to the Motions, and the Action, which ought to appear throughout the whole <hi>Epick Poem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Poets have carefully avoided all manner of ſage and ſerious Debates, where each perſon ſpeaks in his turn, and delivers his ſober thoughts. They generally brought in ſome haſty or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſons, ſuch as are <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the firſt Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and almoſt all the other <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> of this Fable. Such likewiſe in the <hi>Aeneid</hi> are <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Juno</hi> in the tenth Book, and <hi>Drauces</hi> and <hi>Turnus</hi> in the Eleventh. The Council in the ninth Book is altogether as Paſſionate, but the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of another kind. There are neither Quarrels, nor Heats. All the Perſonages therein are generous and manly: And yet of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53904:87"/>
above threeſcore Verſes which the Poet ſpends about it, there are ſcarce five calm ones. <hi>Niſus</hi> and young <hi>Euryalus,</hi> that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced therein, make the reſt ſo paſſionate, that this Paſſage is not one of the leaſt tender and moving Beauties, which the <hi>Aeneid</hi> has of this kind.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Aſſemblies are without paſſions, there ſhould be little ſaid in them, and no body contradicting what is propos'd, theſe Incidents are not ſo much Debates, as ſimple Propoſals of what is going to be done. There ſhould likewiſe ſuch proper Places be choſen for them in the Poem, where they might not interrupt the Series of the Action. Of this Nature are the two Aſſemblies of the Gods in the firſt and fifth Books of the <hi>Odyſſeis.</hi> The firſt is at the Beginning of the Poem, where it interrupts nothing: And the ſecond does not laſt long, and is only a ſimple Tranſition from the Recital of the Tranſactions at <hi>Ithaca</hi> during the Abſence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> to the Recital of that which more particularly regards the Perſon of this Hero.</p>
                  <p>The Reader is offended likewiſe, when that is related to him which he knows already. This was not ſo great a fault in <hi>Homer</hi>'s time. <hi>Virgil</hi> is more exact herein. <hi>Venus</hi> in the firſt book, would not make a Recital of her Misfortunes to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> ſhe interrupts it to comfort him. And in the third Book, when good Manners oblig'd this Hero to relate his ſtory to <hi>Andromache, Helenus</hi> comes in very opportunely, and ſo hinders him from going on with his Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of</hi> Probability.</head>
                  <p>TRuth and <hi>Probability</hi> may meet together, ſince a thing, that is true, may appear ſuch. This is what's common. But ſometimes Truth it ſelf is only <hi>Probability,</hi> as in Miraculous, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, and extraordinary Actions. Sometimes likewiſe there is <hi>Probability</hi> without Truth, as in the ordinary Fictions of the Poets. In a word, an Action may be either only True, or only <hi>Probable,</hi> or elſe without Truth and <hi>Probability,</hi> or laſtly, it may have both theſe Qualifications. Theſe four ſorts of Actions or things have been as it were divided among four ſorts of Learning. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> has got the firſt, relying only on that which is true independently
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53904:87"/>
from <hi>Probability,</hi> which may, or may not be in it. Such is the Action of the <hi>Maid of Orleans.</hi> The <hi>Epick</hi> and <hi>Dramatick</hi> Fables are oppoſite to Hiſtory, in that they prefer a <hi>Probable</hi> Falſity before an Improbable Truth. Such an Action as <hi>Samſon</hi>'s would be leſs proper for the Subject of an <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> than the Death of <hi>Dido</hi> who made away with her ſelf, when <hi>Aeneas</hi> left her. <hi>Aeſop</hi> is alike negligent of Truth and Probability in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes he attributes to the Beaſts. Laſtly, <hi>Moral Philoſophy</hi> ſhould not only mind the Truth of the things it teaches, but 'tis likewiſe neceſſary that this Truth appear ſuch, and convince thoſe, we are willing to convince, that it is profitable.</p>
                  <p>But to what we have ſaid concerning the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> we may add that naturally it makes uſe of both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> does; and that in its Expreſſions and its Dreſs, it aſſumes a liberty very like that of <hi>Aeſop.</hi> It is <hi>Probable</hi> that <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when going for <hi>Italy,</hi> endur'd a dreadful ſtorm, which caſt him upon the Coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> where he eſcaped. 'Tis a <hi>Moral Truth,</hi> that God proves, and ſometimes ſeems to abandon good men, and that at laſt he reſcues them from the Dangers, into which he had permitted them to fall: This is not only <hi>True,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</hi> But the Diſcourſe that paſſed between <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and what <hi>Neptune</hi> ſaid to <hi>Boreas</hi> and <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> have as little <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Probability</hi> in them, as the Intercourſe that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Country</hi> and the <hi>City-Mouſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much may be ſaid in the general. To be more particular, and to ſpeak more exactly and Methodically concerning the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> of <hi>Epick Narrations,</hi> we ſhall reduce it to ſeveral Heads, and conſider it according to <hi>Divinity,</hi> according to <hi>Morality,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Nature,</hi> according to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> according to <hi>Experience,</hi> and according to <hi>vulgar Opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that there is nothing with reſpect to <hi>Divinity,</hi> but what is <hi>Probable;</hi> becauſe with God nothing is impoſſible. This is a Means the Poets often make uſe of to render every thing <hi>Probable,</hi> which they have a mind to feign contrary to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Nature. This is an ample Subject, and requires a particular Treatiſe: Which we ſhall beſtow upon it, when we come to treat of the <hi>Machines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already obſerv'd that <hi>Morality</hi> requires both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> and the firſt is more neceſſary than the laſt. A Poet was formerly condemned and fined for a Default in this upon the Theatre: For he made a Perſonage, whom he had repreſented as an honeſt Man, to ſay, <hi>that when his tongue ſwore, his Mind did not.</hi> Certainly 'tis neither <hi>True</hi> nor <hi>Probable</hi> that an honeſt Man ſhould ever trick another by a falſe Oath, and call God to witneſs thoſe Promiſes he never intends to keep.</p>

                     <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher accuſes <hi>Virgil</hi> of a fault againſt <hi>Natural Truth</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> when he ſays that the Winds were pen'd up in Grots: Becauſe Wind being nothing elſe but Air, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours in Motion, it deſtroys its Nature to ſuppoſe it in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Repoſe. <hi>Voſſius</hi> anſwers this, and ſays, that the Poet has very well deſcribed the Natural production of Winds, which ariſe from Hills by the Vapours and Exhalations, that are incloſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that 'tis concerning the Cauſes of Winds which the ſpeaks, by a figure very common among Poets and Orators, taking the Cauſe for the Effect. 'Tis as if we ſhould ſay, that the Winds are incloſed in Eolipiles full of Water, ſince when theſe Veſſels are warm, the Water comes out of them in puffs of Wind. It would have been likewiſe a Fault againſt <hi>Natural Probability</hi> to have ſaid that <hi>Aeneas</hi> met with Stags in <hi>Africk,</hi> if 'tis true that they could not live there. But theſe are Venial Slips, becauſe, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, they make not againſt the Poet's Art, but ariſe from his ignorance in ſome things that he has learn'd from other Arts. Yet care muſt be taken that they be not too groſs and viſible. There are ſome <hi>Probabilities</hi> of this kind from which <hi>Aeſop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would not be excuſed. We ſhould never pardon him if he had repreſented the <hi>Lyon</hi> Timorous, the <hi>Hare</hi> Daring, the <hi>Fox</hi> Dull, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Probability</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Reaſon</hi> is uſually deſtroyed by thoſe, who only ſtrive to make things look Great. They tranſgreſs the Bounds which good ſenſe preſcribes. They think 'tis creeping unleſs they ſoar above the Clouds: And <note n="*" place="margin">Et dum vitat humum, nubes &amp; ioania captat. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> little dream that when they quit the Earth, they part with what is ſolid to embrace an Airy Fantom. <hi>Statius</hi> is very often guilty of this Fault. Who would believe, for Inſtance, that a ſingle Man ſurprized in an Ambuſcado by fifty Bravo's, that lay in wait for him, could kill nine and forty of them, and give Quarter to the laſt? Who would believe that this ſame Romantick Hero would fight at fifty cuffs with a Young Prince for the Wall? And yet they wore Swords by their ſides, even when they were pulling of hair, and ſcratching Faces with their Nails. The <note n="*" place="margin">Forte &amp; nudaſſent enſes, ſic ira ferebat. <hi>Theb. l,</hi> 4.</note> Poet himſelf obſerves as much, and ſays their Anger roſe ſo high, that perhaps they had drawn upon one another, if King <hi>Adraſtus</hi> had not ſtep'd in between. Here is a ſtrange Illuſtration of the rage of two Kings. The third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finds it ſo reaſonable, <note n="†" place="margin">Haud humiles tanta ira decet.</note> that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers by this noble exploit the greatneſs of their Extraction.

Sometimes the Poets are found fault with for relating things contrary to <hi>Experience.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Etiam decimo Iliados Jovem fulgurare facit, ubi ningit. Nunquam hoc Vidimus. <hi>Scaliger. Poet. Book 5.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Scaliger</hi> blames <hi>Homer</hi> for ſaying <hi>that Jupiter Thundered and Snowed at the ſame time: Which is a thing,</hi> ſays this Critick, <hi>which we never obſerved.</hi> But this does not contradict <hi>Experience;</hi> not many years ago it was obſervable, that in <hi>January</hi> the Thunder was ſo Violent, that it Burnt down the Steeple of a Church at <hi>Chalons,</hi> and did as much at the Abby of <hi>Chally</hi> near <hi>Senlis,</hi> and in ſeveral other places. Terrible Claps of Thunder were heard, and ſeveral Thunderbolts fell at <hi>Senlis</hi> in a very deep and thick Snow. <hi>Homer</hi> then might likewiſe have ſeen the ſelf ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>But the principal ſort of <hi>Probability,</hi> and that which we nam'd laſt, is the <hi>Probability</hi> according to the <hi>common-received Opinion;</hi> which is of no ſmall moment in this place. A thing is <hi>Probable</hi> when it ſeems to be <hi>True.</hi> But ſometimes it ſeems <hi>True</hi> to Men of Sence, and Falſe to the Vulgar; or the Contrary. Since the Vulgar and the Learned are thus divided, it may be asked which ſide the Poet ought to take. The Subject ſhall be, for inſtance, the Adventure of <hi>Dido,</hi> or that of <hi>Penelope,</hi> or the Story of <hi>Medea, Helen,</hi> or the like. That which <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it ſhall be <hi>Probable</hi> to the Vulgar: But Men of Learning ſhall have read the contrary in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Some Authors ſhall have written that <hi>[Dido</hi> was Chaſt, and <hi>Medea</hi> Innocent, that <hi>Penelope</hi> was baniſhed and divorced by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> for having abuſed his Abſence, and that <hi>Helen</hi> was never at <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis no hard matter to decide this Point by the Rules I have laid down. <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and the reſt have made no ſcruple to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that ſo their Fables might be more juſt. <note n="*" place="margin">Rectius Iliacum carmen deducis in actus.

                     <hi>Horace</hi> does not refer Poets to the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> but either to Fables already invented as that of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> or elſe to vulgar Opinions and Fame. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays nothing againſt, but rather ſeems to confirm this Doctrine, when he tells us, that a Poet does not write as an Hiſtorian, what ſort of Man <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was, what he ſaid, or what he did, upon ſuch or ſuch an Occaſion; but only what in all probability he ought to have ſaid or done. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the Fable of <hi>Oedipus</hi> upon the Theatre, and yet, he ſays, that that which ſerves as a Ground work to all this Action has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of reaſon in it: And that King <hi>Oedipus</hi> could not have tarry'd ſo many years, before he made inquiry into the Murder of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour King <hi>Laius.</hi> He only excuſes the Negligence that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>Oedipus,</hi> upon the account that this Fault againſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> was foreign to the <hi>Tragedy.</hi> But this excuſe being only deſigned
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53904:89"/>
to juſtifie the Conduct of the Poet, it expreſly ſuppoſes that this Action was invented contrary to the Truth of <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it ſhews that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> allows of this, when he goes about to prove that this Falſity hinders not but the Subject may be Lawful and Regular.</p>
                  <p>He likewiſe approves of the <hi>Iphigenia</hi> in <hi>Taurica,</hi> and thinks it worth his while to make the Platform of it, as he did that of the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> And yet it does not appear that this Philoſopher nor the Learned Men of his times were perſwaded of a thing whoſe Falſity quite ruins this Action. Certainly they never thought, that in the very moment <hi>Iphigenia</hi> was going to be ſacrificed to <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Aulis,</hi> this Goddeſs conveyed her away, and ſubſtituted a Hind in her ſtead. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was therefore of the Opinion, that a Poet, when his Fable ſo required, was not ſo ſtrictly tyed up to the <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to ſuit himſelf to the Capacity of the Learned, as he was to that which might paſs for <hi>Probable</hi> in the Eye of the Vulgar.</p>
                  <p>After all, it may be ſaid, that not only ev'ry individual perſon finds his ſtory, and meets with his ſatisfaction in this Practice: But likewiſe Men of Learning ſee more ſolid Truths therein, than any the Vulgar can meet with; and more certain than thoſe of Hiſtory which the Poet diſregards. The more learned they are, the leſs will they expect theſe Hiſtorical Truths in a Poem, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that, but for things more Myſterious. The Truths, they look for there, are Moral and Allegorical Truths. The <hi>Aeneid</hi> was never writ to tell us the Story of <hi>Dido,</hi> but to inform us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Name of the Spirit and Conduct of that State which ſhe founded, and of the Original and Conſequences of its differences with <hi>Rome.</hi> A Man takes ſome delight in ſeeing this; and theſe Truths are more pleaſant, more apparent, and better underſtood, than thoſe which the Poet might have taken out of an Hiſtory that was ſo little known in his time, and about which the Learned Men of our days, after ſo many ſearches, do ſtill contend.</p>
                  <p>Beſide theſe ſorts of <hi>Probabilities,</hi> there is ſtill another particular one, which we may call an <hi>Accidental Probability.</hi> It conſiſts, not in making uſe of ſeveral Incidents, each of which in particular is <hi>Probable,</hi> but in ordering them ſo, that they ſhall happen all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether very <hi>Probably.</hi> A Man, for inſtance, may <hi>Probably</hi> die of an Apoplexy, but that this ſhould happen exactly when the Poet has occaſion to unravel his Plot, is not ſo eaſily granted.</p>
                  <p>The faults againſt this <hi>Probability</hi> are of a large Extent: For they comprehend the Multitude of Marvellous things, each of which might have been regular in the particular; but which in all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> cannot be heaped up in ſo great a Number and ſo ſmall a ſpace. 'Tis likewiſe a fault againſt this <hi>Probability,</hi> when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident not duly prepared (tho it needs it) is brought in all on a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53904:89"/>
ſudden. A deſire of ſurprizing the Auditors by the ſight of ſome Beauty which they never expected, caſts Poets of little Judgment into theſe Errors; but the effect thereof is of very ill Conſequence. When a Man ſets himſelf to ſeek for the Cauſes of theſe events in what he has already ſeen, this Application of thought takes away all the pleaſure. It would vex a Man to take too much pains to find out theſe Cauſes, but much more if he could not find them out at all. And when at laſt the Poet does diſcover them, the Paſſion is weaken'd or deſtroy'd by theſe miſplaced Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Comedians</hi> make uſe of theſe ſurprizes more frequently, and can reap ſome Advantage from them. But the gravity of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> will not away with theſe petty Amuſements. All there ought to be manag'd after a Natural way, ſo that the Incidents thereof muſt be duly prepar'd, or elſe be ſuch as need no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> is exact in this. <hi>Juno</hi> prepares the Tempeſt which ſhe raiſes in the firſt Book: <hi>Venus</hi> in the ſame Book prepares the Amours of the Fourth. The Death of <hi>Dido,</hi> which happen'd at the End of this Fourth Book, is prepar'd from the very * firſt day of her Marriage. <note place="margin">Ille dies primus Lethi.</note>

                  <p>ADmiration is oppoſed to <hi>Probability.</hi> 'Tis the buſineſs of the laſt to reduce ev'ry thing into the moſt ſimple, and moſt natural order: Whereas on the other hand, we never admire any thing, but what appears extraordinary, and out of the common Road. This is that which deceives ſome, who, to make their Heroes admir'd, raiſe them to what is impoſſible. This Practice meets with a quite contrary effect; for if we would have a thing admired, we ſhould make it ſo <hi>Probable,</hi> that it may be conceiv'd and credited: We never Admire that, which we think has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53904:90"/>
never been; and all extravagant Flights put us upon this Thought.</p>
                  <p>And yet for ought I know, I may yield too much to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Probability</hi> contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s mind, who prefers the <hi>Admirable</hi> by far before them.

                     <q>that theſe Additions, that are made to Reaſon and Truth for the raiſing of <hi>Admiration,</hi> are likewiſe <hi>Pleaſant;</hi> and that 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent how natural this is by the ordinary practice of moſt People, who to make their ſtory the more diverting, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or another of their own Invention: But that <hi>Homer</hi> out-does all Men in teaching us how to tell theſe ſorts of yes with a <hi>bon grace.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Fictions of <hi>Homer</hi> are, amongſt other things, ſuch as <hi>Horace</hi> commends in the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> and which he finds to be equally beautiful and ſurpriſing, joyning together theſe two Qualifications, the <hi>Pleaſant</hi> and the <hi>Marvellous,</hi> after the ſame manner that we have obſerved <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>But tho' this Philoſopher might have ſaid thus much, certainly he never deſign'd to allow Men a full licenſe of carrying things beyond <hi>Probability</hi> and Reaſon. Beſides, without doing him the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and without abating any thing of his due Authority, it may be queſtioned whether the Example of <hi>Homer,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, would have been exact enough for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Imitation. For the cuſtom of ſpeaking by Fables and Allegories, even in Proſe, and before the People, was not in vogue at <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Latin</hi> Poet's time. So that beſide the Allegorical ſenſe, he was farther obliged to inſert ſome other, which one might underſtand ſimply without any more ado.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53904:90"/>
Laſtly, that which I infer from the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is that he preſcribes the <hi>Marvellous</hi> and the <hi>Probable</hi> to both the <hi>Epick</hi> and the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poets: But in ſuch a manner, that the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick</hi> have a greater regard to the <hi>Probable</hi> than the <hi>Marvellous;</hi> and that the <hi>Epick</hi> on the contrary prefer the <hi>Admirable.</hi> The reaſon of this difference is, that we ſee what is done in Tragedy; and only hear by Recitals the Adventures of the <hi>Epopéa.</hi> 'Tis upon this conſideration that <hi>Horace</hi> orders, <note n="*" place="margin">Multaque tolles Ex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis, quae mox narret fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundia praeſens. Aut in avem Progne, Cadmus mutetur in anguem. Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque oſtendis mihi ſic incredulus odi. <hi>Poet.</hi>
                     </note> that in Tragedies themſelves the two ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Incidents (ſuch as the Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Progne</hi> into a Bird, or of <hi>Cadmus</hi> into a Serpent) ſhould be kept from the Spectator's view. There needs only ſimple Narrations to be made of theſe things. 'Tis likewiſe for this reaſon that the <hi>Epopéa</hi> has the privilege of <hi>Machines,</hi> which are as ſo many Miracles and exceed natural <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> But they are not after the ſame manner allow'd upon the Theatre.</p>
                  <p>We add further, that if for the better pleaſing the Auditors by a ſurprizing Incident, one ſhould tranſgreſs the boundaries of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Truth, their minds ought to be diſpoſed thereto, by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may ſet them ſo far beſides themſelves, that they be not in a condition to perceive that they are impoſed upon; or at leaſt that they may thank the Poet for having ſurpriſed them ſo pleaſantly. This is what Monſieur <hi>Corneille</hi> has obſerv'd in his <hi>Cid.</hi> He knew well enough that he could not bring <hi>Rodrigues</hi> into the Earl's Houſe, whom he had but juſt then Murder'd, without tranſgreſſing againſt Reaſon and Probability: But then he knew as well that the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the Spectators, and the Attention they gave to what paſſed between this Young Hero and <hi>Chimene,</hi> would not ſuffer them to take notice of this fault: And that tho' they ſhould have been inform'd of it, they would have taken it ill, if a more ſtrict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity had rob'd them of ſo great a ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>I believe that the beſt Rules for knowing how far 'tis allowable to carry on the <hi>Marvellous,</hi> and for diſcerning what will be taking, what will offend, and what will be Ridiculous; is firſt, a ſound judgment; and then the reading of good Authors, and likewiſe the Examples of thoſe who have come off but ſorrily; and laſtly the comparing theſe two together. But in this Examen of things a Man muſt be well acquainted with the Genius's, the Cuſtoms, and the Manners of the ſeveral Ages. For that which is a Beauty in <hi>Homer,</hi> might have met with ſorry Entertainment in the Works of a Poet in the days of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not enough (to make an Incident admir'd) that it ſhould have ſomething that is <hi>Admirable:</hi> But beſide that, 'tis requiſite there ſhould be nothing in it that might put a ſtop to its effect,

and deſtroy the <hi>Admiration;</hi> ſuch as would be all contrary Paſſions <hi>Admiration</hi> in this point has nothing but what is common to it ſelf and all the other Paſſions. Therefore for the better explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter we muſt join that with them.</p>

                     </note> but this Beauty is not enough. It is farther neceſſary, that it be moving and <hi>Paſſionate,</hi> that it tranſport the Mind of the Reader, fill him with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, give ſome pleaſure, caſt him into a Conſternation, and make him ſenſible of the Violence of all theſe Motions, even in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which he himſelf knows are feign'd and invented at pleaſure. <note n="†" place="margin">Ille per extenſum funem mihi poſſe videtur Ire Poeta, meum qui pectus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniter angit, Irritat, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, falſis terroribus implet Ut magus. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Horace,</hi> who preſcribes all this to the Poets, can't forbear admiring them, when they come off well, and he compares their skill to the Power of Magick.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Paſſions</hi> then are neceſſary to great Poems: But all are not equally neceſſary or convenient to all Poems. Mirth and Pleaſant ſurprizes belong to <hi>Comedy.</hi> On the contrary, Horrour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion belong to <hi>Tragedy.</hi> The <hi>Epick Poem</hi> keeps as it were in the middle between both, and ſeizes upon all theſe Paſſions, as is evident from the Grief that reigns in the fourth Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> and from the Sports and Diverſions of the Eighth.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> do not allow him in either of theſe Extremes, therefore the Poet does not permit one of them to be predominant in the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> He confines himſelf to <hi>Admiration</hi> only, which he carries to an higher pitch than in the <hi>Iliad:</hi> And 'tis upon this account that he introduces a great many more <hi>Machines</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> into the Body of the Action, than is to be ſeen in the Actions of the other two Poems. This Doctrine will find a fitter place in the next Book, where we ſhall treat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Manners</hi> and the <hi>Character.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſtill two things to ſay concerning the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> The One is how to impreſs them upon the Auditors: And the Other how to make them ſenſible of them. The Firſt is to prepare their minds for them: And the Second is, not to huddle together ſeveral <hi>Paſſions</hi> that are Incompatible.</p>
                  <p>The Neceſſity of preparing the Auditors is founded upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and General neceſſity of taking things where they are, when we would convey them elſewhere. 'Tis eaſie applying this Maxim to the Subject in hand. A Man is in a quiet and profound repoſe, and you have a mind by a diſcourſe made on purpoſe to make him angry: You muſt begin your diſcourſe by a mild way; by this means, you will Cloſe him, and then going hand in hand together, as the ſaying is, he will not fail following you in all the Paſſions: You have a mind to excite in him by degrees. But if at the firſt touch you manifeſt your Anger, you will make your ſelf as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and meet with as little ſucceſs as <hi>Ajax</hi> in <hi>Ovid's Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſes,</hi> in whom the witty <hi>Ovid</hi> has given us a notable Inſtance of this Default. He makes him begin his plea by Anger and violent figures before his Judges who were profoundly calm. <note n="*" place="margin">Conſedêre Duces, &amp; vulgi ſtante coronâ, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git ad hos Clypei dominus ſeptemplicis Ajax.

This Cauſe muſt be tryed in view of the Navy, and</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>my Competitor!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe neceſſary Preparations ariſe from the diſcourſe that goes before theſe Movements, or elſe from ſome Action, that already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to excite them before one ſpeaks. The Orators themſelves ſometimes make uſe of this laſt way. For tho' they generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite not the <hi>Paſſions</hi> till the end of their Harangues, yet when they find their Audience already mov'd, it would be ridiculous, if by an unſeaſonable Calmneſs they ſhould begin by making them quit that, with which they would have them affected. The laſt time <hi>Catiline</hi> enter'd the Senate houſe, the Senators were ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53904:92"/>
at his preſence, that thoſe who ſat next him drew farther off, and left him to ſit alone. Then the <hi>Conſul</hi> would have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Reaſon, if he had begun his Speech with that ſedateneſs that is uſual to <hi>Exerdiums.</hi> He would have abated that Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which he was willing to affect the Senators againſt <hi>Cariline;</hi> and he would have taken away from the mind of this Parricide, that Dread and Terror he was minded to ſtrike him with, and which he was already ſenſible of by this tacite condemnation of the Senate.

                  <p>That which is ſo rare among the Orators, is common among the Poets: They abound with Inſtances of this nature, where one may ſee the Paſſion prepar'd and kept up by the Actions. <hi>Dido</hi> begins a Speech as <hi>Ovid's Ajax</hi> did. <hi>Oh Jupiter!

                  <p>The Practice of <hi>Seneca</hi> is quite contrary. If he has any Recital to make, which ought to imprint ſome great <hi>Paſſion</hi> or other; he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53904:92"/>
takes away from both his Perſonages and his Audience all the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations they might have towards it. If they are poſſeſs'd with the Sorrow, fear, and expectation of ſome dreadful thing? He will begin by ſome fine and elegant Deſcription of ſome place or other, which only ſerves to ſhew the Copiouſneſs; and the poignant, bloomy Wit of a Poet without Judgment. In the <hi>Troad, Hecuba</hi> and <hi>Andromache</hi> were diſpoſed to hear of the violent and barbarous death of their Son <hi>Aſtyanax,</hi> whom the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> had thrown from the top of an high Tower. It mightily concern'd them indeed to know, that among the croud that flock'd from all parts to that ſad ſight, <note n="*" place="margin">Alta rupes cujus è cacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine erecta ſummos turba libravit pedes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Some there were who ſtood upon the ruins of the old decay'd Buildings, others whoſe legs trembled under them, becauſe they were mounted a little too high,</hi> &amp;c. People that have the patience to ſpeak or hear ſuch idle ſtuff, are ſo little inclin'd to weep, that they had need have notice, as the mercenary Mourners of old had, when 'tis time to ſet up their Whine.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing we think neceſſary for the well managing the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and to make the Auditors ſenſible of them, is to inſert them in the Poem <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>diſengag'd</hi> from every thing, that may hinder them from producing their due Effect.</p>
                  <p>'Tis neceſſary then, to avoid the <hi>vicious Multiplicity of Fables,</hi> where there are too many Stories, too many Fables, too many Actions, the Adventures too much divided and hard to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſuch Intrigues as one can't eaſily comprehend. All this diſtracts the Mind, and requires ſo much attention, that there is nothing left for the <hi>Paſſions</hi> to work upon. The Soul ſhould be free and diſengag'd, to be the more ſenſible of them. We deſtroy our true ſorrows, when we divert our thoughts another way: And how contrary will theſe troubleſome Applications be to the Fictions and Movement of Poems?

They fight with and deſtroy one another: And if a Man ſhould mix to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Subject of <hi>Joy</hi> and a Subject of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> he would make neither of them ſink deep. <note n="*" place="margin">Non ut placidia cocant immitia.</note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that no Poetical Licenſe will allow of this ſort of mixture.</p>
                  <p>The very nature of theſe <hi>Habits</hi> impoſe this Law. The Blood and Animal Spirits cannot move ſo ſmoothly on in their uſual way at quiet, if at the ſame time they are ſtop'd and retarded by ſome Violence, ſuch as <hi>Admiration</hi> cauſes. Nor can they be in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two Motions, whilſt <hi>Fear</hi> contracts them from the external parts of the Body to make them rally about the Heart: Or whilſt <hi>Anger</hi> ſends them into the Muſcles, and makes them act there with a Violence ſo contrary to the operations of <hi>Fear.</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53904:93"/>
A Poet then ſhould be acquainted with both the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and the <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Paſſions</hi> in our Souls. 'Tis there we are more ſenſible of them, and know them better than in the Blood and the Animal Spirits. This Knowledge, and the juſtneſs of his Genius will make him manage them with all the force, and the effects they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. And here we will propoſe two Examples of that which we have ſaid concerning the <hi>Simplicity</hi> and the <hi>Diſengagement</hi> of each <hi>Paſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Admirable</hi> muſt needs be predominant in the Warlike Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a Maid; and this is the <hi>Paſſion Virgil</hi> makes uſe of in the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Camilla:</hi> And on the contrary he has made <hi>Pity</hi> to reign in that of <hi>Pallas.</hi> This paſſion agrees very well with this young Prince who is one of the <hi>Heroe</hi>'s Party. But the Poet does not mix theſe two <hi>Paſſions</hi> together. He only ſhows in <hi>Pallas</hi> all that ordinary Courage that a young Man is capable of. He fights <hi>Turnus,</hi> but did not go out to attack him: He does not ſo much as wound him, nor put him in the leaſt danger; he only attends his coming, and <note n="*" place="margin">Aut ſpoliis ego jam rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis laudabor opimis, Aut letho inſigni. <hi>Aen.</hi> 10.</note> ſpeaks to him more like one that fear'd not death, than one who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to kill him. He is kill'd at the firſt blow; and there is nothing extraordinary in it. But there is ſomething more than ordinary in the <hi>Lamentation</hi> which <hi>Aeneas</hi> and the unhappy <hi>Evander</hi> made upon his Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Camilla</hi> on the contrary, made her ſelf admir'd by a Valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a <hi>Hero;</hi> but ſhe dies without being pitied. That which <hi>Diana</hi> ſays upon the Subject, deſerves not the name of a Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in compariſon to that which <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Evander</hi> made for <hi>Pallas.</hi> Beſides, the Speech of <hi>Diana</hi> is ſaid before her Death, and is not in a place where it might have any great effect. In ſhort, <hi>Camilla</hi> is kill'd, ſhe is reveng'd, and nothing more ſaid about it. How many Poets are there, that would have beſtow'd a Lover or two upon her, and endeavour'd to make an <hi>Epiſode</hi> as moving as that of <hi>Clorinda,</hi> and <hi>Tancred?</hi> This Beauty did not eſcape <hi>Virgil</hi>'s view. <note n="*" place="margin">Multae illam fruſtra Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thena per oppida matres Optavere nurum. <hi>Aen.</hi> 10.</note> He ſays, <hi>that ſeveral</hi> Italian <hi>Dames courted her for their Sons.</hi> This Reflection ſhews us, that his thoughts were upon every thing, and that it was not without choice and judgment, that he omitted that which would have appear'd ſo beautiful to other Poets.

                  <p>THE <hi>Epick Narration</hi> ought to be <hi>Active.</hi> This Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo neceſſary to it, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Expreſſion herein ſeems to confound the <hi>Epopéa</hi> with the <hi>Tragedy.</hi> 'Tis by this he begins to lay down Rules for this firſt ſort of Poem. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>'Tis requiſite,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Epick Fables be Dramatick, like thoſe that are in Tragedy.</hi> Now that which makes <hi>Tragedy Dramatick,</hi> and upon the account of which it has the Name which ſignifies to <note n="†" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Act,</hi> is, that the Poet never ſpeaks in it; and that every thing is repreſented by the Perſonages that are introduc'd, and who alone Act and ſpeak therein. From whence we learn, that ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires this Qualification likewiſe in the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> he thereby orders, that the Perſonages ſpeak likewiſe in this kind of Poem.</p>
                  <p>Nor does he hereby exclude the Narration of the Poet. This can never be; ſince he himſelf ſays that the <hi>Epopéa</hi> is <hi>an Imitation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by a Narration;</hi> and that in truth the <hi>Narration</hi> of the Poet is its <hi>Form,</hi> which diſtinguiſhes it the moſt Eſſentially from the Actions of the <hi>Theatre.</hi> But he means, that theſe two things ought to be ſo mix'd, that the Perſonages ſpeak very often. <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Homer,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who merits ſo much praiſe in other things, is eſpecially to be admired for this, that he has been the only Poet, who knew what he ought to do. For the Poet ſhould ſpeak but little. The Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Imitation conſiſts not ſo much in what the Poet ſays, as in what he makes his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages ſay: The other Poets ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Beginning to the very End of their Poems. They imitate but ſeldom, and then they carry not on their Imitation very far.</hi> Homer <hi>uſes a quite contrary method. After having ſaid a very little himſelf, he preſently introduces ſome one or other of his Perſonages.</hi> This is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, nor needs it any Comment. To this famous Example he has given us in <hi>Homer</hi> we might join that of the <hi>Latin Poet,</hi> who ſpeaks leſs in his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than he makes his Perſonages ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53904:94"/>
But the laſt Words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> are capable of two Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the firſt is, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ib.</note> 
                     <hi>Homer ſays but little himſelf, and preſently introduces a Man or a Woman, or ſomething elſe that has Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but without that Qualification he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces nothing.</hi> So that all the Words which follow the mention of <hi>a Man or a Woman,</hi> ſignifie a <hi>Deity,</hi> or a feign'd perſon, which though in its own nature it has no Manners, yet has ſome in the Poem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Allegorically one may bring all manner of things as well as into other <hi>Fables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this thought is taken from the Nature of Fables in general. When they are divided into different ſorts; by the term <hi>Moracae,</hi> that is <hi>by the Manners that are attributed to ſomething that has none,</hi> we underſtand thoſe, where for the Perſonages we introduce Beaſts, Plants, and ſuch like things, which in their own Nature have no Manners. Thus, for inſtance, in the Fable of the <hi>Olive-Tree</hi> and the <hi>Reed,</hi> the <hi>Olive-Tree</hi> is proud and vaunts it ſelf becauſe it ſtands ſo firm as not to bend to ev'ry blaſt of Wind, as the <hi>Reed</hi> does. Whatever then is introduc'd into Fables ought ſo neceſſarily and eſſentially to have <hi>Manners,</hi> that the Author is oblig'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them upon things that naturally are not endued with them.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, if the names of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes uſe of, do not properly ſignifie <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt have omitted a great part of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Perſonages. He has done well then in adding, <hi>[or ſome other thing that has Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.]</hi> And this will denote not only <hi>Apollo, Thetis, Jupiter,</hi> and ſuch like Deities, who are angry, complain, and laugh as we do, but likewiſe the Horſe <hi>Xanthus,</hi> that ſpeaks in the <hi>Iliad;</hi> the Horſe <hi>Rhebus,</hi> which <hi>Mezentius</hi> ſpeaks to in the <hi>Aeneid; Ethon</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the death of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and ev'n <hi>Fame</hi> who knows ev'ry thing, and takes ſuch a pleaſure in telling Tales; the <hi>Winds</hi> that are ſo Mutinous and Seditious that they would have overturn'd the Globe, and daſhed Heaven and Earth together by this time, if <hi>Jove</hi> had not taken care to ſet a King over them, who ſhuts them up cloſe, and when he lets them out always keeps a ſtrict hand over them. And this according to the firſt Interpretation is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> means, by <hi>theſe other things which have Manners,</hi> which the Poet introduces, and makes to ſpeak in the Fable.</p>
                  <p>The other way of Interpreting this paſſage of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to ſay, That he does not ſuppoſe that the Speeches the Perſonages are made to pronounce are the only means of making a <hi>Narration Active</hi> and <hi>Dramatick,</hi> but that 'tis ſo, when the <hi>Manners</hi> are Apparent, whether by the Perſons ſpeaking or only Acting therein, or by any other way, ſuppoſing you have a mind to give this Precept a little larger extent. In this ſenſe, not only the Speech of <hi>Dido</hi> to the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53904:94"/>
Princeſs her Siſter, to whom ſhe diſcovers her paſſion for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> would be <hi>Dramatical;</hi> but this qualification would be likewiſe in the Verſes that go before, where one may obſerve the Agitations and the Diſquietude of this Queen, who from the time ſhe firſt fell in Love, had loſt all her Quiet and Repoſe.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe, the learn'd Diſcourſe of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> to his Son in the ſixth Book may be likewiſe reckon'd among the <hi>Dramatical</hi> paſſages. Firſt, becauſe 'tis not the Poet that ſpeaks, but one of his Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages. Yet I declare 'tis my opinion, that this ſingle Qualification is not a ſufficient Reaſon why that which is ſpoken ſhould be <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> if beſide that, there are not <hi>Manners</hi> to be obſerv'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now there are <hi>Manners</hi> in this ſpeech of <hi>Anchiſes.</hi> That which he ſays there, is the Foundation of all the Morality, the Laws, and the Religion which <hi>Aeneas</hi> was going to Eſtabliſh in <hi>Italy.</hi> So that the ſubject Matter of this Speech is a <hi>Moral Inſtruction</hi> wherein one may ſee the Immortality of the Soul eſtabliſh'd; and the Cauſes of the Paſſions and Manners both of the Living and the Dead. But that which makes moſt for our purpoſe is, that this Speech contains the <hi>Manners, Habits,</hi> and Condition of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> himſelf who ſpoke it, and of thoſe who were in the ſame place with him. The Poet having us'd no ſmall skill to engage him thereto: <hi>Each of us,</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Quiſque ſuos patimur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Exinde per am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum Mittimur Elyſium, &amp; pauci laeta arva tenemus. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> Says he, <hi>feel the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are proper to him; then are we ſent to the Elyſian Fields, where we, a few in number, ſpend our time,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But whatever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ſenſe is, he does not ſeem to favour the ſimple Explication of Arts or Sciences, which are without <hi>Manners,</hi> and without <hi>Action,</hi> and which have nothing of <hi>Morality</hi> in them. If a Man would ſpeak like a Poet, he muſt Imitate <hi>Homer,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal theſe things under the Names and Actions of ſome feign'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He will not ſay that Salt is good to preſerve dead Bodies from Corruption and Putrefaction, and that Flies would preſently fill them full of Maggots: But he will ſay, that <hi>Achilles</hi> deſigning to revenge the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> before he perform'd the laſt Offices to his dead Body, apprehends that the hotneſs of the Seaſon would corrupt it, and that the Flies that lighted upon his Wounds, would engender Maggots there. He will not barely ſay, that the Sea offers him a Remedy againſt the Putrefaction he was afraid of: But he will make the Sea a <hi>Divinity;</hi> he will bring it in ſpeaking: In a word he will ſay the Goddeſs <hi>Thetis</hi> comforts <hi>Achilles,</hi> and tells him, he might ſet his heart at reſt, for ſhe would go and perfume his Body with <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which ſhould preſerve it a whole Year from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. This is the way by which Poets, if they would imitate <hi>Homer,</hi> muſt ſpeak of Arts and Sciences. One ſees in this inſtance, that Flies breed Corruption, and fill dead Bodies with Maggots. One there ſees the Nature of Salt, and the Art of preſerving dead Bodies
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53904:95"/>
from Corruption. But all this is expreſs'd Poetically, and with all the Qualifications requiſite to that Imitation, which according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is eſſential to Poetry: All is reduc'd into Action. The Sea is made a Perſon that ſpeaks and acts, and this <hi>Proſopopoeia</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Paſſion, Tenderneſs, and Intereſt. In ſhort there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein but what has <hi>Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Inſtance may ſuffice; it is plain, obvious, and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. We may for Diverſion ſake produce another from a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a great deal more myſterious. The Chymiſts have too good an opinion of their Philoſophy, and too much eſteem for <hi>Virgil;</hi> than to think he was wholly ignorant of their Art. There are ſome that obſerve, that he has expreſs'd as clearly as themſelves, ſome of their choiceſt Operations. Theſe Gentlemen are not ſatisfied with ordinary Metaphors and Allegories, ſuch as Poets uſe: But they carry on theſe Figures and Diſguiſes to the utmoſt obſcurity of a Riddle. No inconvenience then would follow, ſhould they ſuppoſe the Hero of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> to be a Man who makes a diſcovery of that Gold, which is produc'd after a miraculous manner, and which is reproduc'd and increas'd inceſſantly from the very firſt time of its being diſcover'd. The principle of this happy diſcovery is Piety, Induſtry, á Genius, and the bleſſing of Heaven; <hi>Aeneas</hi> was not deficient in any of theſe. But 'tis requiſite ſeveral things ſhould be Divin'd; For this reaſon <hi>Helenus</hi> ſends <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Sibyl,</hi> he follows his advice, and ſees the two birds of <hi>Venus.</hi> Theſe are the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Vitriol: For that green Mineral, which contains them, is a ſort of <hi>Copper,</hi> that goes under the name of this Goddeſs. I omit the reſt, and leave it as I found it in the Books where by chance I did read of it; at leaſt it will ſuit well enough with the Juſtice of that Advice <hi>Sibyl</hi> gives <hi>Aeneas</hi> upon the account of the difficulty of this diſcovery, and the ſmall number of thoſe who ſucceed in it; and that laſtly, as ſhe ſays, this undertaking is not fit for a wiſe Man. But to return:</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe reckon among the Subjects that are not Poetical, the Deſcriptions of Palaces, Gardens, Groves, Rivulets, Ships, and a hundred other Natural and Artificial things; when they are too long, and made after a ſimple, proper manner, without Allegories. This is what <hi>Horace</hi> calls purple Shreds, which Poets ſometimes place very ill, thinking that thoſe faults will prove the fineſt Ornaments of their Works. Thô this may be good in the leſſer Poems.</p>
                  <p>I believe I have already ſpoken in ſome other place concerning the manner of making the <hi>Narration Active,</hi> which is proper and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Fable. And that is to reduce the Precepts and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we would lay down, into Action. <hi>Virgil</hi> abounds with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this nature. His Hero is a Legiſlator, but 'tis in a Poem. So that he does not appoint that ſuch a Sacrifice ſhould be made, or ſuch Ceremonies obſerv'd: But he does all this himſelf. He does
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53904:95"/>
not command one ſhould ſubmit to the Gods, nor does he preſcribe a way how to puniſh the profane; but he demonſtrates at large the dreadful torments that attend theſe Miſcreants.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. Of the <hi>Continuity</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> and the Order of the <hi>Narration.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Continuity,</hi> which the <hi>Action</hi> ought to have in the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a Conſequence of what has been already ſaid, and will ſerve as a Principle to that we are about to obſerve concerning the Order which the Poet ought to mind in the Recital of all his <hi>Action.</hi> 'Tis upon this Principle we ſhall judge, when the Poet is permitted to begin the <hi>Narration</hi> by the beginning of his <hi>Action,</hi> and to relate every thing one after another, juſt as they happen'd and in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Order; and when, on the contrary, he is oblig'd to invert this Order, and make uſe of the Artificial one, beginning his Poem by the Incidents of his <hi>Action,</hi> which happen laſt perhaps in order of time.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place we will treat concerning <hi>Continuity.</hi> From the time the Poet begins to rehearſe his Subject, from the time he opens his Poem, and brings his Perſonages, if I may ſo ſay, upon the Stage; he ought ſo to continue his <hi>Action</hi> to the very end, that none of the Perſonages be ever obſerv'd to be Idle, and out of Motion.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Continuity</hi> is ſometimes to be met with in the <hi>Action</hi> it ſelf, and in the firſt Model of the Fable. Of this Nature is the <hi>Action</hi> of the <hi>Iliad. Apollo</hi> is provok'd, and ſends the Peſtilence into the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Army. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> pacifies his Anger, the Soldiers recover of their diſtemper, and afterwards Fight. <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> are kill'd, their Funeral Obſequies are over; and ſo the <hi>Action</hi> Ends in leſs than fifty Days without any Interruption and Diſcontinuity.</p>
                  <p>But when the <hi>Action</hi> laſts for ſeveral Years, as in the <hi>Odyſſeïs</hi> and the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it cannot be <hi>Continu'd,</hi> thô 'twere interrupted by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Winter-ſeaſon, a very unfit time for Wars and Voyages, which are the uſual Subjects of Poems. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> tarries a whole Year with <hi>Circe,</hi> and ſeven with <hi>Calypſo:</hi> And <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſpent ſeveral Years in <hi>Thrace,</hi> where he does nothing worthy to be recited by an <hi>Epick Poet.</hi> And perhaps he was more than a Year in <hi>Sicily</hi> during his Fathers Sickneſs, and their Mourning for his Death. So
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53904:96"/>
that the <hi>Actions</hi> of theſe two Poems are not <hi>Continued.</hi> But thô the <hi>Actions</hi> are not <hi>Continu'd,</hi> yet the <hi>Narration</hi> ought to be ſo, as we hinted before.</p>
                  <p>There is no difficulty in managing the Actions that are <hi>Continu'd.</hi> The Poet has nothing to do but Rehearſe them in their Natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and relate the things one after another, juſt as they happen'd: This is what <hi>Homer</hi> has done in his <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Action is long and <hi>Diſcontinu'd,</hi> the Poet relates it in an Artificial Order. He takes nothing for the Matter of his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what towards the End of the Action has ſomething of <hi>Continuity</hi> in it; and for his own ſhare he only relates this part. For this reaſon <hi>Virgil</hi> has begun his Recital juſt after <hi>Aeneas</hi> left <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> where <hi>Anchiſes</hi> dy'd: And <hi>Homer</hi> at the very firſt makes his Hero quit the Iſle of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> after he had ſtaid there ſeven Years, all which time the Poet lets paſs before the opening of his Poem. In the Sequel of the Diſcourſe, ſome probable and natural occaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes for Repeating the moſt conſiderable and neceſſary things which went before theſe beginnings. The love <hi>Dido</hi> conceiv'd for <hi>Aeneas</hi> made her extreamly curious to know his adventures. This Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made the Recital thereof ſo Natural, that the <note n="*" place="margin">Iliacoſque iterum demens áudire labores Expoſcit, pendetque iterum narran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ab ore. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> Poet thought himſelf oblig'd to make it more than once. The <hi>Phaeacans</hi> indeed had no Intereſt in the fortune of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> but the Poet ſupply'd that by making theſe dull Fellows mightily in love with Romantick Adventures.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Artificial Order</hi> divides the <hi>Action</hi> into two Parts very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from each other. The principal Part contains that which the Poet relates. He takes but a little Matter, but he treats of it amply, and with all the Pomp and Majeſty his Art can furniſh him with. The other Part is a great deal larger in the Number of its Incidents, and in its Duration; but 'tis of leſs Compaſs ſhould you reckon the Verſes it takes up, and conſequently in the Circumſtances and Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which make a great part of the Beauties of the Poem. But yet, if among the Incidents which the Poet is oblig'd to inſert in that which we here call the Second and Leaſt part of his Work, there ſhould be any one Important Incident, he may treat of this more largely than of the reſt, as <hi>Virgil</hi> has done the <hi>Taking of Troy.</hi> 'Tis true one may not treat of many of them after this manner: The reſt ſhould be more conciſe. Beſides one ſees a great deal of Difference between the Death of <hi>Priam</hi> deſcrib'd in the Recitals of the ſecond Book, and the Death of <hi>Camilla</hi> related by the Poet in the Eleventh. For thô that of <hi>Camilla</hi> is doubtleſs leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to the Fable, yet the Poet extends it more by half than that of <hi>Priam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two Parts of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> may be compar'd to two of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53904:96"/>
the <hi>Dramatick:</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Aut agitur res in Scenis aut acta refertur. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> One of which is Acted upon the Stage before the Spectators; and the Other comprehends whatſoever is done behind the Scenes, and which we come to know of purely by the Recitals which the Actors make. <note n="*" place="margin">Segnius irritant animos demiſſa per aurem, Quam quae ſunt oculis ſubjecta fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellibus. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> This laſt is leſs moving than the other; And let <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s ſorrow for his firſt Wife <hi>Creüſa</hi> be never ſo great, yet her Death has nothing in it, whereby it deſerves to be compar'd to that of <hi>Dido.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Diviſion of the <hi>Dramatick Action</hi> we are now ſpeaking of, <note n="†" place="margin">Non tamen intus Digna geri promes in ſcenam, multaque tolles Ex oculis, quae mox narret facundia praeſens. Nec pueros co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram populo Medea truci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, <hi>&amp;c. Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> Gives the Poet an Advantage of keeping from the Spectators view, whatever would offend them; either by its being two horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a Mother's butchering her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or by its being too incredible, as the Metamorphoſes of a Man into a Serpent or a Bird: Whereupon theſe things ſhould only be related. So likewiſe the Diviſion of the <hi>Epick Action</hi> gives the Poet liberty to retrench from this Action whatever would cauſe a Confuſion in the Poem. The things that are improper for the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea</hi> are not of the ſame nature with thoſe, which ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the <hi>Theatre,</hi> ſince that which is good in a <hi>Dramatick</hi> Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is likewiſe ſo in an <hi>Epopéa,</hi> which only diſcovers things to us by Reciting them. But on the contrary, the things, that confound the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> are ſuch as are too languiſhing, and which cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that Action and Motion, which are the proper Ornaments of this ſort of Poem. And this is what <note n="*" place="margin">Et quae deſperet tractatu niteſcere poſſe, Relinquit: <hi>Poet.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi> orders to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thence.</p>
                  <p>And in truth how could <hi>Virgil</hi> make his Readers endure <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s conſtant Attendance at his ſick Father's bed, together with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and Fomentations which ought to be made uſe of to recall the Spirits, and the Natural Heat into the cold Limbs of this aged Prince? And the ſorrow too of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> which ought to have been very great, would have been but a ſorry Ornament of a Poem: The Readers would not have been affected with them. Would they have beſtow'd one tear upon the Natural death of a perſon of his Age, who had ſo little to do in this Poem? Therefore has the Poet very judiciouſly drawn a Veil over all theſe things.</p>
                  <p>By this means, the <hi>Artificial Order</hi> cuts off the languiſhing and unpleaſant Incidents, and the Intervals of time that are void of <hi>Action,</hi> which hinders the <hi>Continuity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And <note n="†" place="margin">Vehemens &amp; liquidus puroque ſimillimus amni. <hi>Hor.

                     </note> by theſe Retrenchments it gives the Poem that continu'd force, which makes it run ſmoothly on throughout the whole,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53904:97"/>
and beſtows on it thoſe Beauties which the Action in it ſelf has not. <note n="*" place="margin">Semper ad eventum fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat, &amp; in medias res, Non ſecus ac notus audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem rapit. <hi>Hor. Art. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> By this means it haſtens towards a Concluſion, and at firſt tranſports the Readers into the Middle of its ſubject Matter, and always entertains in them a deſire and expectation to ſee the events as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Our Poets begin their <hi>Narration</hi> ſo nigh the End, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der imagines the Poem would End within a few Verſes. In the <hi>Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeïs,</hi> the Gods order <hi>Mercury</hi> to go to the Iſle of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> where <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was detain'd by <hi>Calypſo.</hi> He was to charge that Goddeſs to give him leave to depart, and furniſh him with ev'ry thing that was neceſſary for his journey to <hi>Ithaca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> approaches ſtill nearer to a Concluſion. His Hero has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy left <hi>Sicily,</hi> and is upon his Journey to <hi>Italy.</hi> The ſecond Part begins much after the ſame Manner: <hi>Aeneas</hi> arriving at the Country which the Fates had promis'd him, finds there the Gods and Men who waited his coming with Impatience; and King <hi>Latinus</hi> offers him his Daughter <hi>Lavinia,</hi> ſole Heir to his Crown, in Marriage. Who would think then but this Hero was very well ſettled, and the Poem at an end? But a Storm caſts him upon <hi>Carthage</hi> and furniſhes the Poet with what fills the firſt Part. The jealouſie of <hi>Turnus,</hi> who pretends <hi>Lavinia</hi> was promis'd to him, and was his due, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Settlement of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and affords ſubject Matter for the laſt ſix Books.</p>
                  <p>The Beginning of the <hi>Action</hi> is reſum'd ſo pertinently that theſe large Recitals of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> make no Interruption. <hi>Aeneas</hi> relates all that preceded his arrival at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and then the Poet undertakes to tell what happen'd to him in that City. This ſeries of things is ſo exact, that the firſt Book may paſs for a mere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which informs us of the Action in general, and which in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcovers the Humors and Intereſt of the perſons that were to appear in Play. The Poet's practice is the ſame in his leſſer Epiſodes. <hi>Venus</hi> ſo reſumes the Story of <hi>Dido,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> that of <hi>Camilla,</hi> that what in this Poem follows the Recitals of theſe two Goddeſſes, is the natural Conſequence of what they related. We may obſerve the ſame Order in the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> But the Death of <hi>Archemorus,</hi> the funeral Sports, and the March of the <hi>Argives</hi> towards <hi>Thebes,</hi> are by no means the Conſequences of that which is contain'd in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of <hi>Hypſipyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our Poets had made the Recitals of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times they could not have connected them to the <hi>Action</hi> that would have follow'd, and the Order would have been leſs exact, and more irkſome to the Readers.</p>
                  <p>Let us now in a few Words ſum up all that has been ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Continuity</hi> of the <hi>Epick Narration,</hi> and the Order <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have obſerv'd therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:53904:97"/>
They have ſo begun, that when once their Perſonages have made their appearance, they never ceas'd from Acting till the End of the Poem. For this purpoſe, when the <hi>Epick Action</hi> was <hi>Continu'd</hi> and of a few Months duration, as that of the <hi>Iliad;</hi> the Poet has related it himſelf in the <hi>Natural Order.</hi> But when it laſted for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years, as the two Others did, the Poets obſerv'd an <hi>Artificial Order,</hi> and the laſt part of their Subject that was only <hi>Continu'd,</hi> was all that they themſelves related. They made their Heroes relate all that went before, and that in one ſpeech, made upon a probable Occaſion. They plac'd theſe Recitals ſo well, that the things related therein, precede immediately, and without any Interruption thoſe which the Poet at laſt relates himſelf. So that neither the Mind, nor the Memory of the Readers are at a loſs to rejoyn the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Incidents, which they read in the Poem.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Of the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Narration.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ACCORDING to the Idea we have been propoſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Continuity</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Narration;</hi> 'tis requiſite we ſhould ſay thus much concerning its <hi>Duration,</hi> viz. That the ſpace of a Year is to the <hi>Epick Narration,</hi> what the ſpace of a Day is to <hi>Tragedy;</hi> and that the Winter is as improper for this great Work, as the Night is for the <hi>Theatre;</hi> ſince both being void of Action, make a vicious Interval, and an irregular <hi>Diſcontinuity</hi> in theſe Poems. So then, the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Epick Narration</hi> only laſts one Campaign, as the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Action laſts an Artificial Day.</p>
                  <p>But we may carry on this Parallel a little farther, and ſay, that as the Time for the <hi>Theatral</hi> Repreſentation is under debate amongſt Learned men, and the Practice of the Ancients has its obſcurities, which ev'ry one interprets in favour of himſelf, either for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or the Artificial day: So the preciſe time of the <hi>Epopéa</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of diſpute; for the Practice of <hi>Virgil</hi> in this matter is not very clear.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it may be ſaid that the Narration of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> laſts a Year and ſome Months. And thus the account may go. <hi>Aeneas</hi> parting from <hi>Sicily</hi> after he had interr'd his Father there, returns thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a Year after, and there celebrates his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary on the very Day he dy'd on. <note n="†" place="margin">Annus exactis comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur menſibus orbis, Ex quo relliquias divinique oſſa Parentis Condidimus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ, moeſtaſque ſacravimus aras. Jamque dies, ni fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, adeſt, <hi>&amp;c. Aen.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>'Tis a full Year,</hi> ſays <hi>Aeneas, ſince we interr'd my Father, and now we are return'd hither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſame day he dy'd on.</hi> So that the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> beginning when <hi>Aeneas</hi> left <hi>Sicily,</hi> juſt after his Father's death, that makes a whole Year to the Sports of the fifth Book. By this means the time that is requiſite for the reſt of this Book, for the Sixth, and for the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> will be added to the Year.</p>
                  <p>One may reduce this <hi>Narration</hi> into a preciſe Year, by ſaying, that theſe Verſes cited out of the fifth Book, do indeed inform us, <hi>that it was a full Year ſince</hi> Aeneas <hi>had interr'd his Father</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> but that neither theſe Verſes nor any others intimate that he left <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> immediately after this Action. One may then with freedom ſuppoſe that he tarry'd there as long a time, as was afterwards requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for his Settlement in <hi>Italy.</hi> From whence one will inferr that the <hi>Narration</hi> is compris'd within the compaſs of a Year of twelve Months, and no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53904:98"/>
Each of theſe Opinions ſuppoſes that the <hi>Winter</hi> is comprehended in this Narration, and that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſpent the whole of that with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> as the Poet plainly ſays in this Verſe ſpoken by <hi>Fame.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Nunc <hi>Hyemem</hi> inter ſe luxu quam longa fovêre.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Opinion ſuppoſes that the word <hi>Hyems</hi> in this Verſe ſhould not be underſtood for the <hi>Winter-ſeaſon;</hi> but that it ſignifies, the ſame thing which it does in other paſſages of this very Book, that have a neceſſary relation to this. <note n="*" place="margin">Dum pelago deſaevit hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, &amp; aquoſus Orion. Quin etiam hyberno mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris ſidere claſſem.</note> Now in thoſe other paſſages it does not ſignify the <hi>Winter,</hi> but a <hi>Seaſon</hi> which the Riſing of <hi>Orion</hi> renders <hi>tempeſtuous,</hi> and that happens in the <hi>Summer;</hi> for this Conſtellation riſes about the <hi>Summer Solſtice.</hi> So that the Poet had only a mind to tell us, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> indulg'd himſelf in the Amours of <hi>Dido,</hi> all that time, wherein the Riſing of <hi>Orion,</hi> for about ſix Weeks, made him afraid to put to Sea, and excus'd him from complying ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Orders of the Gods, that ſummon'd him to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this means all the <hi>Narration</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> will be reduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Compaſs of one ſingle Campaign, making it to begin in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to conclude before the End of Autumn in the ſame Year. This Opinion is grounded upon ſeveral Expreſſions of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which ſeem more exact than the former, thô leſs agreeable to ſeveral Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. <hi>Aeneas</hi> leaves <hi>Sicily,</hi> and is caſt upon the Coaſts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> in the Summer; and this Summer is already the ſeventh ſince the taking of <hi>Troy.</hi> This is what the Poet ſays in the perſon of <hi>Dido,</hi> when ſhe receives this Hero into <hi>Carthage.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Nam te jam ſeptima por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat Omnibus orrantem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; fluctibus <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>This is now the ſeventh Summer ſince your Travels over ſo many Countries, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seas.</hi> He ſpends in <hi>Carthage</hi> neither the Winter, nor any part of Autumn; but he parted thence before the End of Summer. He arrives at <hi>Sicily</hi> and there keeps the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> at the end of the ſame Summer he came to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> in; ſince the Poet ſays that this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the ſeventh. <note n="*" place="margin">Septima poſt Trojae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidium jam vertitur aeſtas. <hi>Aen.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>This is now the end of the ſeventh Summer ſince the Ruin of Troy.</hi> Laſtly, the Poem ends before Autumn does, ſince the day before the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> the Woods had ſtill their Leaves on, and caſt their ſhadow. The Poet ſays, that <note n="†" place="margin">Eſt in anfructu vallis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commods fraudi, Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque dolis; quam den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis frondibus atrum Urgez utrinque latus. <hi>Aen.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Turnus lay in Ambuſh in a Valley where the thickneſs of the Leaves and the Shade favour'd very much his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi> By this means the Narration of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> will compriſe only one Campaign, and be all included within

the two Seaſons of Summer and Autumn: <note n="*" place="margin">Cum ſubito aſſurgens flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu nimboſus Orion.

                  <p>As there are Reaſons for both ſides, ſo there are Difficulties in both. Some of them are reply'd to: And for thoſe that ſeem unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ſay, that the <hi>Aeneid</hi> being uncorrect, we ſhould not Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we cannot underſtand all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> is a great deal clearer. He has made an exact journal of the time he allows his two Poems.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iliad</hi> begins with a Plague, which laſts ten Days. The Poet has allow'd as many for the <hi>Grecians</hi> recovery. The Battles, that follow next, end the fifth Day. After that eleven Days are ſpent in the Funeral Rites of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and eleven more likewiſe in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Hector,</hi> and then the Poem Ends. The twice ten at the Beginning, and the twice eleven at the End make juſt two and forty Days, to which add the five in the Middle, and the whole <hi>Duration of the Action</hi> and the <hi>Narration</hi> amounts to ſeven and forty Days.</p>
                  <p>The Days are not ſo well rang'd in the <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> but the Account is altogether as exact. The Poem opens with <hi>Minerva.</hi> She frees <hi>Telemachus</hi> from the dangers he was in at <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and conducts him to <hi>Pylos.</hi> The fourth Day ſhe goes up to Heaven again, and brings it about that <hi>Calypſo</hi> be ordered to diſmiſs <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> On the morrow he begins a Ship, and in twenty Days finiſhes it; the twenty fifth he ſets Sail, and after a Voyage of twenty Days is caſt upon the Iſland of <hi>Corfu,</hi> There he tarries three Days with <hi>Alcinous.</hi> All this makes one and fifty Days from the firſt opening of the Poem to the Arrival of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> in his own Country. Eight and twenty of them he ſpent with <hi>Calypſo,</hi> reckoning the four that preceded the building of his Ship; three and twenty Days more he is upon his Journey, part of which he ſpent at Sea, and part with <hi>Alcinous.</hi> A night after he arrives in <hi>Ithaca.</hi> Four Days he remains incognito at <hi>Eumeus</hi>'s Country Houſe. On the fifth he went to his own Palace, where he was in diſguiſe two Days, taking an account of what had happen'd and ſquaring his Actions accordingly. The next night he kills his Rivals, and on the morrow makes an end of diſcovering himſelf, and re-adjuſting all his Affairs. Therefore adding theſe ſeven Days to the one and fifty before; the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Narration</hi> in this Poem amounts to eight and fifty Days.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year the Poet gives us an occaſion to gueſs ſomething about it. In the <hi>Iliad</hi> where there is more Action and Violence, the Days are longer than the Nights, and the <hi>Seaſon</hi> very hot. And on the contrary, <hi>Homer</hi> has aſſign'd longer and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Nights to the Prudence of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> placing the Maturity of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> as he has the Contagious heats of the <hi>Summer</hi> in the <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53904:99"/>
The Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> then is without doubt to reduce the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Epick Narration</hi> into the Compaſs of a Campaign of a few Months. But the Difficulty of knowing the deſign and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Virgil,</hi> is the reaſon why 'tis queſtion'd, whether one might not advance it to the Compaſs of a whole Year or more, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Winter ſeaſon ought in reaſon to be excluded thence.</p>
                  <p>I found my ſelf inſenſibly ingag'd in the Examen of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar queſtion: I found it a great deal larger than I imagin'd, and I have diſcours'd very amply upon it, from whence ſeveral things may be deduc'd, that in my mind are of no ſmall uſe for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> I here propoſe this Queſtion about the time by way of Problem, and freely leave others to determine and judge what they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>But yet I ſay, that in this Uncertainty, two Reaſons rather incline me to a ſingle Campaign than a whole Year.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, the Practice of <hi>Homer,</hi> which the <hi>Latin Poet</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly propoſes as his Exemplar, and who by wiſe men has been eſteemed the moſt excellent Model for Poets to imitate. This Reaſon makes ſo much the more for me in this Treatiſe of the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> becauſe 'tis founded upon that Relation that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable between the Practice of <hi>Virgil</hi> and that of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Rules of <hi>Horace,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other Reaſon is ſtill more to my purpoſe; and that is, that this reducing of it to one ſingle Campaign, is more conformable to that Idea I have propoſed concerning the Fable, and the Deſign of <hi>Virgil</hi> in this Poem.</p>
                  <p>We have already conſidered <hi>Aeneas</hi> as a Legiſlator, and Founder of the <hi>Romans</hi> Religion. He is ſo exact in obſerving all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which were performed for the Dead, that there is not the leaſt colour he ſhould omit one ſo conſiderable, as is that of <hi>Mourning,</hi> eſpecially for the Death of his Father, for which he ſpares no coſt. This high Veneration he has for him, makes one of the principal Qualities of his Character, and almoſt throughout the whole regulates the general Character of the Poem.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Mourning</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> conſiſted in two things: the one is its Duration, which laſted ten Months: the other is, that the <hi>Romans</hi> in this ominous and inauſpicious time never undertook any thing of conſequence. How then could <hi>Aeneas</hi> dare to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his Settlement in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was then a buſineſs of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſequence to him? So then, he was oblig'd to ſtay in <hi>Sicily</hi> full ten Months after the Death of his Father; and having ſtay'd leſs than two Months at <hi>Carthage,</hi> he returned to <hi>Sicily</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Anniverſary of his Death, on the ſame day he arriv'd there.</p>
                  <p>This agrees very well with the Expreſſions of the Poet which we have already cited. For the Anniverſary happens at the end of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53904:100"/>
ſeventh Summer, a little more than a Month after the Solſtice and riſing of <hi>Orion. Aeneas</hi> then leaving <hi>Sicily</hi> in Summer during the Riſing of this Conſtellation, which rais'd the Tempeſt in the firſt Book, he could not leave it the ſame Summer <hi>Anchiſes</hi> died, but muſt needs have left <hi>Sicily</hi> the Summer following, which is the ſeventh as the Poet ſays, and the ſame in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Anniverſary. By this means, he muſt needs have paſs'd the Autumn, the Winter, and the Spring in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and have tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there more than nine Months before his parting for <hi>Carthage;</hi> but he went out and came back again to it the ſame Summer.</p>
                  <p>In the other Opinions I neither find the Conformity of <hi>Virgil</hi> with <hi>Homer,</hi> nor the Obſervation of the <hi>Roman Mourning,</hi> to which I really think <hi>Aeneas</hi> was oblig'd as much as he was to the other Ceremonies in which he was ſo punctual. But theſe Reaſons which make for me may not perhaps make for others. I only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as I was oblig'd. 'Tis for Philoſophers and Criticks to examine things, to propoſe Reaſons, and to make them intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and 'tis for the Reader to draw his Inferences.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the <hi>Manners</hi> in General.</head>
                  <p>UNder the name of <hi>Manners</hi> we comprehend all the natural or acquired inclinations, which carry us on to good, bad, or indifferent actions. This Definition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains three things, The firſt is the <hi>Manners</hi> themſelves which we call Inclinations, whether they have their ſource and origin in our Souls, ſuch as the Love of Sciences and Vertue; or whether they proceed from the conſtitution of the Body, as Anger, and the Reſt, which we have in common with the Brutes. The ſecond thing is the cauſe of thoſe <hi>Manners,</hi> which is either Nature, or our Choice, and Induſtry, according as they are either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</hi> The third thing, is the effect of the <hi>Manners,</hi> namely
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53904:101"/>
Actions whether good as that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or bad as that of <hi>Achilles</hi> or indifferent as that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Manners</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> which incline us to Vertue, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions; thoſe <hi>Bad</hi> which incline us to Vice and Sin; and thoſe are <hi>Indifferent</hi> which incline us to indifferent Qualities and Actions.</p>
                  <p>A right diſtinction ſhould be made between Real Vertues, and thoſe that appear ſuch, and are only mere Qualities. The Real Vertues, ſuch as Piety, Prudence, and the like, make thoſe who are Maſters of them Good, Praiſe-worthy, and Honeſt-men. But Real Vices, ſuch as Impiety, Injuſtice, Fraud, and the like, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vitiate thoſe, who are tainted with them. Meer Qualities in their own Nature produce neither of theſe two effects, ſuch as Valour, Art, the Knowledge of Sciences, and the like. <hi>Solomon</hi> could ſtill preſerve the Knowledge of the Sciences even when he was become an Idolater. <hi>Aencas</hi> and <hi>Mezentius</hi> were both Valiant, yet one was a Pious and a good Man, the other an Atheiſtical and profane fellow.</p>
                  <p>'Tis farther obſervable that among the Inclinations, there are ſome which belong more peculiarly to ſome particular Adventure, and that are only of Uſe upon certain Occaſions: Such for inſtance are <hi>Valour, Clemency,</hi> and <hi>Liberality.</hi> Others are more Univerſal, and appear in every thing, ſuch as are <hi>good Nature</hi> and a <hi>paſſionate Temper.</hi> For a Man may be paſſionate, and violent, not only in War, but at a Council board, and upon all other occaſions, as <hi>Achilles</hi> was; or he may be mild and good-natured even in the heat of Battle, as <hi>Aeneas.</hi> We ſhall call this laſt ſpecies of general and Univerſal <hi>Manners</hi> the <hi>Character</hi> of ſuch or ſuch a Perſon, and will treat of it more particularly.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of our <hi>Manners</hi> are either wholly <hi>External,</hi> or wholly <hi>Internal,</hi> or they may be conſidered as partly External, partly Internal. The <hi>External</hi> Cauſes are God, the Stars and our Native Country. The <hi>mixt</hi> Cauſes are our Parents and Education. The <hi>internal</hi> Cauſes are the Complexion, the Sex, the Paſſions, and the Actions whereby we contract theſe habits.</p>
                  <p>The effects of our <hi>Manners</hi> are the Diſcourſes, the Deſigns, and the Eſſays we make to do ſuch or ſuch a thing, and the Good, Bad, or Indifferent Actions.</p>
                  <p>Poetry is not the only thing, where the <hi>Manners</hi> are of uſe. <hi>Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Geographers,</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> treat of them as well as <hi>Poets.</hi> Each of theſe in his own way. But the <hi>Poet</hi> has need of all. And beſide theſe, there are a vaſt number of things, which he is indiſpenſibly obliged to be acquainted with, that he may make his Perſonages ſpeak, and act regularly. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever has been ſaid on this Subject, yet I cannot wholly paſs it over. I ſhall only content my ſelf to apply it to the practice of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53904:101"/>
Therefore before I treat of the <hi>Poetical Manners,</hi> I will explain at large what I have propoſed concerning the Cauſes of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and I ſhall ſay ſomething concerning the <hi>Manners</hi> that are Foreign to <hi>Poetry.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the <hi>Manners.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>GOD is the chief of all the <hi>Cauſes</hi> in general, we ſhall look upon him here in particular, as the moſt univerſal and firſt cauſe of the <hi>Manners.</hi> He is the Author of Nature, and diſpoſes of all things as he thinks fit. This cauſe renders the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Aeneas</hi> good even to admiration. 'Tis ſuperfluous to ſhow how this Hero is favour'd by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſince we ſee <hi>Juno,</hi> who proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him, loves and eſteems his perſon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Stars,</hi> and principally the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi> are the ſecond Cauſe of the <hi>Manners.</hi> The <note n="*" place="margin">Non obtuſa adeo geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m is pectora Teucri: Nec tam averſus equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe. <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> Poet takes notice what influence they have upon Men. When in the perſon of <hi>Dido,</hi> He proves from them that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> are not ſo dull, but that they know what eſteem ought to be had for Virtue. But is it by chance, think ye, that this Poet, who elſewhere was ſo skillful in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, cauſes the Planets to act in favour of his Hero conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of Aſtrologers? Of the ſeven there are three that favour him, <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Sun:</hi> All three act viſibly in the Poem in behalf of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> There are three others, whoſe influences are Malignant, <hi>Saturn, Mars,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Diana.</hi> If they act 'tis indeed againſt the Hero. But they appear ſo obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that one may ſay <hi>Virgil</hi> has hid them below the Horizon. Laſtly, <hi>Mercury,</hi> whoſe <hi>Planet</hi> is ſaid to be good with the good, and bad with the bad, acts viſibly as the good Planets do, but he never acts alone, 'tis <hi>Jupiter</hi> that always ſends him out. And this is the Horoſcope which the Poet makes for the Birth of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third <hi>external cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Manners</hi> is the <hi>Country</hi> in which one is Born. <hi>Virgil</hi> beſtows great commendations on the Country of his Hero, and advances it far above <hi>Greece.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Fracti bello fatiſque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſi Ductores Danaum: <hi>Aen.</hi> 2.</note> As long as <hi>Troy</hi> was aſſaulted fairly by Force, it always remained Victorious. 'Twas only the fraud and Treachery of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that gain'd the maſtery over the generoſity of the <hi>Trojans.</hi> So
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53904:102"/>
that according to their Countries, the one Party are brave and generous, the other Knaves and Cheats; the one Civil, the other Barbarous; the one Hardy, the other Nice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe <hi>Cauſes,</hi> that are properly <hi>external,</hi> follow next the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> whoſe blood is derived down to their Children. We cannot ſay that the Parents are ſuch <hi>Cauſes</hi> as are altogether foreign to the Inclinations of thoſe who are formed from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Let us apply this to our Subject. <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſprang from the Royal Blood of <hi>Troy.</hi> The firſt Princes of this Family were as Virtuous, as Powerful. But in proceſs of time theſe two things were divided into two different branches. <hi>Ilus</hi> left the Crown to <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and his Virtue to <hi>Aſſaracus. Priam</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> were Heirs to the firſt, <hi>Anchiſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> to the ſecond. By this means the Poet beſtows upon his Hero the good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Anceſtors before ever he reſtored to him the <hi>Regal Power.</hi> His Piety deſerv'd the Sceptre of his Fathers, and the perfidiouſneſs of the other branch was the cauſe that <hi>Priam</hi>'s Family was extirpated. The Innocent themſelves felt likewiſe the ſmart of it, as <note n="*" place="margin">Poſtquam res Aſiae, Priamique evertere gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, Immeritam viſum ſuperis, &amp;c. Polydorum ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truncat. <hi>Aen.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> obſerves of <hi>Polydore.</hi> This is more clearly expreſſed by the <hi>Greek Poet.</hi>

Iliad.</note> He lays down the genealogy of <hi>Priam</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and adds that <hi>Jupiter hated the Family of</hi> Priam, <hi>and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding</hi> Aeneas <hi>was to command the</hi> Trojans <hi>and tranſmit the Empire to his Poſterity.</hi> Theſe are the advantages <hi>Aeneas</hi> derived from his Father. His Mother was the Goddeſs, from whom he deriv'd the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Good Nature,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs</hi> which was the fineſt Ornament of his <hi>Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Parents likewiſe hand down to their Children, their Nobility, which often makes a great deal of difference between thoſe, that are Noble, and thoſe that are not. Now that which happens often, or ordinarily in theſe things is the Rule which the Poet ought to go by. It would argue Ignorance, or Childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do otherwiſe: And one ſhould fall under theſe Cenſures, if for inſtance, one ſhould cauſe a Poetical perſon to be born under an unlucky Conſtellation, to whom we would give good inclinations and a happy fortune; whatſoever Inſtances may be oppoſed againſt the pretended doctrine of Aſtrologers, yet that which is admirable, and extraordinary in Poets, does not conſiſt in contradicting the common received opinion about theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Education</hi> is another Cauſe of the <hi>Manners</hi> which depends upon the two former, to wit, the Care and Quality of the Parents. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:53904:102"/>
has not forgot this Cauſe. Thoſe likewiſe with whom one converſes, contribute very much towards thoſe various Inclinations that proceed from <hi>Education.</hi> Whether one ſuits himſelf to their Humour, or whether that conformity of Humours makes theſe Conjunctions, and preſides o'er the choice of Friends, the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Aeneas</hi> are good, ſage, and pious Perſons? <note n="*" place="margin">Ipſe ſuas artes, ſua mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera laetus Apollo Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Citharamque dabat celereſque ſagittas.

                     <hi>Japis</hi> his Phyſician prefers his Skill in Phyſick beyond the Glory of Arms, even in that only deſign of prolonging the life of his old Father.</p>
                  <p>Education depends likewiſe on the Government and the State, under which one is brought up. One conceives quite different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents under a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> than one ſhould do under a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> This Point was of ſome moment to our Poet, who was willing to change the Inclinations of his Audience. 'Tis upon this account that the Inclinations of all the Perſonages in the <hi>Aeneid</hi> are unanimouſly for a <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And though the <hi>Thuſcans</hi> who were uſed cruelly by <hi>Mezentius,</hi> revolt from him, and drive him thence; yet this is not as the firſt <hi>Brutus</hi> did, to change the Face of the State, by baniſhing both the King and his Power together, but in order to ſubmit themſelves to a more juſt Monarch.</p>
                  <p>We may take into the number of <hi>mixed Cauſes,</hi> the Riches, the Dignities, the Alliances, and the other Goods of Fortune, which we poſſeſs; upon which I will only make this Reflection: That a King, or General of an Army, do not always act in that Character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Achilles</hi> was both. But he preſerves nothing of his Sovereignty, but that Independency by which he refuſes to obey <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> as otherwiſe he ought. The Fable requires only this, and <hi>Homer</hi> has ſaid no more of it. His <hi>Achilles</hi> is rather a private Man, and a ſingle Voluntier, who only fights in his own Quarrel, than a King or a General. So that nothing of all the good that is done any where elſe, but where he is preſent, is owing either to his Valour or his good Conduct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Hero is quite of another make. He never diveſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Dignities; he acts in the full Character of a General. And this advances his Martial Atchievements to a higher pitch of Glory than thoſe of <hi>Achilles.</hi> The Abſence of both theſe Heroes gives their Enemies great advantage againſt them, and is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence how great and neceſſary the Valour of both of them is. But this is peculiar to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that whatever good is done in his Abſence, is owing to his Conduct. Two things preſerved the <hi>Trojans</hi> from the rage of <hi>Turnus:</hi> The one is the Rampart and Fortifications of the Camp they were intrenched in. <hi>Aeneas</hi> himſelf deſigned and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53904:103"/>
over-looked theſe Works. The other is the good order they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to defend themſelves: And in this they did no more than what he ordered them at parting. And here is a Glory which the Hero in the <hi>Iliad</hi> can make no pretenſions to; and if one would compare both together, <hi>Achilles</hi> is a valiant Soldier, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> a compleat Commander.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Cauſes of the <hi>Manners,</hi> which we propounded, are purely <hi>internal.</hi> The chief and moſt general of theſe is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</hi> Poets place high Characters upon Bodies of the largeſt ſize, and the fineſt make. <note n="*" place="margin">Os humeroſque Deo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis, <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> gives his <hi>Hero</hi> the Stature and Viſage of a God: And he obſerves * that Vertue is moſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, when a good Soul is lodged in a Body <note place="margin">Gratior &amp; pulchro ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens in corpore virtus. <hi>Aen.</hi> 5.</note> that reſembles it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Complexion</hi> varies according to the difference of Ages and Sexes. <hi>Turnus</hi> is younger than <hi>Aeneas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Aeneas</hi> ought to be ſage and prudent, and <hi>Turnus</hi> furious and paſſionate like another <hi>Achilles.</hi> I will not tranſcribe here what <hi>Horace</hi> has writ concerning the <hi>Manners</hi> that are proper to every Age.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sex, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in his <hi>Poetry,</hi> that there are fewer good Women than bad; and that they do more miſchief than good in the World. <hi>Virgil</hi> is but too exact in copying this Thought. <hi>Venus</hi> is the Mother and Protectreſs of <hi>Aeneas:</hi> She ſeems to be good-natured through the whole. <hi>Sibyl</hi> likewiſe favours him. <hi>Cybele</hi> and <hi>Andromache</hi> are well-wiſhers to him, and wiſh him no harm; but they appear but little. For this ſmall number of good Women, how many bad ones are there, or at leaſt ſuch as bring a great deal of Miſchief upon this Hero? <hi>Juno</hi> is his profeſs'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and employs againſt him <hi>Iris, Juturna,</hi> and <hi>Alecto. Dido</hi> thought of ruining him at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and calls in to her aid her Siſter, a Nurſe, and an Inchantreſs. The <hi>Harpies</hi> drive him out of their Iſland. <note n="*" place="margin">Trojae &amp; Patriae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis Erynnis. <hi>Aen.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Helena</hi> is a Fury that ruines the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> themſelves. The <hi>Trojan</hi> Women, though his own Subjects, ſet his Fleet on Fire. <hi>Amata</hi> contemns the Order of the Gods, and the Will of the King her Husband; and with the <hi>Latin</hi> Women firſt blows the Trumpet to Rebellion. <note n="†" place="margin">Sylvia prima ſoror, &amp;c. <hi>Aen.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Sylvia</hi> puts her upon it. The Women, that were moſt eſteemed by this <hi>Hero,</hi> brought inſupportable Troubles upon his Head.

                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:53904:103"/>
                     <hi>Camilla</hi> bears Arms againſt him, but ſhe gives us an occaſion to make a more particular Reflection. <hi>Virgil,</hi> in her, has given us a pretty Example of the Inconſtancy of the Sex. It ſeems as if this courageous Damoſel was brought in to fight, only to teach other Women, that, War is none of their Buſineſs, and that they can never ſo far diveſt themſelves of their natural Inclinations. There ſtill remains ſomething in them which will prove the ruine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and which is a great prejudice to thoſe who relie upon them. The Poet does admirably apply this Point to the <hi>Manners</hi> of that Sex; and makes uſe of this <hi>Heroine</hi> in the caſe, who ſeems to be wholly of another make. In the heat of the Battel ſhe perceives a Warriour with rich Amour. She was preſently for having the Spoils of this Enemy; and the Motives the Poet gives her are looked upon as a Woman's greedy Deſire. This levity of the Sex makes <hi>Camilla</hi> forget her Dignity, and the taking care of her ſafety, and 'tis followed with very miſchievous Effects. She is killed, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry routed, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> preſerved from an Ambuſcado he was juſt falling into.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>GEography, Hiſtory, Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the Manners, but what the Poet ſhould be acquainted with. We will only here make a ſlight Application of it to our Subject.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Geographers</hi> in the Tracts they write concerning the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seas and Continent, do likewiſe inform us of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of States and Governments, of the Employments, the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Cuſtoms of the People, together with the Faſhion of their Habits. The Speech of <hi>Remulus,</hi> in the Ninth Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> is all Geographical. It contains the <hi>Education</hi> of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and their War-like Manners adapted to every Age; and it ends with an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> wherein he reproaches the <hi>Trojans</hi> with the Effeminacy of their Clothing, as a certain Sign that their Inclinations were oppoſite to thoſe he had been deſcribing. There are ſeveral other Paſſages in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> where this Effeminacy of their Apparel is deſcribed, and the Reproach of it caſt upon <hi>Aeneas</hi> himſelf with ſome ſort of <hi>Emphaſis.</hi> But <hi>Virgil</hi> very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly turns off from his Audience, who were the Progeny of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> this ſmall Reproach, which might elſe have reflected upon them. He ſays, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not derive from their Fathers any of that effeminate Faſhion: But on the other hand, that the <hi>Trojans</hi> accommodated themſelves to the more manly and generous Cuſtoms of the <hi>Italians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as well as <hi>Geography,</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Manners</hi> and the Cuſtoms of States, and People in general. But <hi>Hiſtory</hi> adds like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thereto the <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of particular Perſons, which it names. Both of them treat equally of the <hi>Manners</hi> as indifferent, writing with no other Deſign than to demonſtrate them as they really are. 'Tis true the Notices they give, ſerve for the Conduct of a Man's Life, and each Man is to look upon the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he meets with as ſo many Precepts, which teach him his Duty. But this Application does not ſo much belong to theſe two Arts, as to <hi>Moral Philoſophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poetry</hi> takes from <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Geography,</hi> what both of them ſay concerning the <hi>Morals.</hi> The Poet deſcribes things in general, as <hi>Geography</hi> does, and uſually it claps them under parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Names, as in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Sometimes it joins both theſe two things together, and makes the Application of them it ſelf.

                     <hi>Virgil</hi> being about to deſcribe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Sinon,</hi> advertiſes his Readers, that in the Villainy of this ſingle <hi>Graecian</hi> one might diſcover the Wickedneſs of the whole Nation. <hi>Moral Philoſophy</hi> contains in it the ſimple knowledge of the <hi>Manners,</hi> it ſuffers none that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad, or indifferent. It treats of them only with a deſign to render them good. The <hi>Vertues</hi> are always good. Theſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that we may embrace them. The <hi>Vices</hi> are always evil, and it teaches how to avoid them. The <hi>Paſſions</hi> in themſelves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, it corrects what is ill in them, and puts us in a Method how to make a right uſe of them, and bring them over to Vertue's ſide. There are ſome Inclinations that are ſo indifferent they cannot alter their Property. Such are thoſe of young Children before they are capable of Good or Evil. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> looks upon them not to be ſo much <hi>Manners,</hi> as the cauſe of <hi>future Manners.</hi> We can produce an Inſtance of this without quitting our uſual Guides. <hi>Horace</hi> is no leſs a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> than he is a <hi>Poet.</hi>

He had a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eſtate left him by his Progenitors. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death he bequeaths two of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to his two Sons, and gave them this Advice: <hi>I have obſerved that you,</hi> Aulus, <hi>have managed your Play-things after a careleſs manner, either gaming, or giving them inconſiderately away: And you,</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, <hi>on the other hand, are always coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Trifles, ſeem very anxious, and look about for holes to hide them in. This makes me afraid you will both ruine your ſelves by two contrary Vices; The one, by being as Prodigal as</hi> Numentanus; <hi>The other as covetous as</hi> Cicuta. <hi>Wherefore I charge you both, and conjure you, by the Guardian-Gods of our Family, that you,</hi> Aulus, <hi>diminiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Eſtate I leave you, and that you,</hi> Tiberius, <hi>never increaſe it; but live contented with what Nature, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, think ſufficient for you.</hi> This is the way <hi>Philoſophy</hi> treats of the Inclinations of Children. The Concluſion, and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this prudent Father, are for riper Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> treats of the Doctrine of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> not only as a <hi>Moral,</hi> but as a <hi>Natural Philoſopher.</hi> He renders a Reaſon of theſe things from the Matter whereof Bodies are compoſed, and from the Manner whereby they are made, and united to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53904:105"/>
Souls. But he does it in a <hi>Poetical</hi> Way, and very ſuitably to his Subject.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Rhetorick</hi> propoſes a different End to it ſelf, ſo likewiſe does it treat of the <hi>Manners</hi> after a different way. The Orator's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is not to render his Audience better than they are; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented if they are but convinced of that he undertook to convince them of. The better to effect this, he ſides with their Humour, and their Intereſts, as far as his Cauſe will bear. He appears Modeſt, Prudent, and a Man of Probity, that we may hearken to him with Delight, that we may relie upon him, and that we may believe that he neither deſigns to impoſe upon us, or is in the wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He gives us a quite contrary Idea of thoſe he ſpeaks againſt. In a word, he never troubles his Head with conſidering which are his own true Inclinations, or what the Inclinations of others are, but ſtudies to repreſent them all ſuch as they ſhould be, for him to gain his Cauſe?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poet</hi> ſhould know all this, that ſo he may the better make his Perſonages ſpeak. We might ſay that our Poets might look upon the Anceſtors of their Audience, as Orators do thoſe in whoſe behalf they ſpeak. Beſides <hi>Virgil</hi> might have conſidered <hi>Dido</hi> as his Enemy. The Treachery of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> would have diſpenſed a <hi>Roman Poet</hi> from ſome Civilities, which elſe, perhaps, one might think were becoming him. But the Fable does ſufficiently regulate the <hi>Manners</hi> of all the Perſonages, and 'tis to this one ſhould have the chiefeſt regard.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poet</hi> as well as the <hi>Orator</hi> has his Auditors. All the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I find is, that they are not ſo few in number, nor ſo fickle, nor ſo ſubject to particular Paſſions and Inclinations. The Poet writes for his whole Country, he muſt be read every hour, at all times, and by ſober Perſons. He has nothing then to do, but to ſtudy in general the Humour of his own Nation, and the good Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his Prince, if he lives in a Monarchy as <hi>Virgil</hi> did. But if a Prince has bad Inclinations, and an Author is ſo complaiſant as to ſpoil his Poem, the better to accommodate himſelf to them, he expoſes himſelf to very ſhameful Cenſures.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poet,</hi> as well as the <hi>Orator</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> is obliged to appear a grave, prudent, and honeſt Man. For this reaſon, and becauſe he is obliged to teach us Vertue, he is engaged to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with <hi>Morality,</hi> and to be truly vertuous. This is a practical Science; and is not learnt by empty Speculations. It a good and ſolid Moral does not correct our Paſſions, 'tis almoſt impoſſible but our Paſſions will make us think the <hi>Moral</hi> falſe. We are not apt to condemn thoſe Faults in which we take delight. We had rather believe that there are not Vices, than acknowledge that we our ſelves are vicious. If <hi>Horace</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Homer</hi> would not have given ſuch Commendations of Wine if he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53904:105"/>
had not lov'd it. What can one think of thoſe who take ſo much Delight and Pleaſure in that which is the moſt ſhameful and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in our Paſſions? who make of them the moſt moving and tendereſt Paſſages of their Poems? and who turn all infamous Amours into ſuch Gallantries as an honeſt man and a generous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier may reckon among his good Fortunes? One ſhall never make Vice odious, if one repreſent nothing of it but what is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleaſant. Thoſe who repreſent it only under a plauſible Diſguiſe, give us reaſon to think, that they only expoſe it more to view thereby, and that their Lives are of a piece with their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and their Writings. If there are any Readers that are of the ſame mind, 'tis not to thoſe a Man ſhould ſuit himſelf. This would be on the other hand to deſtroy the moſt eſſential Rules of Poetry, and the Fable. A pernicious Art is no Art, or at leaſt one not to be tolerated. If there are no other Readers to be met with, and if a Poet is oblig'd out of Complaiſance to be debauch'd, woe to thoſe who encourage ſuch a Corruption; and who prefer the Glory of being Poets, to that of being honeſt Men.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reflections are not beſide my Subject, ſince they ſerve to ſhew what is the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> Theſe Pagans have not ſullied the Majeſty of their <hi>Epiſodes</hi> by theſe vicious Delicacies. <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> is cold to <hi>Circe</hi>'s Charms. He is melancholy with <hi>Calypſo. Bryſeis</hi> and <hi>Chryſeis</hi> only inflame <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> with Anger. <hi>Camilla</hi> has no Gallants. There is ſcarce mention made of <hi>Turnus</hi>'s Paſſion for <hi>Lavinia.</hi> And all the Amour of <hi>Dido</hi> is treated only as a vicious Treachery for which this miſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Queen is puniſh'd ſeverely.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53904:106"/>
always in all ſorts of Diſcourſes.</hi> An Inſtance will clear this Definition.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Book of <hi>Virgil, Aeneas</hi> appears to be very pious, and more forward to execute the Will of the Gods, than any other thing. In the fourth Book a very difficult Choice is propoſed to him. On one ſide Gratitude, Love, Natural Tenderneſs, and ſeveral weighty Conſiderations, engage him not to part from <hi>Dido:</hi> on the other ſide, an expreſs Order of the Gods commands him to <hi>Italy.</hi> Before any one ſees what ſide he will take to, and on what he will reſolve, That which he has ſaid ought to have demonſtrated what his Will and what his Inclinations are, and to what he will determine. His former Speeches which diſcover to me his future Reſolution, are the Poetical <hi>Manners.</hi> Theſe make one foreſee that he would leave <hi>Dido,</hi> and obey the Gods: he does ſo: The <hi>Manners</hi> then are good, and duly order'd. If to ſtay with <hi>Dido,</hi> he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey'd the Orders of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the <hi>Manners</hi> would have been bad; bad, becauſe they would have made one foreſee a Choice, and a Reſolution quite contrary to that which he ought to take. But if nothing had foreſhewn me the Reſolution of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> nor what ſide he had taken to, nor the contrary, in this caſe there would have been no <hi>Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, as in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> the <hi>Manners</hi> are good when they make that Man ſo in whom they are; and they are bad when they incline him to Vice and Evil Actions: and as in <hi>Rhetorick</hi> they are good when they manifeſt the Perſon that ſpeaks to be honeſt, prudent, and ſincere, and the Perſon againſt whom he ſpeaks to be guilty of the contrary Vices; and evil when he that ſpeaks ſeems vicious, and imprudent; and his Adverſary ſage, and well adviſed independantly from what they are in Reality: ſo likewiſe in an <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péa</hi> the <hi>Manners</hi> are <hi>good</hi> when one may diſcover the Virtue or Vice, the good or bad Inclinations of thoſe who ſpeak or act; but <hi>bad</hi> when a good man appears vicious, or a wicked man ſeems to have good Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and thoſe of the Athei ſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentius</hi> conſidered Poetically, are both equally good, becauſe they equally demonſtrate the Piety of the one, and the Impiety of the other, which are the Characters the Poet beſtowed upon them, and under which they are always repreſented by him. But in the <hi>Hippolyte</hi> of <hi>Seneca</hi> the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Phaedra's Nurſe</hi> are very <hi>bad,</hi> becauſe this Woman is very wicked, and ſpeaks very fine things.

When a Body hears a long Speech full of thoſe chaſte Thoughts, would not one think that ſhe who ſpeaks is <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity</hi> her ſelf come down expreſs from Heaven to baniſh from the Earth all unlawful Love?

                     <hi>If the amorous Flame rages ſo much within your Breaſt, never value what the World ſays of it.

Let me take this rough Young-man to task, and for your ſake touch the very heart of this reſentleſs Creature.</hi> Here's good Morality turn'd out of doors in an inſtant.

The ſecond thing is the Knowledge which a Genius, Study, and Experience, gives us of the <hi>Inclinations,</hi> that are proper to each Perſon according to the Complexion, the Dignity, and all the other Cauſes whether natural or acquir'd, internal or external, all which we mention'd before. As ſoon as the Poet has given the Dignity of a King to one of his Perſonages, without hearing him ſpeak, or ſeeing him act, we know that he ought to be grave, majeſtical, jealous of his Authority, and the like.

                  <p>To wind our ſelves out of this Difficulty, 'twill not be amiſs to begin here, by examining, whether according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the Poetical Hero ought neceſſarily to be an honeſt and vertuous Man.

                  <head>CHAP. V. Whether the <hi>Hero</hi> of the <hi>Poem</hi> ought to be an Honeſt Man, or no?</head>
                  <p>THIS Queſtion will ſeem unreaſonable to thoſe who have but one ſingle Idea of their Heroes; and who acknowledge none of that Name, but thoſe excellent Men who are endued with every Virtue, are Maſters of their Paſſions, and all their Inclinations, and whom an excellent and Divine Nature raiſes above the reſt of Mankind. But neither the Ancient Poets, nor the Maſters of this Art ever thought of placing their Heroes in ſo high a Sphere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking it lawful to put them in a lower form: 'Tis requiſite then to make the ſame Diſtinction between a Hero in <hi>Morality,</hi> and an Hero in <hi>Poetry,</hi> as we did between <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Poetical Goodneſs,</hi> and to ſay that <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Mezentius</hi> had as much right to the <hi>Poetical Goodneſs;</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> and <hi>Aeneas:</hi> So that theſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53904:108"/>
two cruel and unjuſt Men are as regular Heroes of Poetry, as theſe two Princes that are ſo Juſt, ſo Wiſe, and ſo Good.</p>
                  <p>In the Poem it ſelf this Term admits of two ſences. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifies indifferently all the perſons of Note. So that not only <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> but likewiſe <hi>Entellus</hi> in the ſports of the Fifth Book, and <hi>Miſenus</hi> the Trumpeter of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in the Sixth, are ſtyl'd <hi>Heroes</hi> by the Poet. But though the Name of <hi>Hero</hi> may be alſo beſtow'd on other Perſonages, yet there is ſo particular an Application of it made to the firſt, that when one ſimply ſay; <hi>the Hero,</hi> by that Name we underſtand only <hi>Achilles</hi> in the <hi>Iliad, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſeïs, Aeneas</hi> in the <hi>Latin Poem;</hi> in a word the principal Perſonage in any Poem.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a particular ſignification of the Word <hi>Heroick</hi> when 'tis uſed to denote an <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and ſo diſtinguiſh this ſort of Poem from others. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> give this Name not to the Poem, but to the Verſes made uſe of therein, and which they likewiſe call <hi>Hexameter Verſes.</hi> This laſt has been almoſt the only Name we have retain'd. If we ſhould call <hi>Epick Poems Heroick Poems,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Heroick</hi> Verſes that are made uſe of therein, one might with as much reaſon call the <hi>French Epopéas Alexandrine Poems,</hi> ſince the Verſes they uſe in theſe Poems are called <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrines.</hi> And if the Name <hi>Heroick</hi> comes from the Perſonages of the Poem, who are ſtyl'd <hi>Heroes; Tragedy</hi> would be as much an <hi>Heroick Poem</hi> as the <hi>Epopéa</hi> would, ſince the Action and the Perſonages of <hi>Tragedy</hi> are no leſs <hi>Heroick,</hi> than the Action and the Perſonages of the <hi>Epopéa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I queſtion whether theſe Reflections be ſo uſeful as to deſerve ſo many Words. They may only ſerve to diſcover to us the different uſe of the Terms <hi>Hero,</hi> and <hi>Heroick</hi> among the Ancients, and the Moderns; and to prevent condemning the firſt for ſuch Notions, which they never follow'd. When we know that they did not affix the Idea of Vertue, to theſe Terms taken in a Poetical ſenſe, that they never confin'd the Name of Hero only to the principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage in the Poem, and that they did not call the <hi>Epopéas</hi> by the Name of <hi>Heroick Poems:</hi> We ſhall not in theſe Works look for Examples of a real and excelling Vertue, and no one will wonder that <hi>Horace</hi> has ſaid on the contrary, that all the <hi>Iliad</hi> where ſo many Hero's loſt their lives, contains nothing but Injuſtice, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Paſſion, and Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>I have omitted one ſignification of the word <hi>Hero,</hi> which may be conſidered as <hi>Moral,</hi> and as <hi>Poetical.</hi> In this ſenſe we call ſome Men that were born of ſome Deity, and a Mortal Perſon, as <hi>Achilles</hi> who was the Son of the Goddeſs <hi>Thetis</hi> and <hi>Peleus;</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Alomena.</hi> But this lays no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon Poets to make theſe Heroes good Men: Becauſe there were likewiſe wicked Gods.

                  <p>Beſides, it muſt be obſerved, that he only ſpeaks of that which is the moſt compleat part in the Poems, and not ſimply of that which is regular and allowable: And moreover, that this Mean, which he requires, is for complex Fables. So that he does not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely exclude from the number of theſe Poetical <hi>Heroes,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons of the greateſt Vertue, ſuch as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> nor the moſt Vicious, ſuch as <hi>Ixion</hi> and <hi>Medea. Horace</hi> mentions theſe two laſt among the Regular Heroes. <note n="*" place="margin">Sit Medea ferox invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaque: Perfidus Ixion. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>

                  <p>But ſince laſtly, both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> approve of <hi>Homer</hi>'s practice in the <hi>Manners</hi> he has given to <hi>Achilles,</hi> and ſince they propoſe this Hero, as a Model for other Poets to imitate; the Bad Morals of this Perſonage ſhould convince us, that according to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53904:109"/>
Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and according to <hi>Homer</hi>'s practice, 'tis by no means neceſſary that the principal Perſon of an <hi>Epopéa</hi> ſhould be an honeſt Man. For never does an honeſt Man prefer his own paſſion and private Intereſt to the publick Cauſe, the Glory of his Country, the Honour and the Life of his Innocent Friends. Never did an honeſt Man uſe ſuch vile Language as this to his General, <hi>Go thou Impudent, Drunken, fearful Fellow; there are none but drones who obey thee.</hi> Theſe contumelies are Seditious, and of very bad conſequence, and they are ſo much the more Criminal, becauſe he who ſaid them might be the Ringleader of a Faction: A good Man, if God denies him any thing, will never break out into a paſſion againſt him, and will never tell him that he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on him if he can. 'Tis only profane, and Mad-men that ſpeak thus.</p>
                  <p>Was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ignorant of theſe continual Extravagancies of <hi>Achilles?</hi> Or did this learned Philoſopher take them for real Vertues? There is not the leaſt colour for ſuch a Thought. We ſhould more probably believe that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conſidered this Poetical Hero only as a Savage, directly oppoſite to the Hero of his <hi>Morality.</hi> For in the paſſage above cited, <hi>he oppoſes this Brutality, to the Heroick and Divine Vertues. Becauſe a God and a Beaſt are incapable, the one of Vice, and the other of Vertue.</hi> And in truth the one of theſe Natures is of too high, and the other of too low a pitch. Laws are made for neither the one, nor the other of them. And is not this what <hi>Horace</hi> ſays of the Character of <hi>Achilles? He ſhould not acknowledge that he was under the tye of any Laws.</hi> Therefore there is no medium; he belongs to one of the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> propoſes, either above or below Mankind; he is Divine or Brutal. And which to fix upon is no hard matter. <hi>Horace</hi> ſays he is a Fool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer,</hi> 'tis true, has ſome faults, and <note n="*" place="margin">Non ego paucis Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit, Aut humana parum cavit natura. <hi>Poet.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi> owns it; but the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> cannot be one of theſe faults, which are ſo few, are no offence, and are owing either to humane frailty, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable negligence. Theſe are the faults <hi>Horace</hi> cenſures, or to ſpeak more properly, which he excuſes in <hi>Homer.</hi> And can this be applied to the Character of <hi>Achilles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We conclude this Point by confirming the practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> with a reaſon drawn from the Eſſence of the Poem according as we propos'd it. The Moral does as well teach us how to avoid Vices as (in conformity to <hi>Horace)</hi> we ſaid concerning the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Achilles;</hi> as it does how to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Vertue, as <hi>Horace</hi> obſerves of the other Poem, and the other Hero of <hi>Homer.</hi> And laſtly the Fable which is the very Soul of the Poem, and which is of the ſame nature in <hi>Homer</hi> as in <hi>Aeſop,</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53904:109"/>
is as regularly capable of the moſt baſe and Criminal Men, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals for its firſt and only Perſonages, as it is of the moſt generous and the moſt praiſe-worthy.</p>
                  <p>Without dwelling then upon any new proofs which the Inference will afford us, we may conclude, that Reaſon and the nature of the Poem, the practice of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> do all inform us that 'tis not at all neceſſary that the Hero of a Poem ſhould be a good and vertuous Man: And that there is no Irregularity in making him as treacherous as <hi>Ixion,</hi> as unnatural as <hi>Medea,</hi> and as Brutal as <hi>Achilles.</hi>

                  <p>WHat we are going to deliver here concerning the Goodneſs of the <hi>Manners,</hi> is only an Explanation of what <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> has writ about it in the fifteenth Chapter of his Poetry. The whole Paſſage runs thus: <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>There are four things to be obſerved in the Manners. The firſt and principal is, the Method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them good. There will be Manners in a Speech or Action, if, as we before hinted, either one or the other diſcovers on what the Perſon that ſpeaks or acts will reſolve. Let theſe Manners be</hi> Vicious <hi>and bad, provided they foreſhow</hi> Vicious <hi>and bad Inclinations; or good and</hi> Vertuous, <hi>provided they likewiſe foreſhow good and</hi> Virtuous <hi>Inclinations. This happens in all ſorts of Conditions; for a Woman and a Foot-boy will be good in a Poetical Senſe, though commonly Women are rather bad and vicious than good and vertuous, and Foot-boys are of no account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Paſſage has ſomewhat of Difficulty in it: perhaps I have changed it too much, by confining it to my ſence; but I had rather interpret it thus, than otherwiſe—</p>
                  <p>After what has been ſaid in the former Chapter, I ſee not the leaſt Reaſon to apply this <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which ought ſo ſtrictly to be obſerv'd in the <hi>Manners</hi> of the Poetical Perſons, to Morality and Virtue. I am of Opinion then, that we are to underſtand this of the Poetical Goodneſs; and this is what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would make out, when afterwards he ſays, that there will be <hi>Manners in a

Speech or Action if either of them foreſhow any Inclination, Choice, and Reſolution,</hi> as I have already ſaid upon the occaſion of another of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Paſſages, to which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> refers us.</p>
                  <p>This will likewiſe ſerve to illuſtrate upon what account I have render'd the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by this Phraſe, <hi>upon what he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</hi> This Greek Word ſignifies neither an Inclination, nor a ſimple Act of the Will, without Deliberation and Choice; but it ſignifies the Choice which one makes, and the Deſire one has after ſome ſort of Deliberation. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf explains this Term very largely in his <hi>Ethicks.</hi> The Word <hi>Reſolution</hi> ſignifies thus much, but being uſed alone, is too equivocal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adds, that the <hi>Manners are bad, when the</hi> Reſolutions <hi>that are taken are ſo; and that the Manners are good, when the Reſolutions are good.</hi> I did not think that this <hi>Goodneſs of the Manners</hi> was a Poetical Goodneſs, and that his Meaning was, that for the well ordering of the <hi>Manners</hi> in a Poem, 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the Perſons which are introduced take ſuch Reſolutions and Deſigns as are juſt and good, that an Author tranſgreſſes this Rule, and makes the <hi>Manners</hi> Poetically <hi>bad,</hi> when the Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are determin'd to do a bad Action. This Interpretation would condemn the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>Achilles,</hi> in that of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and in almoſt all the Perſonages of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> Certainly this was never <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Deſign. The <hi>Aeneid</hi> it ſelf would be liable to the ſame Cenſure. <hi>Dido, Turnus, Amata, Mezentius,</hi> and ſeveral others, would ſpoil all the places where they act ſo viciouſly; that is to ſay, they would ſpoil the whole Poem, from one end to the other. I have therefore inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this place in a moral ſence, and thought that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intended to teach us, that the <hi>Poctical Manners</hi> are equally good, let them be in a moral ſenſe good or bad, provided that the Poet order Matters ſo that they appear before hand to be ſuch as either the good or the bad Perſons of his Poem ought to have.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the Text confirms me farther in my Opinion, and in the Diſtinction I have made between the <hi>Moral</hi> and the <hi>Poetical Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Manners. Ariſtotle</hi> ſays that the goodneſs of the <hi>Manners</hi> he ſpeaks of, may be met with in all ſorts of States and conditions even amongſt <hi>foot-men who have no goodneſs in them.</hi> Without doubt a foot-man cannot be Maſter of that goodneſs, to which he has no right. He will then be <hi>morally bad,</hi> becauſe he will be a diſſembling, drunken, cheating Raſcal, and he will be <hi>Poetically good,</hi> becauſe theſe bad inclinations will be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p>This Inſtance of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the application he himſelf makes of what he ſays, of the <hi>goodneſs of the Manners</hi> to a <hi>foot-man,</hi> does teach us that he does not ſpeak only in the behalf of Heroes, let the word be taken in what ſence ſoever, but that this goodneſs he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53904:110"/>
deſcribes, as well as the other Qualifications of the <hi>Manners,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to all ſorts of Poetical Perſons, from Kings and Princes down to foot-men and waiting Boys. Without excepting any one in <hi>Comedy, Tragedy</hi> and the <hi>Epopéa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though we mention the liberty Poets have of putting vicious Perſons in a Poem, yet this liberty has its bounds and Rules, and they are not to ſuppoſe virtue and vice muſt go hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 'Tis neceſſity and probability that regulate theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. And they regulate them ſo, that when they give to vertue all that is poſſible, yet they allow vice only that which cannot be cut off from the Poem without ſpoiling the Fable. Thus <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> cenſures the <hi>Vicious Manners,</hi> not becauſe they are Vicious, but becauſe they are ſo without any neceſſity for it. But he does not blame the obſtinacy of <hi>Achilles,</hi> as unjuſt and unreaſonable as it was, becauſe it was neceſſary to the Fable. If <hi>Achilles</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſatisfaction from <hi>Agamemnon</hi> before the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> the action would have been at an End: Or elſe <hi>Achilles</hi> would have fought no more and ſo the Fable would have been defective and imperfect: Or elſe having no particular quarrel againſt <hi>Hector,</hi> he would have fought only for the common cauſe, and conſequently the Siege and War of <hi>Troy</hi> would have been the Subject of the Poem, and the Action would have been <hi>Epiſodical</hi> and ſpoil'd. 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then that <hi>Achilles</hi> ſhould be unjuſt and inexorable. But the Poet carries the Vices of <hi>Achilles</hi> no farther than the neceſſity of the Fable forc'd him, as we obſerv'd before.</p>
                  <p>'Tis time now to join the Authority of <hi>Horace</hi> to that of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi> Certainly if the Poet ſhould take ſpecial care to make the manners good in a <hi>Moral Senſe,</hi> there would have been as little Reaſon to give the name of <hi>Manners</hi> to indifferent Inclinations in Poetry, as in Moral Philoſophy, and the Maſters in both Sciences would have been equally ridiculous, if they had laid down Rules and Precepts for theſe ſorts of Inclinations.

                  <p>THere is no ſuch difficulty in the other three Qualities of the <hi>Manners</hi> in Poetry as in the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of them. We have already explained in particular what <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> they ought to have with the <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External Cauſes,</hi> which either raiſe or diſcover them in Men. What <hi>Reſemblance</hi> the Poet ought to give them to what Hiſtory the Fable or common report have publiſh'd of them; and laſtly what that <hi>evenneſs</hi> of them is which ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in each Perſonage without permitting him to alter his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. We ſhall ſatisfie our ſelves with only making here ſome general Reflections upon theſe three Qualities.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Reflection we make is this, that ſometimes theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties happen ſo oppoſite in one and the ſame Perſon, that if we would do juſtice to the one, we ſhall be unjuſt to the other. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

of this may be obſerved in the Emperour <hi>Maurice:</hi> His Inclinations would not have been <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the dignity of an Emperour, if one ſhould make him covetous, and they would not be <hi>like</hi> to what we know of him, if one ſhould make him magnificent and liberal. In truth there is a ſort of avarice which Kings are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, to wit, the deſire of heaping up vaſt treaſures. Such was the paſſion of <hi>Polymneſtor</hi> King of <hi>Thrace</hi> which gave <hi>Virgil</hi> an occaſion to ſay, <note n="*" place="margin">Quid non mortalia pectora cogis Auri ſacra fames? <hi>Aen.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>That this inordinate thirſt after Riches, carried Men on to ſtrange extravagancies.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Portantur avari Pygma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionis opes pelago. <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> Such was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the paſſion of <hi>Pygmalion</hi> King of <hi>Tyre.</hi> The queſtion here does not lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſort of Avarice, but concerning the ſordid, baſe niggardlineſs which coſt ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers their Lives. They were Priſoners of War with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who required but a very ſmall ranſome for them. <hi>Maurice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to pay it, and by this baſe, unworthy denial of ſo ſmall a ſum for ſo weighty a conſideration, he caſt the conqueror into ſuch a fit of paſſion, that he ordered all theſe miſerable Souldiers of ſo wicked a Prince to be butchered immediately.</p>
                  <p>It may be asked then what a Poet ſhall do that he may neither offend againſt the <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> of an Emperour's <hi>Manners,</hi> nor againſt the <hi>Reſemblance</hi> of them to that which is to be found in Hiſtory about them? In anſwer to this I ſay, that a Man will not be perplex'd with theſe ſorts of Perſonages, if in the compoſition of his Poem he will but obſerve the Method I propoſed in my firſt Book. In the firſt place the Author will make his Fable with univerſal perſons, and without Names, and conſequently without ſo much as thinking of <hi>Maurice.</hi> And when he has a mind to make the Epiſodes, and ſhall look out for particular Names to give to his Perſonages, if in his platform he meets with a Miſer, he will not think it adviſeable to give him the title and Dignity, either of a King or an Emperour: And if in the ſame platform he meets with a liberal and magnificent Perſon, to be ſure he will never chuſe the Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> to act this part. So that to the queſtion propounded it may be anſwered, that the Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> whether Liberal or Covetous; is not one that can regularly be brought into any Poem.</p>
                  <p>But he may be made uſe of therein, if the Fable admits ſuch a thing as the diſſembling his avarice without changing it into libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; according to <hi>Mr. Corneille</hi>'s practice in his <hi>Heraclius. Phocas</hi> could reap ſome advantage from this criminal paſſion of his Enemy, and ſo render his cruelty againſt this Prince ſomewhat leſs odious, <hi>Maurice</hi> did indeed know that God made uſe of this Tyrant to puniſh the crime, which his avarice put him upon committing: But this I doubt would have been againſt the <hi>ſuitableneſs</hi> of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53904:112"/>
                     <hi>Manners,</hi> and the Spectators would have been offended with this Reflection. The Poet has judiciouſly concealed this vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Maurice</hi> without attributing the contrary to him, which would likewiſe have offended againſt what was <hi>likely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One cannot then act contrary to the Qualities of the <hi>Manners,</hi> but we may ſometimes omit them, and this is the ſecond Reflection I would make upon the Subject.</p>
                  <p>When a Man omits the firſt quality, he neceſſarily omits all the reſt; ſince that is the only ſource and foundation of them. If the <hi>Manners</hi> appear not at all, they will be neither <hi>ſuitable,</hi> nor <hi>likely,</hi> nor <hi>even,</hi> nor the contrary. This may be done in all the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages that are of no note in a Poem, ſuch as are the multitude of perſons juſt mentioned in Battles, and ſeveral others. Becauſe if the Poet on one ſide is obliged to relate no action, nor Incident without <hi>Manners, Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> that the <hi>Narration</hi> may be <hi>active</hi> and pleaſant, and the minds of the Readers may attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: So likewiſe ought he not to admit of any more Intereſted and paſſionate perſons, than what he is preciſely obliged to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out augmenting the number of them, that ſo the Memory may not be over-burdened, nor the attention diſtracted to no purpoſe. So in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> we ſee but little of the <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Mneſtheus, Cloantes, Meſſapus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>fenzus,</hi> and of ſo many Valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and other perſons that have conſiderable Poſts in the Poem.</p>
                  <p>When we make the <hi>Manners</hi> of a perſon appear but only once, we may make them <hi>ſuitable</hi> to his Dignity, Age, and Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may make them <hi>like</hi> to what common fame has publiſhed of them, but 'tis plain that there can be no <hi>equality</hi> of them, no more than there can be an inequality: On the contrary, it ſometimes happens, that one and the ſame perſon is of an even and uneven temper at the ſame time. Becauſe this Character, which in moſt Men reſembles the Sun, whoſe equality conſiſts in appearing always the ſame; <note n="*" place="margin">Stultus ut Luna muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> in others is like the Moon, whoſe equality conſiſts in changing her Faces four times a Month: Sometimes this inequality proceeds from Age, as <hi>Horace</hi> has obſerved in <note n="†" place="margin">Puer mutatur in Horas. Juvenis amata relinquere pernix.</note> Children and Youths. They owe this to the ſoftneſs and the want of due conſiſtency of their Brains. Objects are very eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon them, and theſe Images are as eaſily wip'd away by the impreſſion of new Objects, or meerly by the motion of the Animal-ſpirits. But it happens in ſome perſons, that their Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan is never cloſed ſufficiently. This was the misfortune of <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Auguſtus</hi>'s Fidler. It would be ill ſuiting one's ſelf to his humour, and it would offend againſt what is likely, only to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him always in the ſame Vein. He was covetous and prodigal:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53904:112"/>
As proud as a King in his Dreſs, and clothed as meanly as a Cobler. So active and diligent as to ſpend whole Nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wink of Sleep, and ſo Lazy as to lie a-bed till the Afternoon for it. Laſtly, if we would take <note n="*" place="margin">Nil aequale homini fuit illi, &amp;c. <hi>Hor. Lib. 1. Sat.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi>'s word for't, there could nothing be added to the inequality of this Man's humour. There is another inequality that is more common, but comes on more ſlowly, and that is the inequality of a Man in the different Ages of his Life. <note n="†" place="margin">Juvenis utilium tardus proviſor: Prodigus aeris.</note> In his Youth, he never thinks of heaping up wealth, but idly ſquanders it away. <note n="‡" place="margin">Aetas virilis quaerit opes, inſervit honori.</note> In his riper Age he gathers it in, and lays it out as honourably. <note n="*" place="margin">Sonex, quaerit &amp; inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis miſer abſtinet ac timet uti. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> And when he comes to be Old, he ſeeks for and heaps up Wealth with greedineſs, and is ſo far afraid of laying it out, that he had rather live miſerably than ſpend a Farthing upon the ordinary neceſſaries of Life. This inequality is of little uſe in Poem. It ſeldom happens that a Poet repreſents one and the ſame perſon at his fifteenth, and at his ſixtieth Year, 'Tis the others that are of more uſe in Poems. But when a Poet introduces them, he ought to give his hearers timely notice, that this inequality is the expreſs character that he gives to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Terence</hi> has ſomething upon this Subject in his <hi>Brothers</hi> worth taking notice of. His <hi>Demea</hi> is a teſty and rough old Gentleman, one that keeps a ſtrict hand over his Family, and thrifty to the higheſt degree. This was the conſtant courſe of his whole life, and he carried on this croſs-grained Humour to the very end of the Play. And then he thinks of being better humour'd, more endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obliging and is concern'd for nothing. Here is a ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality. Yet the Poet makes it very regular. <hi>Demea</hi> himſelf gives his Audience notice of it. <hi>Never,</hi> ſays he, <hi>did Man caſt up the buſineſs of his Life ſo exactly; but ſtill Experience, Years, and Cuſtom will bring in ſome new particulars that he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of; and ſhew his Ignorance of what he thought he knew, and after tryal make him reject his former Opinions. This is plainly my caſe at preſent: For ſince my glaſs is almoſt out, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this rigid Life I have always led. But why ſo? Becauſe Experience ſhews me there's nothing like gentleneſs and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And this truth appears plainly to all that knew me and my Brother. He always ſpent his time in eaſe and pleaſure; always courteous, complaiſant, ſpoke ill of no Man, but carreſs'd all; liv'd as he pleaſed, ſpent as he thought fit, the World bleſs'd him, and lov'd him too: But I that ruſtick, rigid, moroſe, pinching, brutiſh, griping fellow muſt needs Marry; And how have I ſmarted for't? I had Children too, thoſe were new
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53904:113"/>
troubles: And truly in building up their Fortunes, I have worn out my life and the beſt of all my days: And now I'm just marching off the Stage, the fruit of all my labour is, to be hated like a Toad. But my Brother enjoys all the pleaſure of a father without the drudgery: They love him, and fly me like the Plague. Him they truſt with all their ſecrets, dote upon him, live with him, but me they ſlight: They both pray for his Life, but long for my Death: Thoſe I have brought up with the greateſt labour, he has gained with a little coſt, ſo I take all the pains, and he reaps all the pleaſure. Well, well, for once we'll try what can be done, whether we can ſpeak obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly, and act the Gentleman too; ſince my Brother urges me to't, I'de willingly have my Children love and reſpect me too; if Gifts and Compliments will do the feat, I'll not be behind the beſt of them: But my Eſtate muſt go to wrack: What care I for that? Since I have one foot in the Grave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I enlarge too far upon a thing ſo well known as this <hi>Comedy. Terence</hi> carries on the Reflection ſtill farther, and ends it not till he ends his Play, and he is ſo cautious in it that he leaves his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience nothing to gueſs at.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Omnibus nobis ut res dant ſeſe, ita magni atque humiles ſumus. <hi>Terent. Hecyr. Act. 3. Scen.</hi> 3.</note> There is another inequality of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> that is occaſioned by the change of a Man's Fortune, and which uſually cauſes Men to be of a low and dejected Spirit, when they are in miſery and diſtreſs, and fierce and proud when they are in power, and think they are Maſters of their Fortune. A Poet may range this <hi>ſuitableneſs,</hi> in the <hi>Manners</hi> of perſons, who are of an ordinary Vertue, and who are more inclined to be vain and proud, than truly generous; and by this conduct the <hi>Equality</hi> will not be alter'd. But if he makes a perſon generous, then he ſhould alter leſs by the change of his Fortune. Theſe perſonages ſhould be as bold in their worſt as in their beſt circumſtances; or as modeſt after a Victory as after the loſing of a Battle; according as the Poet orders either fierceneſs or gentleneſs to be the commanding character he gives them.</p>
                  <p>This laſt Character is that which <hi>Virgil</hi> beſtows upon the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi> They appear very humble before <hi>Dido</hi> when the ſtorm had uſed them ſo ſcurvily, and brought them under the mercy of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

them. But we ſee 'tis true Modeſty, when we hear the ſame Language from them after a Victory. <hi>Aeneas</hi> overcame the <hi>Latins</hi> in a hot Engagement, their Legates fell at his feet beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to give them leave to burn their Dead; and he was ſo far from ſhewing the leaſt Arrogancy, <note n="*" place="margin">Nec veni niſi fata locum ſedemque dediſſent; Nec bellum cum gente gero, &amp;c. <hi>Aen.</hi> 11.</note> that he even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes his being forc'd to conquer them, and declares to them that his deſire was only for peace.</p>
                  <p>Let us now make a Reflection upon the <hi>Reſemblance</hi> the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ought to have with what common fame has publiſhed of them. This quality has this peculiar to its ſelf that one may obſerve the reſt in all ſorts of perſonages, and one may likewiſe commit faults againſt them always. But there are ſome perſons in whom there is nothing to be obſerved either for, or againſt the <hi>Reſemblance.</hi> Theſe perſonages are of two ſorts. The one are ſuch as are wholly invented, as are all thoſe of <hi>Comedies,</hi> and almoſt all the perſonages of the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> and <hi>Tragedy,</hi> ſince in both there are but a few Names taken from Hiſtory or the Fable. The ſecond ſort is of ſuch, that are really taken from Hiſtory, but whoſe manners are known by few, and of whom common fame has ſaid nothing: For in this caſe 'tis plain, one cannot give them Inclinations, that are like or contrary to what common fame has ſaid of them; ſince ſhe has ſaid nothing about them. So likewiſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does not oppoſe Names taken from Hiſtory to Names that are invented, but he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to them names that are well known. The ſame we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm of the <hi>Manners. Dido</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is of this ſecond ſort. The Poet having feigned in his Fable ſuch a perſonage as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Queen to be, the obſcurity of Hiſtory gave him entire licenſe to make uſe of a name ſo little known.</p>
                  <p>This Licenſe is only for ſuch as firſt make uſe of theſe Names: For thoſe who make uſe of them afterwards, are obliged to keep up the Character that was at firſt given them, and which comes to be known this way. They can only change ſome circumſtances that are leſs known, and add other new ones, which ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with what one knows already of it.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Character</hi> of a perſon is that which is proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, and diſtinguiſhes him from others. As this is diſcernable in the lines of a Man's face; ſo it is likewiſe to be met with in the <hi>Manners</hi> we are now diſcourſing of. That which I have met with in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> about it, is in the ſame Chapter, from whence we cited that which has been already ſaid about the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>

                     <hi>Since,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Tragedy is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what is beſt amongſt Men, we ought to do like good Painters, who when they give each perſon his proper form and Character, and ſo make their Figures like them, do likewiſe repreſent them much fairer. In like manner ſhould the Poet form examples of goodneſs or of Hard-heartedneſs, when he imitates a paſſionate and Cholerick or a ſoft and mild natur'd Man, or any other ſuch like Character. 'Tis after this manner that</hi> Homer <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has attributed goodneſs to</hi> Achilles. <hi>Care muſt be taken of this, and beſides without ſpeaking here of what is neceſſary, 'tis requiſite to obſerve the ſeries and the Conſequence that is in Poetry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are ſubject to commit ſeveral faults.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one knows what affinity there is between <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Poetry. Horace</hi> begins his Art with it, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> likewiſe compares them both together in the very firſt Chapter of his <hi>Poetry.</hi> He ſpeaks of it in ſeveral other places, and by this which we have here cited 'tis plain his judgment is, that one cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a more perfect Idea of the <hi>Poetical Character</hi> in the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> than by the practice of <hi>Painters</hi> in the <hi>Character</hi> which they give to their Pictures. If we would underſtand his Mind exactly, we cannot do it better than by enquiring in the Art, how one may draw a Portraicture perfectly like its Original, and which at the ſame time ſhould be finer? I'll venture to give my thoughts about it.</p>
                  <p>Painters in their Perſonagees have three ſorts of Subjects. Either
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53904:114"/>
they repreſent particular Perſons to the Life, ſuch as <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> young <hi>Marcellus, Virgil, Seneca, Paulinus, &amp;c.</hi> Or they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dignities and ſuch like Characters, as a King, a Philoſopher, a Miniſter of State, a Poet, a Varlet, a Beggar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or laſtly, they repreſent a Paſſion, ſuch as Anger, Joy, Diſcontent, Cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may add that Painters and Poets, of an elevated Fancy, are more for drawing Kings, Princes, and things of State and Grandure: And that the leſs noble Genius of others, puts them upon the Choice of Valets, Drunkards, and deſpicable Perſons. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributes the Variety of <hi>Dramatick Poems</hi> and the Invention of <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi> to the diverſity of Genius's. The firſt would doubtleſs make finer Perſonages, than the laſt. But this makes no difference as to the exact likeneſs of the Characters. Both the one, and the other may meet with equal ſucceſs as well in the baſeneſs and deformity of <hi>Irus</hi> and <hi>Therſites,</hi> as in the Majeſty and bon mien of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we cannot here make any uſe of this difference, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks only of Poems, and famous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: And we can without quitting <hi>Tragedy</hi> and the <hi>Epopéa</hi> meet with this difference of more or leſs comelineſs in an exact <hi>likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things are conſiderable in the Perſons one would paint. The firſt are the Features which we may call <hi>Characteriſtical:</hi> Such are the natural Wrinkles of the Face, the Proportion of each part, the colour of the Eyes and Hair, the ſhape of the Noſe, the thickneſs of the Lips, the wideneſs of the Mouth, and other ſuch like proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This is what ſhould properly and chiefly fix the Imagination, and give it the Idea of the perſon we would repreſent. 'Tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that theſe Features be obſerv'd in the Copy, to make it more like the Original; and 'tis of theſe that the expreſſion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be underſtood <hi>[Giving to each perſon the Character that is proper to him.]</hi> Theſe <hi>Characteriſtical Features</hi> are ſo far fix'd, in compariſon to the reſt, that they continue the ſame even in the change of Ages and Sexes; and they eaſily diſcover the Fathers by the countenance of their Children, and the Mothers by that of their Sons.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing is a great deal leſs permanent, and leſs affix'd to its Subject, and conſequently leaves a Painter more to his own liberty. 'Tis the colour of the Fleſh, the plumpneſs, and ſeveral other things, that augment or diminiſh the Beauty of a Perſon without changing the Features, and the proportion of his Countenance. There are ſome, whom a pale colour would better become than a fairer Complexion; or who would be much more taking were they made a little Fatter, or a little Leaner. There needs only a ſlight diſtemper, a diſturbance, or a few Days of Diverſion to produce theſe Alterations. So that a skilful <hi>Painter</hi> will conſider a perſon under different States, and with thoſe various Motions which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53904:115"/>
may naturally happen to him. And having obſerv'd what becomes him beſt, he will paint him in ſome Action or other, wherein he ſhall be a little mov'd with fear or anger, according as he has a mind to make him more pale or more lively than the Original: Or elſe he will give him a ſmiling Countenance, if he perceives the Perſon has ſome defect which a ſmile would conceal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this manner, without altering the natural Reſemblance, Painters <hi>repreſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more comely than they are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two, whereof one makes the Picture like to, and the other makes it more comely than the Original, which we have applied to particular Perſons, may likewiſe be applied to whole Orders of Men according to their Dignities, Ages, Paſſions, and other Habitudes. The Throne, Diadem, Scepter, and Majeſty make up the Character of a King. But there are ſome Perſons, and Faces that carry a great deal more Majeſty in them than others, and on whom a Crown ſits a great deal better. Nature has made no old Man but what carries in his Countenance the Character of his Age: But ſhe has made ſome Venerable and Auguſt, and others Contemptible and Diſtaſtful. There are ſome Perſons whom Anger renders more comely, thô com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly this Paſſion very much disfigures the Countenance.</p>
                  <p>A Painter then in the various Countenances he ſees, being ſtock'd with ſo many different Subjects which may ſerve him as a ground Work to keep up the Characters we have been diſcourſing of; if he is a good Painter, he will not be contented with a Sceptre and a Crown, with Wrinkles and gray Hairs, and with the Features that in general are proper to an incenſed Perſon: But he will ſtudy upon divers Complexions, thoſe that under theſe Characters will be the moſt taking, and will make choice of thoſe whom Nature has made Venerable and Auguſt, and in whom even without a Crown, one may diſcern ſomething of Majeſty and Royalty.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of embelliſhing a <hi>Character,</hi> and that is by deducing the agreeableneſs of it from the very Eſſence and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Character</hi> it ſelf. Anger makes Men look pale or red; it makes them gnaſh their Teeth, fall foul upon every thing they meet with, tear themſelves, and expreſs ſuch Motions and Poſtures, as are ſtrange, terrible, and extravagant. But 'tis not always attended with theſe effects. It has ſome more moderate ones: And 'tis at the Painters choice to make uſe of thoſe which he pleaſes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the more violent Ones, if his deſign requires them not, and to expreſs the moſt moving, the moſt pleaſant, and the leſs irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ones.</p>
                  <p>His liberty is ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs. When he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents one ſingle Perſonage, and invents the Deſign as he pleaſes, then all depends upon him, and if he ſucceeds not, he is to blame. But if one ſhould require a ſtory of him, and determine the perſons for him, then he will be often perplex'd in a great many things by the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53904:115"/>
very Eſſence of his Subject, which permits him not to make uſe of certain Beauties, which would be very advantageous to him. A King preſerves his gravity beſt in a moderate Paſſion, but <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> is not capable of this moderation in the Sacrifice of <hi>Iphigenia.</hi> The Beauty of <hi>Helen</hi> and that of <hi>Paris</hi> would be more conſpicuous by Day-light, than by Torch-light, but yet 'tis neceſſary that this Princeſs ſhould be carry'd off in the Night. <hi>Europa,</hi> ſmiling amidſt the Nymphs and Flowers, would be more comely: But would any one repreſent her ſo when carry'd into the midſt of the Sea upon a Bull. A Painter might come off with ſucceſs in the raviſhing of <hi>Helen,</hi> if one would give him liberty to make choice of a Model; he would likewiſe ſucceed in the portraicture of a perſon, that he draws to the Life, if he invents the Shadows, the Poſture, and the Action thereof: And he would come off but pitifully, were he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to joyn theſe two things together, and to give to <hi>Helen,</hi> when raviſh'd, the Countenance of a perſon, that he had painted with ſucceſs in a contrary Action.</p>
                  <p>The conſtraint is ſtill greater, if one ſhould repreſent ſeveral Actions of one and the ſame Story, and if one ſhould paint the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying off of <hi>Europa</hi> in four Tables. For the ſame Features of one ſingle perſon will ſerve as a foundation of moderate Joy, a dreadful Fright, a mortal Confuſion, and a Miraculous and pleaſant Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                  <p>The great Poems are of this laſt ſort. The ſeveral <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> wherein we ſee the ſame perſon Act, are as ſo many Tables, wherein the ſame <hi>Character</hi> of one ſingle Countenance ought to ſerve as a foundation to the different Characters of oppoſite Paſſions. <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> is repreſented at the Councel Board, in the Fight; and at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Solemnities of his Friend. The Poet has not made his Hero ſage and prudent in This firſt Table; he has not made him proud in the Ceremonies and Religion of the laſt; that ſo he might be leſs angry and paſſionate than in the Battle. This variety of Characters would have made three <hi>Achilles's,</hi> and would have had ſomething of the Ignorance of a Painter, who willing to paint <hi>Achilles</hi> in theſe three different Adventures, would chuſe for his model three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances that had no relation to each other, and would repreſent one of them entire in each Table. But <hi>Homer</hi> at the Councel Board gives <hi>Agamemnon</hi> occaſion to provoke <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is preſently tranſported with anger againſt him, and who begins to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by affronting and venting ſeditious Reproaches againſt him. And in the Funeral of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> the Ceremony that is moſt viſible is the cruelty which <hi>Achilles</hi> ſhews to the body of the Brave and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Hector,</hi> which he ties by the heels to his Chariot, and for twelve Days together inhumanely drags about the Tomb of his Friend. Thus is <hi>Achilles</hi> always the ſame, and is no leſs Cholerick and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful at the Councel Board, and the Funeral Solemnities, than in War and Battle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53904:116"/>
The Poet then, in the Conſtitution of his Fable, ought to mind what he is oblig'd to, and what <hi>Character</hi> it requires: He will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards examine all its Parts, and all the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> it preſents to him. He will ſee which of them he can apply to his <hi>Character,</hi> or to which he can apply it; <note n="†" place="margin">Hoc amet, hoc ſpernat promiſſi carminis autor. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> by this means ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice of thoſe that are for his turn, and rejecting the others, (as <hi>Homer</hi> has done in the Amours of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Briſeis,</hi> with which the very Eſſence of his Fable furniſh'd him.) Thus having entirely diſcover'd all the Lineaments of his Character that are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably annex'd to the very Eſſence of his Fable, and to his Subject, he is oblig'd to keep to them as their proper Form, wherein does eſſentially conſiſt the Reſemblance of his Fable to the probable Action which he would Imitate; let it be in the Perſons, or in the Dignities, or in the Paſſions, or any other things that are capable of a <hi>Character.</hi> This is the firſt thing a Poet is oblig'd to. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is to examine all the other Circumſtances of his <hi>Character,</hi> which the Eſſence of his Fable does not make neceſſary, and which are as the Colours of a more or leſs paleneſs and redneſs, the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof may naturally change. He will diſcover thoſe that are moſt capable of rendring his <hi>Character</hi> pleaſant, and his Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages good, even in a moral Senſe, and he will make uſe of them, and not of the others. 'Tis by this means that without altering the Reſemblance, and the Juſtneſs of the <hi>Character</hi> a good Poet, like a good Painter, will make his Perſonages better, and a ſorry Poet like a ſorry Painter will make them worſe than they are. 'Tis thus that <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf has made his <hi>Achilles</hi> good as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>One may underſtand and interpret the Text of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in a ſenſe different from that which I propos'd in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But it will ſtill ſuit with the Doctrine I have drawn from thence. The other Interpretation is this, <hi>When a Poet imitates a paſſionate Man, or a mild and good humour'd Perſon, or any other Character, he ought rather to propoſe to himſelf Models of Goodneſs, than of Hard-heartedneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the</hi> Characters <hi>of</hi> Achilles, Ulyſſes, <hi>and</hi> Aeneas.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> propoſes <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Achilles</hi> to us, to teach us the way of making the imitated Perſonage like the Original which we propoſe to our ſelves; in ſuch a manner that this <hi>Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,</hi> which may be attended with Deformity and Vice, or Beauty and Virtue, have that which is the moſt perfect of theſe Qualities. We have already taken notice that the <hi>Reſemblance</hi> conſiſts in this Part of the <hi>Character</hi> which is proper and neceſſary to the Fable, and which the Subject obliges indiſpenſably to be obſerv'd; and that the Beauty or the Goodneſs <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks of, and which he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes from the <hi>Reſemblance,</hi> conſiſts in the Circumſtances of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> which are not neceſſarily contain'd in the Eſſence of the Fable. This is what we are more fully to diſcover in the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and his <hi>Iliad,</hi> to which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> refers us, that ſo we may inſtruct our ſelves, where he himſelf learn'd his Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>We have ſufficiently made it appear, that <hi>Achilles</hi> ought to be paſſionate, unjuſt, and inexorable. The Fable neceſſarily requires this; 'tis that renders his Manners <hi>Bad,</hi> and ſo unworthy a Man of Honour. But they have nothing in them that is irregular, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Precepts of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſince he requires Goodneſs only in the Circumſtances, where the Poet is at his liberty, and ſince he blames Vice only when 'tis not neceſſary. So that this is that, which I call Part of the <hi>Character</hi> which renders <hi>Achilles</hi> like to the Idea, which the Poet form'd of him, when he laid down the firſt Model of his Fable.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Fable</hi> leaves the Poet to chuſe the Circumſtances which may either raiſe and embelliſh the <hi>Character,</hi> or render it more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and odious. <hi>Achilles</hi> that is paſſionate, inexorable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, might be likewiſe fearful, and cowardly, and have reveng'd himſelf by betraying his party. He might have given ſome ſecret Intelligence to his Enemies, he might have receiv'd them into his Quarters, or have injur'd his Allies by any other wicked Practices, which might have occaſion'd a great deal of miſchief to have fallen upon the <hi>Greeks, Agamemnon,</hi> and himſelf, and which might have been no hindrance to his Reconciliation. For ſuppoſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> without <hi>Achilles</hi> were ſtronger than the <hi>Trojans,</hi> in this caſe their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage and loſſes would only have happen'd by the Treachery of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53904:117"/>
this Hero. And the Treachery ending with this Reconciliation the Valour of the <hi>Greeks</hi> might have got them the Victory. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would not have been leſs juſt, nor have had leſs of the Moral and Inſtructions than that it at preſent contains.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Eſſence and the Juſtneſs of the Fable leaves the Poet at his full liberty to make choice either of the Valour or the Cowardice of <hi>Achilles,</hi> for to degrade or raiſe his <hi>Character;</hi> and 'tis to this choice, that the Precept of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> refers, when he orders Poets to imitate good Painters, who, always preſerving whatever the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has that is neceſſary or proper to the Subject, raiſe it by all the Embelliſhments 'tis capable of. If <hi>Homer</hi> had choſe to have made his Hero cowardly, rather than Valiant, he would have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> orders here, and elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> Never to repreſent a Perſonage that is wicked without neceſſity forces one to it. But this great Poets practice is not thus. As unjuſt, and as paſſionate as the Anger of his Hero was, and thô 'twas ſo pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his Allies, and to <hi>Patroclus</hi> himſelf yet he has done nothing herein, but what is neceſſary. He has obſerv'd in this <hi>Character</hi> what his Fable indiſpenſibly oblig'd him to. But for as much as it has left him at his liberty therein, he has made uſe of it ſo far to the Advantage of his Hero, that he has almoſt conceal'd his great Vices by the darling ſhow of a miraculous Valour which has deceiv'd ſo many Perſons.</p>
                  <p>This Goodneſs may be likewiſe added to the difference we put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Epick Fable,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> for 'tis neither neceſſary nor congruous in theſe laſt. The Heroes there may be intirely vicious.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſier to diſcover what Goodneſs there is in the <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> ſince the very Eſſence of the Fable requires Goodneſs and Virtue: But yet 'tis ſtill neceſſary to know the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Poets in the <hi>Characters</hi> they have given them.</p>
                  <p>The Fable of the <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> is all for the conduct of a State, and for Policy. Therefore the Quality it requires is <hi>Prudence;</hi> but this Virtue is of too large an extent for the ſimplicity which a juſt and preciſe <hi>Character</hi> requires; it is requiſite it ſhould be limited. The great Art of Kings is the Myſtery of <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> 'Tis well known that <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh for the Inſtruction of his Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd all the <hi>Latin Language</hi> to theſe words only, <hi>viz. Qui neſcit diſſimulare neſcit regnare.</hi> 'Twas likewiſe by this practice that <hi>Saul</hi> began his Reign, when he was elected, and then full of the Spirit of God. The firſt thing we read of him in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ is. <note n="*" place="margin">Ille vero diſſimulabat ſe audire. <hi>Reg. lib.</hi> 1,</note> that he made as if he did not hear the words, which ſeditious People ſpoke againſt him.</p>
                  <p>This then is the <hi>Character</hi> which the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet gives his <hi>

The Fable of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is quite different from the two <hi>Greek</hi> ones. The Poets deſign was to introduce among the <hi>Romans</hi> a new ſort of Government, and a new Maſter. 'Twas requiſite then that this new Maſter ſhould have all the Qualities, which the Founder of a State ought to have, and all the Virtues which make a Prince belov'd.</p>
                  <p>Diſſimulation is a wrong Method. We bear but little love to a Man we diſtruſt, and thoſe who love <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> love him only after they had had a long Experience of his Goodneſs, and of the good will his Father bore towards them. But the Hero of <hi>Virgil</hi> had only new Subjects as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> has, and by the way, I ſhall here ſay, that the Latin Poet was more ſtraitned in this than <hi>Homer,</hi> and that he was like to thoſe Painters, who ought to ſuit their Stories to the Model of a countenance we have preſcrib'd them. <hi>Aeneas</hi> then ought only to give his Subjects ſigns of ſincerity and frankneſs. He could not have the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles.</hi> Then violences of <hi>Achilles</hi> were entirely oppoſite to the deſign of the <hi>Aeneid;</hi> and the Poet has judiciouſly aſſign'd them to <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Mezentius,</hi> which he oppoſes to his Hero. He was therefore oblig'd to a <hi>Character</hi> that is oppoſite to that, as we have often and often ſaid.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> is the inexorable Anger of a revengeful, unjuſt, and valiant Prince; That of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is the wiſe, and prudent diſſimulation of a valiant King, whoſe Conſtancy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſhock. And that of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is a mild, and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Piety, upheld as the two others by a valour and an unſhaken Courage.</p>

                  <p>ALL the perſons in a Picture do not appear in an equal Degree. The principal Perſonage muſt always appear above all the reſt and be view'd at his full Length, as far as Art and Perſpective will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Some others appear almoſt as much. There are others that are half hid, or which appear more or leſs, and there are ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe which ſerve only to repreſent a great number of perſons, whoſe extream Parts are the only things we can diſtinguiſh, and which ſhew that there is ſome body there. Laſtly, ſome are very near and are ſeen diſtinctly, and others are at ſuch a diſtance as confounds the Features, and the very members themſelves, and gives them rather the colour of the Air than their own proper Hue. As for thoſe that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53904:118"/>
are near, a conſiderable part whereof we ſee, 'tis neceſſary that they ſhould wear either in their Countenance, or their Poſture the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> that is proper to them, and make it appear what Intereſt they have in the Action which is repreſented. As for the reſt the leſs is ſeen of them, the leſs is one likewiſe oblig'd to make them known.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is juſt the ſame in the <hi>Epopéa.</hi> The Poet leaves the greateſt part of his Actors in obſcurity, and at a diſtance, but beſide his Hero, to whom he has a particular regard, there are likewiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, whoſe Character muſt be ſet off in a greater or leſs light, according to the Intereſt he makes them have, following in this the Rules which we have apply'd to the Hero. We will take notice of the Differences by what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dido</hi> is the chief Perſonage which the Poet preſents us with, and the moſt conſiderable in the firſt Part of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> ſince 'tis ſhe that makes the Intrigue or Plot thereof. She is the Foundreſs of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as <hi>Aeneas</hi> is the Founder of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhe repreſents the obſtacle which this Republick laid in the way of the <hi>Roman</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which were to raiſe that State to be Miſtreſs of the World. So then, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> bore the Character of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo ſhould <hi>Dido</hi> of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Therefore ſhe is Paſſionate, Bold, Daring, Ambitious, Violent, Perfidious: And all theſe Qualities are carry'd on by a Craftineſs which is the very Soul and <hi>Character</hi> of her. 'Tis by her Craftineſs that ſhe ſucceeded ſo well in her great Undertakings, in revenging her Husband, puniſhing her Brother, and deceiving of King <hi>Iarbas.</hi> 'Tis by theſe very wiles ſhe would ſtop <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Journey, and being not able to compaſs that, deceives her very Siſter who was her only Confident.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Character</hi> is vicious and odious. <hi>Virgil</hi> was oblig'd to it by the very nature of his Fable. But in the Liberty it has given him, he has taken care according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Maxim, to give this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter all the ſoftneſs that is proper to his Subject; and to raiſe it by all the Beauties he found it capable of receiving. <hi>Dido</hi> does not make uſe of the wickedneſs of her temper, but only to ſtay <hi>Aeneas</hi> at <hi>Carthage:</hi> She is inclin'd thereto by the violence of a Paſſion that renders this Action leſs odious, and which puts the Readers upon la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and pitying the Torments ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures, and the <note n="†" place="margin">Quin morere ut merita cs. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> Death ſhe condemn'd her ſelf to. Elſewhere he makes her Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her craftineſs only upon Noble, Lawful, and glorious Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <note n="*" place="margin">Sunt hic ſua praemia lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di. <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> He gives her Qualities truly Royal. She is Magnificent, Courteous, and has a great eſteem for Virtue. All this is to be obſerv'd in that obliging way whereby ſhe entertain'd the <hi>Trojans</hi> before ever ſhe had ſeen <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:53904:119"/>
In the ſecond Part of the Poem there are a great many more intereſted perſons than in the firſt. <hi>Latinus</hi> is a very good and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, but old and without Sons. This gives the Queen an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſobeying his orders, and <hi>Turnus</hi> a deſire of being his Son-in-Law in ſpite of him, and of forcing the good old Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim War againſt <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and of making uſe of his Subjects, his Arms, and his Authority. This default of Authority is natural and ordinary among Kings that have no Heirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amata</hi> pretends to have a kind of Right of diſpoſing of her Daughter. She is ſtrangely affected for her Kinſman <hi>Turnus.</hi> She was ſo obſtinately bent upon having him for her Son-in-Law, that ſhe had rather die than change her Reſolution. This obſtinacy of the Woman put her upon taking all manner of Shapes, keeps up her Anger and her Violence, and is the principal <hi>Character</hi> the Poet gives her.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Turnus</hi> is the ſame with that of <note n="†" place="margin">Alius Latio jam partus Achilles. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Achilles</hi> as far as the alteration of the Deſign, and the Difference of the Fable, would admit. 'Tis a young Man, furious, and paſſionate for a Damſel that a Rival would rob him of. <note n="*" place="margin">Arma amens fremit, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma thoro tectiſque requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Saevit amor ferri, &amp; ſcelerata inſania belli. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 7.</note> His mind is all upon Arms and War without troubling his head whether it be juſt, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the want of Juſtice, and the contrary order of the Gods make it criminal and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He ſuffers himſelf to be tranſported with Anger, the moſt prevailing of all his Paſſions. This is the firſt Idea our Poet gives of him and which he always keeps up very carefully. He is leſs of a Soldier, and more of a General than <hi>Achilles.</hi> But this General in Office ſometimes forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to act the part of a private Soldier. <note n="†" place="margin">Et ſi continuo victorem ea cura ſubiſſer, Rumpere clauſtra manu, ſocioſque immittere portis: Ultimus ille dies bello gentique fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſet. Sed furor ardentem caediſque inſana cupido E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git in adverſos. <hi>Aen.</hi> 9.</note> Had it not been for this, he might have put an end to the War the very ſecond Day, when breaking into the Entrenchments of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> which he beſieg'd, his fury made him forget to keep the paſſage open for his own Men, as he might eaſily have done. So far is it true that Anger is his principal <hi>Character.</hi> He was ſo full of the Idea of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and ſo far maſter of his Spirit, that he brags of being like him. <note n="*" place="margin">Hic etiam inventum Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amo narrabis Achillem. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neid.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he to <hi>Pandarus,</hi> when he kill'd him, <hi>Go tell</hi> Priam <hi>thou haſt met with a ſecond</hi> Achilles <hi>here.</hi> The Poet makes uſe of theſe artifices to ſhew the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what ſort of humour <hi>Turnus</hi> was of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Character</hi> of this Hero has likewiſe this injuſtice of <hi>Achilles,</hi> in that, from his own particular Quarrel he raiſes a general War, renders his Anger pernicious to both Parties, and more to his own
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53904:119"/>
than to that of the Enemy, and expoſes ſo many thouſand Innocents for his ſingle Intereſt. The blackneſs of this <hi>Character</hi> is ſhaded, as the vices of <hi>Achilles,</hi> by the Luſtre of a wonderful courage.</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice without ſpeaking of the other Perſonages, one may apply to them whatever we have ſaid here concerning the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and the <hi>Character.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. What the <hi>Character</hi> is.</head>
                  <p>FRom what has been ſaid we may infer, that in the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> the <hi>Character</hi> is not properly any particular Vertue or Quality, but a compoſition of ſeveral, which are mix'd together in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degree with the Ornaments and Beauty 'tis capable of obſerving, the neceſſity of the Fable, and the unity of the Action.</p>
                  <p>All the Qualities that go toward the making this compoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be all of the ſame claſs, nor be equal among themſelves. Becauſe one carrying the Hero upon one Encounter, and another upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Encounter, the <hi>Character</hi> will ſeem varied, and the Poem as well as the Hero will look like a Body animated with ſeveral Souls. 'Tis requiſite then there ſhould be one commanding Quality to Rule the reſt, and be the Soul of them, and that this appear throughout. After the ſame manner as a Hero being painted in divers Fables ought to be diſcern'd in all, and to have the ſame Features in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, let his Poſtures and his Paſſions be never ſo different. This commanding Quality in <hi>Achilles</hi> is his <hi>Anger,</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> the <hi>Art of Diſſimulation,</hi> and in <hi>Aeneas Meekneſs.</hi> Each of theſe may by way of Eminence be ſtyl'd <hi>the Character</hi> in theſe Heroes.</p>
                  <p>But theſe <hi>Characters</hi> cannot be alone. 'Tis abſolutely neceſſary that ſome other ſhould give them a luſtre and embelliſh them, as far as they are capable: Either by hiding the defects that are therein by ſome noble and ſhining Qualities, as the Poet has done the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> by ſhading it with an extraordinary Valour; or making them entirely of the nature of a true and ſolid Vertue, as is to be obſerv'd in the two others. The <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is a part of his prudence, and the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is wholly employ'd in ſubmitting the will of this Hero to the Gods. For the making up this Union our Poets have joyn'd together ſuch Qualities as are by nature the moſt compatible. <hi>Valour</hi> with <hi>Anger, Piety</hi> with <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> with <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> This laſt Union was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Goodneſs of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> for without that his <hi>Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> might have degenerated into wickedneſs and knavery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:53904:120"/>
Beſides, the Fable requir'd Prudence in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and Piety in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> as we before obſerv'd. In this the Poets were not left to their choice. But <hi>Homer</hi> might have made <hi>Achilles</hi> not valiant. The Cowardice of this Hero would have abated nothing of the juſtneſs of his Fable. So that 'tis the neceſſity he lay under of adorning his Character, and of not making <hi>Achilles</hi> vicious, where there was no need for it, that oblig'd him to give him the Title of <hi>Valiant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Valour then as well as the Prudence, and the Piety in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Poems, which are the ſecondary Qualities we have been ſpeaking of make up the Goodneſs of each Hero, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this ſame Goodneſs to the whole Poem. But if on the one hand, this ſecondary Quality is an ornament to the firſt, on the other it receives ſuch a determination from it, as makes its extent leſs, but withall more juſt; a Hero may be endu'd with a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, generous, and <hi>Roman</hi> Valour, which is ready to pardon injuries upon ſubmiſſion. Such is the Valour of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> He may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be endued with a Cholerick, Cruel, Brutiſh, and Inexorable Valour which never pardons, and had rather its Vengeance ſhould fall upon its Friends, than ſpare one ſingle Enemy, and this is the Valour and <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſhould we conſider theſe two Qualities a-part, for to know which of them deſerves chiefly to be ſtyl'd the <hi>Character,</hi> we ſhall preſently exclude Valour, ſince 'tis neither eſſential to the Fable, nor does <hi>Achilles</hi> make any ſhew of it, but keeps it without Action for above half the Poem: Nor laſtly does the Poet ſing it. But he ſings the <hi>Anger,</hi> and this Anger is neceſſary to the Fable, at leaſt it is predominant as much during the abſence of <hi>Achilles,</hi> as when he is reunited to the <hi>Grecians</hi> and fights in Perſon. So Prudence is not the principal part of the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> ſince the Poet does not ſing a prudent Man, but a Man that changes himſelf into all ſorts of forms. We may likewiſe ſay, that the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> is his chief Quality, thô the word <hi>Pius</hi> which the Poet makes uſe of, ſignifies equally <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe two Qualities muſt a third be joyned to ſupport them, and carry on the <hi>Character</hi> with greater force. A Prince will be to no purpoſe good and pious, or prudent and diſſembling, if he is not Valiant and Brave: He will meet with many invincible Difficulties. Without Valour <hi>Aeneas</hi> would have been routed by <hi>Turnus,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> would have fainted under a hundred hardſhips. <hi>Valour</hi> then is neceſſary to produce great Deſigns, and to put them in Execution. But there is no need to dwell longer on this Subject. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof are very clear.</p>
                  <p>We conclude then, that the <hi>Character</hi> of the Hero in the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> is compounded of three ſorts of Qualities. Thoſe of the firſt ſort are neceſſary and eſſential to the Fable. That of the ſecond are the Ornaments of it. Valour which ſupports both makes the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53904:120"/>
third ſort. The firſt, which is the Principal, muſt be ſome Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Quality, ſuch as ſhould be met with in all ſorts of Occaſions, and Encounters, and ſuch as ſhould make the Hero known through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Character</hi> of the other Perſonages there is likewiſe ſome Compoſition, for one ſingle Quality can never exactly diſtinguiſh one Perſon from others, unleſs it be determin'd by ſome other that may render it proper and ſingular. But 'tis not neceſſary that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or any other Noble Inclination, ſhould be admitted into theſe leſſer <hi>Characters.</hi> I ſee nothing that's Noble or Good in <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, Amata,</hi> or in that number of dull Souls in the <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> and without mentioning theſe laſt, or <hi>Drances</hi> in whom the Poets have not expreſs'd the leaſt Valour. The Women that are introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Poems, do manifeſtly exclude the neceſſity of this Warlike Quality.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> It ſeems indeed, as if the <hi>Character</hi> were as much the Life and Soul of the Hero, and the whole Action, as the Fable is of the Poem, and conſequently it ſeems to require as exact an <hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Character,</hi> and that 'tis more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over neceſſary, that the ſame Spirit appear in all ſorts of Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whether ſimilar, contrary, or others.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Aeneas</hi> for inſtance, acting with a great deal of Piety and Mildneſs in the firſt part of his Poem, which requires no other <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>

and afterwards making a great ſhew of an Heroical Valour in the Wars of the ſecond part, but without any appearance either of a hard or a ſoft Diſpoſition, would doubtleſs be far from offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt what we have laid down about the <hi>Equality</hi> of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> But yet there would be no <hi>Simplicity</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in this <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> So that beſides the <hi>Qualities,</hi> that claim their particular place upon different occaſions, there muſt be one appearing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Commands over all the reſt. Without this we may affirm 'tis no <hi>Character.</hi> And this is what would be that Poet's Fate, that would give his Hero the <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the <hi>Valour</hi> of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> without reflecting on the mild Temper of the one, or the hard Nature of the other.</p>
                  <p>Or to ſpeak more properly, this Poet could by no means give his Hero the Qualities of the two other Hero's. There is a great deal of difference between a Face in General, and the Face of <hi>Aeneas</hi> in Particular, between a Fore-head, a Noſe, a Mouth, and an Eye in General, and the Fore head, Eyes, Noſe, and Mouth of <hi>Achilles.</hi> There is likewiſe a great deal of difference between <hi>Valour</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the <hi>Valour</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and between <hi>Piety</hi> in General, and the <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> This is evident from the Thoughts and the Practice of the <hi>Latin Poet.</hi> Had he taken <hi>Achilles</hi> for a Model of Valour, and had he thought that <hi>Homer</hi> had carry'd this Quality to the higheſt pitch, it could go, certainly he would have made his <hi>Aeneas</hi> a great deal more like the <hi>Greek Hero,</hi> than he has <hi>Tarnus,</hi> ſince he makes him a great deal more Valiant than <hi>Turnus,</hi> and he would never have fail'd giving this Idea to his Readers, and telling them, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> is another <hi>Achilles.</hi> How comes it to paſs that he never does this? And on the contrary, gives this Quality to <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſeveral times: 'Tis doubtleſs becauſe he ſaw well enough, that 'tis by the <hi>Character</hi> one Man reſembles another, and that <hi>Valour</hi> in General is not the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles:</hi> That to be more Valiant as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or leſs Valiant as <hi>Turnus,</hi> 'tis not requir'd that one ſhould have more or leſs of the <hi>Character</hi> of this <hi>Grecian Hero:</hi> But that one ſhall reſemble him the more, the more one is endu'd with a Cholerick, Violent, and unjuſt Valour, as <hi>Turnus</hi> was, and that on the contrary, one ſhall have a <hi>Character</hi> oppoſite to that of <hi>Achilles,</hi> tho' one be never ſo Valiant, when one is Reaſonable, Mild, and Moderate.</p>
                  <p>One may then make a Hero as <hi>Valiant</hi> as <hi>Achilles,</hi> as <hi>Pious</hi> as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and if one pleaſe, as <hi>Prudent</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> But 'tis a meer Chimaera to imagine a Hero that has the <hi>Valour</hi> of <hi>Achilles,</hi> the <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the <hi>Prudence</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> at one and the ſame time. This Viſion might happen to an Author who would ſuit the <hi>Character</hi> of a Hero to whatever each part of the Action does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally require, without regarding the Eſſence of the Fable, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Character</hi> in the ſame Perſon upon all ſorts of occaſions.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53904:121"/>
This Hero would be the mildeſt, beſt natur'd Prince in the World, and the moſt Cholerick, hard Hearted, and Implacable Creature imaginable, contrary to <hi>Horace</hi>'s Prohibition in the Caſe. He would be extreamly tender as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> extreamly violent as <hi>Achilles,</hi> and would have the Indifference of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> that is uncapable of the two extreams; 'twould be in vain for the Poet to call this Perſonage by the ſame Name throughout. The Hero of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> would not be the Hero of the <hi>Field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But can there be no Moderation nor Accommodation made by giving a Hero as much Valour, Prudence, and Piety, as an honeſt Man is capable of, and by retrenching from each of theſe Qualities, whatever it has defective, and contrary to the two others? To judge how far this practice is allowable, we need only reflect on the effects it would produce in ſeveral Poems, whoſe Authors were of the mind that the chief <hi>Character</hi> of any Hero, is that of an honeſt Man. They would be alike in all theſe pieces, we ſhould ſee them all Valiant in Battel, Prudent in Counſel, Pious in the Acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Courteous, Civil, Magnificent, and laſtly, endu'd with all the prodigious Vertues, the beſt Poet could invent. All this would be independant from the Action, and the Subject of the Poem. And upon ſeeing each Hero ſeparated from the reſt of the Work, we ſhould not eaſily gueſs to what Action, and to what Poem the Hero does belong. So that we ſhould ſee that none of theſe would have a <hi>Character,</hi> ſince the <hi>Character</hi> is that which makes a Perſon diſcernable, and which diſtinguiſhes it from all others.</p>
                  <p>Nor would this falſe <hi>Reſemblance</hi> be only among the Hero's, but likewiſe among the other Perſonages, which one were willing to repreſent as honeſt Men. They would not differ from the Hero himſelf, but as <hi>Plus</hi> and <hi>Minus.</hi> He would be a more Honeſt, more Valiant, and more Prudent Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> furniſh us with quite different Examples. <hi>Achilles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> have nothing in common, and differ as much among themſelves as the three Poems, and the three Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which they are the Hero's. They have each of them a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> which admirably diſtinguiſhes them from others, and whoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> is ſo exact, and ſo uniform, as to make them appear the ſame upon all occaſions. <hi>Homer</hi> has ſo prepar'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that 'twas eaſie for him to preſerve this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in the principal parts. <hi>Virgil</hi> has done the contrary. His firſt part is like the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> whoſe <hi>Character</hi> is Coolneſs, Diſimulation, and Prudence. The ſecond is like the <hi>Iliad,</hi> full of the Horrors of War, which naturally draw along with them Anger and Cruelty, and yet he has made Mildneſs and the ſofteſt Paſſions predominant in both parts. <hi>Aeneas</hi> is as Meek and Pious when he kills <hi>Lauſus</hi> in the heat of Battel, as he is in the Sports and the Peaceable and Religious Combats, which he Celebrated in Honour of his Father <hi>Anchiſer.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Character</hi> in the Poem, 'tis requiſite, that theſe oppoſite <hi>Characters</hi> ſhould centre in the <hi>Character</hi> of the Hero, and ſo ſubmit thereto, that <hi>It</hi> alone ſhould be predominant in both the Parties, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Iliad</hi> makes <hi>Anger</hi> to be the Commanding Paſſion as well in the City of <hi>Troy,</hi> as in the <hi>Grecian Camp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Poets have not been ſo circumſpect. We ſee <hi>Claudian's</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius is not rais'd to this Juſtneſs and Accurateneſs, nor has he made ſo exact proportions. The furious and terrible <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Pluto</hi> and the <hi>Furies,</hi> and all the Horror of Hell it ſelf is preſently Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphos'd into the <hi>Character</hi> and the Pleaſure of the <hi>Graces,</hi> the Goddeſſes, the gilt Palaces, and the Flowery Meads. All this Joy does again give way to the Sorrows, and Complaints of a Mother for the loſs of a Daughter. This Author has no Idea of his whole Work. When he Compoſes one part of it, he never thinks on any thing elſe. He has begun with the Infernal Deities, and in all this beginning, one can ſee nothing but the Furies they are capable of. Afterwards he ſpeaks of the Viſit which <hi>Venus, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> make to young <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> and this is wholly taken up with Joys and Pleaſures. Laſtly, he deſcribes the fear and ſorrow of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and then he thinks on no other Paſſion, and he ſuits himſelf ſo well to each thing he Treats on, independantly from the reſt of the Poem, that in his three Books he has as many different, principal, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Characters</hi> as there are in the threeſcore Books of our three Poems. There we ſee Anger, Diſſimulation, and Meekneſs reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them apart and ſingly in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſeis,</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53904:122"/>
in the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> And in the three Books of the <hi>Rape</hi> of <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> we meet with Terror, Joy, and Sadneſs. This is an inſtance of an Error that corrupts the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Character in the Poem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Practice of our Poets is quite otherwiſe. They alter not the Soul when they form different Members to the ſame Body. They know that the Eye, which is the moſt delicate part, and the Hand, which is the moſt laborious and hardy, have yet the ſame Spirit in the ſame Perſon. So that they mind leſs the particular incidents of their Action, and the Humour of each Perſonage, than they do the general <hi>Character of the Fable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, <hi>Virgil</hi> lays no conſtraint upon the <hi>Character</hi> of the Hero which ought to be predominant throughout. He gives it a full and entire Liberty, and on the contrary, he moderates the reſt, and claps a Print upon them to hold them in, either by ſome Paſſion or by ſome dependance, the perſons that have them, are in to ſome Body elſe. <hi>Aeneas</hi> is abſolute Maſter of his Actions, he has none that he is oblig'd to accommodate himſelf to upon what occaſion ſoever. Nor is this peculiar to the <hi>Latin Poet;</hi> he imitates therein the <hi>Greek Poet,</hi> whoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> is as independant as <hi>Aeneas. Achilles</hi> has a General over him, but this General is only as the Chief among equal Princes. <hi>Achilles</hi> then is not his Subject, and take him from the Seige of <hi>Troy,</hi> he has no Orders to receive from him. Beſides, expecting no favour or good will from him, and being Cholerick and Unjuſt, he has no Obedience to pay him, nor meaſures to take to pleaſe him, and he thinks he has ſufficient grounds to withdraw his Obedience from him. Nay, when he is reconcil'd to him, and enters again upon his Duty, yet he receives no Orders from him; on the contrary, without conſulting with this General, or any other of the Confederate Princes, he on his own Head makes a Truce with his Enemies in behalf of them all. 'Tis therefore a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice in <hi>Homer,</hi> when he makes <hi>Achilles</hi> the moſt Valiant of the Confederates, but withall Unjuſt, and without Intereſt, and on the contrary, makes <hi>Agamemnon</hi> the General, very much Intereſted for the Honour of his Brother <hi>Menelaus</hi> and his own. This is what reſpects the Hero.</p>
                  <p>As for the other Perſonages, <hi>Homer</hi> has made the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Character</hi> eaſie, by giving Violence and Anger to the greateſt part of the Commanders on both ſides. The <hi>Latin Poet</hi> is harder put to it, becauſe he has made the Enemies of his Hero to have hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that are contrary to that of his Hero, but withal, he has annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them ſuch Paſſions and Dependances that are no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turnus</hi> has in truth no dependance on King <hi>Latinus,</hi> either as his Subject or his Ally. This old Prince is neither his King, nor his General. He depends upon him after another way, as the Courtier of <hi>Lavinia</hi> his Daughter and ſole Heireſs. For under this preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53904:123"/>
he dares not diſoblige a Prince, that owes him nothing, and from whom he would obtain ſo much. He is therefore oblig'd in many reſpects to ſubmit to him, and to take ſuch meaſures as take off much of his fierceneſs and paſſion. Beſides this, he ſees the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Rival, to whom he is oblig'd to yield the Glory of Arms in the judgment of <hi>Latinus</hi> and <hi>Amata</hi> her ſelf; he ſees the ill ſucceſs of all his deſigns, the death of thoſe he put moſt confidence in, <hi>Mezentius, Camilla,</hi> &amp;c. he ſees the <hi>Latins</hi> decreaſe, and hears the Reproaches they caſt upon him. All this muſt needs cauſe ſtrange Impreſſions on the mind of this <hi>Latin Achilles;</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from carrying on his <hi>Character</hi> ſo far as the <hi>Grecian</hi> did his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mezentius</hi> has a leſs part in the Poem than <hi>Turnus.</hi> But he is too conſiderable to admit of his furious and cruel <hi>Character</hi> in all its force. The Poet makes this prophane perſon much in love with his Son, as he was a deſpiſer of the Gods. He ſo luckily makes uſe of this natural Paſſion, that it renders his tenderneſs conſpicuous, and makes the Character of <hi>Aeneas</hi> Conqueror over the fury of this <hi>Barbarian.</hi> His deſign in renewing the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was only to rejoin his Son. <note n="*" place="margin">Nec tecum meus haec pepigit mihi foedera Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Unum hoc per, ſiqua eſt victis venia hoſtibus, oro; Corpus humo patiare regi. Scio acerba meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Circunſtare odia: hunc (oro) defende furorem. Et me conſortem nati comede ſepulcro. <hi>Aen.</hi> 10.</note> The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his Paternal Love forces him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech <hi>Aeneas</hi> to favour him ſo far, as to let him be buried in the ſame Grave with his Son, and he dies full of the tender and ſad Idea he had of his dear <hi>Lauſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſame Artifice does likewiſe change the violences of <hi>Dido</hi> into a more moderate <hi>Character</hi> by theſe two ways. The firſt is, the inability wherein the Queen is plac'd, <note n="*" place="margin">Non potui abreptum divellere corpus &amp; undis Spargere? Non ſocios, non ipſum abſumere ferro Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canium? patriiſque epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landum apponere menſis. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>What, Can't I,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>tear his Body in pieces, and ſcatter his mangled Limbs in the Sea? O! that I could but cut the Throats of his Comrades, butcher his dear</hi> Aſcanius, <hi>and ſerve him up in a Banquet to his Father,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the wildeſt exceſſes of a moſt violent and terrible fury. But ſhe is in ſuch circumſtances, that the Reader is not afraid any ill effects will follow. He is not concern'd for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> ſince they are no longer within her reach, and he only pities this poor Princeſs, from whoſe Mouth her misfortunes had forc'd this Language. <note n="*" place="margin">Improbe amor, quid non mortalia pectora cogis? Ire iterum in lacrymas, iterum tentare precando Cogitur, &amp; ſupplex ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos ſubmittere amori. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> The other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is the Love of this ſame Queen which in the midſt of her Rage and fury tames her, and forces her to melt into tears, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon her ſelf to the tenderneſs of her Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:53904:123"/>
Another Method <hi>Virgil</hi> makes uſe of, is to interrupt the fights by calm and tender <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> which make the <hi>Character</hi> of the Hero ſtill predominant. Thus the aſſault made upon the Camp of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the fury of <hi>Turnus,</hi> is moderated by the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Remulus</hi> which is diverting: by that of the Ships chang'd into <hi>Nymphs</hi> which is admirable, and by that of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus</hi> which is ſoft and moving—We may reduce all that has been ſaid of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Character</hi> to theſe few Heads.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and the Foundation of all the reſt, is to give the Hero a preciſe and ſenſible Character, which may appear in all ſorts of Encounters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Hero muſt be independent, and left at full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to carry on his Character and Humour in all the force and extent it is capable of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Poet may beſtow this very <hi>Character</hi> on the other Perſonages that are moſt apparent and active, whether they be on the Hero's ſide, or on the contrary Party, or whether they be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons. This is the practice of <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, When there is given to theſe other Perſonages ſome <hi>Character</hi> or other that is oppoſite to that of the Hero, it muſt not be carry'd on in all its force. And as this Moderation cannot proceed naturally from Perſons themſelves, it is produc'd either by ſome Paſſion, or by ſome Dependance, as we have ſeen in <hi>Dido, Mezentius</hi> and <hi>Turnus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fifth way, is to interrupt the particular Actions which of themſelves require an oppoſite <hi>Character</hi> by ſuch <hi>Epiſodes</hi> as are ſuitable to the general <hi>Character.</hi> Thus the Death of <hi>Lauſus</hi> cauſes pity and tenderneſs to bear ſway amidſt the Furies of War, and has the ſame Effects which the <hi>Epiſode</hi> of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus</hi> has. To theſe five ways we might likewiſe join the Thoughts, Figures, and Expreſſions of which we ſhall ſpeak in the laſt Book of this Treatiſe.</p>

Wherein for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample conſiſts a ſolid Piety without Preciſeneſs, Grimace, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm; and without a certain turbulency of Spirit, that is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and of an ill conſequence: how far one may extend ones Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without being Prodigal: and how a Man ſhould manage his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, without being either too Liberal or too Sparing.</p>
                  <p>To this we likewiſe refer the Knowledge we ought to have of the Habits or Qualities in general, ſuch as they ſay are abſtracted and ſeparated from the particular Subjects, as alſo of the Qualities, that are particulariz'd by the Subjects wherein they are, for we ſhould rightly diſtinguiſh Valour in general from the Valour of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and not confound <hi>that</hi> with the Valour of <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What we ſay here, is not with a deſign to exclude out of a Poem, whatever <hi>Morality</hi> condemns. A Poet ſhould never ſet bad Examples, but there's a great deal of difference between a bad Example, and the Example of a bad Action or a bad Perſon. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> never intended to propoſe bad Examples to their Children, when, to deter them from Drunkenneſs, they expos'd to their view, Slaves that they had made down-right drunk. It is therefore lawful for the Poet to make uſe of <hi>Achilles's</hi> and <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius's,</hi> as well as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes's</hi> and <hi>Aeneas's.</hi> He may repreſent Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and Avarice, as well as Liberality and the wiſe Oeconomy of a good Husband, and an honeſt Trades-Man. But whatever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, whether for Vertue, Vice, or any indifferent Quality, he muſt at leaſt be ſenſible of what he does, not only becauſe 'twould be a diſgrace for him to be Ignorant in the caſe, but becauſe this Knowledge puts him upon acting with a great deal more exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſo important, that without theſe notices, he is in danger too often of ſetting very bad Examples, and of offending againſt that which is eſſential to every Art, which is to be profitable, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular againſt the nature of the Fable and the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> whoſe only
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53904:124"/>
deſign is to lay down Inſtructions of Vertue. If then a Poet knows not what a ſolid and true Piety is, and how far it may extend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceſs, he will introduce a Perſonage that will paſs for a very good Man, he will give him ſuch Vertues and Qualities as are dazling and lovely, he will create for him the good Will and Eſteem of all his Auditors, and after he has Arm'd him with ſo dangerous an Authority, he will put him upon venting gravely and in quaint Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſuch Maxims as are falſe, but fair and plauſible in all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, and with a turn that ſhall bewitch Mens Minds. Thus <hi>Aeneas</hi> would have been a very bad Example, if being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſo Prudent and Honeſt a Man, he ſhould prefer the Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Love of <hi>Dido</hi> before the Orders of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Or if being perſecuted by <hi>Juno,</hi> he had ſlighted this Goddeſs as if 'twere allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be leſs ſubmiſſive to God under the Croſſes that befall us, than when every thing happens as we would have it. Or laſtly if this ſame Hero relying on the Credit of the Oracles, which could not deceive him, had ſpared himſelf the Travels and Dangers he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, as if the Favours and Promiſes of God who loves us, ſhould make us more lazy and negligent. <hi>Virgil</hi> commits none of theſe faults. His Conduct teaches us, That the Promiſes of God, tho' infallible, ſhould yet ſerve only to put us upon endeavouring more ardently and faithfully to merit the Effects of them. And in this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he ſets between <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> he likewiſe gives us this admirable Leſſon: That when God ſeems to declare himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, we ſhould only contend againſt him with our Prayers, our Vows, our Oblations, our Submiſſion, and that theſe are the only Weapons by which he ſuffers himſelf to be Conquer'd.</p>
                  <p>But the Poet does not ſet any bad Example, when he ſhews in <hi>Mezentius</hi> Sentiments, that are contrary to theſe Maxims. We are neither ſurpriz'd, nor offended that this Man, whom we know for an Impious Perſon, ſeeing his Affairs ſucceed ſo ill, ſhould contemn the Gods, acknowledge no other but his own Arm and Javelin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Son <hi>Lauſus</hi> to all the Gods, which others ador'd, and make an Idol of him who is both the Object of his Vows, and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee he would adorn with the Spoils of the Vanquiſh'd <hi>Aeneas.</hi> No body would live according to theſe Maxims, but ſuch as would be deliberately Impious, Barbarous, and an Odium to the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to cure this ſtrange Diſtemper of the Mind, the Poet preſents us with the miſerable end of this Atheiſt, whom the Death of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> diſheartens and oppreſſes with very ſenſible pains, raiſing in him a ſenſe of all the Miſeries to which he was reduc'd, which his Brutality and the hopes he had of being re-eſtabliſh'd, would not let him ſee till then.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Vices and Vertues, one is in danger of offending in the wrong uſe of ſome middle Quality, and the danger will be greater, and the Error more conſiderable, if this Quality make a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53904:125"/>
great ſhew and noiſe, ſuch as <hi>Valour</hi> in War. That of <hi>Achilles</hi> is Vicious, and yet it ſo dazled the Eyes of Young <hi>Alexander,</hi> that that to partake of that falſe Glory which he admires in this Hero, he has committed in cold Blood a more unworthy Brutality, than that to which the Anger and Revenge of <hi>Achilles</hi> carry'd him, when he drags the Body of <hi>Hector</hi> round <hi>Troy, Hector</hi> was dead, and <note n="*" place="margin">Q. <hi>Curtius.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> drags the live Governor of a Town he had won.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe, without minding what is Good and Vicious in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, one may be deceiv'd in not rightly diſtinguiſhing what is ſolid in it, from what is only glazing. The Age in which we begin to judge of theſe Characters, commonly caſts us into this Error, and into that we mention'd before: Youth always faſtens upon the very firſt appearances, and never penetrates as far as to the ſolidity of a thing, and when we are once prepoſeſs'd, 'tis a hundred to one, that we ever get perfectly free from our Prejudices. One muſt be very fortunate, or have a clear Intellect and exact Judgment, and more than that, a curioſity and deſire to be acquainted with that which perhaps one does not judge important enough to deſerve a long and ſerious Study. Very often likewiſe the Cuſtoms of the Countrey, and Education, produce theſe bad effects upon the Mind, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in this Ignorance, and in ſuch Judgments as are very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to Vertue. If we ſee Duels fought upon every ſlight Offence, we ſhall imagine that a Man has no Valour, if he puts up an Affront without fighting, and he will meet with too many of his Friends who will prompt him to this ſort of Revenge as Criminal as it is. This is what a Perſon would never do, who, according to the Precepts of <note n="*" place="margin">Qui didicit patriae quid debeat &amp; quid amicis.</note> 
                     <hi>Horace,</hi> had learnt the Duty of a faithful Friend and a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And a Poet would never put this Maxim into the Practice, or Mouth of a Perſonage, he has a Mind to repreſent as a Man of Honour.</p>
                  <p>But to return to what we were ſaying about the diſtinction that ought to be made between the Luſtre and the Solidity of Valour; we will make this one Remark, that ſeems to me very important: 'tis this, That theſe two things are oft times oppoſite in the Eſſence of the <hi>Character.</hi> Violent and Tranſporting <hi>Characters</hi> give a great deal more Luſtre to the Actions they animate, and to the Perſons that have them; and on the contrary, the moſt Mild and Moderate, are often without any Luſtre and Glory, yet theſe laſt are a great deal more proper to Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I inſiſt too much on this Subject, but 'tis of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in General, and in the Inſtance I propos'd juſt now of a Warlike Valour, ſince this Quality is moſt uſual in all <hi>Epopéas,</hi> and the moſt capable of dazling both the Poets and the Readers. I will therefore explain this Inſtance by the Valour that is in the <hi>Aeneid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:53904:125"/>
How many are there, that put a higher value on the Warlike Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and I will add even on thoſe of <hi>Turnus,</hi> than on thoſe of <hi>Aeneas?</hi> Yet <hi>Achilles</hi> is but a Souldier, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. How then comes it to paſs that they judge thus? Unleſs 'tis becauſe they take the Noiſe, the Show, and the Tranſports of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Man for true Valour.</p>
                  <p>If after the ſame manner we compare <hi>Turnus</hi> with <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Pious Hero will doubtleſs ſeem inferior to his Rival. But whoever will ſit down here, and will take the conſequences and the ordinary attendance of a Quality for the Quality it ſelf, he will fall into the ſame impertinence as <hi>Numanus,</hi> who in reproach to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> ſays, they deſerve not the Name of Souldiers, and that they had no more courage than Women, becauſe their way of dreſs is gaudy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate. This is doubtleſs for want of being well acquainted with the Vertues of War, and what the exact <hi>Character</hi> of a Valiant Man is.</p>
                  <p>Valour is the fineſt Ornament of the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and one might add, that 'tis all the goodneſs that is in it; and this quality in <hi>Aeneas</hi> gives place to ſeveral others and principally to his <hi>Piety.</hi> Therefore <hi>Piety</hi> is the thing that ſhould be conſpicuous in <hi>Aeneas,</hi> his Valour ſhould appear much leſs, and on the other Hand Valour ſhould be very illuſtrious and very ſhining in the perſon of <hi>Turnus:</hi> So that he ſhould be as much in love with War, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> is in love with, and deſirous of Peace. Whatever <hi>Turnus</hi> does in the Battels, or in preparing for them, is uſually done with Deſign, with Pleaſure, and with Diſcourſes that are Magnificent, very Pompous, and Cogent. <hi>Aeneas</hi> commonly acts without Noiſe and Affectation, he ſpeaks little, and if he falls into a Paſſion, 'tis not ſo much to fight, as becauſe he is forc'd to fight and defend himſelf; 'tis not ſo much to Conquer, as to put an end to the War.</p>
                  <p>But if the Luſtre and the dazling ſhow make the Valour of <hi>Turnus</hi> more conſpicuous than that of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet the Actions ſhew that in truth and reality, the Valour of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is infinitely Superiour to that of <hi>Turnus.</hi> We need only conſider them without this Luſtre, and without this outward appearance, which a bold Bragadocio and a raſh young Man may have as well as the trueſt Bravo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turnus,</hi> during the abſence of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> aſſaults his Camp, being deſign'd, prepar'd and arm'd with Malice, and in three or four days he could not force it. He breaks in by a paſſage his Bravery had opened for him, he is conſtrain'd to break out again, and at laſt, after an Engagement of two days, he is Routed and Vanquiſh'd by <hi>Aeneas</hi> with a bloody Slaughter. <hi>Aeneas</hi> on the other Hand in the ſight of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and in view of an Army of Enemies, aſſaults an ancient Town well built, and well fortified, and in a few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Maſter of its Rampants and Towers. He is not forc'd thence by his Enemies, <note n="*" place="margin">At Pius Aeneas audito nomine Turni deſerit &amp; muros, &amp; ſummas deſetis arcos. <hi>Aen.</hi> 12.</note> but
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53904:126"/>
he comes down to make an end of the War by the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> whom he forces to a Battel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pallas</hi> is conquer'd and kill'd by <hi>Turnus,</hi> and <hi>Lauſus</hi> by <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Theſe young Princes were equal in Valour, but there is a great deal of difference between the Bravery of their Conquerors. <hi>Turnus</hi> ſeeks this Battle; <note n="*" place="margin">Solus ego in Pallanta feror, ſoli mihi Pallas De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur; cuperem ipſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens ſpectator adeſſet. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 10.</note> he makes his Boaſts and Brags of it, and inſults over this young Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who never fought a Battle before. He wiſhes <hi>Evander</hi> were preſent, he would butcher the Son before his Father's Face. This is the Valour of another <hi>Achilles.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Quo moriture tuis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joraque viribus audes? Fallit te incautum pietas tua. Nec minus ille Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultat demens. Saevae jam<expan>

                     <hi>Aeneas</hi> is far from engaging with <hi>Lauſus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Manner, who expoſes himſelf for his Father's ſake. He on the contrary would ſave his Life, he drives him off, threatens him, and becomes terrible and furious only, becauſe he was forc'd to kill him. This is an Anger worthy of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the exact Character of an Hero more valiant than <hi>Turnus,</hi> but withal more pious than valiant. The extream danger wherein he was, being aſſaulted not only by <hi>Lauſus,</hi> but by a great many others at the ſame time, does not yet hinder him from taking notice of that Affection which this Enemy (who deſign'd his Death) had for his Father. Certainly it muſt needs argue greater Valour and Bravery to ſpare an Enemy at ſuch a time, than <hi>Turnus</hi> ever made appear in any of his Actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus</hi> do the ſame Action of Generoſity in returning the Bodies of theſe two Princes. But <hi>Turnus</hi> with his uſual Noiſe and Show inſults over <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Evander,</hi> and ſeems as if he ſent back the Body of the Son to his Unfortunate Father, only to increaſe his ſorrow. <note n="*" place="margin">Qualem meruit Pallanta remitto.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſend him back his</hi> Pallas (ſays he) <hi>juſt ſuch a one as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to ſee him.</hi> This is a very cruel generoſity, and very becoming an <hi>Achilles.</hi> That of <hi>Aeneas</hi> is all vertuous all ſincere. <hi>Turnus</hi> inſults o'er <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſets his foot upon him, ſtrips him of part of his Armour, and decks himſelf with it: <note n="*" place="margin">Ingemuit miſerans dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramque tetendit, &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem patriae ſubiit pietatis imago. Quid tibi nunc, miſerande puer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Aeneas</hi> laments the Death of <hi>Lauſus,</hi> makes his Elegy, lifts him from the ground himſelf; takes him between his Arms, and reprimands the <hi>Tyrrhens</hi> for being ſo backward in carrying off their Prince.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee then how in the diſtribution of the Valour, <hi>Virgil</hi> gives <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Turnus,</hi> he allows the laſt all that this Quality has of Beauty and ſplendor in appearance: and how in giving to <hi>Aeneas</hi> that which was without all diſpute greater and more real, he is ſatisfied with the ſolid part of it, and makes what is glaring
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53904:126"/>
and dazling in it to give place to the ſweet temper and the Piety of his Hero. Becauſe Piety makes up the goodneſs of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s <hi>Character,</hi> as valour makes up all that <hi>Turnus</hi> has of good in his <hi>Character.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatever we diſcommend here in the <hi>Character</hi> of this laſt Hero, yet 'tis only an Evil in Morality, which does not make it the leſs good in a Poetical Senſe. Theſe Reflections are not deſigned to baniſh it out of Poems, but ſo to diſtinguiſh Vertue from Vice, that a Poet may know what he does, when he gives his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage the one or the other; and that a Reader may judge of it without being miſtaken. That he confound not what a Quality (ſuch as Valour for Inſtance) has of glaring, with what it has of ſolidity. That he ſuffer not himſelf to be dazled with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of <hi>Turnus,</hi> as if <hi>Aeneas</hi> were not in truth a great deal more valiant than he: And that he imagine not that any Man of Honour is capable of the generoſity, and the War-like Vertues which <hi>Virgil</hi> beſtows upon <hi>Turnus,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> upon his <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it at all neceſſary to carry the <hi>Character</hi> of an exact and Vertuous Hero, as far as <hi>Virgil</hi> has done that of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours he uſes to avoid killing <hi>Lauſus,</hi> the ſorrow he ſhews for it, the praiſes he beſtows upon him, and the reſt that we have taken notice of, exceeds the <hi>Character</hi> of a ſimple generoſity, and is the Effect of that <hi>Piety,</hi> which is predominant in <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and in the whole Poem. And it may be ſo contriv'd that theſe things, thus carried on, would not only, not be a perfection in a Man of Honour of another Poem, but alſo ſpoil the juſtneſs of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> So great a difference is there between <hi>Generoſity</hi> in general, the <hi>Generoſity</hi> of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and the Generoſity of every other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon.</p>

not ſimple and imaginary Fictions, but juſt imitations of ſuch things as really are or may be.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, I affirm that a <hi>Character</hi> is <hi>falſe,</hi> when an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſo feigns it, that one can ſee nothing like it in the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein he deſigns it ſhall ſtand.

They are by ſo much the more offenſive to them, by how much the Poet ſeems to ſlight them, and to take them for ſilly perſons on whom he may impoſe what he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>The deſire of amplifying, and making every thing that's ſaid, look great, and marvellous, caſts young Poets into this Error, and all others who are not indued with a juſtneſs of Mind, and are not rightly informed. The Enthuſiaſtick Genius of <hi>Statius</hi> will afford us ſome inſtances of this bad conduct.</p>
                  <p>He would beſtow the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Achilles</hi> upon <hi>Tydeus,</hi> and inſpire him with his Paſſions, and his Anger ſuſtained by his Valour. <note n="*" place="margin">Atque illum effracti per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſum tabe cerebri A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicit &amp; vivo ſcelerantem ſanguine fauces.

He did not think he ſhould make him valiant enough, if he let him looſe to five or ſix Men only. He muſt needs make him kill fifty of them. This exceſs is ſo much the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſince we know that it coſt the Poet nothing.

The Gods of this Poet do not take theſe for extravagancies. <note n="*" place="margin">Ingemuit dictis ſuperûm dolor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> They are really af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them, and dread this Man alone more than all Mankind together. They betake themſelves to <hi>Jupiter.

To conclude, the calamity is Univerſal, and to the diſgrace of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> (before whom they ſeem to prefer <hi>Capaneus)</hi> the admiration they conceived for this great Hero and ſtruck them dumb, and made them fear this Sovereign of the Gods had not a ſhaft ſufficient to conquer this ſingle Man. The Poet himſelf gives us to underſtand, that their fear was not altogether groundleſs. For after <hi>Jupiter</hi> had ſhot his Thunder againſt him, with all his force, and had ſhatter'd to Duſt the Armour <hi>Capaneus</hi> wore, this Bravo had ſtill power left him to ſtand upon his Feet ſo long, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> thought he muſt ſhoot another Bolt at him.</p>
                  <p>One would fanſie the fear is now over: But ſo great a Poet is not contented with ſo little. <hi>Cataneus</hi> during his life made only the <hi>Thebans</hi> tremble and fly; and now at his Death, when he was deſtroyed by Thunder, he fills his own Men with conſternation, and puts both Parties to flight, becauſe they knew not on which ſide he would fall, nor whoſe Troops he would cruſh into pieces thereby.</p>
                  <p>This is an Inſtance of theſe <hi>falſe Characters,</hi> wherein Men fall for want of Judgment and Knowledge.

                  <p>IN the former Book concerning the <hi>Manners,</hi> we diſcourſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Terreſtrial,</hi> and <hi>Mortal</hi> Perſons, and in this, under the name of <hi>Machines,</hi> we ſhall treat concerning the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> perſons: So that this will be nothing elſe but a Conſequence of what has been ſaid about the <hi>Manners</hi> and the Perſons; ſince the <hi>Gods</hi> as well as Men are Actors in the <hi>Epopéa.</hi> We ſhew'd the Neceſſity of this in our firſt. <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> Book, where we likewiſe took notice that all theſe Divine Perſonages are <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We obſerved that there are three ſorts of them. Some are <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical,</hi> and were invented to explain the Nature of God: Others are <hi>Phyſical,</hi> and they repreſent Natural things: The laſt are <hi>Moral,</hi> and they are the Repreſentations of Vertues and Vices.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53904:129"/>
Theſe three ſorts of <hi>Divinities</hi> or <hi>Allegories,</hi> are ſometimes to be met with in one and the ſame perſon. Now for Inſtances of each, and firſt we will begin with the <hi>Theological.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Convention of the Gods, by which <hi>Virgil</hi> opens his tenth Book, <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Venus,</hi> and (we might add) <hi>Fate,</hi> are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages of the firſt ſort; that is, ſuch as repreſent the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> divided into four Perſons, as into ſo many Attributes. <note n="*" place="margin">Hominum Divûmque aeterna poteſtas.</note> 
                     <hi>Jupiter</hi> is the <hi>Power</hi> of God, <hi>Fate</hi> is his abſolute <hi>Will.</hi> to which his very <hi>Power</hi> ſubmits; becauſe God never acts contrary to his <hi>Will.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Fata viam invenient, Rex Jupiter omnibus idem.</note> 
                     <hi>Fate</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determines <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who of himſelf is indifferent, and might as well act in behalf of <hi>Turnus,</hi> as in favour of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his party. <hi>Venus</hi> is the <hi>Divine Mercy,</hi> and that Love which God bears towards Vertuous Men; by which he is induced, never to forget them in the miſeries they endure upon Earth, but to help them out of 'em, and finally to Reward them. Laſtly, <hi>Juno</hi> is his Juſtice: This puniſhes even the leaſt offences; ſpares not even the very beſt of Men, who not being wholly Innocent, are puniſhed ſeverely for their defaults in this Life, where the Juſtice and the Temporal Wrath of God is often declar'd againſt them, and ſo perſecutes them, that there might be nothing left in them but what was Vertuous, Meritorious, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Reward. This Reward is reſerved for them in Heaven, where this Vindictive Juſtice has nothing to do, and from whence it cannot exclude them, as <note n="*" place="margin">Indigetem Aeneam ſcis ipſa, &amp; ſcire fateris Deleri coelo.</note> 
                     <hi>Jupiter</hi> tells <hi>Juno,</hi> when he mention'd <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Poet ſuits himſelf to our groſs way of conceiving Divine things; and to the Infirmity of our Minds, which makes us look upon theſe Qualities in God as oppoſite to one another. <note n="*" place="margin">Nulla eſt regio Teucris quam det tua Conjux Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</note> 
                     <hi>Mercy</hi> upbraids <hi>Juſtice</hi> of its ſeverity, that it is never ſatisfied let Good Men ſuffer never ſo much, and that it never allows them any Repoſe here on Earth: whilſt <hi>Juſtice</hi> on the other hand, accuſes Goodneſs and <hi>Mercy</hi> of its being the Cauſe of all the Sins that are Committed, becauſe it ſhelters Criminals, and puts them in hopes of going off unpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Deities</hi> of the ſecond ſort, that are purely <hi>Phyſical,</hi> are employ'd in the firſt Book in raiſing the ſtorm againſt <hi>Aeneas. Aeolus</hi> is the Power of Nature, which gathers together about Hills and in their Caverns, the Vapours and Exhalations, whence Winds are form'd: And having digeſted theſe Matters to a certain degree of Heat and Dryneſs, puts them upon thoſe Motions and Agitations which we call the <hi>Winds.</hi> 'Tis thus that <hi>Aeolus</hi> is their Maſter.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53904:129"/>
Theſe Vapours and Exhalations ariſe in the Air, which is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Juno:</hi> 'Tis therefore to this Goddeſs that the God of the Winds is beholden for his heavenly Chear. There's no need of taking Notice what is meant by the perſons of <hi>Eurus</hi> and <hi>Zephyrus,</hi> nor that of <hi>Neptune,</hi> who ſpeaks to them.</p>
                  <p>We have one inſtance of the <hi>Moral Deities</hi> in the Engagement of <hi>Turnus</hi> with <hi>Aeneas.</hi> The <hi>Furies</hi> which <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſends againſt <hi>Turnus,</hi> are nothing elſe but the Reproaches of his Conſcience, which ſhew him his Crimes and Impiety: King <hi>Latinus</hi> foretold him of this at the very beginning of the War, giving him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that if he was ſo inſolent as to deſpiſe the Gods, when 'twas at his choice not to oppoſe their Orders, he would at laſt be oblig'd, when too late, to one that he had offended, and they were Powerful. The <hi>Roman Orator</hi> plainly confirms the truth of this Interpretation. <note n="*" place="margin">Nolite putare ut in ſcena videtis, homines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceleratos impulſu Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum terreri, furiarum taedis ardentibus ſua quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fraus, ſuum Scelus, ſua audacia de ſanitate &amp; mente deturbat. Hae ſunt impiorum furiae, hae flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae, hae faces.</note> 
                     <hi>Never think</hi> (ſays he in his Speech before the Senate againſt <hi>Piſo) never think, Gentlemen, that thé Gods ſend the</hi> Furies <hi>with their burning Torches to frighten Criminals, as Poets upon the Theatre repreſent them. No: The Injuſtice, the Villainy, and the Crimes of each Miſcreant, are his Tormenters. Theſe are the Furies, the Fires, and the Flames, that make them faint away, and fill them with ſuch Horrour and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 'Tis thus that <hi>Turnus</hi> is repreſented in his laſt Battle. <note n="†" place="margin">Dii me terrent, &amp; Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hoſtis. Nec ſe cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novit euntem: Scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque in pectore Dirae. <hi>Statius.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Statius</hi> has likewiſe in few Words very well expreſſed the Nature of theſe diſmal <hi>Deities:</hi> Which are no where but within our own breaſts, there tormenting us by the view of the Crimes we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>There are two things obſervable in the Practice of <hi>Virgil</hi> that confirm this Doctrine. The firſt is, that theſe <hi>Furies</hi> are never ſent but againſt ſuch as merit them: They are the only perſons that are terrified by them. The ſecond thing is, that thoſe to whom they are ſent, muſt neceſſarily own there is ſuch a Being as a God, that takes Vengeance upon the Criminal: For Atheiſts, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no God, are not liable to the Checks of Conſcience; nor are they uſed to be troubled at the Offences they commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Deity; nor can they be ſuppoſed to be daunted with the apprehenſion of another Life. So that the <hi>Furies</hi> have nothing to do with them. This is the Reaſon why the Poet employs none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mezentius,</hi> although much more Criminal than <hi>Turnus.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of the <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HOMER and the Ancient Poets have beſtowed upon their Gods the <hi>Manners,</hi> the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and the <hi>Vices of Men;</hi> and ſome are bold to add, that they have given them ſuch <hi>Manners</hi> as turn them into meer Swine. But if we would interpret what they have ſaid about them, according to the Diviſion I have propoſed, and by the <hi>Allegories</hi> that are neceſſarily to be underſtood of them, we ſhall ſee that theſe Reproaches have often more of ſhew than ſolidity in them.</p>
                  <p>Tis true, the Learned men of Antiquity have went upon wrong grounds in a thing of the higheſt importance, when their Writings have been ſuch, that ordinary Capacities or Men of a ſhallow Reach, that is almoſt all Men, have not been able to break the Shell, and look through the Veil, with which they have covered the Truth; and they have been miſerably abuſed in taking the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, and deformed and dangerous Figures for neceſſary and ſolid Truths. Whether it proceeded from Pride, Envy, Error, or a bad Conduct, 'tis doubtleſs a great Fault, and ſuch as we can by no means excuſe. But in our deſign, we may omit, and paſs over ſuch Interpretations as a Poet is not obliged to give in his Verſes, and we may only conſider the Poems, as Works and Inſtructions that ſhould be all <hi>Allegorical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe, 'tis much eaſier to defend than accuſe <hi>Homer;</hi> and more juſt to praiſe than blame him. One can find no fault with him for having made mention of many Gods, nor for his beſtowing Paſſions on them, as we hinted in ſpeaking of <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> He might likewiſe bring them in fighting againſt Men. For have we not examples of theſe Expreſſions and Figures in <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> and the true Religion? And if 'tis ſometimes allowable to ſpeak thus of the Gods in <hi>Theology,</hi> there is a great deal more Reaſon for doing ſo in the Fictions of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Philoſophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When in theſe two ſorts of Learning we deſcribe the Nature of things; 'tis as eaſie to deſcribe their Defects, as the contrary. It would argue a Man's being a Novice in Poetry, and that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but little of the way of Expreſſion is this ſort of Writing, did he imagine, when he ſees the Name of a God or Goddeſs, that he muſt needs meet with nothing, but what is fine, good, and commendable in theſe Perſonages. As if <hi>Virgil</hi> could not have ſaid of <hi>Fame,</hi> that ſhe is a very foul-mouth'd Goddeſs; nor of <hi>Sleep,</hi> that this God was ill-natur'd, when he deceiv'd good <hi>Palinurus,</hi> and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53904:130"/>
tumbled him over-board. 'Tis no more a Soleciſm to ſpeak thus in Verſe, than 'tis to ſay in Proſe, that <hi>Fame</hi> publiſhes very ſhameful things; and that <hi>Palinurus</hi> was aſleep and fell over-board.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true we meet with more offenſive Paſſages, ſuch as the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the <hi>Odyſſeïs.</hi> But beſide, the <hi>Phyſical</hi> and <hi>Moral Allegories,</hi> which may in ſome ſort excuſe theſe too bold Figures, to ſay no worſe of them; and beſides, that we meet with ſomething very like it, written in the ſimplicity of theſe Ancient times by Authors, which we cannot condemn, I add further, that though there were no <hi>Allegory,</hi> yet <hi>Homer</hi> is not leſs excuſable. And to make this out, 'tis to be conſider'd, that 'tis neither the Poet, nor his Hero, nor any other perſon of Probity that makes this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital: but the <hi>Phaeacans,</hi> a Soft, Effeminate People, ſing it amidſt their Feſtival. Now 'tis always allowable in a Poem, and in other grave and Moral writings, to introduce. Vicious perſons, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Gods, profane ſacred things, and ſeek in that which is moſt Holy for excuſes and examples to countenance their diſorders. <hi>Homer</hi> then by the example of theſe idle People, who could do nothing but Sing, Dance, Eat and Drink, gives us this Leſſon, <q>That theſe ſoft and lazy Exerciſes are the ſource of all Vicious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and that the perſons, who live thus are uſually pleaſed to hear theſe ſhameful Tales, and to make the Gods themſelves partners in their Goatiſhneſs.</q> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi> learned this Maxim by theſe Words of <hi>Homer,</hi> as well as by the diſorders of his times; when he ſays, <hi>That a Girl that learns to Dance betimes, learns betimes likewiſe to play the Whore.</hi> So likewiſe, we may ſuppoſe that <hi>Horace</hi> ſays of this Place of the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> as much as of any other, that this Poem is an excellent piece of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> whereby we may learn to be Men of Vertue and Probity, and to avoid all that is baſe and vicious. From whence we may conclude, that the Recital of <hi>Homer</hi> we are ſpeaking of, is not ſo much a pernicious Example of Adultery and Impiety, as 'tis a very uſeful Leſſon, which he gives to thoſe that would live well; namely, <hi>That if they would not be guilty of theſe Crimes, they muſt fly the Arts and Methods that lead thither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in ſhort, a Poet had need be very cautious of medling with ſuch dangerous Incidents as theſe are, if he would not do more hurt than good by his Poems. He ſhould ſtudy the Wants, the Intereſt, the Humour of his Auditors, and the Effects which ſuch Subjects may have upon their Minds. And to ſpeak truth, we live no longer in an Age wherein ſimplicity might render ſuch a ſubject tolerable among honeſt Men: And wherein one might propoſe it without corrupting the better part of the Audience, and without countenancing that Corruption and Vice which the reſt are but too much inclined to. So that how Judicious or excuſeable ſoever <hi>Homer</hi> has been in this Invention; yet a Poet now-a-days would
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53904:131"/>
be neither Judicious nor Excuſable, if he ſhould venture to Imitate him therein. It is good to teach what he taught: But 'tis very bad teaching it his way.</p>
                  <p>However things are, yet this is a particular Caſe, which ſhould not hinder us from concluding, That <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> do no more belong to the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Poetical Gods,</hi> than to the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Poet ſpeaks of the <hi>Gods</hi> in <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> he will give them ſuch <hi>Manners,</hi> Speeches and Actions, as are conformable to the Nature of the things they would repreſent under theſe Divine Perſons. He will ſay, that the God of <hi>Sleep</hi> is Good, Bad, True, a Cheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe we have pleaſant Dreams, and we have offenſive ones, ſometimes they inſtruct us, ſometimes deceive us, very often are vain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The caſe is the ſame in <hi>Moral Deities. Minerva</hi> is Wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe repreſents <hi>Prudence. Venus</hi> is both Good and Bad, becauſe the Paſſion we enjoy under her Name is capable of theſe two oppoſite Qualities.</p>
                  <p>Theology likewiſe has its Variety. The moſt ſound part of it ſhould ſay nothing of the Gods but what is good: <note n="*" place="margin">Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me; neque in ira tua corripias me. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.</note> But it may likewiſe attribute ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſions to them, ſuch as Anger, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Sorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not that they have any ſuch in reality, but only in condeſcenſion and after the language of Men they are ſaid to have ſuch, as we hinted before in ſpeaking of <hi>Virgil's Juno</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> But there are ſeveral Sects, and a Poet ſhould take care who thoſe are that he brings in ſpeaking. For an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> for inſtance, cannot give any Paſſion to the Gods. His <hi>Theology</hi> teaches him that they enjoy a perfect Repoſe, and do not ſo much as concern themſelves with any of the Affairs of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>We might likewiſe add that the Paſſions and the Vices of each perſon form to him his particular <hi>Theology.</hi> The debauch'd <hi>Pagans</hi> thought the Gods could not be happy without enjoying the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Senſe. And they charg'd upon them their Laſciviouſneſs, as we before obſerv'd in the Example of the <hi>Phaeacans.</hi> There are others who think there is no God at all: Or at leaſt would perſwade themſelves that he does not regard us. <hi>Virgil</hi> has given us an Inſtance of this deplorable change in the perſon of <hi>Dido.</hi> This Princeſs at firſt entertains <hi>Aeneas</hi> with Vows and Prayers which ſhe puts up to the Gods with a ſincere Piety. Becauſe then ſhe was Innocent and at Quiet. She begins to love <hi>Aeneas</hi> contrary to the Vow ſhe had made to the <hi>Manes</hi> of her firſt Husband; which to her was a kind of Deity. She begins at the ſame time to ſuppoſe that theſe <note n="*" place="margin">Id cinerem, aut Manes credis curare ſepultos?

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53904:131"/>
her, and lay no Obligation upon her to keep her Vow. Laſt of all, being more corrupted, ſhe becomes guilty of Impiety againſt the Gods: And ſeeing that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was about to leave her by their Order, ſhe would perſwade him, that they are Ignorant of what is done here on Earth. Not that ſhe was really and abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of ſo impious a Maxim: The Poet was too judicious to make ſo great and ſo ſtrange an alteration in the <hi>Manners</hi> of this Queen, in ſo ſhort a time. 'Tis her Paſſion that makes her ſpeak thus. But ſtill 'tis true to affirm that theſe Words are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely jargon in her Mouth, but have ſome foundation in her Heart. This therefore is a Beginning of Impiety, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happens to thoſe, whoſe Vices and Paſſions are Violent, and which at laſt leads them into downright Atheiſm. Atheiſts ſpeak neither well nor ill of the Gods. They deſpiſe this belief, and laugh at thoſe who adore and worſhip them. Such a one is <hi>Virgil's Mezentius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that we have ſaid here concerning the <hi>Manners of the Gods,</hi> ought to be applied to that which we have ſaid concerning the <hi>Morals</hi> or <hi>Manners of Men.</hi> The <hi>Manners</hi> of the Gods are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the four Qualifications which we have given to the Others. They may be <hi>Poetically Good,</hi> ſince they may appear in the Speeches and Actions of the Divine Perſons we introduce. They will be <hi>ſuitable,</hi> if we give to theſe perſons ſuch <hi>Manners,</hi> as the Nature of the things we repreſent require: And if, as we make a King Magnificent and Jealous of his Authority, ſo we make <hi>Fame</hi> to be a lying and malignant Goddeſs. They will be <hi>Likely,</hi> if we ſpeak of <hi>Venus, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. Conformable to that which is reported of them in <hi>Fable,</hi> and which the firſt Poets have invented about them. And they will be <hi>Even</hi> or <hi>Equal,</hi> if in a long ſeries we ſee the ſame <hi>Character</hi> maintain'd.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. How the Gods act in a <hi>Poem.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SINCE among the Gods, there are ſome <hi>Good,</hi> ſome <hi>Bad,</hi> and ſome between both; and ſince of our very Paſſions we may make ſo many <hi>Allegorical Deities:</hi> To the Gods one may attribute all the Good or; Ill that is done in a Poem. But theſe Deities do not always act, after the ſame manner. Sometimes they act inviſibly, and by meer Inſpirations; and this has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous. This is no more than what we ſay every day, <hi>That God has aſſiſted us upon ſuch or ſuch an Occaſion, or that the Devil has inſpir'd a bad Action into this or that Man.</hi> 'Tis thus that <note n="*" place="margin">Juno virés animumque miniſtrat. <hi>Aen.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Juno</hi> helps <hi>Turnus</hi> in the Ninth Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> when he was engaged in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Camp; and thus <note n="†" place="margin">Hic mentem Aeneae genitrix pulcherrima miſit, Iret ut ad muros. <hi>Aen.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Venus</hi> in the Twelfth Book inſpires <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and puts him upon Aſſaulting the Town of the <hi>Latins,</hi> that ſo <hi>Turnus</hi> might be forced to the Combat, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly avoided. The Poet may make the <hi>Gods</hi> act thus, even among Atheiſts: For though theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious wretches acknowledge no God, yet they cannot withdraw themſelves from his Power. He diſpoſes of them as he thinks fit, and without their perceiving it, can turn their thoughts and deſigns as he pleaſes. This is <hi>Virgil</hi>'s practice in the perſon of <hi>Mezentius.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">At Jovis interea moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Mezentius ardens Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit pugnae. <hi>Aen.</hi> 10.</note> 'Tis <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who, minded at laſt to puniſh him for all his Crimes, engages him in a fight with <hi>Aeneas.</hi> To this way of the <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Acting</hi> we might likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that which they inſenſibly contributed to an Action, for which they are thank'd. The God <hi>Mars</hi> does not appear at all in the fight of the Tenth Book of the <hi>Aeneid:</hi> Yet <hi>Aeneas</hi> owns he was obliged to him therein: <note n="†" place="margin">Tibi magne Trophaeum Bellipotens. <hi>Aen.</hi> 11.</note> And to him dedicates the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy which he raiſed of the Arms of <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> Theſe Divine Actions are ſimple and deſerve not the Name of <hi>Machine.</hi> And they are ſuch as are allowable in the moſt exact <hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Comedies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other way whereby the Gods Act is altogether Miraculous and Extraordinary; and this, whether they preſent themſelves
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53904:132"/>
Viſibly, and make themſelves known to Men, as when <note n="*" place="margin">Ipſe Deum manifeſto in lumine vidi Intrantera muros, vocemque his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus haufi.</note> 
                     <hi>Mercury</hi> diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Aeneas</hi> in the Fourth Book: Or whether they diſguiſe themſelves under ſome human Shape, without making themſelves known, as when <note n="†" place="margin">Inſcia Dido, Infideat quantus miſerae Deus. <hi>Aen.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Cupid</hi> under the Form of <hi>Aſcanius</hi> makes <hi>Dido</hi> ſenſible of his Power, who Careſſes him without knowing who he is; or whether without any viſible Appearance, they make us only ſenſible of their Power by ſome Miraculous Action, as <hi>Venus</hi> in the Twelfth Book, when ſhe cures the wound of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Neque te Aenea, mea dextera ſervat: Major agit Deus. <hi>Aen.</hi> 12.</note> The Phyſician, who had it in hand acknowledges that the Cure is all Divine, and that he has no ſhare in it. The <hi>Machines</hi> that are Prohibited in <hi>Dramatick Poems</hi> are of this ſecond ſort: No body cares for ſeeing Gods or Miracles upon the Stage.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe a third way that has ſomething of both the other; 'tis indeed a <hi>Miracle,</hi> but yet has very frequently been refer'd to that way whereby the Gods act, which we mentioned firſt. This third comprehends the <hi>Oracles, Dreams,</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Inſpirations. Virgil</hi> in his Third Book has inſtances of all this. <hi>Apollo</hi> utters an <hi>Oracle,</hi> the <hi>Gods</hi> interpret it to <hi>Aeneas</hi> in a <hi>Dream</hi> and the Divine <hi>Helenus</hi> informs him Poetically of very many things. The Speech of <hi>Sibyl</hi> to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and all that ſhe diſcovers to him of the <hi>Infernal Shades,</hi> and of his Poſterity, is likewiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but one of theſe <hi>Demi-Machines.</hi> We might to theſe add the <hi>Hell</hi> of the <hi>Odyſſeïs:</hi> which conſiſts in nothing elſe but the Conjuring up the Ghoſt of <hi>Tireſias,</hi> and of ſeveral others that were his Attendants.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Ways muſt be probable: And though the Probability in <hi>Machines</hi> is of a very large Extent, ſince 'tis founded upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, yet it is not without ſome Limitations. We may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the <hi>Epopéa</hi> thoſe that <hi>Horace</hi> preſcribed to the <hi>Theatre.</hi> He propoſes three ſorts of <hi>Machines.</hi> The firſt is of thoſe which we can, not only believe, but alſo endure the ſight of: Such is a God preſent and viſibly converſing with the Actors. <note n="*" place="margin">Nec Deus interſit, niſs dignus vindice nodus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderit. <hi>Hor. Poet.</hi>
                     </note> He does not abſolutely forbid this; but he admits it only in a Plot that requires an Actor of this Importance. <note n="†" place="margin">Aut in avem Progne vertatur, Cadmus in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guem.</note> The ſecond ſort comprehends ſuch <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> as are more incredible and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: Such as the <hi>Metamorphoſis of Progne</hi> into a Swallow, and of <hi>Cadmus</hi> into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. <note n="‡" place="margin">Non tamen intus Digna geri, promes in ſtenain, multaque tolles Ex oculis, quae mox nartet facundia praeſns. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> He does not wholly condemn this <hi>Machine,</hi> nor exclude it from the Poem;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53904:133"/>
but he baniſhes it the Stage, and the ſight of the Spectators. <note n="*" place="margin">Quodcunque oſtendis mihi, ſic incredulus odi.</note> Theſe ſights, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thus, are odious; becauſe a Man can never be perſwaded, that he ſees ſo ſtrange a <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> So that, 'tis only allow'd to make a Recital of it. <note n="†" place="margin">Nec quodcunque volet poſcat ſibi fabula credi: Neu pranſae Lamiae vivum puerum extrahat alvo. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> The third ſort of <hi>Machines</hi> is altogether Abſurd. <hi>Horace</hi> rejects it entirely. The Inſtance he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes is of a Child drawn alive out of the Bowels of a Monſter that had devour'd it.</p>
                  <p>This third ſort is likewiſe to be baniſh'd the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> ſince there is no Recital that can make the Auditors believe it. The two others are equally allowable, and without the Diſtinction which <hi>Horace</hi> makes, which is only of Uſe for the <hi>Theatre:</hi> Becauſe, 'tis only in <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poems, that there is any difference to be made between that which is acted upon the Stage in view of the Audience, and that which is done behind the Scenes, which afterwards is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. Our two Poets have inſtances of theſe two ſorts of Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Probable <hi>Machines.</hi> All ſorts of Deities ſpeak often in the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> and are no leſs the Perſonages thereof than Men are, among whom they are often mix'd. Therein are likewiſe rehearſed ſeveral <hi>Metamorphoſes,</hi> as that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi>'s Fleet into a Rock, and that of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Fleet into as many Nymphs as there were Ships.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true theſe <hi>Metamorphoſes</hi> are very rare, becauſe they are a great deal leſs Credible than the reſt. This ſhews that one muſt ſuit one's ſelf to the Guſt of the Audience in this ſort of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. That which was allowable in the Ages <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> liv'd in may be leſs regular in other times.</p>
                  <p>This puts me upon making a Reflection on the Method of making uſe of thoſe <hi>Machines</hi> probably, that are not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Probable enough. The <hi>Machines</hi> which only require Divine Probability (as that for inſtance which we have been diſcourſing of) ſhould be ſo diſengaged from the Action of the Poem, that one may ſubſtract them from it, without deſtroying the Action. But thoſe that are neceſſary, and which make the Eſſential parts of it, ſhould be grounded upon human Probability, and not on the ſole Power of God. Now the <hi>Epiſodes</hi> of <hi>Circe,</hi> the <hi>Syrens, Polypheme,</hi> and the like are neceſſary to the Action of the <hi>Odyſſeïs,</hi> and yet they are not humanly Probable. <hi>Homer</hi> artificially brings them under the <hi>Human Probability,</hi> by the ſimplicity of thoſe before whom he cauſes theſe fabulous Recitals to be made. He ſays very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>That the</hi> Phaeacans <hi>liv'd in an Iſland at diſtance from thoſe Countries where men of a Genius dwelt. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> knew them before he made himſelf known to them; and having obſerv'd that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53904:133"/>
they were ſimple and credulous, and that they had all the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe lazy People, that admire nothing ſo much as to hear of Romantick Adventures: He pleaſed them by theſe Recitals that are ſuited to their own humour. But even here the Poet is not unmindful of his more underſtanding Readers. He has in theſe Fables given them all the Pleaſure that can be reap'd from <hi>Moral Truths,</hi> ſo pleaſantly diſguiſed under theſe Miraculous <hi>Allegories.</hi> 'Tis by this Means that he has reduced theſe <hi>Machines</hi> to Truth and a Poetical Probability.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> likewiſe relates ſomes of theſe Fables. He does not allow himſelf the ſame Pretence; he has others to fly to: One of the principal is, that he is not the Author of them. He relates them after <hi>Homer,</hi> whoſe Authority had already eſtabliſh'd them: So that he had leſs meaſures to take.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THIS Queſtion is eaſily reſolved by the Practice of our Poets. We may in ſhort affirm, that <hi>Machines</hi> are to be made uſe of all over, ſince <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> do nothing without them, They conſtantly put their Gods upon duty. <note n="*" place="margin">Non enim res geſtae verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus comprehendendae ſunt, quod longe melius Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorici faciunt: Sed per, ambages Deorumque mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteria, &amp; fabuloſum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarum tormentum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitandus eſt liber Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religioſae orationis ſub teſtibus fides.</note> 
                     <hi>Petronius</hi> with his uſual Vehemency or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that it ſhould be thus. <q>He would have his Poet converſe leſs with Men than with the Gods: Leave throughout ſome ſigns of his prophetical Tranſports, and of the Divine Fury that ſwells him: He would have his thoughts be full of Fables, that is of thoſe Allegories and ingenious Figures, which, like <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> put the invention of the Readers upon a pleaſing Rack, and leave them to gueſs in their turns what the Poet himſelf has written like a Prophet. Laſtly, he would have a Poem be diſtinguiſhed from Hiſtory in all its parts, not only by the Numbers, but by this Poetical fury, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it ſelf only by Allegories, and does nothing but by the Aſſiſtance of the Gods.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore that would be a Poet, muſt leave <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> to write, that a Fleet was ſhattered by a Storm, and caſt upon a ſtrange Coaſt: And muſt ſay with <hi>Virgil,</hi> That <hi>Juno</hi> went to <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and that this God upon her inſtance unkennel'd the Winds againſt

                     <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Let him learn an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> to write, That a Young Prince behaved himſelf upon all occaſions, with a great deal of Wiſdom and Diſcretion: And let him ſay with <hi>Homer,</hi> that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> led him by the hand in all his Enterpriſes. Let an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> relate, that though <hi>Agamemnon</hi> fell out with <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet he could not but acknowledge that he ſtood in need of his Aſſiſtance for the taking of <hi>Troy:</hi> And let a Poet ſay, that <hi>Thetis,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at the affront offered to her Son, goes up to Heaven, demands ſatisfaction of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and that this God, to ſatisfie her, ſends the <hi>God of Sleep</hi> to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> who puts the Cheat upon him by making him believe he muſt take <hi>Troy</hi> that very day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch, Livy,</hi> and other Authors of the <hi>Roman Hiſtory,</hi> will tell us, that he who preſcribed Laws to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhut himſelf up in a Wood, and feigned that a Nymph dictated ſuch Laws to him, as afterwards he ſhould propoſe to his Subjects. A Poet will ſay, That <hi>Aeneas</hi> being alone with <hi>Sibyl</hi> of <hi>Cumae</hi> in the Foreſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verna,</hi> ſhe makes him go down to the <hi>Infernal Shades,</hi> and there ſee the Rewards of good, and the Puniſhments of bad Actions; and that the <hi>Manes</hi> of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> informed him what ſort of Genius he ſhould inſpire that State with, which he was going to eſtabliſh in <hi>Italy.</hi> And if we would Poetically reduce this Fiction into the Probability of Hiſtory; let us not like an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> ſay, that as <hi>Numa</hi> feigned he had Conferences with <hi>Egeria,</hi> ſo <hi>Aeneas</hi> feigns that <hi>Sibyl</hi> made him ſee in a Dream all that we read of in the Sixth Book: But let us ſay that this Hero was let out of Hell by that Gate which was appointed for the ſending out of <hi>Falſe Dreams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis thus that our Poets make uſe of <hi>Machines</hi> in all the parts of their Works. We might take a more particular View of them, if we would but examine all the Parts of the Poem and the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>Propoſition</hi> in each of our three Poems makes mention of the Gods; the <hi>Invocation</hi> is addreſſed to them, and the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is full of them. The <hi>Gods</hi> are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Actions. They make the <hi>Plots,</hi> and diſpoſe the <hi>Solution</hi> of them too. This is ſo plain that it needs no farther proof. I will inſiſt only on the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nravelling of the Plots,</hi> which we may look upon as that part of the Poem, which is the moſt Important in this Point, eſpecially if we conſider that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> have treated of <hi>Machines</hi> more expreſly in this, than in any other part of the Poem.</p>

How many <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Machines</hi> does <hi>Virgil</hi> make uſe of to raiſe the ſtorm, which caſts <hi>Aeneas</hi> upon <hi>Carthage?</hi> And yet this does not hinder but that this miraculous Action may be look'd upon as the ordinary Effect of a meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſe. <note n="*" place="margin">Cum ſubito aſſurgens fluctu nimboſus Orion I<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

'Tis never to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that there are any ſtorms during the <hi>Halcyonian days.</hi> This would be an affront to the Power of the <hi>Gods,</hi> by aſcribing to them ſuch a force as contradicts <hi>Poetical Probability.</hi> So that, thô beſide this ſhort ſeaſon, there is ſcarce any part of the Year, but when ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probably and without a Miracle one might be toſs'd about with a Storm; yet <hi>Virgil</hi> raiſes his Storms only in a ſeaſon that is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſubject to them. The four we read of in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> do all happen during the Riſing of <hi>Orion.</hi> The firſt caſts <hi>Aeneas</hi> upon <hi>Carthage;</hi> The ſecond ſurprizes him a hunting with <hi>Dido;</hi> The third obliges him to put into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he Celebrates the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of <hi>Anchiſes;</hi> and the fourth cloſes the fine Day he had choſe for the Sports, and quenches the fire that burnt his Fleet. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et informs us that all theſe Storms which ſurpriz'd <hi>Aeneas,</hi> were the effects of one and the ſame Cauſe. <note n="*" place="margin">Quin etiam Hyberno mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liris ſidere claſſem Expecta facilemque fugam, ventoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ferentes. <hi>Aen.</hi> 4.</note> For <hi>Dido</hi> chides <hi>Aeneas</hi> for preparing to leave her, whilſt this dangerous Conſtellation had ſtill an inuflence o'er the Sea; and ſhe conjures him (th ô in vain) to ſtay till this bad ſeaſon was over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:53904:135"/>
According to this Practice, a Poet will be very cautious how he makes uſe of a <hi>Machine</hi> to help him out of a difficulty, wherein his own unskilfulneſs has caſt him. But he will call in the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Gods</hi> to honour his Poem and Hero, and no one will object againſt him, that 'tis for want of Art and Invention, that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to implore the Aid of theſe ſupernatural Powers. No one will caſt theſe Reproaches upon <hi>Virgil</hi> in the Examples we have cited, nor in his other <hi>Machines.</hi> It was not for want of Skill or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he had recourſe to <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> either to raiſe a Storm upon the Fleet of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or to lay it again. So likewiſe, a Woman ſtabb'd to the heart with a Ponyard, as <hi>Dido</hi> was, might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well die of the wound, without <hi>Iris</hi>'s being ſent by <hi>Juno</hi> to clip a lock of Hair off her Head. A Ship well mann'd, and near the Haven, might without any Miracle enter in before another that was farther off. 'Tis therefore without any neceſſity that the Poet makes uſe of the <hi>Gods</hi> therein, and ſays that <hi>Mneſtheus</hi> would have gain'd the prize perhaps, had not <hi>Cloanthes</hi> put up ſo many vows, and had not ſo many <hi>Sea-Gods</hi> that heard him, lent him a helping hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> makes uſe of ſeveral ways, from whence one may diſcover there was neceſſity for <hi>Machines.</hi> Sometimes the thing, that is done by a God, is neceſſary, but it might as well have been done by a Mortal. <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſhould be inform'd of what had happen'd to <hi>Dido:</hi> But there was no need that <hi>Venus</hi> ſhould diſguiſe her ſelf under the ſhape of a <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Damſel, that was hunting in a Wood. A mere Damſel might have inform'd him: And 'tis thus that we ought to interpret the Changes of the Gods into Men. Theſe are the ways whereby Poets expreſs themſelves. An <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> would ſay that <hi>Beroe</hi> excited the other <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames to fire their Fleet: And a Poet ſays, that <hi>Iris,</hi> ſent expreſs by <hi>Juno,</hi> takes upon her the ſhape of <hi>Beroe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Action aſcrib'd to a <hi>Deity</hi> cannot be done by a mere Man: But then this Action ſhall not be at all neceſſary. A mere Mortal cannot transform the Ships of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into Nymphs. But then whether they are thus transform'd, or whether they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by fire, ſtill they are loſt. Nor can any one ſee what alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration one of theſe two Incidents would have caus'd in the Affairs of <hi>Aeneas</hi> more than the other.</p>
                  <p>I have already mention'd the <hi>Infernal Shades</hi> of the ſixth Book, the <hi>Fury</hi> that was ſent by <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Turnus,</hi> and ſeveral other.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore conclude that a <hi>Machine</hi> in the <hi>Epick Poem</hi> is not an Invention to wind ones ſelf out of any Difficulty, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, affected, and proper to ſome parts of the Poem: But that 'tis the <hi>Preſence</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and ſome ſupernatural, extraordinary Action, which the Poet inſerts into almoſt all the Incidents of his Work, to make it look more Majeſtical and ſurprizing, and to give
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53904:136"/>
his Readers a Leſſon of Piety and Vertue. This mixture ſhould be ſo made, that one might retrench the <hi>Machines</hi> without cutting off any thing from the Action.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Whether the Preſence of the Gods is any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the <hi>Heroes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE care of our Poets in making the Actions and Deſigns of their Hero's to ſucceed by the aſſiſtance of the Gods, puts me upon adding the following Reflections to what has been already ſaid. One would think there was no queſtion to be made whether the Love and favour of God were an honour or a Diſparagement to thoſe he thus Loves and Favours. And yet, we ſuffer our ſelves to be ſo far prepoſſeſs'd with ſenſible and ordinary things, that we become liable to more extravagant thoughts. We judge of the Juſtice, the Favours, and (if I may ſo ſay) of the Duties of God; juſt as we do of the Juſtice, the Favours, and the Duties of Men. In a fight between Two perſons, if a Third ſteps in, and aſſiſts one of them to kill the other, we blame that third perſon, and with him condemn his friend, who was ſo much a Coward as to ſtand in need of Succour, to protect them both from diſgrace. Theſe thoughts are proper, and this Indignation juſt. But Men treat God after the ſame Manner. <q>
                        <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſay they, ſhould not have aſſiſted <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Was not this Hero brave enough to fight <hi>Turnus</hi> alone, and valiant enough to Conquer him? Where is there any need then of this foreign Aſſiſtance? Does it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Hero and the God too? And would <hi>Turnus</hi> have done leſs, had he had the ſame Advantage?</q> This is their way of arguing: from whence it muſt be inferr'd, that the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God will ſerve only to make thoſe, that he would aſſiſt, and, and that venture to make uſe of that Aſſiſtance, appear Weak, Impotent, Cowardly, and not worthy of being Conquerors: One ſhould thereupon never pray to him nor thank him for any happy ſucceſs. And by this means the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Mezentius</hi> will be the <hi>Character</hi> of a perfect Hero, and of a truly valiant Man. This Bravo is not for having his Glory eclipſed by the Aſſiſtance of any <hi>Deity:</hi> His Sword and his Arm are the only Gods he acknowledges and invokes. He vows a Trophy to his Victory; but this vow is only addreſſed to his Son <hi>Lauſus,</hi> whom he deſigns to adorn with the ſpoils of vanquiſh'd <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Theſe are the Prayers he makes
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53904:136"/>
for his Victory, and theſe the Thanks givings he deſigns to make. And theſe are likewiſe the Heroes thoſe Men would make, who find fault with <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> for having beſtowed the Victory on <hi>Aeneas, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, it would reflect upon an Hero, if himſelf did nothing; if the Hope and the Confidence he plac'd in the Promiſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God rendring him more negligent, he ſhould wait for the effect with his hands in his boſom; or elſe, if expoſing his Weakneſs and his little Valour, and being juſt upon the point of yielding, he ow'd his preſervation and his Victory only to Gods and Miracles. But the Practice of our Poets removes this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, and we have fully ſatisfied the World as to this point, when we obſerv'd, that the preſence and the Action of the Gods ſhould be ſo order'd, that one might retrench ev'ry thing that was extraordinary and Miraculous, without making any alteration in the Action of the Humane Perſonages. By this means the <hi>Epopéa</hi> will be neither a School of Impiety and Atheiſm, nor of Idleneſs and Sloth. But Men will there learn to adore God, and acknowledge him as the Only and Neceſſary Principle of all the Good that can be done, and without whom the moſt puiſſant Princes, and ſhe moſt accompliſhed Heroes cannot ſucceed in any of their Deſigns. 'Tis he that inſpires Men with good Deſigns, gives them Courage to undertake them, and power to execute them. Men will learn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and ſubmit to him; becauſe this Submiſſion and Humility, which makes even Great Men ſtoop to their God, is the Cauſe and the Occaſion of their being elevated above the reſt of Mankind. They will learn to fear him, by conſidering the Misfortunes thoſe Men bring upon themſelves, who abandon him: And becauſe when our Paſſions have ſhut our Eyes and ſtop'd our Ears to his Orders and Inſtructions, we are too ſlow in apprehending what a dreadful thing it is to make him our Enemy. They will put an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his Words and Promiſes: But withal knowing that they ſuppoſe one ſhall merit the effects of them by uſing ones utmoſt endeavours, an Hero will ſo behave himſelf in all his Actions, as if he ought to gain the ſucceſs alone without the aſſiſtance of the Deity: Becauſe, as the Ancients ſay, the Gods do not abſolutely give us what they ſeem to give us, but they ſell it at the price of our Labours.</p>
                  <p>But if on one hand God be the Author of all the good we do; 'tis true likewiſe to ſay that 'tis our ſelves that really do, whatever God does in and by us: And ſince theſe Actions which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into us, procures for us, and for which he gives us all the Courage and Strength that is neceſſary, are truly and properly our own Actions; it follows that the more God helps and favours us, the more Glory and Honour he does us. And this is the difference that is between the Aſſiſtance of God and that of Men. The
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53904:137"/>
Actions of Men belong only to thoſe that do them: So that their Aid diminiſhes our Glory, as much as the Divine Aſſiſtance height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it. Our Poets inform us thus much, and <hi>Achilles</hi> who was ſo jeálous of his Honour, knows well enough how to make the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction we have here propoſed. He was too high ſpirited to admit of the leaſt aſſiſtance which might leſſen his Glory: He charges the <hi>Grecians</hi> to keep off from <hi>Hector,</hi> whom he purſues. But when <hi>Minerva</hi> offers to aſſiſt him in this purſuit, and to help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and kill him, he was ſo far from rejecting this Divine Aid, that he thinks it an honour to him, and brags of it ev'n to <hi>Hector</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Cornoüille</hi> will allow me to end this point with what he has ſaid about it in his <hi>Andromeda: Phineus</hi> caſts the ſame Reflections upon his Rival <hi>Perſeus,</hi> as one might upon <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But he is young, paſſionate and impious, and has the Character of <hi>Mezentius,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">J'en jure par ſes yeux, &amp; mes uniques Rois, &amp; mes uniques Dieux.</note> in that he acknowledges no other Gods but the Eyes of <hi>Andromeda;</hi> ſo that he is very fit to act that part. Queen <hi>Caſſiopea</hi> makes the Anſwer to him.

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Doctrine of the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and that of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> ſtand upon the ſame Foundation. Both <hi>This</hi> and <hi>That</hi> is nothing elſe but the Art of imprinting on our Auditors ſuch Ideas as we would have them receive. It ſeems as if this Notion belonged rather to the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> than the <hi>Thoughts;</hi> ſince the <hi>Thoughts</hi> being nothing elſe but Ideas, one would imagine that if they were well <hi>Expreſſed,</hi> that would be ſufficient to imprint them on the minds of the Hearers. But you will ſee that this is not enough, if you reflect, that there is a great deal of difference between making any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what we think and have a mind to, and the inſpiring into him the ſame Inclimations, and the ſame <hi>Thoughts.</hi> A good <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:53904:139"/>
is enough for the firſt. But it often happens, that if I would give another the ſame Inclinations, which I have my ſelf, I ſhall ſucceed better, if I expreſs quite contrary <hi>Thoughts,</hi> than if I clearly diſcovered the Ideas of my mind, and my real <hi>Thoughts.</hi> If we pretend an Eſteem and Friendſhip for any one in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a jealous and envious Rival, we ſhall not make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any of thoſe good <hi>Thoughts</hi> for him; but, on the contrary, we ſhall render the perſon, in whoſe behalf we ſpeak, odious and contemptible to him. Figurative ſpeeches may likewiſe furniſh us with Inſtances of this Nature. We expreſs not our preciſe <hi>Thought</hi> in an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> we ſay a great deal more of a thing, than we conceive of it, and more than we would have others conceive of it; and the <hi>Irony</hi> does the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this part of <hi>Elocution</hi> we are ſpeaking of, does not conſiſt in <hi>Expreſſing</hi> ones Ideas, or in making others apprehend the Ideas we propoſe; but in propoſing ſuch Ideas as may imprint thoſe that we would have imprinted, let them be the ſame with thoſe we propoſe, or the contrary, or any other. So that three things are expedient for this purpoſe. Firſt, to have a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Idea we would imprint on the minds of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: It muſt be pure and diſengage'd from all thoſe that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our deſign. Secondly, to know what <hi>Thoughts</hi> are moſt proper to imprint this Idea, by conſidering the preſent Humour, Intereſt, and Diſpoſition of our Audience. And thirdly, to make a good Choice of ſuch <hi>Expreſſions</hi> as are moſt proper and ſuitable.</p>
                  <p>That which is moſt commonly prejudicial to the firſt of theſe, namely to the Purity of the Ideas, is, that beſide each particular Idea which we Imagine, there is likewiſe a general Idea, which ſeldom fails mixing with almoſt all the reſt: 'Tis that Idea which we conceive of our ſelves, and which we would fain repreſent as great, fine, excellent, and in a word ſuch as we our ſelves conceive it. This is evident, eſpecially in that kind of Oration which the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> have ſtil'd the <hi>Demonſtrative.</hi> It ſeems as if an <hi>Orator</hi> in ſuch an Harangue ſpeaks more to entertain us with a vaſt Idea of himſelf than of his Hero: And when we go away from hearing the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of any <hi>Saint</hi> or perſon of Quality; 'tis ſeldom that we praiſe or diſpraiſe either the One or the Other of them upon the account of what the <hi>Orator</hi> has ſaid: But we only cry, <q>That this <hi>Orator</hi> has an Eloquent Tongue, or that he is but ſo, ſo:</q> As if we went to hear his Speech, only to paſs a Judgment upon his, not the Hero's perſon. The two other kinds of <hi>Oratorical Diſcourſes</hi> are not wholly free from this Vice. Some are ſo vain, as to attempt it upon all occaſions, and at ev'ry turn. They are full of this vaſt Idea of themſelves, that they cannot keep it in, but out it muſt come, ſpread every where,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53904:139"/>
and like a Deluge overflow all the Judgment, and little Senſe they have. We can produce inſtances enow, even in the <hi>Juridical Kind,</hi> though that is more confin'd than the other two.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, did theſe Perſons underſtand wherein a true praiſe does conſiſt, and were they Maſters of the ſecond quality we requir'd, which is, to know what <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Sentiments</hi> a Man ſhould propoſe in order to raiſe a great Idea of himſelf in the minds of thoſe that hear him; they would then correct this firſt default, they would ſpeak correctly, and ſay nothing but what was of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and to the Purpoſe. But ſince their firſt Error proceeds from a Defect in judgment, it cannot be alone. They imagine that the true eſteem of an <hi>Orator</hi> or a <hi>Poet</hi> conſiſts chiefly in fine <hi>Thoughts,</hi> in ſtrong and lofty <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> in paſſions carry'd on to an extream, or in other ſuch like things, which in truth belong not to <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and ſometimes produce effects quite contrary to the deſign of an unjudicious Author.</p>
                  <p>A Lawyer, for inſtance, will Imagine that his Eſteem depends upon making a ſet Speech, adorn'd with figures, and full of a great many pretty <hi>Antitheſes:</hi> He will be ſure to heap figure upon figure in his pleading: And chuſe rather to enervate a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and loſe his Cauſe by an unpardonable flight, than not give his <hi>Antitheſes</hi> all the Embelliſhments he judges they are capable of. This is what <hi>Pedius</hi> did according to <hi>Perſius</hi>'s account of him.

                  <p>The more Vanity any Man has, the more ſubject he is to theſe Vices. Therefore <hi>Poete</hi> ſhould be more upon their Guards, than <hi>Orators.</hi> The Compoſures of the laſt are only to be ſpoken, and to eſtabliſh for their Authors a preſent Fame. But a Poet has Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality ſo much in his Thoughts, that he fanſies he has enough and to ſpare on't; and promiſes it with ſo much Confidence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as if his own where indiſputable, and as if all his Enemies were deſtroy'd to the very laſt Rat and Butter-Wife. Theſe Poets will ſtuff a Poem with <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> either ill plac'd, or ill manag'd, with affected and uſeleſs <hi>Figures,</hi> with forc'd and inſipid <hi>Sentences,</hi> with <hi>Similes</hi> more fine than juſt, and with other ſuch like Ornaments: And by this means they deſtroy the Idea they ought to give of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by imprinting on their Readers minds nothing elſe but the Idea of their Knowledge, Eloquence, and fine Genius, becauſe they forſooth fanſie that the Politeneſs of a Genius, and the Honour of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor conſiſts in theſe things. They judge of the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> according to theſe Ideas; and ſuppoſe they have excell'd <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and all other Poets, when (without minding the <hi>Character,</hi> or any thing elſe that is peculiar and proper to each Poem) they have heap'd up in that, which they compoſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appear'd beautiful in all the reſt; and when they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted theſe pretended Beauties with as little skill, as if the Noſe or the Lips of an handſom perſon, had the ſame Comelineſs upon all ſorts of Faces, without any diſtinction of Age, Sex, or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This was not <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Opinion, when he imitated the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet. He has given another ſort of <hi>Character</hi> to his <hi>Aeneid;</hi> and he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53904:140"/>
well obſerv'd, that this oblig'd him to give the things he borrow'd, a quite different Turn. This made him ſay. <q>That 'twas harder to ſteal one Verſe from <hi>Homer</hi> than to rob <hi>Hercules</hi> of his Club.</q> This great Man had juſt and pure Ideas, and perfectly knew how to inſpire his Audience with them, without quitting his deſign, to run after falſe lights, and glittering thoughts, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Vanity, more pardonable in the Rawneſs of a Scholar, than in the Maturity of a Maſter. Let us apply this to ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Thoughts.</p>

               <div n="2" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Concerning</hi> Deſcriptions.</head>
                  <p>DEſcriptions are properly ſuch Speeches as explain the parts and properties of ſome thing or other. This Term ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times extends even to Actions: But that of a <hi>Recital</hi> or <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is more proper to them, eſpecially when theſe Recitals are of ſome Length, ſuch as is that of the <hi>Tempeſt</hi> in the firſt Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> the <hi>Sports</hi> of the Fifth, the <hi>Infernal ſhades</hi> of the next Book, the <hi>Battles</hi> of the Second part, with ſeveral Others which I was willing to comprehend under what I ſaid concerning the <hi>Narration.</hi> They are too conſiderable to be mention'd here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Sentiments</hi> or ſimple <hi>Thoughts.</hi> The <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> we now ſpeak of are only parts of theſe long <hi>Recitals.</hi> They therefore muſt be ſhort; and moreover, neceſſary and ſuited to the general <hi>Character</hi> of the Poem, and to the Particular <hi>Character</hi> of the Subject matter that is deſcrib'd, as far as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Deſcription</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece of his <hi>Aeneid</hi> is contained in ſix Verſes. It tells us that this City is ſeated over againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> facing the very mouth of <hi>Tiber;</hi> that it is powerful in War, and that <hi>Juno</hi> had a mind to make it the ſeat of the Univerſal Monarchy. This is the Cauſe of the Anger of this Deity, and that which makes the <hi>Plot</hi> of the Poem.</p>
                  <p>The Readers would not have imagined how <hi>Aeolus</hi> could keep in and let looſe the Winds as he thought fit, if they had not been informed, that they are incloſed in Caverns. The Poet ſpends twelve Verſes upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Ships of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> ſo roughly handled by a Tempeſt, and at a Seaſon, when the Sea was liable to frequent and unforeſeen Storms, had need of an <hi>Harbour,</hi> that was free from this Danger,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53904:141"/>
and very ſtill; and ſince it was in a ſtrange and unknown Country, 'twas requiſite this <hi>Haven</hi> ſhould be in a private and ſecret Place. This is what <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribes in Eleven Verſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Venus</hi> preſents her ſelf to her Son, diſguis'd like a Maid. The Poet is obliged to tell how this Maid happen'd to be in a wide Foreſt. He repreſents her in a hunting Habit. He is likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reduce to Probability ſuch an extraordinary thing as that of a Maid in Armour. A <hi>Deſcription</hi> of ſeven lines does it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly.</p>
                  <p>Deſcriptions ſometimes are mix'd with ſome Paſſion or another. In this caſe not only the Thread of the Diſcourſe ſhould make them very Natural; but they ſhould likewiſe be in ſome meaſure aſſiſting to the Paſſions to which they are joyn'd. That fine <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> of a Calm and quiet Night in the Fourth Book, renders the cruel Diſturbances of <hi>Dido</hi> a great deal more moving, ſince they rob her of that Reſt which all Nature enjoy'd, to the very vileſt and moſt deſpicable Creatures.

                  <p>The Judicious Readers might perhaps have been diſguſted at this Beauty ſo carefully deſcribed in the very heat of Battle, if the Poet had only made it for their ſakes. But 'tis not deſign'd ſo much for them as for <hi>Camilla.</hi> This Maid is ſo charmed at the ſight of his Accoutrements, that ſhe is wholly intent upon the Conqueſt of them.

'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite we ſhould produce an Inſtance of it. <hi>Creon</hi> has a Story to tell <hi>Oedipus,</hi> that was the moſt melancholy, the moſt frightful, and the moſt ungrateful that ever could be told a King. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, he is threatned, and after great ſigns of Grief for being forc'd to tell him ſuch terrible and afflicting things, he begins his Narration with the <hi>Deſcription</hi> of a <hi>Grove,</hi> which <hi>Oedipus</hi> knew as well as the <hi>French King</hi> knows the Foreſts of <hi>Vincennes, Boulogne,</hi> and S. <hi>Germain.</hi> But ſuppoſe <hi>Oedipus</hi> had never heard of it, was he then at leiſure to be told, that it was full of Cypreſs-Trees,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53904:142"/>
Oaks, Laurel, Myrtle, Alder, and Pine-Trees? That the Cypreſs-Trees are always green, that the Laurel-Trees bear bitter Berries, that the Alder-Trees were proper to build Ships, which ride on the wide Ocean, &amp;c. That the Oaks of this Grove had their Branches diſtorted and eat up with Age; that Time had gnawn the Bark off this; that the Roots of <hi>That</hi> could no longer ſupport it, and that it would tumble down, were it not prop'd up by the Trunk of another Tree.

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of</hi> Compariſons <hi>or</hi> Similes.</head>
                  <p>WE very commonly explain our ſelves by <hi>Similes,</hi> and make uſe of them, the better to make others apprehend what we propoſe, and to give them a juſt Idea thereof. There are two Eſſential Qualities belonging to them, the Firſt is, that the thing we make uſe of be better known, and eaſier to apprehend, than that we would make known by its aſſiſtance; and the ſecond is, that there be an exact Relation between them.</p>
                  <p>As for that which concerns the Knowledge of the thing we make uſe of in a <hi>Simile,</hi> there is no need that we ſhould have ſeen it with our Eyes. 'Tis enough that we have the Teſtimony of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion only on our ſide; thô we know at the ſame time 'tis either falſe or Fabulous. The <hi>Phoenix,</hi> the <hi>Harpyes,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of <hi>Hercules,</hi> are as proper for this purpoſe, as a <hi>Cock,</hi> or a <hi>Dog,</hi> or the Actions of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> Nor ſhould we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſome Exceſſes that are commonly to be met with in theſe <hi>Similes,</hi> as if they deſtroyed the juſtneſs of them: but we ſhould conſider that in this caſe there is an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> added to the <hi>Simile.</hi> 'Tis therefore allowable to liken a Valiant Captain to a Torrent that bears down all before it; to a Thunderbolt that meets with no reſiſtance, and to a Lyon in the midſt of a Flock of Sheep. But we are moſt liable to be deceiv'd in this Juſtneſs, if we look upon <hi>Similes</hi> only as Ornaments; for then we may neglect the juſtneſs which is Eſſential to them, and mind nothing elſe but a Luſtre and Beauty, which has nothing to do with the Eſſence. That we may not be deceived therein, we muſt be acquainted with the Deſign of the Poet, and the Nature of the things he makes uſe of. Without this, one is in danger to be miſtaken, and to imagine that a juſt and ſuitable <hi>Simile</hi> is both falſe and vicious. Let us now ſee ſome inſtances of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> deſcribing the Beauty of <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> compares him to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone ſet in Gold, and to Ivory enchac'd in Box. It is true, that whoever imagines <hi>Virgil</hi> would ſay this young Prince was as handſome as a piece of Ivory enchac'd in Box, would find this <hi>Simile</hi> to be very flat: and would have reaſon to complain that the Poet leſſens an Idea that he ought to raiſe. But we ſhall find that this <hi>Simile</hi> is juſt, if we would diſcover wherein it conſiſts, and obſerve, that the Author has diſtinguiſh'd two things in <hi>Aſcanius.</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53904:143"/>
The one is the ſhining of his comely head when bare: And the other is the Colour of his Complexion, and that of his hair. The firſt is compared to a precious Stone enchac'd in Gold.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Dardanius caput ecce puer detectus honeſtum Qualis gemma micat ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum quae dividit aurum, <hi>Aencid.</hi> 10.</note> See how the <hi>Trojan</hi> Youth, his head all bare,</l>
                        <l>Does like a Gem enchac'd in Gold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is both juſt and noble. But the whiteneſs of a Face would have been but pitifully expreſſed by a precious Stone. It is with a great deal more Juſtice compar'd to the Whiteneſs of Ivory, and the Colour of his Hair to that of Box.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Vel quale per artem, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſum buxo aut Oricia te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebintho Lucet ebur: fuſos cervix cui lactea crines Accipit. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                           </note> Or like to Ivory inclos'd in Box:</l>
                        <l>So ſhine the Youth's disſhevl'd Yellow Locks</l>
                        <l>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon his milky Neck.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Sixth Book there is a Compariſon very like this laſt. A Bough of Gold, which grew upon an Oak, the Poet compares to <hi>Miſleto.</hi> He would have taken off very much from the Luſtre of this precious Bough, if his deſign had been to expreſs this Luſtre by that of the <hi>Miſleto.</hi> But this Property of Gold is very well known, and the bare naming of this Metal raiſes in us an Idea of it that is lovely and dazling enough: It ſtands in no need of being heightened by a <hi>Compariſon.</hi> 'Tis a great deal more Wonderful and Extraordinary to ſee a Tree ſhoot forth a branch of Gold, of ſo different a Nature from its own. This therefore calls for a <hi>Simile:</hi> and is the Subject of that which <hi>Virgil</hi> made. He does not fail making mention of the Diverſity of Natures that is between Green and Yellow <hi>Miſleto,</hi> and the Oak which produces it at a time when it has the leaſt ſtrength, and looks more like a dead Trunk than a living Plant.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Quale ſolet Sylvis, &amp;c. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> Juſt as upon ſome Sapleſs Oak does grow</l>
                        <l>I'th' midſt of Winter verdant Miſleto:</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe ſay that this <hi>Simile</hi> is a Proof that Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſome things extraordinary, and renders the Fiction more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For <hi>Virgil</hi> does ſometimes make this uſe of the <hi>Similes</hi> he employs. This is manifeſt from <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s accidental meeting with a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Damſel, that was in Armour and a hunting. The Poet compares her to <hi>Amazon,</hi> and to a <hi>Spartan</hi> Laſs. Theſe two Quotations prove that the meeting with a Damſel hunting in the Foreſt of <hi>Carthage</hi> is to be allow'd as exactly probable. This
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53904:144"/>
                     <hi>Simile</hi> then is a great deal better, more juſt, and more ingenious than if he had compared this Damſel to <hi>Diana;</hi> thô this laſt would have ſeemed more noble, and have preſented it ſelf ſooner to the mind.</p>
                  <p>If it ſeems natural to compare a Huntreſs to <hi>Diana,</hi> it ſeems no leſs ſo to compare a Valiant Commander to a Lyon. Should not <hi>Virgil</hi> have done his Hero rather than <hi>Turnus</hi> this Honour? Yet he does the contrary. Perhaps 'tis becauſe the Character of the Lyon is Anger. He is the emblem of it: And <note n="*" place="margin">Fertur Prometheus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere principi Limo coactus particulam undique De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectam, &amp; inſani Leonis Vim Stomacho appoſuiſſe noſtro. <hi>Lib. 1. Od.</hi> 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Horace</hi> informs us that when <hi>Prometheus</hi> form'd Man out of that which was proper to each Animal, that which he borrow'd from the Lyon was his Anger. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude then of this Animal is not at all ſuitable to the Valour of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> but a great deal more proper for that of <hi>Turnus.</hi> So that when the Poet did it he was not at all ignorant of the Terms, <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Fury.</hi> He makes uſe of theſe very Expreſſions, when he likens <hi>Turnus</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi> to whom he never compares <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhould not make <hi>Compariſons</hi> between Noble and Ignoble, between great and inconſiderable things. But what is baſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble at one time and in one Country, is not always ſo in others. We are apt to ſmile at <hi>Homers</hi> comparing <hi>Ajax</hi> to an Aſs in his <hi>Iliad.</hi> Such a <hi>Compariſon</hi> now adays would be indecent and ridiculous; becauſe it would be indecent and ridiculous for a perſon of Quality to ride upon ſuch a Steed. But heretofore this Animal was in better repute: Kings and Princes did not diſdain the Beaſt ſo much as meer Tradeſmen do in our times. 'Tis juſt the ſame with many other <hi>Similes,</hi> which in <hi>Homer</hi>'s time were allowable. We ſhould now pity a Poet, that ſhould be ſo ſilly and ridiculous as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Hero to a piece of Fat: Yet <hi>Homer</hi> does it in a <hi>Compariſon</hi> he makes of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> And the <hi>H. Ghoſt</hi> himſelf, which cannot be ſuppoſed to have a wrong ſenſe of things, begins the Encomium of <hi>David</hi> by this Idea. <note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 47. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>As is the Fat taken away from the Peace offering, ſo was David choſen out of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> The reaſon of this is, that in theſe Primitive times, wherein the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the true Religion as well as of the falſe, were living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the <hi>Blood</hi> and the <hi>Fat</hi> were reckon'd the moſt noble, the moſt auguſt, and the moſt holy things.</p>
                  <p>Compariſons do not leſſen the Paſſion of thoſe that hear them, but in the perſons that ſpeak them they generally denote ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, as do not uſually proceed from a diſturb'd and unquiet mind. So that it rarely happens that they ſeem natural and probable in the mouth of a paſſionate perſon. Yet obſerve what the enrag'd <hi>Medea</hi> ſays in <hi>Seneca.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Concerning</hi> Sentences.</head>
                  <p>THis Word <hi>Sententia,</hi> in Latin is very Ambiguous. It ſignifies that part of Poetry, which we now treat of in this Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Sentiments</hi> or <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It likewiſe ſignifies a <hi>Sentence</hi> of few Words, that contains ſome profitable <hi>Thought</hi> or other for the conduct of human Life; ſuch as in theſe Inſtances: <note n="*" place="margin">Diſcite Juſtitiam moniti &amp; non temnere Divos. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Learn to be juſt, and don't the Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn. The habits we contract in our youth are of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Word <hi>Sentence</hi> in our Language does not fall under the firſt of theſe two Significations. Therefore in this Chapter we ſhall only take it in the latter Sence, and underſtand by it, a Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction couch'd in a few Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sentences</hi> then render Poems very uſeful, and beſides that, they have I know not what kind of Luſtre that pleaſes us. So that, it ſeems natural to imagine, that the more any Work is embelliſh'd with them, the more it deſerves that general Approbation, which <hi>Horace</hi> promiſes to thoſe, that have the Art to mix the <hi>Profitable</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:53904:145"/>
with the <hi>Pleaſant.</hi> But there is not any one Vertue, but what is attended with ſome dangerous Vice or other.</p>
                  <p>Too many Sentences make the Poem ſink into a Stile that is too <hi>Philoſophical;</hi> and caſt it into a Seriouſneſs that is leſs becoming the Majeſty of a Poem, than the Study of the Learned, and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Dogmatical. Theſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> have in their own Nature a certain kind of calm Wiſdom, that is contrary to the Paſſions, and with which they inſpire us: They are ſuch as make the Paſſions languiſh as well in the Auditors, as in the ſpeakers. To conclude, the Affectation of ſpeaking by <hi>Sentences</hi> is the cauſe that many fooliſh and triffling ones are ſpoken, or that they are ſpoken by ſuch, whoſe preſent State and Condition does not allow them to be ſo prudent and learned.

From whence then proceed theſe grave and moderate Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and theſe fine Moral Reflections?

The Ghoſt appear'd, diſcover'd the remedy according as it was requir'd, and <hi>Creon</hi> comes to give the King an account of it. He begins with declaring, that he cannot tell how to utter his mind; and by <hi>Sentences</hi> he makes this fooliſh Declaration to him:

                  <p>A Man muſt have a ſtrange fancy to ſpeak <hi>Sententiouſly,</hi> that makes his Perſonages ſpeak thus upon ſuch an Occaſion. When he is upon declaring the only Remedy that could ſave a State, which his ſilence would certainly ruin; is it not a great piece of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence to ſay, <hi>That the leaſt favour that could be begged of a King, is to hold ones peace; and that if it be not lawful to conceal this Remedy, nothing is lawful?</hi> Yet <hi>Oedipus,</hi> who at the firſt denyal made him by <hi>Creon,</hi> was ſo incenſed againſt him, <note n="*" place="margin">Itane &amp; ſalutis publicae indicium obrues....

And they too are of the ſame ſtamp with thoſe we have already ſeen. This is his anſwer, <hi>That</hi>

                     <hi>oftimes ſilence does more harm to Kings and States than even ſpeaking does;</hi> and that laſtly, <note n="†" place="margin">Imperia ſolvit, qui t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>he is no obedient Subject, that ſpeaks not when Commanded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Remedy to cure theſe Indecenies, is to imagine we hear the true Perſons talking naturally together, and to ſuppoſe our ſelves in their places, and ſee what we would ſay upon ſuch an Occaſion. By this means a Man will learn to uſe <hi>Sentences</hi> ſeldomer, and to retrench thoſe, that being not neceſſary to raiſe the Idea of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53904:146"/>
that which he would repreſent, are only dreſs'd up for a ſhow. He will likewiſe learn to ſtrip a great many <hi>Thoughts</hi> of that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Air, which forms a general Precept out of a Trifle. And he will ſay upon theſe occaſions; <hi>I command you to ſpeak, do you Obey:</hi> And not like <hi>Seneca, he that does not ſpeak when command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does not do as we Command him.</hi> In ſhort he will know how to manage the <hi>Sentences</hi> he makes uſe of better, and how to render them more juſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Remedy is, ſo to expreſs theſe <hi>Sentences,</hi> that they be not too apparent; and that the Effect of them befel before they are diſcern'd. This is <note n="*" place="margin">Curandum eſt, ne Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae emineant extra cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus orationis expreſſae, ſed intexto veſtibus colore ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reant.

                  <p>But before we ſpeak of theſe <hi>diſguiſed Sentences,</hi> let us make this Reflection upon the others: That they are generally ſpoken either by a grave and tragical perſon, or elſe by one of the common People.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have ſpoken concerning the firſt of theſe. And to that which we have already ſaid about it, we add, that the Poet ſhould make choice either of ſuch as may excite to Action, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe to whom they are ſpoken, ſuch as this for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;

                  <p>They are made uſe of quite another way with reſpect to the Vulgar, and the perſons of <hi>Comedy.</hi> They are often brought in ſpeaking <hi>Sententiouſly,</hi> or (to ſpeak more properly) in <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Punns.</hi> The reaſon of this Difference is, that the grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons invent what they ſay, according as the preſent occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; ſo that their <hi>Sentences</hi> are ſo many nice or judicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which ſhould be inſpir'd into them by Objects that are preſent. Now it ſeldom happens, that Objects, which are preſent,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53904:146"/>
inſpire theſe ſorts of general <hi>Thoughts</hi> into paſſionate and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons. 'Tis this that ought to regulate the uſe of them in Poems; and which Art and Nature have taught <hi>Virgil</hi> to practiſe. But the <hi>Vulgar</hi> never invent, they only ſay over again by rote what they have heard others ſay often, and what one may ſuppoſe they themſelves have ſaid an hundred times over. So that their <hi>Sentences</hi> coſt them no Reflection, nor the leaſt premeditation. Beſides, they meet with no paſſion, which they interrupt contrary to Art: But they only raiſe laughter, and that is more conformable to the Art and Air of <hi>Comedy.</hi>

                  <p>WE are now come to ſhew that the <hi>Sentences</hi> ſhould be <hi>diſguiſed;</hi> we ſhall in ſome inſtances of <hi>Virgil</hi> propoſe the Methods whereby he has made theſe Diſguiſes. The moſt general Method is, not to declare the Moral Inſtruction in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Terms, but to make an Application of it to the Action on foot. This, for inſtance, is a pure <hi>Sentence,</hi> and declar'd in univerſal terms: <hi>Thoſe who</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hic quibus inviſi fratres dum vita manebat, Incinſi poenam expectant. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>hate their brethren in this life, ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed for't in Hell. Virgil</hi> applys it to his Action by ſaying, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> being in Hell, met there among the damn'd ſuch as had hated their Brethren here on Earth.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ways of <hi>diſguiſing Sentences,</hi> and of applying them to the Action, ſometimes the Conſequence alone has this effect, when the Poet has skill enough to manage it well. In the Second Book of the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> the <hi>Trojans</hi> were at a ſtand what they ſhould do with the Wooden-horſe, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> had left behind them <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that tells the ſtory, relates the Opinions of ſeveral conſiderable perſons, of <hi>Thymaetes, Capys, Laocoon</hi> and others, and therewith he mixes the Diſcourſes of the People, <hi>who in the Contrariety of their Opinions knew not on what to reſolve.</hi> We here ſee nothing but a bare Recital of that which happen'd among the <hi>Trojans</hi> upon this Occaſion; This may be conceiv'd without a <hi>Sentence,</hi> and without a general and univerſal Propoſition. But if this <hi>Thought</hi> be taken from what follows and conſider'd alone; it is without doubt a <hi>Sentence,</hi> and a diſcourſe that ſhews us in general
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53904:147"/>
the Nature and the reſtleſs Inclinations of a People, that deliberate in a hurry, and know not on what to reſolve:

                  <p>It is no matter by whom, and how many theſe ſentences are utter'd:

                  <p>A <hi>Sentence</hi> is well expreſſed any of theſe ways: And theſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> taken from the places where they are, and conſider'd without the Conſequence, as I here repreſent them, are true <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> and <hi>Moral Precepts,</hi> which fortifie us againſt all manner of unlucky Accidents, and againſt the Oppoſitions of Fortune. But in the Series of the Poem, they are, properly ſpeaking, neither <hi>Sentences,</hi> nor general Precepts, but advices given to <hi>Aeneas</hi> upon particular occaſions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue has an advantage over ours in this, by means of the <hi>Ellipſis.</hi> In <hi>Latin</hi> 'tis often as elegant to ſuppreſs, as 'tis to expreſs a word. So that, ſuppreſſing the Word that makes the particular Application, one leaves the <hi>Thought</hi> in that kind of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Ambiguity, which we obſerv'd in the foregoing Examples, where there is nothing to be underſtood. Here you have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this <hi>Ellipſis.</hi> The <hi>Trojans</hi> reduc'd to their laſt ſhifts by <hi>Turnus,</hi> ſee <hi>Aeneas</hi> advancing to ſuccour them. The Poet ſays, <hi>Spes addita ſuſcitat iras.</hi> This Expreſſion ſignifies equally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in particular, that <hi>the Hope They receiv'd rally'd and increas'd their Courage;</hi> or in general, that <hi>the Hope of approaching and certain Succour raiſes mens Courage, and arms them with new Vigor.</hi> If the Poet had added but one Word, and ſaid, <hi>Ollis ſpes addita ſuſcitat iras;</hi> The firſt ſence would have been clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and it would not have been a pure <hi>Sentence,</hi> but the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a <hi>Sentence.</hi> The leaving out of this Word makes it a perfect <hi>Sentence.</hi> But this leaving out the word being ſo natural, that we can eaſily underſtand it; reduces the <hi>Sentence</hi> into the body
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53904:147"/>
of the Diſcourſe, and prevents it, as I may ſo ſay, from being upon the ramble. This is one of thoſe fine and delicate Unions which <hi>Perſius</hi> requires.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way of diſguiſing the Sentences, is by applying them ſenſibly to the Particular Action. This is done by drawing a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Concluſion from an Argument founded upon a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which we do not expreſs. An inſtance thereof is this, <hi>Dido</hi> complains, becauſe ſhe did not ſet upon <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whilſt it was in her power; and ſhe ſtarts this Objection againſt it: That <hi>ſuch an Aſſault would have been as dangerous to her as to her Enemy. Verum anceps pugnae fuerat fortuna.</hi> One may anſwer her in this Argument: He that is reſolv'd to die, has nothing to fear; I have nothing then to fear, ſince I am reſolved to die. It would have been ridiculous to have expreſſed all this in a Poem, and to make one as paſſionate as <hi>Dido</hi> then was, to argue the Caſe thus. 'Twas requiſite then that one or other of theſe Propoſitions ſhould be made choice of; each of them is intelligible enough. The mind of the Compoſer does uſually determine this without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and he takes either that ſide to which his over ſerious Wiſdom, or to which his own Imagination judiciouſly warm'd, and transformed into that of the perſon who Acts and Speaks, inclines him. Thus the Sage and Sententious <hi>Seneca</hi> would not have fail'd taking the general propoſition. <hi>What ſignifies?</hi> He would have ſaid, <hi>he fears nothing that is reſolv'd to die. Virgil</hi> has follow'd his ordinary Flame and Stile, and ſays, <hi>Fuiſſet! Quem metus moritura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> very frequently in his <hi>Tragedies,</hi> where the <hi>Moral</hi> ſhould be leſs apparent than in the <hi>Epopea,</hi> uttere his <hi>Thoughts Morally</hi> and <hi>Sententiouſly;</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> on the other hand, in the <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> and in places that are deſign'd for <hi>Morality,</hi> conceals his <hi>Sentences</hi> under Figures, and particular Applications This <hi>Tragedian</hi> in his deſign of joyning what is <hi>Profitable</hi> to what is <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> has ſo manag'd things, that he quite hides the <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> and ſtifles the Paſſion that ſhould be predominant, that he may foiſt in a <hi>Sentence,</hi> the effect whereof is frequently nothing elſe but the offending thoſe that make impartial Reflections thereon; as in that we have already taken notice of in his <hi>Oedipus.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Virgil,</hi> retaining in the <hi>Sentence,</hi> he makes uſe of, all that is <hi>Profitable</hi> and inſtructive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he is oblig'd, mixes therewith the Luſtre and the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Paſſions with a judgment and skill that is peculiar to him.</p>
                  <p>If any thing lays us under an obligation of embracing Vertue, and abandoning Vice, 'tis doubtleſs this Maxim, <hi>viz. That the chiefeſt and beſt Recompence of a Good Action is Vertue it ſelf, and the good Habits we contract by our good Actions;</hi> as on the contrary, <hi>Vicious Actions imprint on us the Love of Vices and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53904:148"/>
the Habits of committing them, which ſometimes lead us into a kind of fatal Neceſſity.</hi> The <hi>Habits</hi> take ſuch deep rooting in us, that Death it ſelf does not make us relinquiſh them: We preſerve to Eternity the Affections and Inclinations which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in our life-time, and with which we die. So that thoſe who are ſo unhappy as to leave this World with their Vicious inclinations about them, are afflicted with unſpeakable torments, when they come to ſee the deformity of thoſe Vices which they cannot diveſt themſelves of, and the Beauty of Juſtice and Vertue, from which they are baniſh'd for ever. <hi>Virgil</hi> teaches us all this in ſeveral <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> that he diſguiſes after a moſt admirable manner.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing is: That the <hi>Manners</hi> and the <hi>Habits</hi> are the beſt reward of good Actions. He tempers this excellent precept with ſo much Tenderneſs, that 'tis hard to ſay, whether in this paſſage he makes uſe of the <hi>Profitable,</hi> or the <hi>Pleaſant.</hi> A young Nobleman, <hi>Eurialus,</hi> the moſt amiable, and the moſt beloved of all the <hi>Trojans,</hi> meets with an important occaſion of ſerving his Prince, to which nothing but his own Vertue obliges him. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the opportunity with all earneſtneſs, and is going to expoſe himſelf to a Death, that perhaps might be the heart-breaking of his Mother. She loved this Son ſo paſſionately, that ſhe was the only Woman that followed him into <hi>Italy,</hi> without fearing the Dangers and the Fatigues which kept all the reſt behind at <hi>Sicily. Eurialus,</hi> that lov'd his Mother as dearly, dares not take his leave of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not away with the tenderneſs of her tears. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommends her to young <hi>Aſcanius. Aſcanius</hi> receives her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his protection: And on both ſides they expreſs all the Paſſion, which a great Poet was able to inſpire them with. 'Tis in the midſt of theſe paſſions, that a grave old Man with tears in his Eyes, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces <hi>Eurialus</hi> and his dear friend <hi>Niſus;</hi> prays for their ſucceſs, and for a reward of ſo much Vertue, promiſes them ſuch a one as we have been diſcourſing of.

The ſecond <hi>Sentence</hi> is this, that when we die, we carry along with us the habits we have contracted here. The Poet makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the troubleſome and tormenting habits, upon the occaſion of thoſe Lovers which <hi>Aeneas</hi> meets with labouring under the ſame Miſeries they did before their Death.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Poet makes a particular Application of this laſt paſſage by adding the Words <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horſes.</hi> One might entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench them, and that which remains be a pure and perfect <hi>Sentence. Quae gratia fuit vivis, quae cura, eadem ſequitur tellure repôſtos.</hi> The preceding paſſage is pure and general in the Terms, and in the Expreſſion. <hi>Curae non ipsâ in morte relinquunt.</hi> 'Tis the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence alone that renders it ſingular, and reduces it into the body of the Action. Theſe two particular Applications do in the general ſay the ſame thing, and teach us; that <hi>we eternally preſerve the ſame paſſions and habits, which we have contracted whilſt living, unleſs we relinquiſh them before we die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is likewiſe what our Poet teaches us, when among the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Hell, he mentions that which the Damn'd ſuffer there at the ſight of the Juſtice and Vertue they have deſpis'd, and of which they have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally depriv'd themſelves. <note n="*" place="margin">Sedet aeternumque ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Infoelix Theſeus: Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaſque miſerrimus omnes Admonet, &amp; magna reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur voce per umbras: Diſcite Juſtitiam moniti, &amp; non temnere Divos. <hi>Aen.</hi> 6.</note> The miſerable <hi>Theſeus,</hi> ſays <hi>Virgil,</hi> is in Hell, and there will for ever be; and <hi>Phlegias</hi> more miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than he, is always calling to thoſe about him; <hi>Hark ye,</hi> cries he to the Damn'd, <hi>and learn what 'tis to be juſt and pious.</hi> This paſſage preſents us with a Sentence diſguis'd a quite different way from thoſe we have been diſcourſing of.

In truth a Man would not queſtion but this was the Poet's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; if he only conſiders his perſon, and that of the Readers; and he cannot ſay but that he has given it full force: For to cauſe this <hi>Sentence</hi> to be ſpoken in this frightful place of Torment, where Men are puniſh'd ſeverely for neglecting to practiſe it, muſt needs render it very moving and convincing.</p>
                  <p>But when, without conſidering the perſon of the Reader, one Reflects upon the Conſequence, and minds only him that ſpeaks, and the perſons to whom he ſpeaks: 'Tis no ſuch eaſie matter to imagine, that <hi>Virgil</hi>'s deſign was to inſpire Piety and Juſtice into Souls, that are no longer capable thereof, being condemn'd to ſuffer Eternal Torments in a place from whence they muſt never depart. The Poet's meaning then is ſomething elſe, ſince he makes theſe words be ſaid in a Paſſage where nothing but Crimes and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are his Theme. The Torments of Senſe, denoted by the Chains, the Whips, the Wheels, and the Flames, are not the greateſt. The Conſcience forms ſuch, to which the others are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. And as our Author has ſaid, that External things are not even in this life the higheſt Recompence of Vertuous Actions; he would have us likewiſe underſtand, that 'tis the ſame Caſe with puniſhments, and that our Soul has no greater a Tormenter than its own ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>Perſeus,</hi> who has taken many things from <hi>Virgil,</hi> may as well have taken this <hi>Thought</hi> from him too. This Poet could not imagin any dreadfuller torment, than for a Man to have a view of Vertue, when he lies under ſuch a fatal Neceſſity, as to be no longer able to purſue it. <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, if Vertue could be ſeen with the Eyes of the Body, it would charm all the World. What torment then muſt thoſe Men needs ſuffer, who ſee it more evidently than with their Bodily Eyes, and are ſo far from being able to enjoy its Charms, that they ſee themſelves ty'd down inſeparably to the contrary Vices, with which they are forc'd to make this <hi>Compariſon,</hi> when in the midſt of their Torments they are call'd upon,

                  <p>THE <hi>Points</hi> and the neat <hi>Turns</hi> are in the <hi>Pleaſant,</hi> what the <hi>Sentences</hi> are in the <hi>Profitable.</hi> Their Luſtre dazles young Poets, and others too that have more Fancy than Judgment. The <hi>Sentences</hi> cool the Action, and retard its Motions by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Gravity: And the <hi>Points</hi> deſtroy the Majeſty of a Poem by pretty conceits that are unbecoming it. Sometimes theſe fine Words produce forc'd and ridiculous <hi>Thoughts,</hi> when a Poet would prepare them, and ſtart up occaſions to make uſe of them. In the <hi>Troad</hi> of <hi>Seneca, Agamemnon</hi> falls out with <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and hits him in the Teeth, <note n="*" place="margin">Incluſa fluct.</note> that <hi>the place of his Nativity was ſurrounded with Water.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Nempe cognati maris.</note> 
                     <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Grandſon of <hi>Thetis</hi> replies, that <hi>theſe Waters were his Grandmothers:</hi> From whence 'tis concluded that they cannot prejudice his Iſland, nor ſet bounds to his Empire; ſince in ſome ſort they belong to it. This was an Ingenious Repartee: But upon what account does <hi>Agamemnon</hi> upbraid <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> for being born in an Iſland? This King of Kings would never have ſaid thus to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> had not the Poet foreſaw, what this youngſter would have anſwered him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſier redreſſing this fault, than 'tis that of the <hi>Sentences;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Sentences</hi> and the Precepts of Morality are neceſſary to the <hi>Epopéa,</hi> whoſe ſole deſign is to inſtruct Men, which cannot be done without theſe <hi>Sentences.</hi> They therefore cannot be excluded. One muſt learn how to make uſe of them, and this requires a great deal of Art, a great deal of Fancy, and a mature and ſolid Judgment. But the <hi>Points</hi> are ſo little neceſſary, that one may quite exclude them from a Poem. Our Poets have done ſo: Among ſo many <hi>Sentences,</hi> there are ſo few <hi>Points,</hi> and pretty Conceits, that one may ſuppoſe that even thoſe that happen to be there, are ſuch as crept in without the Poets being aware of them. <hi>Virgil</hi> was too ingenious not to meet with a great many <hi>Points</hi> that lay in his way, but he has made no uſe of them, and by conſequence one may preſume he wholly rejected them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Amplification</hi> of the things one ſpeaks of belongs likewiſe to the ſame Genius; and thoſe that are in love with glaring and fine <hi>Thoughts are</hi> ſubject to a vicious <hi>Amplification.</hi> In the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baid</hi> of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">

even in the midſt of the Crimes he had committed, and he takes them all upon himſelf, only upon a deſire he had of expreſſing his great Kindneſs for his daughter <hi>Antigone.</hi> He had Murder'd his Father, and marry'd his Mother without knowing it. He was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed for it. But when he ſaw <hi>Antigone</hi> did not abandon him in his miſeries, he cries out: <hi>O my dear Daughter, I am well enough ſatisfied with my Commiſſion of Parricide and Inceſt, ſince 'tis to theſe that I am beholden for ſuch a Daughter.</hi> The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of <hi>Statius,</hi> and the frantick deſire he had of making all things look great, is ſuch, that he chooſes rather to contradict himſelf, than not have his humour. When he would amplifie the Valour of <hi>Capaneus, Jupiter</hi> ſcarce thinks his whole Godhead to be Match enough for this great Man: And after he had darted one Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bolt at him, he is ready to caſt another. And when he comes to ſpeak of the Great Power of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> this very God ſmiles at the Vanity and Weakneſs of <hi>Capaneus,</hi> and diſdains him ſo much, that he could ſcarce perſwade himſelf to take his Bolt in his hand to cruſh him with it in pieces.</p>
                  <p>The affected <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Knowledge of all Arts and Sciences,</hi> is another dangerous Rock to the Vanity of Writers. Though a Poet ſhould know ev'ry thing; yet 'tis not with a deſign he ſhould vent his <hi>Science</hi> by retail, and let the World ſee the Extent of his mind: But that he may ſay nothing that ſhould argue him ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and that he may ſpeak correctly upon ſeveral Occaſions. 'Tis requiſite likewiſe that theſe Occaſions be natural, and ſuch as appear unavoidable, and unſought for. We have ſeen one inſtance of this in the Doctrine of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> has ſo judiciouſly and neceſſarily placed in his Sixth Book.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſo eaſie to make uſe of all manner of Terms of Art in a Poem, that a Man muſt be one of little Thought and a mean Soul, that ſhall be Ambitious of the praiſe of having done it. There needs only reading over a Book of the Art one would ſpeak of; or converſing with an Artificer: And after that to make ſome one or other that underſtands it ſee what we have writ about it. An Author will be a pitiful Creature, if he does not attain his end by this means: But he will not be much the more learned for having ſucceeded therein. A great Poet will never ſtoop to ſo low and uſeleſs a Vanity in an <hi>Epick Poem.</hi> Let him indeed learn, and know every thing; but then let him make uſe of this his knowledge as we before advis'd; and let him do it by uſing the moſt Common, and the moſt intelligble Terms he can. The minds of his Readers muſt never be burden'd, when there is no occaſion for it: The Paſſions and the Pleaſure of a Poem require an entire freedom from every thing elſe.</p>

The deſire of appearing Learned, makes a Poem ſmell of it from one end to the other. We ſhall ſee Women, that in a violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will make Reflections on things, which in all Probability they are wholly ignorant of; and on which, though they were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, they ought not in the Condition they are in to ſpend the leaſt Thought. Theſe Poetical <hi>Heroine</hi>'s are vers'd in <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Mythology, Geography,</hi> a great many curious <hi>Properties of Nature,</hi> and very fine Leſſons in <hi>Morality:</hi> In a word, they are not ignorant, in their very Paſſions, of whatever the Poet knows in his Study, amidſt his Books and common places. If they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any Cruelty, they name ye all the cruel Tyrants that ever were, and know without the leaſt miſtake, wherein the wicked Inclination of each Perſon did conſiſt.</p>

They would think it a ſhame only to know that the <hi>Scythians</hi> are cruel; they muſt likewiſe know that they have no ſix'd Habitation, but are <hi>here</hi> to Day, and <hi>there</hi> to Morrow. This is what <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Andromache</hi> knew; and on which ſhe reflected even during the ſad Recital of the Death of her only Son, little <hi>Aſtyanax,</hi> who was thrown from the top of a Tower. If one conſiders on all this, one can never be affected with theſe learned Complaints: And if the Audience never think thereon, to what purpoſe are they us'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Madneſs</hi> of <hi>Medea</hi> is no leſs learned than the <hi>Sadneſs</hi> of <hi>Andromache.</hi> This Mad-Woman threatens to burn the King of <hi>Corinth</hi>'s Palace: The Flame whereof ſhould be ſeen off the Promontory of <hi>Malea,</hi> which lies at the farther end of the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus.</hi> But this is not all; this Paſſion would not have been learned enough, had not <hi>Medea</hi> added, that this Promontory is inacceſſible, that the Rocks which ſurround it with Water-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, oblige the Ships to go a great way about, and that they are forc'd to fail at ſuch a diſtance off it, that their Voyage by this means is ſo much the longer. Sometimes likewiſe, not being able to expreſs theſe things by <hi>Circumlocutions,</hi> ſo as to be underſtood, all ſhall be included in an <hi>Epithet,</hi> an <hi>Adverb,</hi> or ſome other word, and then let the Reader gueſs at the meaning. But Poems are not invented for this.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here make this one Reflection more; that, though we are to avoid <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> and never to affect appearing Learned: Yet we muſt not fall into the contrary fault, and appear ignorant, as <hi>Statius</hi> has done in the beginning of his <hi>Thebaid.</hi> He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the War of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> and before he enters upon the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Achilles, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> are very great, and yet differ very much from each other. The <hi>Iliad</hi> conſiſts altogether in Battles, in Anger, and in a continual Commotion without Bounds and meaſure. The <hi>Odyſſeis</hi> on the contrary is full of nothing elſe but Prudence, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Wiſdom. So that the Learned obſerve there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difference in the Stile and Verſes of theſe two Poems. There is a great deal of Flegm in the <hi>Odyſſeis:</hi> But the <hi>Iliad</hi> is all over one continual Flame. The <hi>Aeneid</hi> ſhould be a great deal ſofter than the two <hi>Greek Poems.</hi>

                  <p>Beſide this firſt Diſtinction, each part of which comprehends an entire Poem, there are likewiſe inferiour Diſtinctions, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide each Poem into its <hi>Epiſodes</hi> and leſſer parts. For though the ſame <hi>Character</hi> ſhould be predominant, yet it ſhould not take up the <hi>Whole</hi> of the Poem, there are many Paſſages very different from one another.

oppoſite thereto. She made a compariſon between them, and the Happineſs of her former Years: And ſhe compar'd theſe different States to the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year; but in ſuch a manner, that ſhe only inſiſted on the Deſcription of the Beauty and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of the <hi>Spring.</hi> And when after a long train of theſe fine things, which inſpir'd nothing but Pleaſure and Joy, ſhe paſs'd on to the Deſcription of <hi>Winter,</hi> and when one would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear at laſt ſomething that was conformable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition of this unfortunate Princeſs, ſhe gave us the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of it. She made a Deſcription of <hi>Winter,</hi> not by repreſenting the melancholy part of it, but by making an elegant <hi>Amplification</hi> on all the Beauties of <hi>Spring,</hi> which the <hi>Winter</hi> wanted. All this was expreſſed in ſuch choice Phraſes, which certainly coſt the Poet thoſe Studies and ſleepleſs Nights, which <note n="*" place="margin">Nec nocte paratum Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabit qui me volet incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſe querela. <hi>Hor.

                  <p>Poets are oblig'd to keep up to the Rules of Art: But they are not to diſcover them openly. Oftentimes theſe very Reflections prejudice, and hinder the Pleaſure and the Paſſion. In this caſe they have recourſe to ſome Expreſſion and Phraſe, which being of it ſelf indifferent to the matter that is treated on, and not obliging the Reader to any Reflection that leſſens his Attention to the main thing, does yet give thoſe an occaſion of finding out the Rules and the Artifice, who have a mind to look after them.

                     <hi>Virgil</hi>'s meaning will ſeem ſufficiently explain'd, if one ſhould ſay, That <hi>the</hi> Trojans <hi>prepar'd for their Departure with ſo much earneſtneſs and precipitation, that they brought the Trees almoſt juſt as they found them, without giving themſelves the leiſure to ſquare them, to take the Bark, or ſo much as to ſtrip the Branches off them.</hi> And yet the Word <hi>Frondentes</hi> is not mention'd, which denotes expreſly that theſe Trees had their Leaves on: From whence one may conclude, that this time was not the <hi>Winter Seaſon;</hi> and that this other Expreſſion, <hi>Hyberno Sidere,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes uſe of upon the ſame occaſion, cannot denote that <hi>Seaſon,</hi> but only ſignifies the Tempeſtuous Conſtellation of <hi>Orion,</hi> which is predominant in the <hi>Summer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two Remarks I have made in this Chapter, are ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe that thoſe who never invent any thing of their own, but make it their only buſineſs to tranſlate, do never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently reflect thereon. One of the beſt Tranſlators of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> into <hi>French,</hi> has in one ſingle Verſe given us an Example of theſe two things. 'Tis in that of the fifth Book.
<q>
                        <l>Septima poſt Trojae excidium, jam vertitur Aeſtas.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſignifies that <hi>'twas the end of the ſeventh Summer ſince the Ruine of</hi> Troy. By this the Poet gives us to underſtand, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> did not ſpend the Winter in <hi>Carthage,</hi> ſince he came thither about the Solſtice of the ſeventh Summer; and at the end of the ſame Summer he is upon his return to <hi>Sicily.</hi> This likewiſe makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> whoſe Anniverſary they then celebrated, dyed at the end of the Summer. Laſtly, This ſerves to give an account what the Time and the <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Epick Action</hi> in the <hi>Aeneid is.</hi> All theſe proofs then are enervated, and the quite contrary are brought in in their ſtead by this Tranſlation:
<q>
                        <l>Le Septiéme Printemps peint la terre de fleurs.</l>
                        <l>The Seventh Spring now paints the Earth with Flowers.</l>

                  <p>Beſide this pleaſant Expreſſion, and theſe Terms of <hi>Spring, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>painted Earth,</hi> are entirely oppoſite to the deſign of him that ſpeaks, and to the occaſion upon which it is ſpoken. The <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan Matrons</hi> did not lament the Death of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> whoſe Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they then kept, ſo much as they did the Miſeries they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffer'd on the Sea, and thoſe they were ſtill to ſuffer. They had not their Thoughts then upon the Flowers of the <hi>Spring,</hi> nor upon the Beauties of the Earth, but upon the ſad and frightful Scenes the Sea preſented to them; which they look'd upon with Tears in their Eyes, and with Sighs and Complaints in their Mouths;

                  </head>
                  <p>WHatever Rules we have laid down in this Treatiſe, and howſoever we have expreſſed our thoughts, yet it has been far from our deſign to form a Poet, and to teach Men how to make an <hi>Epopea:</hi> But only to give the World a clearer inſight into the <hi>Aeneid.</hi> So that we muſt look upon the whole only as the way whereby one ſhould judge of that excellent piece. 'Tis upon this Conſideration that we ſhall here add ſome general Reflexions to thoſe we have already made.</p>
                  <p>The juſtneſs of the Judgment one paſſes upon the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Elocution</hi> of an Author, depends on the Nature of the Poem one reads, and which one ſhould be throughly qualified with, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, it depends upon the Qualities of the mind of him that reads it.</p>

                     <hi>Horace</hi> touches upon the firſt point in the compariſon he makes between <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Painting. Pictures</hi> have their <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> their <hi>Diſtances,</hi> and their <hi>Point of Sight,</hi> without which they loſe all their Grace and Regularity. The Images that adorn the Arch of a very high <hi>Cupola,</hi> are very large where they are, and to thoſe who view them pretty near, repreſent only Members that are monſtrous in their Projections. A Man would render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous, if he ſeriouſly found fault with thoſe miſhapen Poſtures, which Men of Underſtanding greatly admire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in truth theſe irregular Figures are harder to draw well, than all the ordinary Decorations, where every thing is juſt and regular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53904:153"/>
'Tis juſt ſo with the Works of the Poets. It is eaſie after the ſame manner to find fault with the moſt excellent and admirable touches of them. One ſhall inveigh againſt <hi>Homer</hi> for carrying on the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Achilles</hi> even to Brutality; and for degrading the Patience of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> even to the making him a Beggar. He will laugh at the Meekneſs and Piety of <hi>Aeneas;</hi> and prefer the Valour of <hi>Turnus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. And yet that which appears defective in theſe Poetical Hero's, is juſt in the ſame manner as certain. Pictures ſeem irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, when one takes them out of their proper place, and conſiders them alone, without their Circumſtances. Theſe pretended Faults have more juſtneſs and Artifice in them and are a great deal harder to manage, than the pitiful Beauties, and the cold and languiſhing Perfections, which the meaneſt Poets may ſteal from <hi>Morality,</hi> and give to their chief Perſonages.</p>
                  <p>Poetry then has its <hi>Shadow,</hi> and its <hi>Point of Sight</hi> as well as <hi>Painting.</hi> And to diſcover the Beauty and Artifice of each paſſage, a Man muſt not examine it alone and without its Circumſtances; for then he will be liable to miſtakes. He ſhould read it with the ſame Paſſions with which it was penn'd. And he muſt entertain theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the whole Series of the ſubject matter, and of the Body of the Poem. To do otherwiſe, is to deceive ones ſelf, or upon deſign to deceive others. 'Tis to do as <hi>Eſchynes,</hi> when he upbraids <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> and ſays, the Phraſes he made uſe of were more like <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> than Words in a Speech. That they might appear ſuch, he propoſes them out of their due place, and without that Patheticalneſs with which they were ſpoken and heard. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays this is no ſuch hard matter. Nor is there any difficulty to find fault with ſeveral Beauties of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and to turn them into Ridicule, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being ignorant of the Art, or by the Wit of an Enemy, or by the Spite of an envious Humour, or laſtly by the Buffooneries of a Railer.</p>
                  <p>We may likewiſe fall into theſe falſe <hi>Criticiſms</hi> for want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a deep reach. We would fain have <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> form the Cuſtoms and Manners of their Perſonages according to the modern Mode. We think their ways of ſpeaking fantaſtical, becauſe they would be ridiculous, if turn'd <hi>Verbatim</hi> into our Language. We faney there's an extraordinary meanneſs in the Words <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Blood, Fat,</hi> the <hi>Inteſtines</hi> and other parts of Animals, becauſe all this is now nothing elſe but <hi>Butcher</hi>'s and <hi>Kitchen-girls</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and we are apt to laugh at it. And we never conſider that in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s time all this was agreeable to the ſenſe of the <note n="*" place="margin">

'Tis therefore according to theſe Ideas that our Poets were bound to ſpeak of theſe things. They would have been impious had they treated theſe Subjects with Contempt. And perhaps a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> would do little better, ſhould he dare to ridicule them, eſpecially if we reflect that the Books of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have us'd them leſs than they are made uſe of in ſeveral Books of the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> which a Man by thus doing will expoſe to the Buffoonery of <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Expreſſion</hi> in its kind is of no leſs extent, and requires no leſs ſtudy. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> are two dead Languages, of which we are no longer Maſters. They have their Turns, their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, and their Beauties, which we ought to ſtudy in the beſt <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals.</hi> It would be a piece of Vanity, if we pretended to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Languages which we no longer ſpeak, as well as thoſe who have improv'd them for ſo many Ages together, and as well as thoſe that have brought them to their higheſt perfection, and have come off with the greateſt ſucceſs.

                  <p>We may therefore ſhut up all by ending as we began. Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as well as Poems are the Inventions of Art and a Genius, which gives them their Form and Perfection. If we have a mind to know them throughly, and to paſs a right Judgment upon the <hi>Ancients,</hi> we muſt before every thing rectifie our Judgment.

Juſt ſo likewiſe, before we judge of a Poem, we ſhould rectifie our Judgment, and prove it by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Works of the beſt Maſters. If they do not pleaſe us, we ſhould rather think the fault is in our own Judgments, than in thoſe Models; and if they do pleaſe us, we may rely upon our ſelves with the greater

               <hi>Satyr</hi> is a kind of Poetry only known amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Relation to the <hi>Satyrical</hi> Poeſie of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> though ſome Learned Men have pretended to the contrary. <hi>Quinctilian</hi> leaves no room to doubt upon this Point, when he writes in Chap. 10. <hi>Satyra quidem tota noſtra eſt.</hi> The ſame Reaſon makes <hi>Horace</hi> call it, in the laſt Satyr of Book 1. <hi>Graecis intactum Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> The natural and true Etymology is this: The <hi>Latins</hi> called it <hi>SAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R, quaſi plenum,</hi> to which there was nothing wanting for its Perfection. Thus <hi>Satur color,</hi> when the Wool has taken a good Dye, and nothing can be added to the Perfection of it.

            <p>From thence the Word <hi>Satura</hi> was apply'd to many other Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in <hi>Feſtus: Satyra cibi genus, ex variis rebus conditum.</hi> From hence it paſs'd to the Works of the Mind; for they call'd ſome Laws <hi>Leges Saturas,</hi> which contain'd many Heads or Titles; as the <hi>Julian, Papian,</hi> and <hi>Popean</hi> Laws, which were called <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellas,</hi> which is of the ſame Signification with <hi>Satura.</hi> From hence aroſe this Phraſe, <hi>Per Saturam legem ferre,</hi> when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate made a Law, without gathering, and counting the Votes, in haſte, and confuſedly all together, which was properly call'd, <hi>Per Saturam ſententias exquirere,</hi> as <hi>Saluſt</hi> has it after <hi>Lelius.</hi> But they reſted not here, but gave this Name to certain Books, as <hi>Peſcennius Feſtus,</hi> whoſe Hiſtories were call'd <hi>Saturas,</hi> or <hi>per Saturam.</hi> From all theſe Examples, 'tis not hard to ſuppoſe, that theſe Works of <hi>Horace</hi> took from hence their Name, and that they were call'd, <hi>Saturae quia multis &amp; variis rebus hoe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53904:155"/>
carmen refertum eſt,</hi> becauſe <hi>theſe Poems are full of a great many different Things,</hi> as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> ſays, which is partly true. But it muſt not be thought it is immediately from thence; for this Name had been uſed before for other Things, which bore a nearer Reſemblance to the Satyrs of <hi>Horace;</hi> in Explanation of which, a Method is to be follow'd, which <hi>Caſaubon</hi> himſelf never thought of, and which will put Things in ſo clear a Light, that there can be no place left for Doubt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> having been almoſt four hundred Years without any <hi>Scenical Plays,</hi> Chance and Debauchery made them find in one of their <hi>Feaſts,</hi> the <hi>Saturnian</hi> and <hi>Feſcennine</hi> Verſes, which for ſix ſcore Years they had inſtead of <hi>Dramatick Pieces.</hi> But theſe Verſes were rude, and almoſt without any Numbers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>Extempore,</hi> and by a People as yet but barbarous, who had little other skill, than what flow'd from their Joy, and the Fumes of Wine. They were filled with the groſſeſt ſort of Raile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and attended with Geſtures and Dances. To have a livelier Idea of this, you need but reflect upon the honeſt <hi>Peaſants,</hi> whoſe clowniſh Dances are attended with <hi>Extempore</hi> Verſes; in which, in a wretched manner, they jeer one another with all they know. To this <hi>Horace</hi> refers in the firſt Epiſtle of his Second Book;
<q>
                  <l>Feſcennina per hunc inventa licentia morem,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Licentious and Irregular Verſe, was ſucceeded by a ſort more correct, filled with a pleaſant Raillery, without the Mixture of any thing ſcurrillous; and theſe obtain'd the Name of Satyrs, by reaſon of their Variety, and had regulated Forms, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Dances and Muſick; but undecent Poſtures were baniſh'd. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> has it in his Seventh Book. <hi>Vernaculis artificibus, quia</hi> Hiſter <hi>Tuſco verbo</hi> Ludio <hi>vocabatur, nomen Hiſtrionibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum, qui non ſicut ante Feſcennino verſu ſimilem compoſitum temere, ac rudem alternis faciebant; ſed impletas modis Satyras, deſcripto jam ad Tibicinem cantu, motuque congruents perage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi> Theſe Satyrs were properly honeſt Farces, in which the Spectators and Actors were rallied without Diſtinction.</p>

               <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> found things in this Poſture when he firſt undertook to make Comedies and Tragedies in Imitation of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> This Diverſion appearing more noble and perfect, they run to it in Multitudes, neglecting the Satyrs for ſome time, tho they receiv'd them a little after; and ſome modell'd them into a purpos'd Form, to Act at the End of their Comedies, as the <hi>French</hi> Act their Farces now. And then they alter'd their Name of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> for that of <hi>Exodia,</hi> which they preſerve to this day. This was the firſt and moſt ancient kind of <hi>Roman</hi> Satyr. There are
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53904:156"/>
two other ſorts, which though very different from this firſt, yet both owe their Birth to this, and are, as it were, Branches of it. This I ſhall prove the moſt ſuccinctly I can.</p>
            <p>A Year after <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> had caus'd his firſt Efforts to be Acted, <hi>Italy</hi> gave Birth to <hi>Ennius;</hi> who being grown up, and having all the Leiſure in the World to obſerve the eager Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with which the <hi>Romans</hi> receiv'd the Satyrs, of which I have already ſpoke, was of Opinion, that Poems, tho not adapted to the <hi>Theatre,</hi> yet preſerving the <hi>Gaul,</hi> the <hi>Railings,</hi> and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs which made theſe Satyrs take with ſo much Applauſe, would not fail of being well receiv'd: he therefore ventur'd at it, and compos'd ſeveral Diſcourſes, to which he retain'd the Name of <hi>Satyrs.</hi> Theſe Diſcourſes were entirely like thoſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> both for the Matter and the Variety. The only eſſential Difference that is obſervable, is, that <hi>Ennius,</hi> in Imitation of ſome <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf, took the Liberty of mixing ſeveral kinds of Verſes together, as, <hi>Hexameters, Iambics, Trimeters,</hi> with <hi>Tetrimeters, Trochaics</hi> or <hi>Square</hi> Verſe; as it appears from the Fragments which are left us. Theſe following Verſes are of the <hi>Square</hi> kind, which <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> has preſerv'd us, and which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well merit a Place here for the Beauty they contain:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I attribute alſo to theſe Satyrs of <hi>Ennius</hi> theſe other kinds of Verſes, which are of a Beauty and Elegance much above the Age in which they were made; nor will the ſight of 'em here be unpleaſant.

               <hi>Horace</hi> has borrow'd ſeveral Things from theſe Satyrs. After <hi>Ennius,</hi> came <hi>Pacuvius;</hi> who alſo writ Satyrs in Imitation of his Unkle <hi>Ennius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucilius</hi> was born in the time when <hi>Pacuvius</hi> was in moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. He alſo wrote Satyrs. But he gave 'em a new Turn,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53904:156"/>
and endeavoured to imitate, as near as he could, the Character of the old <hi>Greek</hi> Comedy, of which we had but a very imperfect <hi>Idea</hi> in the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Satyr, and ſuch, as one might find in a Poem, which Nature alone had dictated before the <hi>Romans</hi> had thought of imitating the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and enriching themſelves with their Spoils. 'Tis thus you muſt underſtand this Paſſage of the firſt Satyr of the ſecond Book of <hi>Horace.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Quid, cum eſt Lucilius auſis,</l>
                  <l>Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace</hi> never intended by this to ſay, That there were no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs before <hi>Lucilius,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi> were before him, whoſe Example he followed: He only would have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, That <hi>Lucilius</hi> having given a new Turn to this Poem, and embelliſh'd it, ought by way of Excellence to be eſteemed the firſt Author. <hi>Quinctilian</hi> had the ſame Thought, when he writ, in the firſt Chapter of the Tenth Book, <hi>Satyra quidem to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta noſtra eſt, in qua primus inſignem laudem adeptus eſt Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> You muſt not therefore be of the Opinion of <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> who building on the Judgment of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> thought that the Satyr of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and that of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> were entirely different: Theſe are the very Words of this Grammarian, which have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Judicious Critick: <hi>Satyra eſt Carmen apud</hi> Romanos, <hi>non quidem apud</hi> Graecos <hi>maledicum, ad carpenda hominum vitia, Archaeae Comoediae charactere compoſitum, quale ſcripſerunt</hi> Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius &amp; Horatius, &amp; Perſius. <hi>Sed olim Carmen quod ex variis Poematibus conſtabat, Satyra dicebatur, quale ſcripſerunt</hi> Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius &amp; Ennius. You may ſee plainly, that <hi>Diomedes</hi> diſtinguiſhes the Satyr of <hi>Lucilius</hi> from that of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius;</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which he gives for this Diſtinction, is ridiculous, and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe. The good Man had not examin'd the Nature and Origin of theſe two Satyrs, which were entirely like one another, both in Matter and Form; for <hi>Lucilius</hi> added to it only a little Politeneſs, and more Salt, almoſt without Changing any thing: And if he did not put together ſeveral ſorts of Verſe in the ſame piece, as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> has done, yet he made ſeveral Pieces, of which ſome were entirely <hi>Hexameters,</hi> others entirely <hi>Iambics,</hi> and others <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaics,</hi> as is evident from his Fragments. In ſhort, if the Satyrs of <hi>Lucilius</hi> differ from theſe of <hi>Ennius,</hi> becauſe the former has added much to the Endeavours of the latter, as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> has pretended, it will follow from thence, that thoſe of <hi>Horace,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> are alſo entirely different; for <hi>Horace</hi> has no leſs refin'd on the Satyrs of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> than he on thoſe of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius.</hi> This Paſſage of <hi>Diomedes</hi> has alſo deceiv'd <hi>Douſa</hi> the Son. I ſay not this to expoſe ſome light Faults of theſe great
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53904:157"/>
Men, but only to ſhew, with what Exactneſs, and with what Caution, their Works muſt be read, when they treat of any thing ſo obſcure and ſo ancient.</p>
            <p>I have made appear what was the ancient Satyr, that was made for the <hi>Theatre:</hi> I have ſhewn, that that gave the Idea of the Satyr of <hi>Ennius:</hi> and, in fine, I have ſufficiently prov'd, that the Satyrs of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> of <hi>Lucilius</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> are but one kind of Poem, which has received its Perfection from the laſt. 'Tis time now to ſpeak of the ſecond kind of Satyr, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to explain, and which is alſo derived from the ancient Satyr: 'Tis that which we call <hi>Varronian,</hi> or the Satyr of <hi>Menippus</hi> the Cinick Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>This Satyr was not only compoſed of ſeveral ſorts of Verſe, but <hi>Varro</hi> added Proſe to it, and made a Mixture of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin. Quinctilian,</hi> after he had ſpoke of the Satyr of <hi>Lucitius,</hi> adds, <hi>Alterum illud eſt, &amp; prius Satyrae genus, quod non ſola Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num varietate miſtum condidit</hi> Terentius Varro, <hi>vir Romanorum eruditiſſimus.</hi> The only Difficulty of this Paſſage is, that <hi>Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> aſſures us, that this Satyr of <hi>Varro</hi> was the firſt; for how could that be, ſince <hi>Varro</hi> was a great while after <hi>Lucilius? Quinctilian</hi> meant not that the Satyr of <hi>Varro</hi> was the firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Time; for he knew well enough, that in that reſpect he was the laſt: But he would give us to underſtand, that this kind of <hi>Satyr,</hi> ſo mix'd, was more like the <hi>Satyr</hi> of <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuvius,</hi> who gave themſelves a greater Liberty in this Compoſition than <hi>Lucilius,</hi> who was more ſevere and correct.</p>
            <p>We have now only ſome Fragments left of the Satyr of <hi>Varro,</hi> and thoſe generally very imperfect; the Titles, which are moſt commonly double, ſhew the great Variety of Subjects, of which <hi>Varro</hi> treated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Book on the Death of <hi>Claudius, Boetius</hi> his <hi>Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philoſophy,</hi> and that of <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> are Satyrs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely like thoſe of <hi>Varro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what I have in general to ſay on <hi>Satyr;</hi> nor is it neceſſary I inſiſt any more on this Subject. This the Reader may obſerve, that the Name of <hi>Satyr</hi> in Latin, is not leſs proper for Diſcourſes that recommend Virtue, than to thoſe which are deſign'd againſt Vice. It had nothing ſo formidable in it as it has now, when a bare Mention of Satyr makes them tremble, who would fain ſeem what they are not; for <hi>Satyr,</hi> with us, ſignifies the ſame Thing, as <hi>expoſing</hi> or <hi>laſhing</hi> of ſome Thing or Perſon: yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Acceptation alters not the Word, which is always the ſame; but the <hi>Latins,</hi> in the Titles of their Books, have often had regard only to the Word, in the Extent of its Signification, founded on its Etymology, whereas we have had reſpect only to the firſt and general Uſe, which has been made of it in the beginning, to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53904:157"/>
               <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>deride;</hi> yet this Word ought always to be writ in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> with an <hi>(u)</hi> or <hi>(i) Satura,</hi> or <hi>Satira,</hi> and in Engliſh by an <hi>(i).</hi> Thoſe who have wrote it with a <hi>(y)</hi> thought with <hi>Scaliger, Heinſius,</hi> and a great many others, that the Divinities of the Groves, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call'd <hi>Satyrs,</hi> the <hi>Romans Fauns,</hi> gave their Names to theſe Pieces; and that of the Word <hi>Satyrus</hi> they had made <hi>Satyra,</hi> and that theſe Satyrs had a great Affinity with the Satyrick Pieces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which is abſolutely falſe, as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> has very well prov'd it, in making it appear, That of the Word <hi>Satyrus</hi> they could never make <hi>Satyra,</hi> but <hi>Satyrica:</hi> And in ſhewing the Difference betwixt the Satyrick Poems of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrs. Mr. <hi>Spanheim,</hi> in his fine Preface to the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> has added new Reflections to thoſe which this Judicious Critick had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and he has eſtabliſh'd, with a great deal of Judgment, five or ſix eſſential Differences between thoſe two Poems, which you may find in his Book. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had never any thing that came near this <hi>Roman</hi> Satyr, but their <hi>Silli</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which were alſo biting Poems, as they may eaſily be perceived to be yet, by ſome Fragments of the <hi>Silli</hi> of <hi>Timon.</hi> There was however this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That the <hi>Silli</hi> of the Greeks were <hi>Parodious</hi> from one End to the other, which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrs; where, if ſometimes you find ſome <hi>Parodia's,</hi> you may plainly ſee that the Poet did not deſign to affect it, and by conſequence the <hi>Parodia's</hi> do not make the Eſſence of a Satyr, as they do the Eſſence of the <hi>Silli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having explain'd the Nature, Origin, and Progreſs of <hi>Satyr,</hi> I'll now ſay a Word or two of <hi>Horace</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a more juſt Idea given of this part of his Works, than in comparing them to the Statues of the <hi>Sileni,</hi> to which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in the Banquet compares <hi>Socrates.</hi> They were Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, that without had nothing agreeable or beautiful, but when you took the pains to open them, you found the Figures of all the Gods. In the manner that <hi>Horace</hi> preſents himſelf to us in his Satyrs, we diſcover nothing of him at firſt that deſerves our Attachment. He ſeems to be fitter to amuſe Children, than to employ the Thoughts of Men; but when we remove that which hides him from our Eyes, and view him even to the Bottom, we find in him all the Gods together; that is to ſay, all thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which ought to be the continual Practice of ſuch as ſeriouſly endeavour to forſake their Vices.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have been content to ſee only his out-ſide; and 'tis a ſtrange thing, that Satyrs, which have been read ſo long, have been ſo little underſtood, or explain'd: They have made a Halt at the out-ſide, and were wholly buſied in giving the Interpretation of Words. They have commented upon him like Grammarians,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53904:158"/>
not Philoſophers; as if <hi>Horace</hi> had writ meerly to have his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage underſtood, and rather to divert, than inſtruct us. That is not the End of this Work of his. The End of any Diſcourſe is, the Action for which that Diſcourſe is compos'd; when it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no Action, 'tis only a vain Amuſement, which idly tickles the Ear, without ever reaching the Heart.</p>
            <p>In theſe two Books of his Satyrs, <hi>Horace</hi> would teach us, <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our Vices, to rule our Paſſions, to follow Nature, to limit our Deſires, to diſtinguiſh True from Falſe, and Idea's from Things, to forſake Prejudice, to know throughly the Principles and Motives of all our Actions, and to ſhun that Folly which is in all Men who are bigotted to the Opinions they have imbibed under their Teachers, which they keep obſtinately, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether they are well grounded.</hi> In a Word, <hi>He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make us happy for our ſelves, agreeable, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Friends, eaſie, diſcreet, and honeſt to all, with whom we are oblig'd to live.</hi> To make us underſtand the Terms he uſes, to explain the Figures he employs, and to conduct the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſafely through the Labyrinth of a difficult Expreſſion, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> is no great Matter to perform: And as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi> ſays, There is nothing in That beautiful, or truly worthy a wiſe Man. The principal and moſt important Buſineſs, is, to ſhew the Riſe, the Reaſon, and the Proof of his Precepts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that thoſe who do not endeavour to correct themſelves by ſo beautiful a Model, are juſt like ſick Men, who having a Book full of Receipts, proper to their Diſtempers, content themſelves to read 'em, without comprehending them, or ſo much as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantage of them.</p>
            <p>I urge not this becauſe I have my ſelf omitted any thing in theſe Annotations, which was the incumbent Duty of a Grammarian to obſerve; this I hope the World will be ſenſible of, and that there remains no more Difficulty in the Text. But that which has been my chief Care, is, to give an Inſight into the very Matter that <hi>Horace</hi> treats of, to ſhew the Solidity of his Reaſons, to diſcover the Turns he makes uſe of to prove what he aims at, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute or elude that which is oppoſed to him, to confirm the Truth of his Deciſions, to make the Delicacy of his Sentiments perceiv'd, to expoſe to open Day the Folly he finds in what he condemns. This is what none have done before me. On the contrary, as <hi>Horace</hi> is a true <hi>Proteus,</hi> that takes a thouſand different Forms, they have often loſt him, and not knowing where to find him, have grappled him as well as they could; they have palm'd upon him in ſeveral places, not only Opinions which he had not, but even thoſe which he directly refutes: I don't ſay this to blame thoſe who have taken Pains before me on the Works of this great Poet; I commend their Endeavours; they have open'd me the way;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53904:158"/>
and if it be granted, that I have ſome little Advantage over them, I owe it wholly to the great Men of Antiquity, whom I have read with more Care, and without doubt with more Leiſure. I ſpeak of <hi>Homer,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of ſome other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, which I ſtudy centinually, that I may <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my Taſte on theirs, and draw out of their Writings, the Juſtneſs of Wit, good Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>I know very well, That there are now a days ſome Authors, who laugh at theſe <hi>great Names,</hi> who diſallow the Acclamations which they have receiv'd from all Ages, and who would deprive them of the Crowns which they have ſo well deſerv'd, and which they have got before ſuch Auguſt <hi>Tribunals.</hi> But for fear of falling into <hi>Admiration,</hi> which they look upon as the Child of Ignorance, they do not perceive that they go from that <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> calls the Mother of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and which was the firſt that opened Mens Eyes. I do not wonder that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Beauties, which we find in the Writing of theſe incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men, loſe with them all their Attractives and Charms, becauſe they have not the Strength to keep their Eyes long enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Beſides, it is much eaſier to deſpiſe than underſtand them. As for my ſelf, I declare, that I am full of Admiration and Veneration for their Divine Geniuſes: I have them always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Eyes, as venerable and incorruptible Judges; before whom I take pleaſure to fanſie, that I ought to give an Account of my Writings. At the ſame time I have a great Reſpect for Poſterity, and I always think with more <hi>Fear</hi> than Confidence, on the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will paſs on my Works, if they are happy enough to reach it. All this does not hinder me from eſteeming the great Men that live now. I acknowledge, that there are a great many who are an Honour to our Age, and who would have adorn'd the Ages paſt. But amongſt theſe great Men I ſpeak of, I do not know one, and there cannot be one, who does not eſteem and honour the Ancients who is not of their taſte, and who follows not their Rules. If you go never ſo little from them, you go at the ſame time from Nature and Truth; and I ſhall not be afraid to affirm, that it wou'd not be more difficult to ſee without Eyes, or Light, than 'tis impoſſible to acquire a ſolid Merit, and to form the Underſtanding by other means, than by thoſe that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have traced for us: whether it be that we follow them by the only force of Natural Happineſs, or Inſtinct, or that Art and Study have conducted us thither. As for thoſe who thus blame Antiquity, without knowing of it, once for all I'll unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and make it appear, that in giving all the Advantage to our Age, they take the direct Courſe to diſhonour it; for what greater Proofs can be of the Rudeneſs, or rather Barbarity of an Age, than in it to hear <hi>Homer</hi> called dull and heavy, <hi>Plato</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:53904:159"/>
tireſome and tedious, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ignorant, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> vulgar Orators, <hi>Virgil</hi> a Poet without either Grace or Beauty, and <hi>Horace</hi> an Author unpoliſhed, languid, and without force? The <hi>Barbarians</hi> who ravag'd <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much Fury to deſtroy all things that were fine and noble, have never done any thing ſo horrible as this. But I hope that the falſe Taſte of ſome particular Men without Authority, will not be imputed to the whole Age, nor give the leaſt Blemiſh to the Ancients. 'Twas to no purpoſe that a certain Emperour declar'd himſelf an Enemy to <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Titus Livius.</hi> All his Efforts were ineffectual, and the Oppoſition he made to Works ſo perfect, ſerv'd only to augment in his Hiſtory the number of his Follies, and render him more odious to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

            <head>OF PASTORALS. By Monſieur <hi>De FONTENELLE,</hi> Engliſhed by Mr. <hi>MOTTEUX.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OF all kinds of Poetry the Paſtoral is probably the moſt Ancient, as the keeping of Flocks was one of the firſt Employments which Men took up. 'Tis very likely that theſe primitive Shepherds, amidſt the Tranquility and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which they enjoy'd, bethought themſelves of ſinging their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and their Loves; and then their Flocks, the Woods, the Springs, and all thoſe Objects that were moſt familiar to them naturally came into the Subject of their Songs. They liv'd in great plenty after their way, without any controul by Superiour Power, being in a manner the Kings of their own Flocks; and I do not doubt but that a certain Joy and Openneſs of Heart that generally attends Plenty and Liberty induo'd them to ſing, and to make Verſes.</p>
            <p>Society in time was brought to perfection, or rather declin'd and was perverted; and Men took up Employments that ſeem'd to them of greater conſequence; more weighty affairs fill'd their Minds, Towns and Cities were built every where, and mighty States at laſt were founded and eſtabliſht. Then thoſe who liv'd in the Country became Slaves to thoſe who dwelt in Cities, and the Paſtoral Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown the Lot of the moſt wretched ſort of People, no longer inſpir'd any delightful Thought.</p>
            <p>To pleaſe others in ingenious Compoſures, Men ought to be in a condition to free themſelves from preſſing want; and their Minds ought to be refin'd through a long uſe of Civil Society: Now a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Life has always wanted one of theſe two Circumſtances: The primitive Shepherds, of whom we have ſpoken, liv'd indeed in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough, but in their Times the World had not yet had leiſure to grow polite. The following Ages might have produc'd ſomething more refin'd, but the Shepherds of thoſe Days were too poor and dejected: So that the Country-way of living, and the Poetry of Shepherds muſt needs have been always very homely and artleſs.</p>

And indeed nothing is more certain, than that no real Shepherds can be altogether like thoſe of <hi>Theocritus.</hi> Can any one think that 'tis natural for Shepherds to ſay like his?

            <p>I am of opinion that there will be found in theſe Expreſſions more Beauty and more Delicacy of Imagination than real Shepherds have.</p>
            <p>But I don't know how <hi>Theocritus</hi> having ſometimes rais'd his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in ſo pleaſing a manner above their native Genius, could let them ſo very often fall to it again: I wonder he did not perceive 'twas fit that a certain groſs Clowniſhneſs, which is always very unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould be omitted. When <hi>Daphnis</hi> in the firſt <hi>Idyllium</hi> is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die for Love, and a great number of Deities are come to viſit him, in the midſt of that honourable Company, he is reprov'd for being like the Goat-herds, who envy the pleaſure of their Copulating Goats, and are Jealous of them; and 'tis moſt certain that the Terms
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53904:160"/>
us'd by <hi>Theocritus</hi> to repreſent this, are much of the kind of the Idea which they give.
<q>
                  <l>Ah <hi>Daphnis,</hi> looſe and wanton in thy Love!</l>
                  <l>A Herdſman thought, thou doſt a Goat-herd prove:</l>
                  <l>A Goat-herd, when he ſees the Kids at Rut,</l>
                  <l>Sits down, and grieves that he's not born a Goat:</l>
                  <l>Thus, when you ſee the Virgins Dance, you grieve,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe refus'd, and now diſdain to live.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In another <hi>Idyllium</hi> the Goat-herd <hi>Comatas,</hi> and the Herdſman <hi>Laco</hi> contend about ſome Theft, which they have committed againſt each other; <hi>Comatas</hi> ſtole <hi>Laco</hi>'s Pipe, and <hi>Laco</hi> had ſtollen the Skin which <hi>Comatas</hi> us'd to wear to cover himſelf withal, ſo that he had left him bare. They rail at each other, and vent their Paſſion in reviling and abuſive Words, which might become a couple of <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> but certainly are not over civil; and then, after a gentle <hi>Item</hi> which one of them gives the other of ſmelling rank, they both ſing for a Wager; the one having challeng'd the other to that Muſical Fight, though it ſhould rather have been to a Rubbers at Fiſticuffs, conſidering what went before; and what ſeems the more odd, is, that whereas they begun with groſs Taunts and ill Language, now that they are going to ſing againſt each other, they affect an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon niceneſs concerning the Choice of the Place where they are to ſing; each propoſing one, of which he makes a florid Deſcription. For my part, I have much a-do to believe that all this is very well ſet together. Their Songs are as odly diverſify'd; for among the things that relate to their Amours, and that are pretty, <hi>Comatas</hi> puts <hi>Laco</hi> in mind of a Beating which he beſtow'd upon him; and <hi>Laco</hi> anſwers him, that he does not remember it, but that he has not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got how <hi>Comatas</hi> was bound and ſoundly laſh'd by his Maſter <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maras.</hi> I do not fanſie that thoſe who ſay that <hi>Venus,</hi> the Graces, and <hi>Cupid</hi> compos'd <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s <hi>Idyllia,</hi> will pretend that they had a hand in theſe Paſſages.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other Places in <hi>Theocritus</hi> that are not altogether ſo low, which yet are not very entertaining, becauſe they barely treat of Country Matters. His fourth <hi>Idyllium</hi> is wholly of this kind. The Subject of it is only a certain <hi>Aegon,</hi> who, being gone to the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, has left his Herds to one <hi>Corydon. Battus</hi> tells the Truſtee, that the Herds are in a pitiful condition ſince <hi>Aegon</hi> left them. <hi>Corydon</hi> anſwers, that he does his beſt, that he drives them to the beſt Paſtures he knows, and feeds them at a Rack of Hay. <hi>Battus</hi> ſays that <hi>Aegon</hi>'s Pipe is ſpoil'd and mouldy in his abſence; <hi>Corydon</hi> replys. that it is not ſo, that <hi>Aegon</hi> when he went gave it him, and that he is a notable Piper. Then <hi>Battus</hi> deſires <hi>Corydon,</hi> to pull a Thorn out of his Foot, and the other having advis'd him,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53904:161"/>
never to walk over Mountains without his Shooes, the <hi>Idyllium</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently concludes, a thing which thoſe who are not converſant with Antiquity, would ſcarce have believ'd poſſible.</p>
            <p>When in a Paſtoral Strife one ſays, <hi>Ho! My Goats go on the Brow of yonder Hill;</hi> and the other anſwers, <hi>Go, my Sheep, feed on to the Eaſtward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, <hi>I hate the bruſh-tail'd Fox, which comes at Night and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours our Grapes;</hi> and the other, <hi>I hate the Beetles that Eat the Figs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, when one ſays, <hi>I have made my ſelf a Bed with Cow's Skins near a cool Stream,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>And there I value Summer's burning Heats,</l>

            <p>May not theſe Diſcourſes be thought too Clowniſh, and fitter to be ſpoken by real Country Fellows than by ſuch Shepherds as are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in Eclogues?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil,</hi> who having had the Example of <hi>Theocritus</hi> before his Eyes, has had an opportunity to outdo him, hath made his Shepherds more polite and agreeable. Any one who compares his third Eclogue with that of <hi>Laco</hi> and <hi>Comatas</hi> in <hi>Theocritus</hi> will eaſily find how well he cou'd rectifie and ſurpaſs what he did imitate: Not but that he ſtill ſomewhat too much reſembles <hi>Theocritus,</hi> when he loſes ſome time in making his Paſtors ſay,
<q>
                  <l>Beware the Stream, drive not the Sheep too nigh,</l>
                  <l>The Bank may fail, the Ram is hardly dry.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Kids from the River drive, and ſling your Hook,</l>
                  <l>Anon I'll waſh them in the ſhallow Brook.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Boys, drive to Shades, when Milk is drain'd by heat,</l>
                  <l>In vain the Milk-Maid ſtroaks an empty Teat.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is the leſs pleaſing conſidering that it comes after ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things which are very pretty and genteel, and which have made the Reader the more unfit to reliſh ſuch things as altogether relate to the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:53904:161"/>
               <hi>Calpurnius</hi> a Writer of Eclogues, who liv'd almoſt three hundred Years after <hi>Virgil,</hi> and whoſe Works however are not wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Beauty, ſeems to have been ſorry that <hi>Virgil</hi> did expreſs but with the Words, <hi>Novimus &amp; qui te,</hi> thoſe Injurious Terms with which <hi>Laco</hi> and <hi>Comatas</hi> treat one another in <hi>Theocritus;</hi> tho after all, it had yet been better had <hi>Virgil</hi> wholly ſuppreſt that ſhort hint. <hi>Calpurnius</hi> has judg'd this Paſſage worthy a larger extent and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote an Eclogue which is made up of nothing but thoſe Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, with which two Shepherds ready to ſing for a Prize, ply each other with a great deal of Fury, till the Shepherd who was to be their Judge, is ſo affrighted that he runs away and leaves 'em. A very fine Concluſion!</p>
            <p>But no Author ever made his Shepherds ſo clowniſh as <hi>J. Baptiſta Mantuanus,</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> Poet, who liv'd in the foregoing Age, and who has been compar'd to <hi>Virgil,</hi> tho he has indeed nothing common with him beſides his being of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Shepherd <hi>Fauſtus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his Miſtreſs, ſays, that ſhe had a good big bloated red Face, and that, though ſhe was almoſt blind of an Eye, he thought her more beautiful than <hi>Diana.</hi> 'Twere impoſſible to gueſs what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution another Shepherd takes before he begins a Diſcourſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length; and who knows but that our modern <hi>Mantuan</hi> valued himſelf mightily upon having copied Nature moſt faithfully in thoſe Paſſages?</p>
            <p>I therefore am of Opinion, that Paſtoral Poetry cannot be very charming if it is as low and clowniſh as Shepherds naturally are; or if it preciſely runs upon nothing but rural Matters. For, to hear one ſpeak of Sheep and Goats, and of the care that ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thoſe Animals, has nothing which in it ſelf can pleaſe us; what is pleaſing is the Idea of quietneſs, which is inſeparable from a Paſtoral Life. Let a Shepherd ſay, <hi>My Sheep are in good Caſe, I conduct them to the beſt Paſtures, they feed on nothing but the beſt Graſs,</hi> and let him ſay this in the beſt Verſe in the World, I am ſure that your imagination will not be very much delighted with it. But let him ſay, <hi>How free from anxious Cares is my Life! In what a quiet ſtate I paſs my Days! All my Deſires riſe no higher than that I may ſee my Flocks in a thriving condition, and the Paſtures wholeſome and pleaſing; I envy no Man's Happineſs,</hi> &amp;c. You perceive that this begins to become more agreeable: The reaſon of it is, that the Idea runs no longer immediately upon Country Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but upon the little ſhare of Care which Shepherds undergo, and upon the quietneſs and leiſure which they enjoy; and what is the chiefeſt point, upon the cheapneſs of their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>For, all Men would be happy, and that too at an eaſie rate. A quiet Pleaſure is the common object of all their Paſſions, and we are all controuled by a certain Lazineſs: Even thoſe who are moſt
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53904:162"/>
ſtirring are not preciſely ſuch for Buſineſs ſake, or becauſe they love to be in action, but becauſe they cannot eaſily ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Ambition, as it is too much an Enemy to this natural Lazineſs, is neither a general Paſſion nor very Delicious. A conſiderable part of Mankind is not ambitious; many have begun to be ſuch, but by the means of ſome undertakings and ties that have determin'd them before they ſeriouſly reflected on what they did, and that have made them unfit ever to return to calmer Inclinations; and even thoſe who have moſt ambition, do often complain of the Cares which it exacts and the Pains that attend it. The reaſon of this is that the Native Lazineſs, of which we were ſpeaking, is not wholly ſuppreſt, though it has been ſacrificed to that preſumptuous Tyrant of the Mind; it prov'd the weakeſt, and cou'd not over balance its Rival; yet it ſtill ſubſiſts and continually oppoſes the motions of ambition. Now no Man can be happy while he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by two warring Inclinations.</p>
            <p>However, I do not ſay that Men can reliſh a ſtate of abſolute Lazineſs and Idleneſs; No, they muſt have ſome motion, ſome agitation, but it muſt be ſuch a motion and agitation as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, if poſſible, to the kind of Lazineſs that poſſeſſes 'em; and this is moſt happily to be found in Love, provided it be taken in a certain manner. It muſt neither be a hot, jealous, touchy, furious, deſperate Love, but tender, pure, ſimple, delicate, faithful, and, that it may preſerve it ſelf in this ſtate, attended with hopes: Then the heart is taken up, but not diſturb'd; we have Cares, but no uneaſineſſes; we are mov'd, but not torn, and this ſoft Motion is juſt ſuch, as the love of Reſt, and our Native Lazineſs can bear it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, 'tis moſt certain that Love is the moſt general and the moſt agreable of all the Paſſions. So, in the State of Life which we have now deſcrib'd, there is a concurrence of the two ſtrongeſt Paſſions, Lazineſs and Love; which thus are both ſatisfied at once; and, that we may be as happy as 'tis poſſible we ſhould by the Paſſions, 'tis neceſſary that all thoſe by which we are mov'd, agree together in us.</p>
            <p>This is properly what we conceive of a Paſtoral Life. For, it admits of no ambition, nor of any thing that moves the heart with too much Violence; Therefore our Lazineſs has cauſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. But this way of living by reaſon of its idleneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility creates Love more eaſily than any other, or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges it more: But after all, what Love! A Love more innocent, becauſe the Mind is not ſo dangerouſly refin'd; more aſſiduous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who feel it are not diverted by any other Paſſion; more full of Diſcretion, becauſe they hardly have any acquaintance with Vanity; more faithful becauſe with a Vivacity of Imagination
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53904:162"/>
leſs uſed, they have alſo leſs uneaſineſs, leſs diſtaſte, and leſs fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is to ſay, in ſhort, a Love purg'd of whatever the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of human Fancy have ſophiſticated it with.</p>
            <p>This conſider'd, 'tis not to be admir'd why the Pictures which are drawn of a Paſtoral Life, have always ſomething ſo very ſmiling in them, and indulge our Fancies more than the Pompous Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſplendid Court and of all the Magnificence that can ſhine there. A Court gives us no Idea but of toilſome and conſtrain'd Pleaſures: For, as we have obſerv'd, the Idea is all in all: Cou'd the Scene of this quiet Life, with no other buſineſs but Love, be plac'd any where but in the Country, ſo that no Goats nor Sheep ſhou'd be brought in, I fanſie it would be never the worſe; for, the Goats and Sheep add nothing to its Felicity; but as the ſcene muſt lye either in the Country or in Towns, it ſeems more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to chuſe the Firſt.</p>
            <p>As the Paſtoral Life is the moſt idle of all others, 'tis alſo the moſt fit to be the Ground work of thoſe Ingenious Repreſentations of which we are ſpeaking. So that no Ploughmen, Reapers, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers or Hunts men, can by any means be ſo properly introduc'd in Eclogues, as Shepherds: Which confirms what I ſaid, that what makes this kind of Poetry pleaſe, is not it's giving an Image of a Country Life, but rather the Idea which it gives of the tranquility and Innocence of that Life.</p>
            <p>Yet there is an <hi>Idyllium</hi> of <hi>Battus</hi> and <hi>Milo,</hi> two Reapers in <hi>Theocrtius,</hi> which has Beauties. <hi>Milo</hi> asks <hi>Battus</hi> why he does not Reap as faſt as he uſed to do? He anſwers, that he is in Love, and then ſings ſomething that's very pretty about the Woman that he loves. But <hi>Milo</hi> laughs at him, and tells him he is a Fool, for being ſo idle as to be in Love; that this is not an Imployment fit for one who Works for Food; and that, to divert himſelf and excite one another to Work, he ſhould ſing ſome Songs which he denotes to him, and which altogether relate to the Harveſt. I muſt needs own that I do not ſo well like this Concluſion. For I would not be drawn from a pleaſing and ſoft Idea to another that is low and without Charms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sannazarius</hi> has introduced none but Fiſhermen in his Eclogues; and I always perceive, when I read thoſe Piſcatory Poems, that the Idea which I have of the Fiſhermen's hard and toilſome way of living, ſhocks me. I don't know what moved him to bring in Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men inſtead of Shepherds, who were in poſſeſſion of the Eclogue time out of mind, but had the Fiſhermen been in poſſeſſion of it, it had been neceſſary to put the Shepherds in their place: For, ſinging, and above all, an Idle life becomes none but Shepherds: Beſides methinks 'tis prettier and more genteel to ſend Flowers or Fruit to one's Miſtreſs, than ſend her Oyſters as <hi>Sannazarius's Lyco</hi> doth to his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:53904:163"/>
'Tis true that <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath an <hi>Idyllium</hi> of two Fiſhermen; but it doth not ſeem to me ſo beautiful as to have deſerv'd to tempt any Man to write one of that kind. The ſubject of it is this; Two old Fiſhermen had but ſparingly ſupp'd together in a wretched little Thatcht-houſe, by the Sea-ſide: One of them wakes his Bedfellow to tell him, he had juſt dreamt that he was catching a Golden Fiſh; and the other anſwers him, that he might ſtarve though he had really caught ſuch a one. Was this worth writing an Eclogue!</p>
            <p>However, though none but Shepherds were introduc'd in Eclogues, 'tis impoſſible but that the Life of Shepherds which after all is yet very Clowniſh muſt ſeſſen and debaſe their Wit, and hinder their being as ingenious, nice, and full of gallantry as they are commonly repreſented in Paſtorals. The famous Lord <hi>D'urfé's Aſtraea</hi> ſeems a leſs fabulous Romance than <hi>Amadis de gaule;</hi> yet I fanſie that in the main it is as incredible, as to the politeneſs and graces of his Shepherds, as <hi>Amadis</hi> can be as to all its Enchantments, all its Fairies, and the Extravagance of its adventures. How comes it then that Paſtorals pleaſe in ſpight of the falſity of the Characters, which ought always to ſhock us? Could we be pleaſed with ſeeing ſome Courtiers repreſented as having a Clowniſhneſs which ſhould reſemble that of real Shepherds as much as the Gallantry which Shepherds have in Paſtorals reſembles that of Courtiers? No, doubtleſs; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that Character of the Shepherds is not falſe after all, if we look upon it one way: For we do not mind the meanneſs of the Concerns that are their real Employment, but the little trouble which thoſe Concerns bring. This meanneſs would wholly exclude Ornaments and Gallantry, but on the other hand the quiet ſtate promotes them; and 'tis only on that tranquility that whatever pleaſes in a Paſtoral Life is grounded.</p>
            <p>Our Imagination is not to be pleaſed without Truth; but it is not very hard to pleaſe it; for, often 'tis ſatisfied with a kind of half Truth. Let it ſee only the half of a Thing, but let that half be ſhown in a lively manner, then it will hardly bethink it ſelf that you hide from it the other half, and you may thus deceive it as long as you pleaſe, ſince all the while it imagines that this ſingle moiety, with the Thoughts of which it is taken up, is the whole Thing. The Illuſion and at the ſame time the pleaſingneſs of Paſtorals therefore conſiſts in expoſing to the Eye only the Tranquility of a Shepherd's Life, and in diſſembling or concealing its meanneſs, as alſo in ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only its Innocence and hiding its Miſeries; ſo that I do not comprehend why <hi>Theocritus</hi> dwelt ſo much upon its Miſeries and Clowniſhneſs.</p>
            <p>If thoſe who are reſolved to find no faults in the Ancients, tell us that <hi>Theocritus</hi> had a mind to draw Nature juſt ſuch as it is, I hope that according to thoſe principles, we ſhall have ſome <hi>Idyllia</hi> of Porters, or Watermen diſcourſing together of their particular Concerns:
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53904:163"/>
Which will be every whit as good as ſome <hi>Idyllia</hi> of Shepherds ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing but their Goats or their Cows.</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs is not purely to deſcribe, we muſt deſcribe ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are delightful: When the quiet that reigns in the Country, and the ſimplicity and tenderneſs which are diſcover'd there in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love, are repreſented to me, my Imagination, mov'd and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with theſe pleaſing Ideas, is fond of a Shepherd's Life; but tho' the vile and low Employments of Shepherds, were deſcrib'd to me with all the exactneſs poſſible, I ſhou'd never be taken with 'em, and my Imagination wou'd not in the leaſt be touch'd. The chief advantage of Poetry conſiſts in repreſenting to us in a lively manner the things that concern us, and in ſtriking ſtrongly a Heart which is pleas'd with being mov'd.</p>
            <p>Here's enough, and perhaps too much againſt theſe Shepherds of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and thoſe who, like 'em, have too much of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in 'em. What we have left of <hi>Moſchus</hi> and <hi>Bion</hi> in the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kind, makes me extreamly lament what we have loſt of theirs. They have no manner of Ruſticity, but rather a great deal of Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace, and ſome Ideas wholly new and pleaſing. They are accus'd of being too florid; and I do not deny but that they may be ſaid to be ſuch in ſome few places; yet I don't know why the Criticks are more inclin'd to excuſe <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s Clowniſhneſs, than <hi>Moſchus</hi> and <hi>Bion</hi>'s Elegancy; methinks they ſhould have done the contrary. Is it not that <hi>Virgil</hi> has prejudic'd every one for <hi>Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> having done to no other the honour of imitating and copying him? Or is it not rather that the Learned have a taſte that uſes to nauſeate what is Delicate and Genteel? What ever it is, I find that all their Favour is for <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and that they have reſolv'd to dubb him Prince of the Bucolick Poets.</p>
            <p>The Moderns have not often been guilty of making their Shepherds thus Clowniſh. The Author of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> in that Romance, which otherwiſe is full of admirable things, has rather run into the other extream. Some of his Shepherds are abſolutely drawn ſuch as they ought to have been, but ſome others, if I am not miſtaken, might better have been plac'd in <hi>Grand Cyrus,</hi> or in <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Theſe Shepherds often ſeem to me Courtiers diſguis'd in a Paſtoral Dreſs, and ill Mimicks of what they would imitate; ſometimes they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me moſt Cavilling Sophiſters; for tho' none but <hi>Sylvander</hi> has ſtudied in the School of the <hi>Maſſilians,</hi> there are ſome others who happen to be as full of Subtility as himſelf; though I don't comprehend how they cou'd even but underſtand him, not having like him took their Degrees in the <hi>Maſſilian</hi> Schools.</p>
            <p>It does not belong to Shepherds to ſpeak of all ſorts of Matters, and when a Poet has a mind to raiſe his Style, he may make uſe of other Perſons. When <hi>Virgil</hi> deſir'd to give a pompous Deſcription of the imaginary Return of the Golden Age, which he promiſes to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53904:164"/>
the World at the Birth of <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Son, he ſhould not have excited the Paſtoral Muſes to leave their natural Strain, and raiſe their Voices to a pitch which they can never reach; his Buſineſs was to have left them, and have addreſs'd himſelf to ſome others. Yet I do not know after all if it had not have been better to have kept to the Paſtoral Muſes; for, he might have given a pleaſing Deſcription of the good which the Return of Peace was ready to cauſe in the Country; and this, methinks, had been as acceptable at leaſt as all thoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Wonders which he borrows of the <hi>Cumean</hi> Sibyl, this new Race of Men which is to deſcend from Heaven, theſe Grapes which are to grow on Bryars, and theſe Lambs whoſe Native Fleece is to be of a Scarlet, or Crimſon hue, to ſave Mankind the trouble of dying the Wool. He might have flatter'd <hi>Pollis</hi> more agreeably with things that might have ſeem'd more conſiſtent with probability, though, after all, even theſe perhaps did not wholly ſeem inconſiſtent with it, at leaſt to the Party concern'd; for Praiſe is ſeldom thought ſuch by thoſe on whom it is laviſh'd.</p>
            <p>Shall I dare to ſay that <hi>Calpurnius,</hi> an Author much inferiour to <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems to have handled a Subject of the ſame nature much more to the purpoſe: Take notice that I only ſpeak of the Deſign or Fable, and not at all of the Stile. He brings in two Shepherds, who to be skreen'd from the Sun's ſultry heat, ſhelter themſelves in a Cave where they find ſome Verſes written with the God <hi>Faunus</hi>'s own hand, which contain a Prophecy about the Happineſs which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is to enjoy under the Emperour <hi>Carus.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duty of a Paſtoral Poet, he dwells ſufficiently on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Plenty that relates to the Country, and then proceeds to higher Matters; becauſe, as he makes a God ſpeak, he has a Right to do ſo; but he brings in nothing like the Sibyl's Prophecies. 'Tis pity that <hi>Virgil</hi> did not write the Verſes of this Piece; neither had there been need to have had them all written by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> makes <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſay to him at the beginning of his ſixth Eclogue, that a Shepherd ought not to ſing Kings nor Wars, but to ſtick to his Flocks, and ſuch Subjects as only require a plain Stile. Without doubt <hi>Phoebus</hi>'s Counſel was very good, but I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how <hi>Virgil</hi> could forget it ſo much as to fall a ſinging immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, the original of the World, and the framing of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, according to <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Syſtem, which was a great deal worſe than to ſing Kings and Wars. I muſt needs own that I cannot in the leaſt tell what to make of this Piece; I do not underſtand what is the Deſign, nor what Coherence there is between the ſeveral parts of it: For after theſe Philoſophical Notions, we have the Fables of <hi>Hylas</hi> and <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> and of <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Siſters which have no manner of Relation to them, and in the middle of theſe Fables, which are all borrow'd from very remote times, we have <hi>Cornelius
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53904:164"/>
Gallus, Virgil</hi>'s Contemporary, and the Honours which he receives on <hi>Paruaſſus;</hi> after which, we preſently come to the Fables of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Philomela.</hi> 'Tis honeſt <hi>Silenus</hi> that gives all this fine Medly; and, as <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us, that according to his laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, he had taken a hearty Carouſe the Day before, I am afraid, the Fumes were hardly yet got out of his Head.</p>
            <p>Here let me once more take the freedom to own that I like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſign of an Eclogue of this kind, by <hi>Nemeſianus,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who was <hi>Calpurnius</hi>'s Contemporary, and who is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deſpis'd. Some Shepherds, finding <hi>Pan</hi> aſleep, try to play on his Pipe, but as a Mortal can make a God's Pipe yield only a very unpleaſing ſound, <hi>Pan</hi> is awak'd by it; and tells them, that if they are for Songs, he'll gratifie them preſently. With this be ſings to them ſomething of the Hiſtory of <hi>Bacebus,</hi> and dwells on the firſt Vintage that ever was made, of which he gives a Deſcription which ſeems to me very agreeable; this Deſign is more regular than that of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Silenus,</hi> and the Verſes alſo are pretty good.</p>
            <p>The Moderns have been often guilty of handling high Subjects in their Eclogues. The <hi>French</hi> Poet <hi>Renſard</hi> has given us in his the Praiſes of Princes and of <hi>France,</hi> and almoſt all that looks like <hi>Bucolick</hi> in them, is his calling <hi>Henry</hi> II. <hi>Henriot,</hi> [or <hi>Harry.] Charles</hi> IX. <hi>Carlin,</hi> and Queen <hi>Catherine de Medicis, Catin,</hi> [or <hi>Kate.]</hi> 'Tis true, he owns that he did not follow the Rules, but it had been better to have done it, and thus have avoided the Ridicule which the diſproportion that is between the Subject and the Form of the Work produces. Hence it happens that in his firſt Eclogue it falls to the Lot of the Shepherdeſs <hi>Margot</hi> [or <hi>Peg]</hi> to ſing the Elogy of <hi>Turnebus, Budaeus,</hi> and <hi>Vatable,</hi> the greateſt Men of their Age for <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but with whom, certainly <hi>Peg</hi> ought not to have been acquainted.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Shepherds look well in ſome kinds of Poetry, many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proſtitute them to every Subject. They are often made to ſing the Praiſes of Kings in the ſublimeſt Stile the Poet can write; and provided he has but talk'd of Oaten Pipes, Meads and Plains, Fern or Graſs, Streams or Vallies, he thinks he has written an Eclogue. When Shepherds praiſe a Hero, they ſhou'd praiſe him Shepherd-like, and I do not doubt but that this wou'd be very ingenious and taking, but it wou'd require ſome Art, and the ſhorteſt cut it ſeems is to make the Shepherds ſpeak the common Dialect of praiſe, which is very big and ſofty indeed, but very common and conſequently eaſie enough of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Allegorical Eclogues alſo are not very eaſie. <hi>J. B. Mantuanus,</hi> who was a Carmelite Fryar, has one in which two Shepherds diſpute, the one repreſenting a Carmelite Fryar, who is of that Party of the Order which they call, <hi>The ſtrict Obſervance,</hi> and the other
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53904:165"/>
of that which they call the <hi>Mitigated.</hi> The famous <hi>Bembus</hi> is their Judge; and 'tis worth obſerving, that he prudently makes them lay down their Crooks, leſt they fall together by the Ears.</p>
            <p>Now, though in the main our <hi>Mantuan</hi> has pretty well kept the Allegory, 'tis too ridiculous to find the Controverſie between theſe two ſorts of <hi>Carmelitans</hi> handled Ecloguewiſe.</p>
            <p>Yet I had rather ſee a Shepherd repreſent one of theſe, than have him act the <hi>Epicuraean,</hi> and ſay impious things; 'tis what happens ſometimes to ſome of <hi>Mantuanus</hi>'s Shepherds, though they are very Clowniſh, and he himſelf was of a Religious Order. <hi>Amyntas,</hi> one of them, in an angry fit, which makes him rail againſt the Laws and Vertue, meerly becauſe he is in Love, ſays, that Men are great Fools to feed themſelves up with a Fancy of being taken up to Heaven af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death; and he adds, that the moſt that is like to happen then, is that they may chance to tranſmigrate into ſome Birds, and ſo flutter up and down through the Air. In vain to make this excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, our Fryar ſays, that <hi>Amyntas</hi> had liv'd a long time in Town; and as much in vain <hi>Badius</hi> his worthy Commentator; for as much a Modern as <hi>Mantuanus</hi> is, he has one, and as bigotted and hot for his Author as thoſe of the Ancients; in vain, I ſay, he takes from thence an opportunity to make this rare Reflection, that Love cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to doubt of matters of Faith: 'Tis certain that theſe Errours, which ought to be deteſted by all thoſe who have heard of them, ought not to be known, much leſs mention'd by Shepherds.</p>
            <p>To make amends, ſometimes our <hi>Mantuan</hi> makes his Shepherds mighty Godly. In one of his Eclogues you have a Catalogue of all the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Holidays; in another an Apparition of the Virgin, who promiſes a Shepherd, that, when he ſhall have paſt his Life on Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> ſhe'll take him to a more pleaſant place, and will make him dwell in Heaven with the <hi>Dryades,</hi> and <hi>Hamadryades,</hi> a ſort of new-faſhion'd Saints whom we did not yet know in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</p>
            <p>Such groſs and inexcuſable Indecencies may be eaſily avoided in the Character of Shepherds, but there are ſome that are not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, of which ſome Writers cannot ſo eaſily be freed: 'Tis the making their Shepherds ſpeak too wittily. Sometimes even thoſe of the Marqueſs <hi>de Racan</hi> are guilty of this, though they generally uſe to be very reſerv'd in that point. As for the <hi>Italian</hi> Authors, they are always ſo full of falſe and pointed Thoughts, that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve right or wrong to give them leave to indulge themſelves in that darling Stile of theirs, as natural to them as their Mother Tongue. They never take the pains to make their Shepherds ſpeak in a Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stile, but make uſe of as bold and exaggerated Figures, and are as full of <hi>Conceipts</hi> in that ſort of Poetry, as they are in others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:53904:165"/>
Father <hi>Beuhours</hi> in his excellent Treatiſe <hi>of the manner of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtly in ingenious Compoſures,</hi> finds fault with <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s <hi>Sylvia,</hi> who ſeeing the Reflection of her Face in a Fountain, and adorning her ſelf with Flowers, tells them ſhe does not wear them to mend her Beauty, but to leſſen them, and diſgrace them by being plac'd near her brighter Charms. Our Judicious Critick thinks this Thought too full of Affectation, and not natural enough for a Shepherdeſs, and none can refuſe their aſſent to this Criticiſm which is the reſult of a very delicate Taſte: But when that is done, let none give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Trouble of reading <hi>Guarini</hi>'s, <hi>Bouarelli</hi>'s and <hi>Marini</hi>'s Paſtoral Poetry with a deſign to find any thing in them truly Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for <hi>Sylvia</hi>'s Thought is one of the moſt unaffected and ſingle things in the World, if compar'd to moſt of thoſe of which theſe Authors are full.</p>
            <p>And indeed <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s <hi>Amynta</hi> is the beſt Thing that <hi>Italy</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the Paſtoral kind; and has certainly very great Beauties; even the paſſage of <hi>Sylvia,</hi> except what we have obſerv'd in it, is one of the moſt ingenious and beſt deſcrib'd Things I ever read, and we ought to own our ſelves extremely oblig'd to an <hi>Italian</hi> Author, for not having been more prodigal of Pointed Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>De Segrais,</hi> whoſe Works are the moſt excellent Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern we have of Paſtoral Poetry, owns himſelf, that he did not always keep exactly to the Stile which it requires. He ſays, That he has ſometimes been obliged to humour the Genius of this Age, which delights in figures and glittering Things: But this muſt be ſaid on his behalf, that he only condeſcended to follow this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod after he had ſufficiently prov'd that he can when he pleaſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly hit the true Beauties of Paſtoral. After all, none can well tell which is the Taſte or Genius of this Age, 'tis not determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to what is good or bad, but ſeems wavering ſometimes on this and ſometimes on that ſide. So I believe, that, ſince there is ſtill a hazard to be run what ever ſide we take, 'twere better to follow the Rules and true Ideas of Things.</p>
            <p>Between the uſual Clowniſhneſs of <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s Shepherds, and the too much Wit of moſt of our Modern Shepherds, a certain <hi>Medium</hi> ſhou'd be kept, but 'tis ſo far from being eaſily follow'd in the performance, that 'tis even difficult to denote it. The Shepherds ought to have Wit, and it ought to be fine and genteel too; for they cou'd not pleaſe without it, but they ought to have that Wit only in a certain Degree, otherwiſe they are no more Shepherds: I'll endeavour to determine this Degree, and adventure to give my notion of it.</p>
            <p>The Men who have the moſt Wit, and thoſe who have but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſhare of it, do not differ ſo much in the ſenſe which they have of Things as they do in their manner of expreſſing it. The Paſſions, amidſt all the Diſturbance which they cauſe, are attended
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53904:166"/>
by a kind of Light, which they impart almoſt equally to all thoſe whom they poſſeſs. There is a certain Penetration, certain Ideas, which, without any regard to the difference of the Minds, are always found in Men in whatever concerns and affects them. But theſe Paſſions, at the ſame time that they in a manner inform the Mind of all Men alike, do not enable them to ſpeak equally well. Thoſe whoſe Mind is more refin'd, more capacious and more improv'd by Study or Converſation do, while they expreſs their Sentiments, and ſomething that hath the air of a Reflection, and that is not inſpir'd by the Paſſion alone; whereas the others ſpeak their Minds more ſimply, and add, in a manner, nothing that's foreign: Any ordinary Man will eaſily ſay; <hi>I ſo Paſſionately deſir'd that my Miſtreſs might be faithful, that I believ'd her ſuch;</hi> but it only belongs to a refin'd Wit, as the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucaut</hi> to ſay, <hi>My underſtanding was fool'd by my Will,</hi> or, <hi>My Reaſon was cully'd by my Deſire; [<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Eſprita eté en moy la Dupe du Coeur:]</hi> The Sence is the ſame, the penetration equal, but the Expreſſion is ſo different, that one would almoſt think 'tis no more the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>We take no leſs Pleaſure in finding a Sentiment expreſt ſimply, than in a more thought-like and elaborate Manner, provided it be always equally fine: Nay the ſimple way of expreſſing it ought to pleaſe more, becauſe it occaſions a kind of a gentle ſurpriſe, and a ſmall admiration. We are amaz'd to find ſomething that is fine and delicate in common and unaffected Terms; and on that account the more the thing is fine, without ceaſing to be Natural; and the Expreſſion common, without being low, the deeper we ought to be ſtruck.</p>
            <p>Admiration and ſurpriſe are ſo powerful that they can even raiſe the value of Things beyond their Intrinſick worth. All <hi>Paris</hi> has laviſh'd Exclamations of Admiration on the <hi>Siameſe</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for their Ingenious ſayings; Now had ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadors ſpoken the ſame Things, no body would have minded it. This happen'd becauſe we wrongfully ſuppos'd that ſome Men who came from the remoteſt Part of the World, of a tawny Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, dreſt otherwiſe than we are, and till then eſteem'd Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians by thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> were not to be endow'd with common Senſe; and we were very much ſurpris'd to find they had it; So that the leaſt thing they ſaid fill'd us with admiration, an Admiration which after all was Injurious enough to thoſe Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>The ſame happens of our Shepherds; for, we are the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly ſtruck with finding them thinking finely in their ſimple Style, becauſe we the leaſt expected it.</p>
            <p>Another Thing that ſuits with the Paſtoral Stile is to run only on Actions, and never almoſt on Reflections. Thoſe who have a middling ſhare of Wit, or a Wit but little improv'd by a Converſe with polite Books or Perſons, uſe to diſcourſe only of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53904:166"/>
Things of which they have had a Senſe; while others raiſing themſelves higher, reduce all things into general Ideas: The Minds of the latter have work'd and reflected upon their Sentiments and experiments, it happens that what they have ſeen hath led them to what they have not ſeen; whereas thoſe of an inferior Order, not purſuing their Ideas beyond what they have a Senſe of, it may happen that what reſembles it moſt may ſtill be new to them. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the inſatiable Deſire of the Multitude to ſee the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and their admiring always almoſt the ſame Things.</p>
            <p>A Conſequence of this Diſpoſition of Mind is the adding to the Things that are related any Circumſtances whether uſeful or not. This happens becauſe the Mind has been extreamly ſtruck with the particular Action, and with all that attended it. Contrary to this a great Genius, deſpiſing all theſe petty Circumſtances, fixes on what is moſt eſſential in Things, which commonly may be related with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>'Tis truer than it ſeems, that in ſuch Compoſures wher in Paſſion is to be deſcrib'd, 'tis better to imitate the way of ſpeaking uſed by Men of indifferent Capacity, than the Stile of more refined Wits. I muſt own that thus there is little related beſides Actions and we do not riſe to Reflections; but nothing is more graceful than Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo diſplay'd as to bring their Reflection along with them. Such is this admirable Touch in <hi>Virgil; Galataea throws an Apple at me, then runs to hide her ſelf behind the Willows, and firſt would be perceiv'd.</hi> The Shepherd does not tell you what is <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taea</hi>'s Deſign, though he is fully ſenſible of it; but the Action has made a deep pleaſing Impreſſion on his Mind, and, according as he repreſents it, 'tis impoſſible but you muſt gueſs its meaning. Now the Mind is delighted with ſenſible Ideas, becauſe it eaſily admits of them, and it loves to penetrate, provided it be without Effort; whether it be that it loves to Act but to a certain Degree, or that a little Penetration indulges its vanity. So the Mind hath the double Pleaſure, firſt of getting an eaſie Idea, then of penetrating, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuch Caſes as that of <hi>Galataea</hi> are laid before it. The Action, and, in a manner, the Soul of the Action all at once ſtrike the Eyes of the Mind; it can ſee nothing more in the matter, nor more quickly, neither can it ever be put to leſs expence.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Virgil</hi>'s ſecond Eclogue, <hi>Corydon,</hi> to commend his Pipe, tells us that <hi>Damaetas</hi> gave it him when he died, and ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art the ſecond Maſter it hath had,</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> was jealous, becauſe it was not bequeath'd him: All theſe Circumſtances are altogether Paſtoral: It might not perhaps be diſagreable to bring in a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd who is puzzled in the midſt of his Story, and who finds ſome difficulty in recovering himſelf; but this wou'd require ſome Art in the management.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:53904:167"/>
There are no perſons whom it becomes better to lengthen a little their Narrations with Circumſtances than Lovers. They ought not indeed to be abſolutely needleſs or too far-fetch'd; for, this would be tedious, though it may be natural enough; but thoſe that have but a half relation to the Action which is talk'd of, and that ſhow more paſſion than they, are conſiderable, can never fail to pleaſe. So when, in one of <hi>Monſieur de Segrais</hi>'s Eclogues, a Shepherdeſs ſays,
<q>
                  <l>The Songs which <hi>Lyſis</hi> and <hi>Menalcas</hi> ſing</l>
                  <l>Pleaſe ev'ry Swain, and make the Vallies ring;</l>
                  <l>But I like better thoſe which near <hi>This Tree,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Mr Jealous Shepherd lately made for me.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Circumſtance of the Tree is pretty, only as it had been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for any other but a Lover. According to our Idea of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Tales and Narrations become them very well; but for them to make Speeches, ſuch as thoſe in <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> full of general Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Chains of Arguments, is a thing which I do not think their Character allows.</p>
            <p>It is not amiſs to make them give deſcriptions, provided they be not very long. That of the Cup which the Goat-herd promiſes to <hi>Thyrſis,</hi> in <hi>Theocritus</hi>'s firſt <hi>Idyllium</hi> ſomewhat exceeds the Bounds: Yet, according to that Example, <hi>Ronſard,</hi> and <hi>Belleau</hi> his Contemporary, have made ſome that are yet longer. When their Shepherds are about deſcribing a Basket, a Goat or a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird, which they make the Prize of a Paſtoral Combate, they never have done: Not that their Deſcriptions are ſometimes without great Beauties, and are writ without admirable Art; far from this, they have too much of it for Shepherds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vida</hi> a Latin Poet of the laſt Age, and of great Reputation, in his Eclogue of <hi>Nice,</hi> whom I take to be <hi>Victoria Colonna,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcario</hi>'s Widow, brings in the Shepherd <hi>Damon</hi> giving a Deſcription of a Ruſh Basket which he is to make for her. He ſays, that he will repreſent in it <hi>Davalos,</hi> that is the Marqueſs, dying, and grieved that he does not die in Battle; ſome Kings, Captains, and Nymphs in Tears about him, <hi>Nice</hi> praying the Gods in vain, <hi>Nice</hi> fainting away at the News of <hi>Davalos</hi>'s Death, and with difficulty recovering her Senſes by the means of the Water which her Women throw on her Face; and he adds that he would have expreſſed many Complaints and Moans, if they could be expreſt on Ruſh. Here are a great many Things to be ſhow'd on a Basket! Neither do I relate them all; but I cannot tell how all this can be expreſt on Ruſh, nor how <hi>Damon,</hi> who owns he cannot expreſs on it the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Nice,</hi> is not at a Loſs to diſplay on it the Marqueſs's

Grief for dying in his Bed. I ſhrewdly ſuſpect that <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Shield is the Original from which this Basket has been imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>I find that <hi>Virgil</hi> has us'd ſimilitudes very often in his Paſtoral Diſcourſes: Theſe ſimilitudes are very properly brought in, to ſupply the place of thoſe trivial Compariſons, and principally of thoſe clowniſh proverbial ſayings, which real Shepherds uſe almoſt continually: But as there is nothing more eaſily to be imitated than this way of uſing ſimilitudes, 'tis what <hi>Virgil</hi> hath been moſt copied in. We find in all your Writers of Eclogues, nothing more common than Shepherdeſſes who exceed all others as much <hi>as lofty Pines e'er top the lowly Reed, or higheſt Oaks the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Shrubs exceed;</hi> we ſee nothing but the cruelty of ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherdeſſes who are to a Shepherd, <hi>What Froſts or Storms are to the tendereſt Flowers, like Hale to rip'ning Corn,</hi> &amp;c. I think all this old and worn thread-bare at this Time of Day, and to ſay the Truth on't, 'tis no great Pity. Similitudes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are not very proper for Paſſion, and Shepherds ſhou'd only uſe them when they find it difficult to expreſs themſelves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; then they wou'd have a very great Beauty, but I know but very few of that kind.</p>
            <p>Thus we have pretty near diſcover'd the Pitch of Wit which Shepherds ought to have, and the Style they ſhould uſe. 'Tis methinks with Eclogues, as with thoſe Dreſſes which are worn at Maſques or Balls; they are of much finer ſtuff than thoſe which real Shepherds uſually wear; nay they are even adorn'd with Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Points, and are only made after the Country cut. In the ſame manner the Thoughts which are the Subject matter of Eclogues, ought to be finer and more delicate than thoſe of real Shepherds; but they muſt have the moſt ſimple and moſt rural Dreſs poſſible.</p>
            <p>Not but that we ought to uſe both ſimplicity and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-like plainneſs ev'n in the Thoughts, but we ought to take notice that this ſimplicity and Country-like plainneſs only exclude your exceſſive delicacy in the Thoughts, like that of the refin'd Wits in Courts and Cities, and not the Light which Nature and the Paſſions beſtow of themſelves; otherwiſe the Poet wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and run into Childiſh Talk that wou'd beget Laughter rather than admiration. Something of this kind is pleaſant enough in one of <hi>Remi Belleau's</hi> Eclogues; where a young Shepherd, having ſtoln a kiſs from a pretty Shepherdeſs, ſays to her,
<q>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:53904:168"/>
                  <l>I've kiſt ſome new fawn'd Kids, like other Swains,</l>
                  <l>I've kiſt the ſucking Calf, which in our Plains</l>
                  <l>Young <hi>Colin</hi> gave me; but this Liſs I ſwear,</l>
                  <l>Is ſweeter much than all thoſe Kiſſes were.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſuch a Childiſhneſs ſeems more pardonable in this young Shepherd than in the Cyclops <hi>Polyphemus.</hi> In <hi>Theocritus's Idyllium</hi> that bears his Name and which is fine, he is thinking how to be reveng'd on his Mother, a Sea Nymph, becauſe ſhe never took care to make <hi>Galataea,</hi> another Sea Nymph, have a kindneſs for his Giantſhip; ſo he ſays to his Miſtreſs, that He'll tell his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make her mad, that he has à pain in his Head and in his Thighs.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard to imagine that, ugly as he was, his Mother cou'd doat on him ſo much as to be very much concern'd to hear the poor little Urchin had thoſe petty ills, or that the Clowniſh Giant cou'd invent ſo gentle a Revenge, his Character is better kept when he promiſes his Miſtreſs to make her a preſent of a Litter of Cubs, or young Bears, which he breeds for her in his Cave. And now that I ſpeak of Bears, I wou'd gladly know why <hi>Daphnis</hi> when he is going to die bids adieu to the Bears, the Lyons and the Wolves, as well as to the fair Fountain <hi>Arethuſe,</hi> and to the Silver Streams of <hi>Sicily:</hi> Methinks a Man does not often uſe to regret the Loſs of ſuch Company.</p>
            <p>I have but one Remark more to make which hath no manner of Connection with thoſe that go before: 'Tis concerning thoſe Eclogues which have a <hi>Burthen</hi> much like thoſe in Ballads, that is, a Verſe or two repeated ſeveral times. I need not ſay that we ought to place thoſe repeated. Verſes in ſuch Parts of the Eclogue as may require, or at leaſt bear ſuch a Verſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard them; but it may not be amiſs to obſerve that all the Art that <hi>Theocritus</hi> hath us'd in an <hi>Idyllium</hi> of this kind, was only to take this Burthen and ſcatter it up and down through his <hi>Idyllium</hi> right or wrong, without the leaſt regard to the Sence of the places where he inſerted it, nay without even ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome of the Phraſes which he made no difficulty to ſplit in two.</p>
            <p>I have here ſpoken with a great deal of Freedom of <hi>Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> notwithſtanding they are Ancients; and I do not doubt but that I ſhall be eſteem'd one of the Profane, by thoſe Pedants who profeſs a kind of Religion which conſiſts in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Ancients. 'Tis true, however, that I have often commended <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Theocritus;</hi> but yet I have not always
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53904:168"/>
prais'd them; much leſs have I ſaid, like the Superſtitious, that even their Faults (if they had any) were beautiful; neither have I ſtrain'd all the Natural Light of Reaſon to juſtifie them; I have partly approved, and partly conſur'd them, as if they had been ſome living Authors, whom I ſaw every day; and there lies the Sacrilege!</p>
