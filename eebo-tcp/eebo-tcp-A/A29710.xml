            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HUmble ſalutes; my laſt unto you was from <hi>Carrickvergus</hi> of the 25. paſt, wherein I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at large, what I conceived of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of this Country, as alſo how that I was deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for this place, laden with proviſion for the Army, who then was deſigned to take the <hi>Newry.</hi> It pleaſed God, that on the 18. paſt, I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here, where I found my ſelfe ſurrounded with great companies of the Rebels, whom I did know, expected daily a ſupply of Munition, wherefore to put them in hopes, I diſplayed no Collours, our men ſeeking the Channell, came with their boats ſomewhat neere the ſhore, whom the Rebels bid very welcome, and demanded whence we came, the one ſide of the Harbour, my men anſwered from <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and on the other ſide, they ſaid from <hi>France,</hi> (both which ſayings was without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) but fourteen of the Rebels ſoon came aboard, in hopes to buy Powder and Armes, (whom I laid in Irons) and preſently ſhot divers guns, as healths, in hopes to get ſome more from the ſhore, it being towards night, my project failed, wherefore the next morning, I fell to battering the Towne of <hi>Carlingford,</hi> but the ſame lay ſo far off, that I could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65636:4"/>
doe no great execution from our Ship, ſhe being almoſt without diſtance, wherefore I preſently rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a platforme upon a great open boat, which the night before I had taken, and thereon mounted two peeces of Ordnance, and ſo with all my force I could ſpare, leaving my Ship well manned, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached within a Musquet ſhot of the Town, and battered the ſame with our two guns, and being within call of the Kings Caſtle, the Rebels challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to land, promiſing they would meet me with halfe my number, whereupon I forthwith drew to a poynt, where I knew my ſelfe ſecure, and their landed 64. men, being within a Musquet ſhot of the Towne, having my great guns, ready to charge them at or as they ſhould approach, There I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long while in order of battle, but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my approached not, though in great numbers, but from that time began to burne the Towne, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their goods into the Mountaines, and the next day we had a Parley, wherein I was reſolved to have redeemed ſome Engliſh people, againſt my priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But the next morning before day, they fearing our comming a ſhore, fired all the Towne and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and left them on fire unto us, wherein are ſix Iriſh Caſtles, and the Kings Caſtle beſides, being a ſtrong hold, wherein I forthwith put a garriſon of my owne Seamen, and kept the ſame about fifteene dayes, unt ill I procured from Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> reliefe from <hi>Dundalke,</hi> unto whom I ſurrendred the ſaid Towne and Caſtle, about the time of our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this place. The Army was likewiſe come to the <hi>Newry,</hi> which they tooke in without many
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65636:4"/>
ſhot, the Souldiers flying away from them, aſſoon as they hea rd the Army marched toward them, the <hi>Ditto</hi> Army for want of ſome neceſſeries, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>Carrickvergus,</hi> where three dayes ſince they are arrived without any oppoſition, being not above 3500, men, under command of a gallant Souldier Colonell <hi>Mouro,</hi> and for my owne part I am deſigned thither, only wait for a faire wind, where I hope to find ſome letters from you, being exceedingly deſirous to heare your Newes. Tis now daily more and more to be ſeene and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that famine muſt doe that which our ſwords cannot, for I doe now conceive they will never ſtand to fight any conſiderable battell, but will continue in the Woods, Bogs, and Mountaines, all day, and in the night they ſteale, fire and burne, and will ſo continue ſtill, removing as the Army moves, and will never fight except upon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and indeed as yet they have very little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and few armes, and are daily more and more diſcouraged, finding no ſupply. As for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon poore people, I beleeve a great part of them were at firſt forced to this action, by the threats of the great ones, and the curſes of Prieſts if they did not; it is beleeved moſt of them would lay downe their armes at the feet of the Brittiſh, provided they might ſave their lives onely, but this were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, and ſoone would beget a new Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have great ſtore of Cattell in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines with them, but tis hoped this winter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming will ſhrinke them, and their Garrons which they in holes have hid, ſo that I doubt not but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65636:5"/>
will ſoone come in among them afterward, and doe much more execution then all our Armies if they were five times more, eſpecially if they bee deprived of this ſummers courſe by our forces, as is hoped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have Cowes enough, but as yet they are hardly mans meat, nor will not be this two moneths. The Ship <hi>Peter</hi> is guarding the North Coaſt, and hath relieved <hi>Colraine</hi> and <hi>London Derry</hi> with ammunition. Thus hoping to heare of your welfare, I take leave for preſent, and reſt,</p>
