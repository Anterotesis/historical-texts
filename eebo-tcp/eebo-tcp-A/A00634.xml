            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lawe is a doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/> giuen of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="b"/> commaunding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> to the whole man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience, in doing thoſe things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="e"/> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
which in the Lawe are commaunded,
and fleeing thoſe only which there are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.

            <p>4 <hi>Perfect obedience.</hi>) A ſeconde difference
of the Law and Goſpell is gathered: for the
Goſpell asketh but a true faith, not perfect,
Marke 9. 24. 1. Theſ. 3. 10. Alſo by this, not
onely the thing, but the neceſſarie meanes
to the things is commaunded and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

            <p>That the firſte worke may better bee
wrought, the Lawe hath two properties,
Deut. 28. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curſe or puniſhment,</hi> whiche is the firſte,
which puniſheth the leaſt offence with the
wrath of God to be felt for euer ſin ſoule &amp;
body, called death, Gal. 3. 10. Rom. 6. 23. &amp;
5. 12. 13. Deut. 27. 26. Gene. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſing or rewarde,</hi> which is the ſeconde,
giuing to the perfect obedience of all, the
fauour of God to be felt with all bleſſing in
ſoule and body for euer, called life, Deut. 6.
24. 25. Leuit. 18. 5. Deut. 30. 19. 20.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the Lawe, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
and vſe of it. Nowe followeth the
interpretation of it, where is declared what
is commaunded and forbidden.</p>
            <p>In the interpretation of the Lawe, muſt
be ſeene what is commaunded and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Prou. 2. 9.</p>

in the diuiſion generall of the lawe.</p>
            <p>The whole Lawe is diuided by the Lord
him ſelfe into two tables.</p>
            <p>The firſt doeth contayne thoſe dueties
which we owe to him directly in his ſeruice
Deut. 4. 13. and Exod. 34. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>The ſecond which we owe vnto our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Mat. 22. 36. Rom. 13. 8. 9.</p>
            <p>In this diuiſion wee are charged twoo
thinges. Firſt, that to perfect obedience of
the Lawe, we ſhould bring theſe two ſortes
of dueties ſounde and whole, as thoſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
then onely are pleaſing vnto God, when
they are found togither. Mich. 6. 7. 8. 1. Ioh.
5. 2. and 4. 20. 21. Here then is forbidden,
the ſeuering of them, as ſome will ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in exerciſe of religion, as they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
other dueties towardes men, as Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
Fathers, Magiſtrates, &amp;c. And ſome
ſeeke ſo to pleaſe theſe in ſeuerall dueties,
<pb facs="tcp:18776:6"/>
as they neglect too much the other, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Lawe of God, hearing the word
preached, and calling it to minde beeinge
hearde, &amp;c. Both which are condemned as
vngodly and vniuſt. Rom. 24. 26. Tit. 1. 4.
The forgiueneſſe of this ſin is had in Chriſt,
who was condemned as a blaſphemer, this
righteouſnes is imputed to vs from him.
Iohn 17. 1. 34. 5. 6. &amp;c. Heb. 5. 7. 8. And with
this grace, the other, to be godly and iuſt, is
alwayes giuen. Tit. 2. 13. aud 12. 13. Hence
we are taught, that feeling ſome readines
vnto godlineſſe, we ſhould turne our ſelues
alſo to endeuour to worke iuſtice: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
the ſeconde thing commaunded in
this diuiſion, is, we ſhould preferre loue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
&amp;c. The dueties we owe to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe we owe to men, Mat. 22. 36. 1.
Sam. 13. 11. 12. The remedie in Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
as a blaſphemer, yet ſought the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

mercie maketh vs come to this duetie,
Actes 4. 18. 19. Here we muſt often marke
howe by ſtealth we ſhall be drawne to the

reſiſt it. Hitherto what is commanded and
forbidden generallie in the Lawe. Nowe

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt commaundement, Exod. 20.
2. 3. verſe, we muſt conſider firſt the reaſon,
then the precept. <hi>I am the Lorde thy God.</hi>
I take this to be a reaſon of the next verſe:
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r if it were a precept, it ſhould redounde,
ſeeing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie being forbidden in that
which followeth this, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
alſo. 2. It is not like the other 3. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
reaſons annexed, this the firſt and the
chiefeſt ſhould wante. 3. A generall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
of the lawe went before. Wee maye
note the reaſons are added, to ſhewe vs our
ſinne the better, when we ſhall ſee we haue
broken not a bare precept, but a precept
perſwaded by ſuch vnanſwerable reaſons.
Alſo that when we riſe by Chriſt, we might
not onely be taught what to doo, but bee
allured to it. <hi>Thy Lord.</hi> This worde <hi>Iehoua</hi>
noteth out his being eternall, infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and ending of all thinges. Exod. 3.
14. Reuel. 1. 8.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth, this Lawe appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to all; becauſe he is the Lorde of all.
<hi>Thy God:</hi> that is, one who doeth vouchſafe
thee a peculiar fauour, when in thy creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18776:7"/>
he indued thee with corporall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
benefites, and doeth enritch thee vnto
eternall life, Pſal. 144. 15. Heb. 8. 10. Ezec.
36. 26. 32. Luke 37. 38. Heb. 11. 16. By
this appeareth, that neither we nor the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
had promiſes of this lyfe onely: laſtly,
that the true fountaine of ſubiection vnto
God, is this aſſurance, He is our God, Ioſua.
24. 16. Rom. 12. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 1. <hi>Which broght.</hi>
By this we are taught the better to nouriſhe
the former roote of obedience, to call of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to remembrance the particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
of God. By this appeareth that the
Lawe was giuen to the Iewes, &amp; vs, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to bring vs vnto Chriſte, but alſo to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
&amp; inſtruct vs to obedience when Chriſt
is receyued. Thus much of the reaſon.
Nowe followeth the commaundement:
<hi>Thou ſhalt haue no ſtraunge or other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me.</hi> To haue an other God, is to ſett
vp an other whom we will acknowledge to
be of power, of goodnes, iuſtice, of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
nature, and therefore feare, loue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
hang on him in all eſtates, Deut.
26. 17. 18. As they looke for him to bee
their God, as aboue, ſo that where this is
wanting, eyther on the part of God, or the
people, they are called without God, Ephe.
2. 12. Not his people, Oſe. 1. 9. This the
Lord forbiddeth to be attributed vnto any
<pb facs="tcp:18776:7"/>
but his owne Maieſtie, becauſe he onely is
the Lord our God, and by this forbiddinge
commaundeth the contrary, that he onely
ſhould be acknowledged God, hee alone ſo
loued, feared, reuerenced, &amp;c. In this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
therefore we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/> firſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the true knowledge of one true
God, then the confidence and loue &amp; feare,
&amp;c. whiche is to bee giuen to his perſon.
The true knowledge of the true God, is to
knowe his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="b"/> nature ſpirituall, infinite, pure,
conſtant, moſt ſimple, &amp;c. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> his properties

layde on Chriſte, and the anguiſhe of

laid on him: by which alſo we die vnto this
ſinne, and rayſe this part of obedience, Eph.
4. 13. After this true acknowledging of the
Lorde out of his worde, muſt proceed: firſt
a ſure confidence in the Lorde, with the
fruites of the ſame, Pſal. 100. 3. Then the
other affections of loue, reuerence, feare of
the Lorde: Alſo a ſure confidence in the
Lord, is from the aſſurance of his fauour,
to be aſſured from him onely for continual
defence, deliuerance, and ſuccour in ſoule

Hitherto of the commaundement it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now foloweth the reaſon, which is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn
from a double propertie of the Lorde:
his Ielouſie in wrath, and his mercie. <hi>For I
the Lord thy God. i</hi> Euen then being ioyned
vnto thee by my mercifull couenaunt, as a
huſband to his wife, Chap. 19. 6. <hi>A ſtrong
God.</hi> The firſt title is added to note his great
power, to doe what hee will, ſo that being
preſwaded in the firſte propertie of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
to puniſhe, and in the ſecond of his
readines to reward. And firſt in this of his
power we neede not to doubt at all, &amp; ſuch
vſe we ſhould make of his Titles. Pſal. 2. 12.

or any manner of behauiour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that which appertaineth to them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and by this wee gather the greatneſſe
of the ſinnes, eyther of groſſe Idolatrie,
or any countenaunce vnto it.</p>
               <p>This Ielouſie he ſetteth further forth by the
fruite that the Lord puniſheth ſeuerely this
ſin. <hi>Viſitinge iniquitie. i</hi> puniſhing this ſinne
<pb facs="tcp:18776:14"/>
or the tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this law in diſſoluing
this holy bande: for ſo the generall worde
Iniquitie, and euill is taken ſomtimes for
ſome ſpeciall great ſinne, as Deut. 17. 2. Pſal.
78. 39. And here it appeareth that it muſt be
ſo taken, becauſe it is not a reaſon of the
whole lawe, but of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement only
This is further declared by the perſons
on whom it falleth. <hi>The thrd and fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
which is both becauſe by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſinne diſanulling the couenaunt by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie,
the child falleth out of the ſame,
&amp; continuing in that fall, is puniſhed iuſtly
for his owne ſinne, and his fathers both.
Mat. 23. 25. And therefore that which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<hi>Thoſe that hate me.</hi> That is thoſe that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſpiritual whoredom againſt this
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement: and ſo this is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
to that. Ezech. 18. <hi>Exerciſing benignitie.</hi>
This is the ſeconde propertie wherein the
Lorde declareth his reward towardes the
keeper of this Law, that is, free liberalitie or
bountie (for ſo the word ſignifieth) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
them into a couenant of lyfe and
bleſſedneſſe, yea &amp; that eternall. Act. 2. 37.
Out of this wee learne that as a childe to his
father, when wee ſhall do all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
wee are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/> but vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
and haue done but our dutie: &amp; as if
<pb facs="tcp:18776:14"/>
our father leaue vs no patrimonie, are wee
leſſe bound to do our duetie, ſo if the Lord
had not bound himſelfe by his couenant,
which came from his free and vndeſerued
goodnes, could we haue claymed any thing
by fulfilling, becauſe wee did but our dutie,
for the mercie of creating vs in great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
according to his owne likenes in holines
and righteouſnes. But now hauing ſo many
times offended ſince the knoweledge of his

corruption and continuall ſeruing of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
from the ſame dailie, how is it not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
onely, without all deſeruing, when he

all which are vttered by the Hebrew

practiſe the true vſe of GOD his name in
all the outward meanes of his worſhippe, by
being prepared reuerently to take it vp, by
bringing the proper affections in the vſe of
it, and by ſhooting at that moſt profitable
end, which he hath appointed for euery one
Al which we muſt conſider in euery of them
ſeuerally and firſt in thoſe things, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
imprinted his name in them, hee hath

to him, his titles, and workes. His
titles according to the double vſe of them
ſimply, or in an othe hath double caution
ſet downe in the word. In the ſimple vſe we
muſt be prepared either by premeditation,
or els by ſome occaſion going afore, which
doeth ſtirre vp the ſeuerall affections of the
heart in the vſe of them. Rom. 9. 5. 1. Tim. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18776:16"/>
17. 2. Chron. 24. 22. Here is forbidden the
vſuall taking vp of the titles of God, not
hauing our affection prepared to the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
vſe of them: by any of theſe meanes, the
proper affection here muſt be according to
the title and vſe of it, as in the example of
Zach. 2. Chron. 24 22.. Being lead by the
occaſion of their vniuſt &amp; vnmercifull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

ſo made vſe of that glorious title the Lord

The vſe of his titles muſt bee eithet

Here is forbidden the vſe of the name of

commonly at euery trifle, if but vnawares
wee let fall a thing, or when wee vtter ſome

<pb facs="tcp:18776:16"/>
Or in blaſphemy. Leuit, 14. 11. When wee
vſe the name of God in an oath, according
to the excellencie of this dutie, wee muſt be
diligently prepared by earneſt &amp; ſufficient
conſideration of the perſon of the Lorde, to
whoſe iudgement we commit our ſelues, of
the cauſe &amp; matter where about we ſweare
with all other circumſtances appertaining

the ceremonie of lifting vp their
handes vnto the Lorde, which called them
to minde with whom they had in this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
to deale. Gene. 14. 22. So ſomtimes they
added or put it ſteede of the creatures of

not to giue the honour of an oath vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

which were moſt ſenſible in thoſe thinges.

called ſwearing in trueth. Iere. 4. 2. The
ende is to make knowne a very weightie
trueth, which cannot by any other meanes
bee ſo conueniently knowne, And this is
to ſweare for a iuſt cauſe. Iere. 4. 2. Hebr. 6.

of God. For the workes of God, any

not generall, I haue not found. The affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which is proper in the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t conſideration
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is great reuerence and ſweete feeling
of the glory of God, which any manner of
way is found in them. Pſal. 64. 9. 10. &amp; 104.

&amp;c. in which ſort wee ſpeak ſomtime of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſomtime of holy matrimonie, yea
ſomtime of the ioyes of heauen, &amp; paines of

kingdome of God. Pſal. 145. 11. 12. To vs,
that wee and our poſteritie may better

make any ſuch vſe, but harden our hartes
againſt all his workes, both of iuſtice and

which are directlie attributed vnto him.
Nowe followeth the other in the priuate

               <p>Nowe followeth that duetie whiche one

in the ſanctification of his Saboth. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
So he ſeemeth to ſpeake, becauſe when
as this commandement was before giuen,
they had neglected the ſame. The Saboth
day to ſanctifie, that is, to ſeparate it from a
<pb facs="tcp:18776:20"/>
common vſe, and dedicate it to a peculiar
and holy vſe vnto the Lord. So the golde,
the veſſels, &amp;c. were ſaide to be holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
for the holy vſe of the Temple, and
might not be giuen or put to any other vſe:
To ſanctifie a Saboth therefore, is to call
our ſelues, not from our owne ſinful wayes,
which we muſt doe euery day, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
honeſt and lawfull callings, that giuing our
ſelues to godly and chriſtianly exerciſes of
our fayth, wee may bee ſtrengthened in the
wayes of God, and ſo in thought, word, and
deede conſecrate a glorious Saboth vnto
the Lord. Therefore it is called the Saboth
of God, Exod. 20. 10. and Leui. 23. 3. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it a holy conuocation, that is, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to holy meetings. So Eſai 58. 13. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is confuted their opinion that take it a
Saboth kept, if thei reſt from their labours,
ſo in the meane time they labour in playes,
dauncings, vaine ſonges and enterluds, &amp;c.
as though the Lord had called vs from our
profitable labour commanded, to diſpleaſe
him in theſe vanities. Againe others alſo
who if they be better then the former, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayning
from thoſe things, haue notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their heades, hartes, and mouthes,
ſo full of worldly things, as they doe not in

when as it ſhould be kept as the reſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:18776:20"/>
Lawe, not onely in action, but alſo in the
thoughtes of the heart and wordes of the
mouth. Eſa. 58. Amos. 8. 5. But before wee
come to the proper and peculiar exerciſes,
we will ſet downe reaſons that proue it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall

Firſt becauſe of the couenaunt of the lawe,

meditate in his creatures of his wiſedome,

1. &amp; 18. 4. Luke 4. 11. 2. Kings 4. 23. Priuate
exerciſes are for our ſelues to encreaſe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
for others their comfort. Nehe. 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort are reioicing in the worde
receyued, and profiting by that. Alſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
conference, &amp;c. on the workes of
God, that ſo wee might not onely by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but by experience be taught, and ſo
be brought to greater feeling, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
Deut. 5. 20. For other, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
dueties of loue in relieuinge, and
comfortinge the needie, as well bodily by
our helpe, as ſpiritually by comfort and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
out of the worde, edifying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our moſt holy fayth, 1. Corin. 14. 2.
Mat. 12. In theſe things our contempt, and
neglect both of the mercie of the Lorde,
who hath ordayned ſo many good meanes
to increaſe our knowledge, our feelinge in
the faith and good workes, his wiſedome,
<pb facs="tcp:18776:22"/>
who hauing regarde to our weaknes, hath
giuen vs ſuch great varietie, that alwayes
being wearie of the one, we may breath our
ſelues in the other. In this as in the reſt,
and the commaundement going before, we
muſt haue the ſinnes forgiuen in the ſonne
of God his obedience here, Luk. 13. 10. to
the 18. verſe, Luke 13. 4. 5. In him alſo wee
muſt receyue power with this former grace
to die vnto this ſinne, and riſe vnto this part
of obedience.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the reaſon whereby he
doeth both make plaine the obedience, and
allure vs vnto it. He allureth, becauſe hee
giueth this equitie perpetuall, that ſeeinge
in ſixe dayes wee may doe all our worke,
which is neceſſarie for the maintenance of
this life, and prouiſion of our families, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is declared by theſe oppoſitions in the
9. and 10. verſes. Six dayes thou ſhalt work,
but the ſeauenth is the reſt or Saboth of the
Lorde thy God. In ſixe dayes doe all thy
worke, in the ſeauenth doe no worke, but
of the Saboth. Mat. 12. 5. <hi>The Saboth vnto
the Lorde,</hi> Here, as in that afore, are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
confuted, who ordayned Saboths to
Saintes and Angels, a worſhip due to the
Lorde onely, who alſo tooke away this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of ſixe dayes wholy, and too often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No manner of worke,</hi> except for frugall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb facs="tcp:18776:22"/>
of putting on of appareil, of meate,
drinke, &amp;c. whiche muſte bee as meanes to
helpe and ſuccour the weakenes of tender
and olde age, the ſtrength of ſtrong men in
this exerciſe, who if they ſhould ordinarely
abſtayne on that day from theſe thinges, it
would make them much vnable to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe
that worke of the Lorde, and ſo it is
expounded, Luke 13. 15. Wherefore that of
Exod. 35. 3. was a rudiment ceremoniall,
whereby they were inſtructed to the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the ſame, when as otherwiſe they
might doe great things. This is further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by a diſtribution of the efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<hi>Thou, nor thy Sonne, nor thy Daughter, nor
thy Seruaunt.</hi> By which wee ſee we doe not
rightlie obſerue the Saboth, except all with
in our gates, that is, our authoritie, (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe they bound the proper place of
euery man where he exerciſeth any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie)
doe likewiſe ſanctifie the ſame. The
ſecond reaſon is drawne from the example
of the Lorde him ſelfe, the more to allure
vs and moue vs, who contende to come
neere the excellent. ſo Chriſte gaue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for vs to followe. <hi>For the Lord made
heauen and earth in ſix dayes, but the ſeauenth
he rested.</hi> By that ſeuenth day, hee poynteth
out the Iewes Saboth, the ſeauenth from
the creation, to the which day they were
<pb facs="tcp:18776:23"/>
neuer preciſely tyed, becauſe being the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
it carried a note of perfection, and ſo
did ſhadowe out the excellencie of our reſt
vnder Chriſt, Heb. 4. 20. and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that was ceremoniall, that proper day
was pointed out to Adam, Gen. 2.</p>
               <p>Whereas if this had not bin ceremoniall, he
had not needed, becauſe the morall equitie
of one in ſeuen, was written in his heart, as
aboue hath bene noted. And thus as it was
a figure of our ſanctification and adoption,
it was not a piece of the first table, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
generall to the whole lawe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that reſpect is aboliſhed. Col. 2. 16.</p>
