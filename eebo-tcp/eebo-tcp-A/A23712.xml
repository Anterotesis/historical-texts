            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the two precedent Chapters, 13, and 14. you ſhall find, that <hi>Abſalom</hi> fully diſcovered his many Vices of Revengefulneſſe, Malice, Inſolency, Diſſimulation, Pride, Impatience, Vnthankfullneſſe, Iuſtifying himſelf in his faults, even in the Murther of his Brother <hi>Amon</hi>; and being thus ſeaſoned, he turnes Traytor; <hi>For Treaſon never goes alone, it is alwaies <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhered in with other notorious vices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he is reſolved to enter into the Rebellion, he firſt amuſes the Common people with an opinion of his Gallantry. [Chap. 15. v. 1. <hi>He prepareth Horſes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51745:3"/>
and fifty men to run before him.] Such Shewes he knew would prevaile much with the multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he poſſeſſeth them wirh an opinion of his induſtry, and wins upon their affections, with his Affability. [v. 2. <hi>He roſe up early, and ſtood beſide the way of the Gate, and it was ſo, that when any man that had a controverſie came to the King for judgement, then Abſalom call'd unto him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with him.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But yet this was not enough, unleſſe he ſlandered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governement, for he ſaith to him, [v. 3. <hi>See thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is good and right, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.] The Common ſort love to be flattered, and are naturally inclined to beleive ill of their Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he is liberall in his Proteſtations, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he would doe for a ſudden Reformation if he were in Authority; and ſaid moreover [v. 4. <hi>O that I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any Suite or Cauſe might come to me, and I would doe them Juſtice.] He muſt raiſe an expectation of the new, who goes about to alter the frame of the old Governement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to winne upon them whom he intended to abuſe, he aboundeth in courteous and civill behaviour toward thoſe who make their application to him. [v. 5. <hi>When any came nigh to him, to do him obeyſance, he put forth his hand and took him and kiſſed him] And herein he dealt ſubtilly to gaine a generall applauſe, he did not speake ſome faire, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect others,</hi> [but v. 6. <hi>In this manner did Abſalom to all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell that came to the King for judgement, and ſo Abſalom ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſraell.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Yet all this while he is not come to the height of his wickedneſſe, untill he make Religion the Stale for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. [v. 7. <hi>Abſalom ſaid to the King, I pray thee let me go and pay my Vow which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.] And the King gave him leave, and he went.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he having thus infatuated the hearts of the Men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad of performing an Act of Devotion, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. [v. 10. <hi>Abſalom ſent ſpies</hi> (as Committees)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51745:3"/>
               <hi>throughout all the Tribes of Iſraell, ſaying, as ſoone as yee ſhall heare the ſound of the Trumpet, then yee ſhall ſay Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom raigneth in Hebron.] A cheife City in Iſraell yee ſee, was the place where the Covenant was made, and the vow to be performed, and thus the Scene of Rebellion being laid in the ſanctified City, it spred quickly throughout the reſt of the Kingdome like Wilde-fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some (no doubt) went with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who were of the Plot, but [v. 11. <hi>others went in their ſimplicity and knew not any thing.] Alas! its no hard matter to miſlead many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſoules by example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet when they are gathered, they muſt be kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the opinion that wiſemen are in the Plot. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, [v. 12. <hi>Abſalom ſent for Ahitophell the Gilonite, Davids Councellour, from his City, even from Gilok, while he offered Sacrifice.] There is never ſo much danger of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Subjects, as when the Kings Councellours, when his great Councell turne head againſt him, specially under the counterfeit maske of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, and not till now,<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> is the Treaſon diſcovered to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> acquaints his Servants therewith, who were with him at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and he ſaid to them, [v. 14. <hi>Ariſe and let us fly, for we ſhall not elſe eſcape; make speed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part leaſt he overtake us ſuddainly, and bring evill upon us.] There is no dallying in time of eminent danger.</hi> And, [v. 15. <hi>The Kings ſervants ſaid to the King behold thy ſervants are ready to doe whatſoever my Lord the King ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, [v. 16. <hi>The King went forth and all his houſhold after him,</hi> and, [v. 17. <hi>They tarried in a place that was far off.] I doe not finde that then, or at any time after, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt</hi> David <hi>as a fault, that he then left the City, or His great Councell, who had firſt left him, and their Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this is obſervable, That although the Kings depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were ſuddaine, it was not in diſorder, [v. 18. <hi>All his ſervants paſſed on beſides him, and all the Cherethites, and all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51745:4"/>
the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, even</hi> 600 <hi>men, which were come from Gath, went before the King.] Theſe were his Life-Guard, and his ſervants, and his Guard in thoſe daies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke not their Maſter the King in his distreſſe.</hi> And all this while, or after this, I doe not finde what the Kings fault was, which might provoke <hi>Abſalom</hi> and the people to this Rebellion. <hi>David was a good King, and a wiſe, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man, a man after Gods owne heart, and yet he was not free from this misfortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt others who attended the King, <hi>Ittai</hi> (who as is conceived was the Sonne of the King of <hi>Gath</hi>) was one who went over to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> with <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Gath. It was not objected againſt</hi> David, <hi>or</hi> Ittai, <hi>as a fault, that he was a ſtranger, and yet did offer to aſſiſt the King againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; nor in truth is it a fault now, unleſſe in this, that ſtrangers ſhould thus condemne the Naturall borne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the King would have diſſuaded <hi>Ittai</hi> from going with him, and ſaid, [v. 19. <hi>Wherefore goeſt thou with us? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to thy place, and abide with the King, for thou art a ſtranger, depart thou therefore to thy place.] Strangers may not be compell'd to ſerve in ſuch a caſe; but they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaind, if they be willing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Ittai</hi> would not be diſſuaded, but anſwered the King thus, [v. 21. <hi>As the Lord liveth, and as my Lord the King liveth, in what place my Lord the King ſhall be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in life or death, even there ſurely will thy ſervant be.] True fidelity is then beſt tryed, when the event is doubtfull, and good Princes ſhall do well to obſerve ſuch followers and ſuch Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 24, 27, 28.</note>Amongſt others, <hi>Zadook</hi> the high-Prieſt, and <hi>Abiathar</hi> and the <hi>Levites,</hi> would have gone with the King. <hi>They did well to offer their Services, for in ſuch times no Subject is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> ſent them back of purpoſe to gaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence by their meanes. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> their two Sonnes, being truſty Perſons fit for that imployment. <hi>Good intelligence is an important piece of Service in time of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51745:4"/>
Warre especially, and it is a principall point of wiſedome to imploy fit Inſtruments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Huſhai,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 32, 33, 34.</note> alſo a Councellour to the King would have gone with him. <hi>Indeed I wonder how any Councellour can abſent himſelfe at ſuch a time; but by the Kings owne directions, as</hi> Huſhai <hi>did</hi>: But he was ſent back of purpoſe, that he being a ſad wiſe man and a faithfull, might undermine the crafty Councell of <hi>Ahithophel. Both in times of Warre, and of Peace, ſuch expedients muſt be uſed, and then are not only lawfull but neceſſary, and amongst other policies, divertion is many times of great uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As good Men upon ſuch Accidents follow the King in his loweſt Fortune, out of Duty and Conſcience, ſo doe ſome wicked and falſe men, for by-reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ziba,</hi> the Servant of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 16. v. 1.</note> comes to meet the King, and brings a Preſent with him, the outſide was faire, to ſhew his duty to the King, but the true Errand was, to inſinuate with the King, and by a falſe Lye to betray his Maſter. <hi>This kind of Court craft is practiced too often; but a wiſe King, ſooner or latter, will find thoſe out who uſe it, and ſeverely puniſh it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time alſo,<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> the King met with another miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant of another diſpoſition. <hi>Shemei</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Gera</hi>; he finding the King in theſe ſtreights railed at him, and curſed him to his face. <hi>After-ages have alſo found many</hi> Shimei's, <hi>who ſtick not to raile at God's Annointed; but doubtleſſe ſuch will meet with their reward, as</hi> Shimei <hi>did, in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abiſhai</hi> being then preſent,<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> his fingers itched to take off the head of this foule-mouth'd man; but <hi>David</hi> made other uſe of this Affliction, and would not give way thereto at that time. <hi>There are ſeaſonable times for patience, as well as for Juſtice, and good Princes will diſcerne the ſeaſons thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We left <hi>Huſhai</hi> a while ſince,<note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> when he left the King to follow <hi>Abſalom.</hi> But you obſerve it was by the King's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall direction, and for his better Service. <hi>Elſe it had been a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51745:5"/>
Crime unpardonable in him, had he done it of his owne head, and a good intent would not have excuſed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21, 22, 23.</note>This Plot of ſending <hi>Huſhai</hi> to <hi>Abſalom</hi> proſpered well, for <hi>Ahithophel</hi> gave ſhrew Counſells indeed, for one was, That <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſhould goe into his Fathers Concubines, and that publickly, that ſo the breach between him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might be ſo wide, that it ſhould be irreconcileable. <hi>A desperate Counſell it was, that he and his Co-adjutors being put paſt hope of pardon, they ſhould be put paſt feare of retracting; And thus when the wicked Counſells of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour prosper, he is cryed up for an Oracle, as</hi> Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel <hi>was.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By this time was the Kings Army well increaſed,<note place="margin">Chap. 18. v. 1, 2,</note> and now the King divides it into three <hi>Tertia's,</hi> under the Command of ſeverall Colonells or chiefe Captaines. <hi>That was the courſe then, and that's the courſe ſtill, where there are formed Armies, for Order must be kept in all great Actions, both in times of Peace and Warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To encourage the Souldiery,<note place="margin">Verſ. 3, 4,</note> the King would have gone into the Battell in Perſon; But the People diſſuaded him, ſaying [<hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us</hi>] and the King hearkned unto them. <hi>For the Perſon of the King ought not to be hazarded, but in Caſes of inevitable neceſſity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>When this was related to <hi>Joab</hi> the Captaine of the Kings Hoſt, and he underſtood, that <hi>Abſalom</hi> was not yet dead,<note place="margin">Verſ. 10, 14, &amp;c.</note> he was not ſatisfied till he had taken three darts, and ſtrook him thorough the heart. <hi>It is not ſafe to deale remiſſely with notorious and dangerous offenders.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Chap. 19. v. 1,</note>But when <hi>Joab</hi> (an old Commander) obſerved what impreſſion this took with the Souldiery, he told the King very home of this unſeaſonable Error. <hi>Some body muſt deale plainly and truly with the King in ſuch Caſes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo it be done with diſcretion.</hi> He told plainly to the King,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6,</note> That it would hazard the loſſe of the hearts of his People, if they ſhould apprehend, that he loved his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hated or neglected his Friends.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The King gratiouſly accepted <hi>Barzillai's</hi> fidelity,<note place="margin">Verſ. 33,</note> and moved that he ſhould goe along and live in Court with him, (<hi>Barzillai</hi> was for his quality, a Perſon might have befitted it,) but he was very aged, unfit for a Court life, and he was alſo wiſe and underſtood his owne imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and unfitneſſe to turne Courtier at that Age, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore modeſtly and thankfully he refuſed that gratious offer. <hi>It were to be wiſh'd, that none were imploy'd in places for which they are not fit, and that men were ſo modeſt and ſo wiſe, as not to accept of ſuch imployments when they are offered.</hi>
