            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 TIM. II. 1, 2.</bibl>
               <q>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding the Care at firſt, which was taken in planting the Goſpel of Chriſt, and that the Doctrines and Precepts thereof were publiſh'd by Men divinely inſpired, yet Errors of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nature did early creep into the Church.</p>
            <p>Two of which are oppoſed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text; the one concerned the Extent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and the other related to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection due to the Civil Magiſtrate. It was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Opinion among the <hi>Jews</hi> who were the firſt Converts to Jeſus Chriſt, That his Goſpel was only to be preached to themſelves; and that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42930:4"/>
the Infinite Happineſs promiſed in it, ſhould be limited to the People of their own Nation.</p>
            <p>They were puff'd up with the long Courſe of Favours God had been pleas'd to vouchſafe unto them, and could not endure with patience to hear and think, that under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould ſtand on a Level with them, and become equally capable of the hopes and means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> would have ſhut the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God out of the World, ſo They would have confined the illuſtrious Manifeſtations of it by Jeſus Chriſt, to the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the peculiar Care of God, the Laws he made to govern them were chiefly Political, and had regard to their Publick Good and Safety as a Nation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, like the Civil Laws of other Countries; and Submiſſion to them was enforced by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>But when it pleaſed him to enact Laws which were for the Reformation of the Minds and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as well as the Manners of Men, and which would not only advance their general Good in this Life, but procure their Eternal Welfare in the next, it ſeemed agreeable to his boundleſs Goodneſs and Wiſdom, that what he intended for the Advancement of Human Nature, and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42930:4"/>
Reparation of his own Image in the Souls of Men, which was defaced by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and Man's own wilful Tranſgreſſions, ſhould reach to all who did partake of that Nature.</p>
            <p>And this being the higheſt Favour his poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Creatures were capable of receiving, it was his merciful Reſolution not to deny any of them the Means to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that the Merit of Chriſt's Death was to extend not only to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the whole Poſterity of <hi>Adam. That as in Adam all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22.</note> 
               <hi>dye, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that God's deſigned Bounty by the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſhould comprehend all Nations, the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſufficient notice from the Inſpired Writers of their own Country. <hi>And I will ſhake all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 6.</note> 
               <hi>thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in ſupport of this great Truth, St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort <hi>Timothy,</hi> That Supplications be made for all Men: Whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Believers or Infidels; of what Country, of what Rank or Quality ſoever they be.</p>
            <p>But the Occaſion of our being at this time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, will not permit me longer to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Refutation of this firſt Miſtake of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, againſt which St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42930:5"/>
is here directed: I proceed therefore to the Conſideration of the other immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which was, Their Averſeneſs to live in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Their Untractableneſs and Diſreſpect to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, had appeared on ſeveral occaſions, eſpecially ſince they were brought under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke; and may probably be in ſome meaſure imputed to a wrong Interpretation which they had put upon a Precept that God gave them by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God had required them to make no King, but of their own People. <hi>One from among thy brethren</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>ſhalt thou ſet king over thee; thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, which is not thy brother.</hi> This made them unwilling to ſubmit to any Foreign Power.</p>
            <p>It is true, while a liberty of Election conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, they were to chuſe a King of their own Nation; but after God for the hardneſs of their hearts did ſuffer them to be ſubdued by their Neighbours, and to be carried Captive into a ſtrange Land, it became their Duty to be ſubject to them who had brought them under their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to conform themſelves to the Laws of the Emperors and Kings who protected them.</p>
            <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſome cauſe to ſuſpect, ſince their Converſion to the Chriſtian Religion, that they had not quitted all their Prejudices and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42930:5"/>
falſe Notions about Obedience and Submiſſion to the higher Powers, which they held under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpenſation, does in the Text exhort and deſire <hi>Timothy,</hi> that as Prayers ſhould be made for all kinds of Men, ſo chiefly, and in the firſt place for Kings, and all that are in Authority. In treating of which Argument, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew,</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) That it is not foreign to the Office of the Miniſters of the Chriſtian Church, to remind the People of their Duty to the Civil Power.</item>
               <item>(2.) That the People are bound by the Laws of God and Nature, to pray for thoſe in Authority, and to live in due Subjection to them.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">(1.) That it is not foreign to the Office of the Miniſters of the Chriſtian Church, to remind the People of their Duty to the Civil Power.</p>
            <p>Which Propoſition may be grounded on the Exhortation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy.</hi> The Apoſtle did not think it ſufficient, when he writ to whole Churches, to injoyn them to render Tribute <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Service to Chief Governors, and all in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under them; but in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who being made Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was about to order and eſtabliſh the Worſhip of God in the Aſſemblies of the New Chriſtians, he does exhort and beſeech him, that their Publick Service ſhould begin with Prayers for all Men, and particularly for Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42930:6"/>
And with equal Care and Zeal to preſerve Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from Seditious Deſigns and Plots againſt the Magiſtrate, in his Letter to <hi>Titus,</hi> by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Biſhop of <hi>Crete,</hi> he preſſes him to put the Churches in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, to be ready to every good.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> is required, That in his Office of Publick Prayer, Kings ſhould have a principal part; and <hi>Titus</hi> hath order in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to put the Hearers in mind of their Duty to the Supreme and Subordinate Powers.</p>
            <p>Whatever therefore is declared a Duty of our Holy Religion, and is contained among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Precepts, muſt not only be a Subject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but very neceſſary for Chriſtian Miniſters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and ſeriouſly recommend unto the People.</p>
            <p>There was more cauſe for making this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which ariſes directly from our Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been often objected to the Clergy, when they preach Loyalty and Submiſſion to the Government, that they exceed the Bounds of their Office, and meddle with Matters which do not belong to them.</p>
            <p>As if a Chriſtian Miniſter could go beyond his Commiſſion, while he contained himſelf within the compaſs of his Bible, and only publiſhed thoſe Doctrines unto the Congregation, which our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42930:6"/>
Lord Chriſt, and his Holy Apoſtles had taught before him. If any therefore have been worthy of blame for their Diſcourſes on theſe Arguments, it muſt proceed from want either of Judgment, or Sincerity in their Performance.</p>
            <p>We do not therefore pretend to excuſe either thoſe who have taught the People to ſpeak Evil of Dignities, and would have diſpoſed them to Mutiny and take Arms againſt their Sovereign Lords; or thoſe who would perſuade Governors to Rule by Arbitrary Power, and not to have reſpect to the Laws, and the general Good in their Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Such Men indeed tranſgreſs their Commiſſion, and Act without Integrity or Skill in both the Extremes; and ought not to be eſteemed Friends, either to the Prerogative of Princes, or to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People. For neither the one, nor the other, can be ſtretched beyond the Meaſures of Law and Juſtice, without hazard of being broken.</p>
            <p>But then this is not the only Caſe in which Men may betray the defects of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of their Honeſty; ſeeing other Religious Matters have likewiſe their Extremes; and we need not ſeek much, or go far for a pertinent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>For in the ſame Verſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does bid <hi>Titus</hi> to put them in mind to be ſubject to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42930:7"/>
he alſo requires him to exhort them to be ready to every Good Work. Now Good Works are a moſt noble and neceſſary Subject for Preachers to treat of in the Pulpit, and they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can compoſe a Sermon, without having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make mention of them.</p>
            <p>And yet ſome have ſet too high a rate even upon Good Works, and others have as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued them. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> over-rate them, while they contend they are meritorious, and that God is bound to reward thoſe who do them; making that a Debt of his Juſtice, which is the effect alone of his free Grace and Mercy.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Solifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> as they are called, do put too low a Value on Good Works, by not allowing them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinary Laws of the Goſpel, to be neceſſary Ingredients of the Condition upon which the Chriſtian man ſhall be juſtified: When yet our Saviour hath declared, that the trueſt Teſt we can give of our love of him, and the way to enter into Life, is to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and St. <hi>James</hi> does pronounce, <hi>That faith without works cannot ſave us.</hi>

            <p>The Evidence from the Light of Nature and Reaſon will be ſtrong, if it can be proved that the Original of Society is from God, and that he hath made Government neceſſary to Mankind, and conſequently hath obliged every Man to comply with, and ſubmit to all things neceſſary to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Rule and Diſcipline in Bodies Politick.

(1.) That God hath fitted and qualified the Nature of Man for Society, is manifeſt both from the Faculties of the Mind, and the Powers of the Body, wherewith he hath endowed him. Man is furniſht with <note n="*" place="margin">Primum eſt quod cernitur in univerſi generis humani ſocictate. Ejus autem vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum eſt, ratio, &amp; oratio, quae docendo, diſcendo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municando, diſceptando, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicando, conciliat inter ſe homines, conjungitque natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali quadam ſocietate. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. de Off. l. 1. p.</hi> 26.</note> Reaſon, and Memory, and Speech, and Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Strength, which are ſo many Qualifications for the making him a ſociable Creature; ſince they are all contrived, and may be uſed as well for the benefit of others, as of our ſelves; and Speech ſeems for no other end deſigned, than Converſation, and the furtherance of Mutual Good.</p>
            <p>Man by the Exerciſe of his Reaſon does diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a difference between things; that ſome are <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Ariſt. de Repub. l. 1. c. 2.</note> Good, and others Evil; thoſe things he judges Good, which will preſerve and improve the Faculties and Powers of his Being; and thoſe Evil, which have a tendency to corrupt and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Next, by comparing his own Nature with other Mens, and obſerving the reſpects they have one to another, he concludes that what is Good or Evil for him, will be ſo for other Men; that what contributes to his own Safety or Deſtruction, in the ſame Circumſtances will do ſo to theirs who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42930:8"/>
have the like Intellectual Faculties and Corporeal Powers with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence he advances to find out the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of goodneſs in things, and to compute how much one Good exceeds another; and he cannot but determine that the Good which is durable, is to be preferr'd to that of ſhort continuance; that what cauſes Peace and Tranquility of Mind, is more to be eſteemed, than what procures free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Pain, and Eaſe of the Body; and that Goods, of every kind, are ſo much more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as they are more diffuſive.</p>
            <p>And therefore what is good for him, and for others alſo, is a greater good than what is ſo for himſelf alone; and that, in proportion, every Good is ſtill the greater, by how much the more have benefit by it; and conſequently, his Reaſon will engage him conſtantly to purſue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the moſt Univerſal and Publick Good, in which his own will ever be involved, before and above all others.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Men have much help from their Memory in forming Notions of Truth and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, and of the Good and Evil in things, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling the Times and Actions which are gone, and by recollecting what Fruits ſuch Courſes of Life did produce, and what was the gain or loſs ſuch Deeds did bring along with them. So that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42930:9"/>
in paſſing Judgment upon Matters in view, they may be directed not only by the Objects which at preſent work upon their Senſes, but conſult the Regiſter of all that are paſt, and therefrom col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the ſame Cauſes will have the ſame Effects; and ſo get Inſtructions how, by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the way, to attain the Good, in the purſuit whereof before they miſcarried; and to eſcape the Evils, into which by Ignorance or Raſhneſs they formerly had fallen.</p>
            <p>Then laſtly, By Speech, which would be of no uſe without Society, Men are enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to each other not only their preſent Thoughts, but their former Experience; and ſo to arrive at the ſame Opinions of things, and at length to agree upon ſuch Rules in ordinary Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which they ſhall judge to be for the general Good.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We prove Order and Government to be ordained of God, from the great Love and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite all Men have for Society. Where an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is univerſally rooted in the Nature of any kind of Beings, we can attribute ſo general an Effect to nothing but the Maker of thoſe Beings. As all the Faculties of Men are fitted for mutual Intercourſe, ſo no Deſires are more conſtant or ſtronger, than thoſe of converſing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42930:9"/>
How great is the Delight that ariſes from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Friendſhip! How unſpeakable the Pleaſure which ſprings up in our Souls, from Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to imitate our Glorious Lord and Maker, in doing good to great Numbers! Actions of this kind are moſt agreeable to our Senſe and Reaſon. And we cannot return Acts of Gratitude to our Friends, do Deeds of Charity to the Poor, or ſhew Kindneſs to any in their preſent Diſtreſs, without ſweet and pleaſing Reflections, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trueſt inward Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>As to them who pretend to be moſt delighted with hiding themſelves from the World, it is enough to anſwer, That they could not retire with ſafety, and freedom from fear, were they not protected by the Laws of the Community, and the Care of thoſe who apply themſelves to Publick Buſineſs; and that their Retirement would prove very uncomfortable, had they not the Works of ſuch Perſons to entertain themſelves with in their Cloſets, whoſe Company they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline abroad.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That the Deficiencies and Wants unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in the preſent ſtate, cannot be ſupplied without Society, and other Mens Aſſiſtance. No living Creatures have ſuch need of one another as Men; they cannot come into the World without much help; and when in it, they know no means
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42930:10"/>
to ſupport themſelves; it is for a long time that their Parents provide all Neceſſaries for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Many ſudden Calamities and Diſaſters befal Man, which would preſently make an end of him, did not his Neighbours come to his relief. He is liable to numerous Diſeaſes which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure or prevent; ſome whereof not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order his Blood and Spirits, but deprive him of the Uſe of Reaſon; in which diſtreſſed Condition he owes his Life, under God, wholly to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Care of his Friends.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to make Men more ready to do good Offices, God hath put Paſſions in them, whereby they are deeply affected with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity or Misfortunes of them with whom they converſe. The good ſucceſs of the Affairs of their Allies, does ſtir up ſecret Joy and Pleaſure in their Minds; and the fear of any harm hapning to them, is the cauſe why they bring in more ſpeedy and ample Supplies for their Deliverance out of Trouble.</p>
            <p>But that our Paſſions ſhould not tranſport us into any Exceſs hurtful to our ſelves or others, God hath put them under the Government of our Reaſon: So that any Miſchief coming to us by their Unrulineſs, muſt be imputed to our own want of Care and Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42930:10"/>
More Reaſons, was there now time, of the neceſſity for Men to confederate and join together in Bodies by Rules and Covenant, might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Nature teaches us, that what it hath left in common, ought to be divided into ſhares; for while men have nothing proper to themſelves, the uſe of things would be the occaſion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Quarrels; they would ever be contending who ſhould be the firſt Poſſeſſor of this or that Portion of Land, and how long they ſhould keep Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that it is of abſolute neceſſity there ſhould be general Rules to ſeparate and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh one man's Share and Propriety from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which are what we mean by Laws: And the making an equal Diviſion among all Parties in like Circumſtances, is ſtiled Juſtice: Which Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue the <note n="*" place="margin">Ariſt. Ethic. Nicom. l. v. c. 1.</note> Philoſopher thinks more difficult to be practiſed, becauſe it primarily has relation to the good of other men, but the reſt of the Virtues to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Indeed there could be no Encouragement for Man to labour and cultivate the Earth, if there were no Laws to reſtrain the Strong from taking by Violence, or the Weak from ſecretly purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fruits and Products of his honeſt Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; or to puniſh the Malicious Perſon, whoſe Spite and Ill Nature ſhould prompt him to do a ſhrewd Turn to his Neighbour.</p>

Wherefore thoſe Savage People among whom little Government, Order, or Diſcipline is viſible, ſeem to be in a ſtate of Life not much preferable to that of the Wild Beaſts of the Foreſt: They both ſpend their Time in hunting for their Food; and there is no great difference between the Huts of the one, and the Dens of the other: Nay, Birds and Beaſts, by Inſtinct of Nature, delight to flock and herd together, and to receive ſome low degrees of Advantage from ſuch imperfect Society as they are capable of by their Nature.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That unleſs men ſubmit to the Authority erected and eſtabliſh'd in every Society for the Government of it, no Society or Community can ſubſiſt or continue.</p>
            <p>If the Providence of God hath ſo contrived the ſtate of things, that Mankind cannot live happily in the World out of Communities or Confederate Bodies; and if Subjection to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power in every Community, be required abſolutely to the Preſervation of it; then God has made Subjection a Duty incumbent upon the Members of the Community.</p>
            <p>The Truth of this Aſſertion will be more clear and evident, by conſidering the ſeveral things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the Conſtitution of a Society or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; which I take to be theſe Three.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42930:11"/>
(1.) That there ſhould be Laws enacted and publiſhed for the Government of the Society. As I have ſhewn it to be the Dictate of Nature, that the Earth and the good things it does bring forth, ſhould be divided among men, for uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace and Order in the World, ſo it is plain that what Portion thereof every particular man ſhould enjoy, muſt be determin'd by the Laws of the Community where he reſides.</p>
            <p>It is the Work of them who have the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, to make Laws to deſcribe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſingle Perſons; to try the Juſtice and Equity of Bargains and Contracts; to eſtimate the Loſſes and Damages men ſuffer one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: By theſe Laws mens Labours and Service are to be rated; Rewards or Puniſhments are to be meaſured out to Perſons, according as they ſhall advance the Welfare of the Society, or it ſhall receive Detriment from them. In a word, the Civil Laws do allot what Tributes and Taxes each man ſhall pay, to defend and preſerve the Body Politick, whereof he is a Part.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is neceſſary that in all Societies there ſhould be a Chief Governor to interpret the Laws, and according to them to decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between particular men, without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Affection, or Prejudice and Hatred to any Party.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42930:12"/>
But if there was no Publick Perſon to expound the Laws, every Private Man might underſtand them in his own Senſe, and make them bend to his peculiar Intereſt: And hence it would follow, that there would be as great and endleſs Strifes about the meaning of the Laws, as would have been about the ſeveral Portions of Land in a Country, before a general Diviſion was made. And therefore it is very clear and manifeſt in the Third Place:</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That all the Members of a Community are bound to ſubmit to the Laws and Decrees of their Chief Governor. For neither Laws nor a Governor can conſtitute a Society, if private Men have Liberty not to ſubmit to them. Of what Uſe would Laws be, if every one might interpret them to his own particular Advantage? To what purpoſe ſhould a Governor undertake to hear Cauſes, if the People were not bound to ſtand to his Determinations? This therefore never can happen in any Place, without a Diſſolution of the Government, and the bringing all things into Confuſion. And Men in a State, where every one preſumes a Right in himſelf to oppoſe what he miſlikes, muſt not be thought an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regulated Society, but a disjointed and lawleſs Multitude. Wherefore no one is to doubt, but that God who is Author of Societies, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42930:12"/>
the Supreme Rulers in every Society, a Right to ſo much Power as is ſufficient to compel men to yield Obedience to the Laws; and that he has obliged all Perſons belonging unto it, to ſubmit to their Authority.</p>
            <p>But now let us obſerve in the Revealed Will of God, what further Approbation he has given of the Sovereign Powers over Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, through his Providence ſettled in the World, for the Good and Welfare of Men.</p>
            <p>When God did put the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immediate Government, we may take notice how ſeverely he puniſhed thoſe who did mutiny againſt the Rulers, that by his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on acted under him. <hi>Miriam</hi> was ſmitten with the Leproſy, becauſe ſhe unadviſedly ſpoke againſt <hi>Moſes. Korah</hi> ſeduced ſome Malecontents into an Inſurrection, and the Earth opened and ſwallowed him and his Company for their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>God ſo far countenanced the Erection of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power over his own People the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to grant their Petition for a King, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they did ſin, <hi>in rejecting him, when they deſired a king to judge them, like all the nations:</hi> And what is remarkable, he cauſed their two firſt Kings to come to the Throne by his ſpecial Choice and Deſignation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42930:13"/>
It is alſo worthy of noting, That the uſual Title and Stile of Kings in Holy Scripture, is, <hi>The Anointed of the Lord:</hi> In which he forbids the reviling of Rulers, and the curſing of the King even in our Thoughts; he declares them his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives; that by him they rule and decree Juſtice: Nay, he threatneth to pour his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for their revolting from the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> after he had conquered their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour likewiſe, whoſe Kingdom was not of this World, was ſo far from deſigning any Alteration in the Forms of Government, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Laws of Nations, that were agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Morality, that he confirmed their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and did ſubject himſelf to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of his own Time and Country, by ordering Tribute to be paid to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and in acknowledging to <hi>Pilate,</hi> That his Power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him from God.</p>
            <p>Subjection to Kings and Governors is more largely and diſtinctly aſſerted by the Apoſtles, who in their Divine Writings were aſſiſted with his Holy Spirit. And to render their Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Obedience to thoſe who preſide at the Helm, and direct and rule Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the more effectual, they back them with ſtrong Arguments, taken from the Profit which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42930:13"/>
accrues to Societies, through their reſpectful and dutiful Behaviour to the Civil Authority; and from the Judgments God will bring upon Men of a rebellious and untractable Spirit.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires every Chriſtian Soul to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers; becauſe thoſe Powers are ordained of God, and becauſe they that reſiſt them, do reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and by his Decree, who will maintain his own Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall for their Sin of Reſiſtance, receive to themſelves Damnation.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoins Chriſtians in general to be ſubject to the King, who is Supreme, and to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that are deputed by him, for the Lord's ſake, and becauſe ſo is the Will of God; and both point to the Bleſſings and Benefits that will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from proceed to Men: The one ſays, Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the Evil: And the other, That they are for the Puniſhment of Evil-doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, That the Magiſtrate is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to thee for Good; that is, for the ſupport of Juſtice, and Honeſty, and Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; and that in defending the Authority of Governors, we ſhall include our own Quiet and Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42930:14"/>
It is not unworthy of notice, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> urged the Duty of Subjection, that <hi>Nero</hi> was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, one of the worſt of Men; and to obviate an Objection made by ſome ſince, who had more regard to their own Will, than the Word of God; That the Primitive Chriſtians did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Authority of the Emperors, becauſe they, being but a handful of Men, had not Force ſufficient to oppoſe them; he adds, That they were to be ſubject not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake; that is, not only for Fear of the Emperors, who in their Rage might let looſe their Armies upon them; but upon a Principle of Duty and Juſtice, in Conſideration of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Profit they gain by their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And if we are to be Obedient to the Higher Powers for ſake of Conſcience, then, by Rule of Contraries, we ſhall contract a guilty Conſcience by our Diſobedience. The Sum of all is, That we ought to pray for, both in Publick and Private, to Fear, and Reſpect, and Honour in our Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Kings, and Princes, and other Magiſtrates, and to ſubmit to their Righteous Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, not only in regard they are ſet over us by God, and Reign by his Commiſſion, but out of good Will to Men, who are protected in their Lives, Freedoms, and Eſtates, through their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42930:14"/>
How wide then are they from Praying ſeriouſly in the Church or Cloſet for the Proſperity of the Civil Powers, and the Bleſſing of God upon their Management of Affairs, from Reverencing and Honouring them, who ſpeak Reproachfully of their Perſons, and make it their buſineſs every where to traduce their Actions, and to incline the People to Sedition and Tumults?</p>
            <p>The right ordering the Intereſt of a Kingdom, is matter of great difficulty, and needs the utmoſt Application, even where the Subjects have their Prince in higheſt Eſteem, and concur with him in carrying on the Work; but when bad Men by Slandering the Governors, and Cenſuring their Proceedings, whereof they commonly have but little Knowledge, do create Miſunderſtandings between them and the People, 'tis next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things ſhould go well in a Nation. And for the moſt part, the Cure of the Faults they have detected, does not near ſo much Service to the Publick, as the Fears and Jealouſies they ſtir up, do harm.</p>
            <p>No Government, of what Form ſoever, did ever arrive at that degree of Perfection, as to have no Slips or Errors committed in the Adminiſtration. The beſt of Kings while they carry Humanity about them, muſt have failings; neither is it to be expected, what care ſoever is taken in chuſing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42930:15"/>
that all who ſerve the Crown, ſhould be both Able and Honeſt.</p>
            <p>Princes are fain to make that uſe of the Eyes and Hands of other Men, as it will be no wonder ſometimes to meet with Miſtakes in Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon with the greateſt Thought and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; and where they act with all diligence and ſincerity, an unequal Diſtribution of Juſtice may happen, and Rewards or Puniſhments not exactly always follow the Merit or Demerit of Men.</p>
            <p>They therefore muſt be thought to reſiſt the Ordinance of God, and to act againſt the true Intereſt of Kingdoms and Societies, who upon Slips and Ordinary Miſcarriages, and perhaps great Hardſhips upon ſome Single Perſons, do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to change the Form of Government, and openly oppoſe with Violence thoſe in Authority. For upon ſuch rigid Terms, as appear unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable both to the Reaſon and Experience of Men, no Kingdom or State can ſtand. Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but the aſſuming a Power to ſet the Laws all aſide; a General Invaſion of Property, and the endeavouring to deſtroy the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of a Society, can break the Bands of it aſunder, and leave the People at liberty to take care of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42930:15"/>
But this was remote from the Caſe of our Martyr'd Sovereign, King <hi>Charles</hi> I. whom there was ſo little Colour to charge with a Deſign to alter the Ancient and Legal Settlement of the Nation, and to diminiſh the Force of the Laws, that he ſeemed really perſuaded they were ever on his ſide, and upon all Occaſions did openly condemn proceeding by Abſolute Power.</p>
            <p>And in the great Point he was believed to depart fartheſt from the Law; it may be ſaid in abatement of what he did himſelf, that he acted by the Advice of his Council, and followed the Reſolution of all his Judges; Men not put into Place to ſerve a Turn, but of Eminent Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in their Profeſſion, and hardly, in other reſpect, blameable for the Execution of their Truſt.</p>
            <p>How ſincere he was in his Intentions to Rule by Law, we learn from the Solemn Proteſtation he made at a time when Succeſs did moſt attend his Arms.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I do promiſe to Almighty God, as I <note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 435.</note> hope for his Bleſſing and Protection that I will to the utmoſt of my Power,' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain the True Reformed
