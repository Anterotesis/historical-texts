            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And for that your princelie loue and good will, hath alwaies beene great and fauourable, to all true and faithfull Souldiours and Seruitors: it hath the more imboldened me, to preſent to your moſt gracious view, this little labour, beſt befitting to come from a Martiall mind.

And although commonlie, euerie man (moſt worthie and renowmed Soueraigne) ſeeketh ſpeciallie to commende and extoll the thing, whereunto hee feeleth himſelfe naturally bent and enclined.

<pb facs="tcp:11537:3"/>
then the knowledge of ſeruice in warre or deedes of Armes. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ambition of the world is ſuch, that it is impoſsible for any Realme, Kingdome, or Dominion, long to continue free in quietnes and ſauegard, where the defence of the ſword is not alwaies in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe. For as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſaith, the ſafe keeping of this bleſſed peace, conſiſteth in the knowledge of warre, and deedes of Armes.</p>
                  <p>

Manie more, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite examples might be alledged, and all againſt thoſe which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of this moſt famous and honourable exerciſe of Martiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and renowmed orders of the Lawe of Armes, which hath alwaies heeretofore beene the purchaſer of Empires: Kingdomes hath beene enlarged: Princes preſerued: iuſtice maintained: good Lawes protected: and the Common-wealth defended. So in laying aſide the exerciſe of warlike weapons and Martiall diſcipline, how many Kingdoms hath beene ouerthrowne, how many Countries ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated, &amp; how many floriſhing Citties ſacked and beaten downe flat to the ground.</p>
                  <p>But as your Highneſſe, hauing moſt ſufficiently furniſhed euerie part of your Realme, with all manner of warlike prouiſion, in ſuch ſort, as neuer any of your Prediceſſors hath heeretofore come neere: euen ſo could I wiſh in hart, that Englande were as well furniſhed with Seruitours of experience and knowledge, in this moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe of Martiall diſcipline. But the ſtarres run their courſe contrarie to the world, and the learned iudge otherwiſe then the Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote.

For we are to conſider, the ambition of the world is ſuch, that it is vnpoſſible for a Realme or Dominion, long to continue in quietnes &amp; ſafegard, where the defence of the ſworde and Mtiarall feates of warre is not exerciſed and practiſed with diſcipline. For as the <hi>Greckes</hi> thinking themſelues to be in peace and ſecure, applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in tryfling matters, taking pleaſure in Comaedies, and ſuch like toyes, altogether laying aſide Martiall diſcipline and the exerciſe of warlike weapons: which gaue occaſion to <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> King of <hi>Macaedonia,</hi> father to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and to bring them in ſeruitude vnder his ſubiection. I could alledge many more which hath beene ſuppreſſed, onelie for lacke of the vſe of warlike weapons, and thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be in moſt ſecuritie and peace, as the <hi>Aſsirians, Perſians, Athenians,</hi> &amp; ſuch like. And the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which might haue beene perpetuall, but thought themſelues in peace, and fell to inordinate ryot and paſtimes, not doubting nor fearing any thing which was hurtfull vnto them or their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: which thing was to theyr great ruine and ouerthrowe. Euen ſo where ouermuch libertie is giuen, men may be troden down vnder foote, and brought to moſt horrible miſerie &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie:
<pb facs="tcp:11537:4"/>
if they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues only to paſtimes &amp; pleaſures, and forſake the vſe and exerciſe of warlike weapons, which are the defence both of Prince, Country, Religion, iuſtice, lawes, and ſubiects: the which are altogether maintained, and protected by Armes onely. And therefore the moſt famous Conquerers and mightie Captaines did deuiſe, with moſt dilligence, all maner of waies, to bring their men to be perfect in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all manner of things appertayning to the warres. As manifeſtly appeareth, by the warlike Games which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Grecia</hi> ordained vpon the Mount <hi>Olimpus.</hi> And alſo by the orders and exerciſe that the auncient Romans vſed in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, and ſpecially in <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> and in theyr ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Theaters, which chiefely they builded for that purpoſe: whereby they made their Souldiours of ſuch experience, that they obtained with ſmall company in fight, againſt a great multitude of enemies, ſuch wonderfull and meruailous victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as in many credible Hiſtories are mencioned. And alſo by the ſame meanes, their ſtragling people which followed the Campes, gotte ſuch vnderſtanding in thoſe actions of Armes, that they in the day of battaile, beeing leſt deſtitute of ſuccour, were able without any other helpe, to ſette themſelues in good order of battaile, for theyr owne defence againſt the enemie, and in ſuch times of ſeruice, they haue doone theyr Countrey great ſeruice. So that the antiquitie eſteemed nothing more happy, then to haue the Country full of men of vnderſtanding and knowledge, in warlike actions, and Martiall diſcipline. Which thing is leaſt regarded in this Realme, &amp; moſt neede of it: for that we haue ſo many euill &amp; peſtiferous enemies rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about vs: which are ready continually, if oportunity ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to worke our ruine and decay. Wherfore ſtirre vp your ſelues euery man with courage, and boldnes of minde, to the exerciſe of your warlike weapons, which is honourable, and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be preferred before all exerciſes. For the vſe heere of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid aſide, breedeth more ſedicions and warres, then if they were daily had in vſe, &amp; ſo perfectly practiſed: for experience in ſeruice, doth much more preuaile, then many multitudes of
<pb facs="tcp:11537:5"/>
people, beeing without vnderſtanding and knowledge in this moſt honourable ſeruice. Wherefore, ſith the neceſſity of this ſeruice of warre, and Martiall exerciſe is ſo great, and alſo the neceſſary vſe of them ſo manifeſt, that euen peace herſelfe, in manner, doth challenge her cheefe defence &amp; protection, ſuch is the worthines of Martiall exerciſes: for as by proofe wee ſee, that the glory thereof cannot eaſily finde roote, but in the harts of ſuch moſt worthy men, which continually exerciſeth themſelues in theſe warlike weapons, for the glory of their Prince &amp; Country, and alſo for their own honour and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie. Wherfore theſe exerciſes being of ſuch force, which bringeth all thoſe that exerciſe the ſame to ſuch honour and fame, both of Prince and Countrey, that I would in hart, that all Engliſh men, might ſhewe their good will in the exerciſe thereof. But hauing ſo fewe men of experience in theſe dayes, we ſee that euery one hauing ſerued but a yeere or two, it is a great matter. Nay, if he but croſſe the Seas, and make hys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode but one month, he is accounted a Souldiour. But for my part, I haue ſerued theſe ſixteene yeeres in Ireland, and in the Low Countries, and haue ſeene many peeces of ſeruice in both places, and yet I dare not account my ſelfe a Souldiour. For the name of a Souldiour is moſt honourable, and thoſe that beare the name or title thereof, ſhoulde be men of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and knowledge, and well experienced in warre, &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>Doe we not find in many places of the holy Scripture, both in the bookes of Moſes, in the booke Numbers, in the booke of Ioſua, and in diuers other places of the Scripture, where they vſed no little regard, not onely in chuſing of theyr Captaines and leaders, but as well in preſcribing of Lawes and Martiall diſcipline of warres, the which in times paſt were appointed by the Almighty God himſelfe: moreouer promiſed gyfts to thoſe which could perſwade the children of Iſraell. As by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the booke of Numbers, as I remember, in the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene chapter, howe God promiſed with his owne mouth to rewarde <hi>Caleb,</hi> for his conſtancie, &amp; couragious perſwaſion
<pb facs="tcp:11537:5"/>
to the children of Iſraell. And <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing a man of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count among the great Warriours, yet for his worthines and famous behauiour, in killing and ouerthrowing <hi>Goliah:</hi> what great riches and rewards receiued hee, with the Daughter of King <hi>Saul?</hi> But in Englande, we neuer conſider, neyther of hys actions, nor of his knowledge and experience: but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, our Captaines are choſen, more for fauour then for knowledge: more for freendſhip, then for experience: for if they haue a good opinion in him, they neuer conſider his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, whether he be a man able to diſcharge his place or no. But I haue no doubt, that euery manſhalbe hereafter better looked vnto, both for theyr knowledge, as alſo for their experience &amp; deſert. And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro</hi> ſayth, there be three things not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, a wiſe man vnder the gouernaunce of a foole: a liberall man in ſubiection to a caytife: and a foole ſette in authoritie. Wherfore it is moſt commonly ſeene, where good order &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce faileth, obedience decayeth, boldnes increaſeth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit eſcapeth, iniuries preuaileth, auarice corrupteth, and the eſtate of a Weale publique ſoone after decayeth. But leaſt I ſhould offend, I will conclude with a fewe other examples, as in Spayne, in Fraunce, in the Low Countries, and many other places, what great intentions are among theyr Princes &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, the which is a great perrill, and an endangering to their Princes and their Common wealth &amp; Countrey, in an euil and dangerous eſtate. Wherefore let vs be thankfull to God, for giuing vs ſo louing and gracious a Princeſſe, who foreſeeth ſuch euill intentions, leaſt they ſhould breede to ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſores which may not be cured. For her Maieſtie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, that the ſtrength of her Realme, is the freendſhip and loue of her people. And <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſayth, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces liue more ſafely, in gathering to them men of good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge, then with theyr treaſures of money: for the loue of a Princes Subiects to theyr Prince, is the whole ſtrength of the Lande. And as <hi>Hermes</hi> ſayth, vnhappy is that Prince, that eſteemeth himſelfe happy, to haue his Cofers full of treaſure, and his counſaile full of men of euill and corrupt
<pb facs="tcp:11537:6"/>
liuing. Alſo let vs remember the woorthy ſaying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who ſayth, that if a Prince be mercifull, liberall, and louing, his eſtate ſhall proſper, and his wiſedome ſhall helpe him in hys neede. If he be iuſt, his ſubiects ſhall reioyce in him, his Realme ſhall proſper, &amp; his eſtate continue: for glorious is that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Common wealth, and fortunate is that Prince, that is Lord of young men to trauaile, and olde ſage perſons at home, to giue graue and wiſe counſaile.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing ſpoken ſufficient, I will conclude, moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeching God, ſo to bleſſe her Maieſtie, with long life to raigne ouer vs, that wee may by her gracious proceedings be long gouerned. God confound her foes, and bring to lyght all traiterous Conſpiratours againſt her moſt excellent Maieſtie. God ſo bleſſe her honourable Counſaile with increaſe of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that all theyr conſultations, may redownd to the ſafe keeping and honour of this moſt famous England. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>A Campe, Leagar, or Gariſon, furniſhed with ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, cannot but floriſh as the Laurell in all behauiours: in ſo much, as the Officers being themſelues faythfull, expert, and godly, the common Souldiours muſt needes be the better, both by inſtruction, and example of lyfe, and knowe how to liue in all duetie and obedience: ſo that vertue thus bearing ſway on euery ſide, vnitie thence immediatly ſpringeth, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in they all in one lincke: beeing knitte together, there is no doubt but they muſt néedes preuaile againſt their enemies, for loue and concorde in Campe or Leagar, is a diſcouragement to the enemies, and an encouragement to themſelues.

                  <p>But the Officers be diuers, for ſo it is néedefull: for, the gouernment of a Campe or Leagar, is as the gouernment of a Realm or Countrey, and requireth lyke Officers, to miniſter iuſtice and to ſuppres wrongs and iniuries: and as that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (though the Lawe be neuer ſo pure) cannot long continue in ſecuritie, where the Magiſtrates bee ignorant of

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable and my very good Lord, hauing receiued ſo many bountifull rewards, with an infinite number of good words, for other of his writings, the which it hath pleaſed your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo fauourably to accept, is not thereby onely encouraged nowe once againe, to betake himſelfe to his penne, but alſo he is emboldened, to preſent to your L. view this his ſmall labour, which containeth the approoued order of Martiall Diſcipline. And as it is the common opinion of all worthy men, (right honourable &amp; my very good Lord) that among all things that is to be preferred, warre is the one: and that becauſe whoſoeuer behaueth himſelfe honourably in the exerciſe thereof, repreſenteth the true Image of the moſt great and omnipotent God, becauſe among the high titles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed according to his will and diuine Maieſtie in the olde and holy Law, hee hath alwaies beene content to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and called by the name of the GOD of hoſtes: ſo if this worthy exerciſe of Martiall Diſcipline be vſed, and had in practiſe for the glory of God, and the defence of Chriſt hys Goſpell, or for the defence of a Kingdom or Common-weale,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11537:35"/>
no doubt there is, but that the great GOD of Hoſtes is our chiefe Generall, and moſt worthy Captaine.</p>
                  <p>And as your honour, being not inferiour to any in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe heereof, not onely for your owne honour and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, but for the better vpholding of Chriſtes Goſpell, for the defence of our gracious Soueraigne, her Lawes and louing Subiects, for the exerciſing of warlike weapons, and the often vſing of them breedeth peace, but if warlike weapons ſhould be layd aſide, and Martiall diſcipline forgotten, then would it be with vs, as it was with the Romans. For as <hi>Scipio</hi> ſaith, after the Romans layd aſide the vſe of theyr warlike weapons, and Martiall exerciſes, they fell into great idlenes, outrages, ryot, and wantonnes; for more hurtfull was this time of peace to Rome, then during the whole courſe and ſeaſon of the warres, for that whilſt they had enemies in <hi>Affrick,</hi> they knewe not what vices and inordinate ryot ment in Rome.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, may it pleaſe your good Lordſhip, in this time of peace, there muſt be had ſpeciall regard, to ſee theſe warlike weapons vſed and practiſed, and not that euery common fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be ſette in authoritie, but thoſe which be men of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; knowledge, for what profiteth theſe Companies heere in England with all theyr muſter and traynings? May I ſpeak it without offence, there is not in conſcience two Companies among twentie, which hath men of experience to inſtruct them in the exerciſe of theyr weapons. For it is not ſufficient to haue ſtore of Armes, weapons, Munitions, and furniture, but alſo to haue men of experience to vſe them, and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in the knowledge of Martiall diſcipline to lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>The Realme thus gouerned with men of experience and knowledge, there is no doubt but it will continue and floriſh. For as <hi>Varro</hi> ſayth, exerciſe of warlike weapons, and rumors of warres, breedeth peace. And for that your Lordſhip, beeing a moſt loyall and faithfull friende to her Maieſtie, and a moſt worthy and famous Generall, beſt befitting your honourable eſtate, for the better ſafe keeping of thys little England, I haue thought it good, for to diſcouer this briefe diſcourſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

diſcipline vnto your good Lordſhip, hauing not any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing to beſtow of you whereby to witneſſe my good will, for if I had, I would with all willingnes impart the ſame. And for that your Lordſhip knoweth, the earth which yeldeth ſalte beareth no other thing, and the ground that hideth golde, will beare no kinde of grayne, ſo from a ſlender wit, exerciſed in Martiall diſcipline, your Lordſhip will looke for no gyfts, but fruites of a moſt willing minde. And albeit they are many, who allured by your manifolde vertues regarde you, and mooued through your true nobleneſſe of minde to honour you, yet as one not inferior in affection to any, but in good wil ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many, thus I boldly preſume, leauing it to your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humanitie: as a perſonage moſt meete, and bulwarke moſt ſufficient, againſt the barking impes of the enuious, and blunt haſtie bolts of the fooliſh, whoſe eyes beeing ſore, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Sunne, and theyr wits ſo weake, are not able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the ſubtiltie of Martiall experiences: and therefore as ſlothfull neglect them, or as malicious, wholy contemne them. But proceeding too farre in theſe ſpeeches, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I may be miſliked, and therefore leaſt I ſhould ſeeme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſo farre, that I cannot find the way out, I will conclude.</p>
