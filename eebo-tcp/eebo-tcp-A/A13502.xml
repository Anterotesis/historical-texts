            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Invitation.</head>
               <p>FIrst I would have my Guests understand this point of Modesty, not to presume to come unto my Feast without bidding, except they bring stooles with them (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Guests should do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe a Rule of the <hi>Italian</hi> (which is now of late in great use in <hi>England</hi>) which is to invite a man most earnestly to Dinner or Supper, hoping hee or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11748:4"/>
they that are so invited, will have more manners then to come: But if they do come, then the Inviters doe esteeme the Guests unmannerly, and that they want good and gentile breeding.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I would have none but such as have the gift of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence and Fasting to come to my Feast, for my House stands (as other Gentlemens houses do) in a very wholesome and hungry Ayre, that shall not take away any mans Appetite, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man to depart with a good stomacke to his meate, (when he hath it) which is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant and infallible signe of health.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as many as please to come over my House any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, shall be very welcome to breake their Faces before they goe: Or if the greatest enemy I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11748:4"/>
have doe ride within a Mile or two of my Dwelling, let him or they make bold to stay there a Moneth (if they please) and take such as they finde and welcome, for I will be but at ordinary or small charge in providing.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen Readers, or all of what degree so ever, that doe read this, I pray you all to take notice that you are my Guests, for the entertainement and Dyet you are like to have, I pray takeit in good part, washing is costly, and Soape is deare, therefore I will not have any Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-cloath, or Napkin fould, for you shall have no occasion to wash your hands, licke your lipps or fingers, nor shall you neede to make use of a Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke, you shall have no cause to draw Knives, neither shall here be any carving of either the wing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11748:5"/>
of a Coney, or the fore-legge of a Capon: heere is no trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some shifting of Trenchers or Platters, nor exception for the highest place at the Board, for the Dyet is a like in all places of the Table, (and to avoyde Pride and emulation) I have caused it to be made and fram'd, neither long or short, or middle size, square, round, or ovall; and so you are all welcome unto my <hi>Tantalian</hi> Feast, which is drest without Kettle, Pot, or Spit, Dripping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, Frying-pan, Ladle, Scum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Cooke, Scullion, Jacke, or Turne-broach: So now at the first sight you may perceive bread and salt, which is first placed upon every mans table, and so likewise at my Feast, and so in good order you shall finde the rest of the Feast follow in their due course and order.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:11748:5"/>
               <head>2. Bread and Salt.</head>
               <p>BRead and Salt are the first Ushers to the Feast. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram of Bread, is Beard or Bared, and though Salt come in with the first, yet Salt Anagrammatiz'd is Last; which signifies that Bread and Salt should be the first broght in to a Table, and last Bared and carried away. But my Bread is not for every mans tooth, it not being made of Wheate, Rie, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Oates, Mescellin, Beanes, Pease, or any Graine, Pulse, or Roote whatsoever. It is neither dough Baked, Baked dough, or burnt in the Oven, neither leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or unleavened, nor any yeast,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11748:6"/>
Barme, or Rising put into it, (for it might fill my Gueſts with wind in stead of puffing them up with vaine glory.) It hath neyther Crust or Crum, nor is it chip'd or unchip'd; for the colour and finenesse of it is neyther White, Wheaten, Raunged, or Browne: it is neither in the shape of Loafe, Rowle, Cake, bunne, Wig, Manchet, Ruske, Bannock, Jannock, Symnell, or bread-pye, nor is it Cheat-bread, for it shall satisfie every man as much as hee lookes for: if it bee distastfull unto any, let him dippe it in the Salt, and it will be savoury presently.</p>

               <head>3. Great and small Oysters.</head>
               <p>MY <hi>Bawdy Boy,</hi> having thus procur'd Faggots, yet hee'l not be idle, but for your better content, the same Tyde hee will fit you with two Bushels of great and small Oysters; for before hee had rowed foure miles, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke a Katch that was swiming up towards <hi>London</hi> loaden with Oysters. Well overtaken Katch-man sayes one, Gramer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Water-man said the other; wilt thou buy 100. of Faggots, said <hi>Bawdy Boy?</hi> I know not what to doe with them said the other; but yet I care not if I give thee a Crowne for them: <hi>Bawdy boy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I was glad (quoth hee) to take them for part of a desperate Debt, for where I had them, I could get no money, and my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11748:7"/>
house is little, so that I want roome to lay them in, which is the cause that makes me to sell them to thee at so cheape a rate. The match being thus made, the Faggots were delivered into the Katch, and the five shillings was paid to the Water-man, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently demanded of the Katch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man if his Oysters were good? who answer'd, that his great ones were at sixe shillings the Bushell, (water-measure) and his small ones at two shillings the Bushell: <hi>Bawdy Boy</hi> said, thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed thy money with me for Faggots, and I will leave it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with thee for Oysters; I will give thee a Crowne for a Bushell of the great, and two shillings for the small: all parties being agreed, the Oysters were measur'd, and throwne into the Boate: I pray thee Katch-man
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11748:7"/>
said <hi>Bawdy Boy,</hi> give me one great Oyster or two into the bargaine, which whil'st the Katch-man was reaching, the other put off his Boate, and rowed away: The one call'd ho Water-man, thou hast not payd me for my Oysters, the other said, you lye Katchman, you have Faggots for your Oysters; the other reply'd, thou hast mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for thy Faggots, the other answer'd, thou hast Faggots for thy Oysters, and for thy money both, and thou art an ignorant fellow, that know'st not how to reckon right: So away rowed he, and I pray Gentlemen fall to your Oysters.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WIll Baxted,</hi> a late well knowne fine Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, went in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on one of the Twenlve dayes in <hi>Christmas</hi> time, upon occasion of businesse to speake with an old rich miserable House-keeper, and having done what he came for, hee tooke his leave, leaving the old man in his Chamber: but as hee was going out of the doores, he said to the Fellow that let him out, My Friend, is not this <hi>Christmas</hi> time? Yes that it is said the other;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11748:8"/>
then sayd <hi>Baxted,</hi> will not your Master bee angry if I doe goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and not drinke? the Fellow said, no sure, I thinke he will not be offended at all for such a small fault: O but (quot <hi>Baxted</hi>) it is good to be sure, and I am loth you should have any ill will for my sake, therefore I pray you, aske your Master if he will not be angry with you, if I doe goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before I drinke: Sir sayd the fellow, I will not aske him such a question, but I will make you drinke without his knowledge. So into a Celler they went, and strong Beere was drawne in a Horne-cup, and as <hi>Baxted</hi> was drinking, the Master of the house knockt, and call'd, and whistl'd for his man as if hee had beene mad, so that the fellow was faine to leave <hi>Baxted</hi> in the Celler, and run upstaires in haste to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11748:9"/>
who angryly said, (Sirrha) where have you beene? and what is the reason that I have knock't, and bounc'd so long for you? Sir (sayd the servant) I was giving a cup of Beere in the Celler to the Player that was with you: How, said the Master, thou idle wastfull knave, doe I keepe a Tap-house or Ordinary for every compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to tipple in? I'le make thee know it is not my Disposition, nor is it for my Reputation or profit: Truely Sir, said the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I could not chuse but make him drinke for shame, hee spake such words that mov'd me so; and with that he told his Master what <hi>Baxted</hi> said, and that he had left him in the Celler alone: A Rope on him said the Old man, I will goe to him, and bid him welcome, (though but with an ill will) the mad knave will jeere
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11748:9"/>

No sir quoth he, I am single, and I keepe no house; the other said, I thought so by your cutting of Brawne, for I doe thinke you doe neither know the price of such a Coller, or what belongs <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

Sir, indeed for the price I neither know, nor care for, but yet I doe know what belongs to it, which is a cup of Muskadell, if I could get it.

               <head>14. A couple of fat Ducks roasted.</head>
               <p>NEere the Citty of <hi>Gaunt</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in a small Village there was lately a Priest that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, or rayled most bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestants, calling them Reprobates, Cast-awayes, Hugonats, and Hereticks, good for nothing but to feed fire, flame, and faggots; for which constant way of invective talking the Priest was mightily followed by abundance of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (the most part women) as the like troupes doe into many places haunt Schismaticall Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists, that willingly would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locate the Conformity and Unity of the Church. Amongst the rest of this Priests Auditorie, there was one man and his wife that seldome failed to heare him;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11748:23"/>
but it hapned that the Woman was to give her mayd-servant leave to goe to a Wedding at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> (where she had a kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to bee married) so that her Mistris was forc'd to stay at home that Sunday, and dresse Dinner for her Husband and family. The Sermon being done, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came home, and told his Wife that their Priest had made an extraordinary piece of worke, that the like was never spoken, and that hee thought all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants were knock'd downe with his words, and that he was griev'd at the heart shee was not at Church to heare him.</p>
               <p>At which report the woman was so full of griefe, (for her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent from so rare a matter) that shee could eate no meate to Dinner, but fed upon sorrow; her Husband began to comfort
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11748:24"/>
her, and told her, that if shee would bee merry, and eate her meate, hee would procure the Priest to come to their house on the Wednesday following, and there, (in their Parlour) he should repeate the same Sermon to them privately. The woman was well contented with the motion, and said, that shee would bestow a couple of as good Ducks roafted on him as ever hee eate in his life. (Now you must understand, that the Woman was hard and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and did seldome use to feede her Husband, or any other with Ducks: and the Priest on the other side, did love a Ducke so well, that hee would run over the Parish after them.) Well, the Wednesday was come, the Priest came, the Ducks were on the Spit roasted, the Sermon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and Dinner was expected:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11748:24"/>
The Woman arising from her seate, made a low courtesie to the Priest, saying, Sir, I will goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kitchin, and make haste with your meate, the while I will leave you with my Husband to discourse. in the Parlour: So the good wife went to her Maid, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, In faith Wench our Priest hath made a good Declaration, but I would my Ducks were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live againe, for it grieves me to remember how the pretty fooles would quacke, quacke, about the backsides; but troubles my mind more, to thinke how, like Wolves, the Priest and thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster will devoure them. The Maid answer'd her Dame, that if she pleased, that we two here will eate up the Ducks in the Kitchin, the whilst the Priest and hee are prating in the Parlour. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reply'd, that she could finde
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11748:25"/>
in her heart to doe it, but shee could not answer the matter with credit. Then said the Maide, Dame, let us eate the Ducks, and I will lay my Quarters wages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that wee will come off with fame and credit.</p>
               <p>The match was agreed upon, the Ducks were taken from the Spit, and betwixt them one was eaten, and the other dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, and spoil'd: What must be done now said the Dame? I pray you (quoth the Maid) to lay the cloath, with Bread, and Salt, and Trenchers; which she did, (her Husband bidding her make haste with Dinner) then shee came to her Maid againe, and asked what must further be done? Then said the Maid, you see our Knives are foule and blunt, I pray you whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our Master in the eare, and tell him you will turne the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11748:25"/>
whilst hee doth sharpen them: Then the woman did as her Maid bid her, and as her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and shee were grinding in the back-side, the Maid went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Parlour to the Priest, and told him that he was in great and suddaine danger, for her Master and Dame were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam'd by reason of too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity which was suspected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her Dame and his good father-hood, and therefore they had sent for him, with a trick to abuse him, to make him relate a Sermon, (which they regard not:) and as for the Ducks which he expected, shee swore truely there was not a Ducke in the house: The maine plot was, that they did purpose to gueld him, and therefore were sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Knives; which if hee pleas'd but to looke out at the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11748:26"/>
Hall-window, he might plainely see. The Priest was all amazed at this newes, and looking, (as the Maid said) hee spied the man and his wise grinding and turning, at which sight he took his heeles, and ran away as if hee had beene two stone lighter than hee was. Then the Maid went to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and said, that shee thought the Priest was mad, or the Devill was in him; for he came suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Kitchin, and was run away with both the Ducks. Whereat the hungry man was angry, and in haste (with one of the naked Knives in his hand) he ran after the Priest; so they both ran, the one for feare, and the other for hunger: the man calling to the Priest, bad him for shame not to carry them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but to let his wife have one of them: the Priest made answer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11748:26"/>
(as he ran) that thy wife and thee are a couple of Rogues, and they should both bee hang'd before they had one of them, and that he would keepe them both whilst he had them. Thus the Sermon was said, the Priest was affraid, his hunger unstay'd, the Jest well laid, the Wages paid, Gramer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Maid.</p>

               <p>MY Reader perhaps may bee thirsty or dry with relating this long Tale of the Ducks, therefore it cannot be amisse to give him a Bowle of small Beere for a cooler.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman that dwelt tenne miles from <hi>London,</hi> sent his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all haste to the Citty, to tell a Merchant welcome newes of a rich Unkle of his lately dead,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11748:27"/>
that had left him somewhat to make him merry for his Death, with an out-side mourning in Blacke, and an in-side laughing with Sacke. The Foot-man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Message, with a Letter, made as much speed as hee could, in hope of Reward for his good tidings, so that he seem'd by his pace to have wings on his heeles, and by the fogge or sweate hee was in, you would have suppos'd him to have beene bloated or stewed body and bones.</p>
               <p>Being come to the Merchant, hee deliver'd the Letter, which after he had halfe read, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents contented him so, that hee call'd his Maid, commanding her to fill a Bowle of Beere, and give it to the Foot-man, (who stood dropping with sweate as if he had newly beene duck'd) but hee setting it to his mouth, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11748:27"/>
it with extreame eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and finding by the taste that it was a poore mortified Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, having no vivacity left in it, but meerely cold, comfortlesse, and at the best, a poore decayed single-soal'd drinke, although it were dead, and a deceased rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of humidious Aquacity, nay though it had not upou the death or departure from its Cinnicall or Diogenicall habitation given so much as a good rellish, a smacke, or a taste to the poore Foot-man, that ever any Malt had beene drown'd, drench'd, or imbrew'd into it, yet hee (as a man of a milde temper) amidst his heate, unwilling to speake ill of the dead, did plainely tell the Merchant thus: Sir, I doe thinke that your Beere hath ran as fast as I have ran, and faster. Why sayst thou so? (quoth the Merchant)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11748:28"/>
because said the other, it sweates more then I do: it cannot be said the Marchant: the foote-man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that if it did not sweate, he was much deceived, for hee was sure it was in a cold sweate, or all of a water.</p>

                  <head>Now how the Beefe was purchased.</head>
                  <p>A Brace or couple of monilesse Gallants, who had met with some believing or credulous Mercer and Taylor, and sworne (and lied themselves into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate suites of praeter-plu-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect-plush, or well deserving bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Uelvet: these two had long time shared equall fortunes, and did purpose to live and dye in a brotherly conjunction; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was pitty to part them.</p>
                  <p>It befel that upon an Ash-wens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, they chanced to read a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for the strict observing and keeping of Lent; at which they were both exceedingly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so that the one said to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I cannot live according as is here commanded, for I will eate no fish, and therefore must have flesh: The other then replied I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11748:29"/>
I thinke neither of us have friends, money, or credit, to purchase flesh or fish; but if thou canst borrow a Porters habite, as a Frock, Cap, Basket, Rope, or Halter; stockins, shooes, and the like, then I will assure thee, I will load thy backe with good Beefe; my wit shall get it, and thy backe shall beare it, and our old Hostesse where we lodge, will powder it, and wee all will bee merry, and eate it.</p>
                  <p>To be short, the out-side of a Porter was borrowed, and on the Thursday after Ash-wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to the Butchers went this Gentleman-porter, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort the Kater. (Now there was an old Doctor of <hi>Physicke,</hi> which for some Reasons shall not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Hee dwelt in <hi>London,</hi> of good repute, and great estate, but so lame of the Gout, that he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11748:29"/>
seldome went out of his House, but sate in a Chaire, and gave his opinion of Urins and Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Directions, and Bills to Patients and Apothecaries.) This Doctor was the stake or ayme that the Master Cheater did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to make the Buckler for his knavery: For comming to a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, hee bargained with him at the best rate for so many Stone of the chiefest Beefe, with a legge and shoulder of Mutton, and loyne of Veale, which came to fifty shillings and odde money; which being cut in peeces, and joynted, and laid in the Basket, he asked the Butcher if hee knew such a Doctor of Physicke? (as afore-said) the Butcher said that he knew him well, that hee was an honest Gentleman, and that one of his men did buy meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him at his shop; the Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11748:30"/>
reply'd, that hee was also one of the Doctors men, and that hee that was wont to buy meat of him, was his Fellow, but he was gone into the Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some occasions, and that himselfe for his part had laid out all his money in the Citty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon other things for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, therefore hee intreated the Butcher to let one of his servants to goe home with him, and take his due for his meate: The But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher said it was a busie time, and had my customers to serve, yet hee commanded one of his men, (calling him <hi>Richard</hi>) to goe with the Gentleman, to bring 52. shillings and 10. pence, and to make haste backe againe.</p>
                  <p>Away went the Butcher, the Porter, and the Gentleman, who asked the Butcher his name, and of what Country he was? he said
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11748:30"/>
his name was <hi>Richard Snelling,</hi> of such a Parish in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi> the Cheater straite began to call <hi>Richard</hi> Cousin, and told him, that himselfe was a <hi>Snelling</hi> by the Mothers side, and that hee would doe more for him than hee was aware of. When they came into a Lane neere <hi>London wall,</hi> (called <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lane</hi>) where the old Doctor dwelt, the Cheater said <hi>Richard,</hi> I will goe before, and have the gate or doore open, because the Porter is loaden; so running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace to the gate, hee knock'd, which straite a Maide opened, to whom he said, yonder comes a Butcher with a Porter, I pray you let them rest here in the Hall whilst I doe speake a word with your Master in the Parlour: as hee requested, it was done, and the Cheater went to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11748:31"/>
Doctor, and told him that hee was a Gentleman famous for Learning and Experience, and that though hee were lame in his legges, yet hee was sound in his Art and profession, which had moved him to bring to him a Patient, (his Kinsman) who was of Gentle Birth, but in his wild youth ran from his Parents, and bound himselfe Apprentise to a Butcher, and now within two dayes he was halfe franticke, and talk'd of nothing but money, which he thought was some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature in the Brayne, through want of sleepe, which surely Sir (said he to the Doctor) I am perswaded that you can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one night, and you shall have ten pound for the Cure: He is very milde and tractable, his fault is onely talking of Money, and he staies without in your Hal.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11748:31"/>
I pray you call him in said the Doctor, which the Cheater did, saying, <hi>Richard,</hi> goe into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, my Master will pay you: so in went the Butcher to the Physitian, the whilst the two Cheaters went away with the meate. Then <hi>Richard</hi> entred with his Cap off, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny scraping legges to the Doctor, who bade him put on his Cap, and take a stoole, and sit downe by him; but <hi>Richard</hi> said, hee had more manners than so, desiring his Worship to helpe him to his money: Alas good fellow sayd the Doctor, I would not have thee to set thy heart upon mony, for they that doe love money, are bewitch'd with this World, and have little thought or hope of a better; that money was like fire and water, very necessary for the use of Man, (so long as they are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11748:32"/>
servants, and kept under) but where they get the maistry, they will doe a man a world of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> reply'd, (Sir) I care not for money, but I must have money of you for my Master Beefe: to whom the Doctor said, <hi>Richard,</hi> thou art farre gone, how long hast thou beene in this case, to talke thus idly of Money? I pray thee canst thou say thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Creed? Then straite the Butcher began to waxe hot, and said, that he was not farre gone, nor would goe without his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and for the case hee was in, it is the same hee will be in, till he have his Money: And as for prayers, hee came not thither to pray; and therefore I pray Sir, to leave jesting, and give me my Money, for my Master and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris are hastie folkes; and will
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11748:32"/>
bee very angry with me for my long stay, and therefore give me my money.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor perceiving that he could not put <hi>Richard</hi> out of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Money, did suppose he was stark mad, and therefore he quickly called for his men, (<hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>) and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to take <hi>Richard,</hi> and put him into a close Chamber, and to draw curtaines, and shut up the windows, whereby hee might be kept darke, (for the better settling of his braines) say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Richard</hi> came of good friends, and that a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (his Unkle) was with him but now, and further, that hee had a good hope to cure him in short time.</p>
                  <p>The Serving-men (as their Master bad them) tooke hold of <hi>Richard,</hi> who would not goe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11748:33"/>
with them; then they began to pull, hale, and tugge him, so that <hi>Richard</hi> in anger, asked if they would make him mad: Then they fell by the ears, and cuffe, and buffetted till they were bloody-nos'd, and their Bands torne; the Doctor still crying to his men, Away with him, I will tame him before I have done, that he shall set his minde no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> (being weake) was dragg'd perforce to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when presently the Butcher (<hi>Richards</hi> Master) came to the doore, and knock'd, demanding whether hee had not a servant in the House? one of the men said, there was a young fellow in the House that was stark mad, and that they would hhe had beene hang'd before they saw him, hee had beaten and torne them so:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11748:33"/>
what, is he mad, (quoth the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?) yes said the other, hee talkes of Money, and would have it of my Master; but feare not (honest man) my Master will cure him.</p>
                  <p>What, is my man mad said the Butcher? yea quot the other, hee would have Money, I told you: Money, why should hee not have Money said the Butcher? He must, and shall have Money, and so will I: Are you as mad as your man said the Serving-man? then we must be troubled to have another darke Chamber for you too; and (growing to high words one with another) at last the Butchers wife came, (flinging her Armes as if she had beene swimming) using the volubility of her Tongue to a shrill and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty straine, (a principall vertue in too many women) that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11748:34"/>
House rang with the clamour, (as if it had beene a Cock-pit) asking her Husband why hee staid there, and where the idle rogue her man was, that hee brought not away the Money.</p>
                  <p>The old lame Doctor, hearing such a noise, asked one of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants what the matter was: who told him that the Butcher and his wife both were come for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Hoy-day, said the Doctor, I thinke all the World is made for Money; goe and tell the Butcher and his Wife, that I have not darke roomes enow in my House for them: so after a little confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence together, the Doctors maid affirm'd that a Porter rested his meate in their Hall, whilst the other Gentleman spake with him in the Parlour, and that they both went away when the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers man went in: thus the truth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11748:34"/>
was cleared, the Cheaters were victual'd, the Doctor was gull'd, the Butcher was couzned, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was released.</p>

               <p>THere is a Market-town (which I will not name in Print) in the roade betwixt <hi>Lond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> which hath a

pretty River or Brooke rnnnes by it, up which Brooke it did chance that a Sturgeon did swim or shoote, (somewhat neere the Towne) the which a Gentleman that dwelt neere, espied, and caused a small Rope to bee put through the gills of the Fish, and fastened it to a stumpe of a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, intending to take it as a wafte or stray, that fell into the limits of his owne Bounds or Royalty: but as hee was gone to make provision for the carriage of it, and to call his servants for that purpose, the newes of the Sturgeon was brought to the Towne, and the Recorder told the Major, that it was taken in their Liberty, and that they were better to spend or give an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, than to lose or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the losse of so much ground as the Sturgeon was within their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11748:38"/>
Liberty and Lordship: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were their best course to goe speedily and fetch it away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne perforce.</p>
               <p>This counsell was lik'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, and so with one consent, the Major with his Brethren, the Recorder, and Officers, with the whole Drove or Heard of the Townsmen, went out to bring in the Sturgeon. And as they went, Master Major said, that he had eaten part of such a Fish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, but in all his life hee had never seene a whole Sturge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therfore he did not know of what shape or proportion it was: to whom one of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men said, Sir, in my youth I did use to goe to Sea, and then I did now and then see one, and I can compare or liken him to nothing more than to an old ragged Colt; 'tis like enough to bee so (quoth

the Major) and for any thing I know he may be like a Goose, a Cocke, or a Bull: Thus as they walk'd and talk'd many words to small purpose, they espy'd a fellow leading a young Colt with aslip from the Brooke thwart o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the field, which caused one of the Aldermen to say to the Major, Sir, yonder man (be like) hath had some warning of our comming, and you may see he is about to prevent us, for he is leading away the Sturgeon from us; with that the Major cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led aloud, saying, Hallow, thou fellow, I charge and command thee, that thou bring hither our Sturgeon before me: The fellow (wondring) answer'd, what zay Zur? Marry I say Sir, I charge thee bring hither our Sturgeon; What doe you meane, my Colt said hee? Sirrah, sirrah, said the

Major, doe not you offer to put your knavish Colts tricks upon me, for if you doe, I'le lay you by the Heeles: Do'st thou thinke that I am such an Asse that I doe not know a Colt from a Sturge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Yfaith quoth the fellow, you are a merry Gentleman, and with that hee led the Colt away. Then the Major commanded men to pursue him, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Sturgeon: Well, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ran, the Townsmen ran, the Colt slip'd his Halter, and was encompast round, and hunting him into the Towne, was met by men, women, and children, as a rare and admirable sight, and had like to have beene kill'd, and cut out into Jolles and Rands, and made up into Keggs in pickle, but that a knowing understanding Shooe-maker most luckily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it.</p>

standing, and another penny the Tanner spent upon himselfe in a Pinte of Beere, and a halfe-penny loafe; so two pence in the Totall was his constant expences every Market-day for so long a time: till at last as hee passed alongst the Streete, he espied a Wench that sold hot Pudding-pies, and presently his chapps began to water, so that his quicke Eye and liquorish Tooth made him turne prodigall so farre as to waste a pennie upon himselfe for a Pudding-pie, which he put in his Handkerchiefe, and carried to his Inne, with a purpose to feast his carkasse. So being set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a Roome, hee call'd for a whole pot of Beere, which the Maide drew, and was carrying it to him: but meeting her Dame or Mistris by the way, shee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her to whom that Beere was

fill'd? for the old Tanner said the Maide, whereat the Mistris call'd her forgetfull Baggage, that had forgotten his usuall Diet, to bee but a pinte of Beere, and a Halfe-pennie loafe: The Maide reply'd, that hee had bought a Pudding-pie, and would make that serve instead of Bread, and therefore hee would spend a whole pennie in Drinke. So it was carried to the Tanner, who sate (repentingly) looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Pie; the whilst the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse went into another roome, where there were some merry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows drinking, to whom shee told how the Tanner had altered his custome and diet, and that hee was in such a Roome alone with his Pot and his Pudding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie before him: whereat one of the fellows start up, and swore, the old miserable Hound should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11748:43"/>
have small joy of it; so away went he to the Tanner, (who as yet had neither touch'd Pie or Pot) to whom hee said, by your leave Father, I am bold to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Roome, for my selfe with some friends are basely us'd in this House, for they fill us such scurvy dead drinke, as a man would bee asham'd to wash his Boots with it: Now you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old Guest of the House, I would taste if your Beere bee better, and with that hee tooke up the Pot, and dranke all off, set it on the Boord againe, saying, I thought (old man) that you were in favour with mine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse, and I perceive it now by the goodnesse of the Liquor: Oh but said the Tanner, you have drunk up all, then call for more said the other; but who shall pay (quoth the Tanner?) hee that's

The Hoy-man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, saying, they are not mine to sell, I am but hired to bring them to <hi>London</hi> for a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger that dwells there. My Friend (quoth <hi>Bawdy-boy</hi>) what though they are none of thine to sell, yet thou may'st let me have one Hundred of them, and make thy Master beleeve they were mis-told to thee; or else thou may'st mis-tell one Hundred in the delivery of them; 'tis twenty to one they will never bee mist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many.</p>
               <p>This gentle and grave counsell began to worke upon the tender conscience of the Faggot-man, insomuch that the bargaine was strooke, that for Five Shillings <hi>Bawdy-boy</hi> should have one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Faggots. In briefe, the Faggots were taken into the

Wherrie, and the Faggot-seller expected Five shillings; to whom <hi>Bawdy-boy</hi> said, (Friend) I doe see a Faggot with a crooked stick in it, which sticke will be to me of more worth than three Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, for a use that I would put it to: I pray thee let me have it, and I wil give thee one of my faggots backe againe for it; the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that he would doe him that kindnesse, though it were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to him to remove a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen or twenty Faggots that lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: So whilst the fellow was busie to get the crooked-sticke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faggot, <hi>Bawdy-boy</hi> thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe off with his Boate and one Hundred of Faggots: At the last the Hoy-man came to the Hoyes side, and perceiving his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to be gone, hee called to him, saying, Hoe friend, com<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

the crooked sticke: To whom <hi>Bawdy-boy</hi> reply'd, saying, it is no matter, I have better bethought my selfe, I will make a shift without it: the other call'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and said, thou hast nor paid me for my Faggots, I know it well quoth the other, nor will I pay thee any thing; thou art a Theefe, and a notable Rogue, and I will pay thy Master, who is an honest Gentleman, and hee shall know what a Rogue you are, and so I leave you.</p>
