         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that albeit they were men of rare learning, of profound
wisedome, of deepe iudgment, and subtile vnderstandings,
yet did they submit their vnderstanding, and iudgments, and
captiuate their wisedomes and learning, to the obedience of
fayth: so that in all their number there was none found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the deity of the second person, with Arrius, nor the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the holy Ghost with Macedonius, nor the truth of the
reall presence with Caluin, nor the necessity of good workes
with Luther, none was found to be a Manichean, Marcionist,
Donatist, Eunomian, Anabaptist, or Puritan: none I say was
found among them to adhere to ould sectmasters, or to follow
new Dogmatizers, none to embrace the heresies that grew in
former ages, or sprunge vp in these later tymes; so happy was
Ireland by the fauour of heauen to liue still in the perpetuall
sunne-shine of Catholicke Religion, without the interpositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any cloud of errour or heresy. Neither was Ireland our deere

in behalfe of <hi>S. Partrick)</hi> furnish the scrip of your memoryes with
fiue most bright stons taken vp out of the torrent of our glorious
Apostles life, wherwith if you charge the sling of your tongues,
the weakest among you shalbe able to encounter, &amp; cast downe
any temerarious, &amp; <hi>Goliah</hi>-harted protestant that should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

The holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Eucharist, is but a bare type &amp; naked
figure: no religious worship is to be exhibited to the sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Saints: the Masse deserueth not the honour or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of a sacrifyce, it being but a phantastical stage-show, fraught

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
vs to the hauen of interminable happines. What, is this the
symbole that Patricke hath planted with infatigable paynes, &amp;
roborated with stupendious miracles? Is this the forme of belief
that hath ingendred in our worthy Ancestors such contempt of
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:7147:6"/>
sublunar felicity, such detestation of sensuall blandishments, &amp;
such thirst of heauenly beatitudes? Why then did Patrike seeke
and accept of his mission from the Roman chaire c. 3. §. 2. &amp; 4?
Why did he procure her priuiledges and indults c. 17. §. 2? Why
did he not misprize the title of Apostle, the office of Legat, the
Pallium of Bishop she bestowed of him, c. 17. §. 33? Where doth
he treate with Kinges, touching the vndergoing this care of
preaching? Or where is the least mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he was
emploied by them in this charge? We find in this volume, c. 10
§. 2. &amp; 4. that he reuoked to life, &amp; enspirited againe, the dead
bodyes of Kinges, but neuer that he entituled them heads of the
Church, &amp; surely he was no lesse faythful in designing of these
liuing vnder one supreme and soueraigne Pastour, then he was
fortunate in reuiuing them. By S. Patrickes verdict then, not
Kings, but Bishops are gouernors of the Church &amp; Presidents
of fayth. The moderne sect masters depriue you of the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and substitute but a bare shadow of Christs body in the holy
Eucharist. But more liberall is Patricke, who confidently tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
(q) the bloud &amp; body of our spouse, to be shrouded vnder
these visible symbols c. 6. §. 6. &amp;c. 16. §. 5. and stileth it, <hi>a diuine
Viaticum,</hi> c. 10. §. 2. These pure Gospellers daigne not scarce the
honor of sepulture to sacred bodies, of whose cinders S. Patrick
deliuereth magnificent eulogies, &amp; prophecieth gloriously c. 12
§. 5. and brought himselfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> reliques of the Apostles &amp;
Martyrs, togeather with a sheet died with our Sauiours bloud,
causing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be shrined sumptuously, &amp; worshiped religiously
c. 17. §. 3. <hi>Calum</hi> &amp; <hi>Luthers</hi> progeny, are so incensed against the
holy sacrifice of masse, that they are not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to abrogat
the vse therof, but they would haue the very name obliterated.
But <hi>S. Patrike</hi> was a most earnest establisher of the Masse, by the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of protestants the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, so that with the bare instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
used in that misterious oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wrought stupe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious signes, c.
11. §. 2. &amp; deliuered many honorable encomioms of it. Now as
for saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> attained by sole fayth, the Proto-patriark of the fift
gospell, is so serious to establish this wicked <hi>Theorem,</hi> that in
fauour of it, he shameth not to discard canonicall Scripture;
thinking perchance that himselfe being the Apostle of a god &amp;
goddes <hi>Bacbus</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus</hi> might by authority down waigh &amp; ouer
<pb n="xij" facs="tcp:7147:7"/>
the Apostle of Iesus Christ. S. Patricke was so farre from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this exoticall and vnchristian paradoxe, the sluce to all
flagitiousnesse, that he tearmeth with S. Iames, Fayth that is
not animated by good workee, a dead, and life-lesse fayth, nay
no fayth at all, that in any wise auailes towardes our finall
happinesse. By this Antithesis of these fiue articles in debate
betweene vs and Protestants (not to enterlarge me any more
in a cause so perspicuous in any dispassionate eye) the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
or opposition of the fift ghospell, and S. Patrickes religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is rendred so luculent and manifest, that the proudest Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of the Protestant side, vnlesse he be moone-sicke, wil neuer
presume to accept of the combat on the open playne of S. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes
life. Now to declare the triall of so indifferent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
a barre, and to flinche from the vnpreiudicate verdict
of Saint Patricke (who liued within the compasse of the fiue
prime ages of the confessed purity of fayth and religion) cannot
but put all Catholikes, and especially Irishmen, in suspicion of
their fraudulent de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>portement, and foule wracking impostures,
since it was Patrike that brought to them the brightsome light
of true, and neuer fayling fayth, if euer she blazed her glorious
beames on the face of Ireland (and I suppose none will be soe
impudent as to deny she did) since it was Patricke that planted
Ireland, a Paradise of pleasures, whether Elias would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
to be transported in his fiery Caoch to glut his mind with
her marueilous delights, since it was he that consecrated her as
it were a third heauen, whether S. Paul would willingly be
rauished to contemplate her delightfull maruayles, since it was
he that disimpestered her by the soueraigne influxion of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
benediction, of the encombrance of serpents, scorpions &amp;
other venemous animals, since it was he that beautifyeth her
with the stately structures of religious monasteries, garnished
her with many miriades of renowned Saints, enriched her
with copious treasures of sacred priuiledges, so that scarce any
corner can be found in Ireland, that is not sanctifyed with some
worthy monument of his holy benediction. What hitherto we
haue instanced in a more ample and diffuse manner concerning
S. Patricke our chiefe patron and Apostle, the same we may
auouch no lesse of S. Bridgit the seconde in the number of our
<pb n="xiij" facs="tcp:7147:7"/>
holy patrons: how farre she was from houlding with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
or breaking with Catholikes, her life will giue ample
testimony. The same we may as well auerre of S. Columbe,
who is the third in the glory of patronizing Ireland; for he
taught no other religion in Brittany or the lesser Scotland, then
that himselfe learned in Ireland, or the greater Scotland. What
this religion was, Protestant or Papisticall, I leaue it to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittement
of any that wil with conscience peruse his life, which
heere we haue compendiously set downe. Heare then, O wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with an obsequious eare, the doctrin of your thrice
worthy Father S. Patricke, and of your two other holy Patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
bind it on your fingers,<note place="margin">Prou, 1.</note> and write it in the tables of your hartes,
to preuent that you sincke not so deepe in the gulfe of true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
as you haue soared high in the ayre of Christian glory, to
preuent that the world, that hitherto hath proclaymed your
impregnable fidelity, declayme not against your damnable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidie:
<hi>If sinners entise you, do not condescend to them; for their feete
do run to euill.</hi> What greater euill can they runne into, then to
varnish their nouuell religion, with the graue colours of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
antiquity? Or what greater imposture can they impose on
you, then to father their protestant paradoxes, on the primitiue
Christians? Can any conceaue that our moderne sect-masters,
after the reuolution of so many ages, see more clearely, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
more faithfully, the religion that flourished in the first fiue
centuryes after our redemption, then S. Patricke who liued
within the compasse of the sayd tymes? O no! This bragge
then of their pretensed concordance with the Christians of these
purer tymes, is a vaine flourish, a painted shew, a mere collusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>By these points insisted vpon, and instanced by vs, you
may learne the sympathy between vs moderne Catholikes and
S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> &amp; betweene <hi>S. Patrike</hi> and the Primitiue Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
and on the contrary, discouer the discrepancy of the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
not only with <hi>S. Patcrike,</hi> whome I am sure they wil discard for
a very superstitious papist, but from all the current of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Catholiks, hauing no more alliance with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then truth with
falshood, light with darkenes, or Christ with Belial. And to
returne home, deere Contrymen, it is not they that conuerted
Ireland, being a pagan Kingdome, but rather peruerted her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Catholike country, they haue not illuminated her fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
with the light of faith, but on the contrary, obscured her
faythfull with the fogge of heresy. For which respect that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
censure of <hi>Tertullian</hi> may be deseruedly pronounced of
them: <hi>Of the administration of the word, what shall I say? Since it is
their study, not to conuert the Ethnicks, but to peruert ours: and this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
they ayme at, if they may procure the ruine of such as stand, and not the
erection of them that are prostrate; for their worke consists not of their
owne proper building, but of the destruction of the truth; they digge vp

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST (gentle Reader) I would haue thee
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that in this Translation of S.
<hi>Patrickes</hi> life, I haue followed <hi>Iocelinus
of Tornesio,</hi> who had written it in latin
aboue 400. yeares agone, at the intreaty of <hi>S. Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Conerthen,</hi> of the right Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in God <hi>Thomas,</hi> Lord Primate of Ireland, &amp; of
the honorable Knight Syr <hi>Iohn de Curcy,</hi> as himself
signifyeth in his Preface, which togeather with many
other celebrious and note-worthy thinges, I haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
left out, contenting my selfe in this present edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to publish a summary abridgment of the matters,
that are most remarkable, and best befitting our tymes.
If I learne that this my labour will proue gratefull, I
will God willing, put my hand to an entiere edition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would haue thee know, that in seuerall
Chapters and passages, I haue for the latin word <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nia,</hi>
translated <hi>England,</hi> wherof I would haue none
to take aduantage. I know the English lay clayme to
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:7147:10"/>
               <hi>S. Patricke,</hi> so doe the French, so doe the Moderne
Scots. Therefore it was not my minde, or meaning to
giue a decissiue verdict or suffrage in a matter so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
on all sides, or to depriue any of the former na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the right, or title they haue to him. For <hi>S.
Patricke</hi> is too rich a iewell, to be lost but vpon good
euidence, and better then I haue alleadged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning <hi>S. Bridgits</hi> life, I haue
translated it partly out of <hi>Cogitosus</hi> her nephew (as
some do thinke) and partly out of <hi>Capgraue,</hi> &amp; haue
my slefe distinguished it by Chapters and Paragraphes
otherwise then it is in the latin, thinking that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
I obserued therein, would be more for thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
profit, the ornament of the worke, and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
of the life it selfe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this summary of S. <hi>Columbes</hi> life,
I haue abridged out of S. <hi>Adamnan,</hi> whome I haue
preferred before many other authors, supposing that
none will be so impudent, as to deny what hath beene
deliuered from so holy, and innocuous a pen Further
for the latin worde <hi>Scotia,</hi> I haue most commonly
translated <hi>Ireland,</hi> in regard that Ireland was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
called <hi>Scotia,</hi> by the conspiring confession and
vniforme consent of all learned Writers, and especia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because it is cleerer then midday, that my Authour
meaneth by the latin word <hi>Scotia, Ireland,</hi> which he
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:7147:10"/>
calls sometymes <hi>Scotia,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Hibernia,</hi> in
one and the selfe same paragraphe, whereof see cleere
and vndenidable proofes <hi>lib. 2. cap. 6. §.</hi> 1. and
<hi>lib. 3. cap. 2. §.</hi> 1. Which we haue faythfully
translated as they lye in the latin, to show with what
sincerity and candour, and vpon what iustifyable
groundes, we haue proceeded in this matter.</p>
            <p>Fiftly gentle Reader, I trust that as the desire of
of aduancing thy spirituall profit, made me vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this translation: so thou wilt be pleased of thy
curtesy to correct patiently, or to couer charitably, the
faults escaped both in the English, and print. Truly
were I able (as I was not) to inuest these Saints liues in
a lofty and magnificent stile, yet would I preferre a
a plaine and simple phrase. I know that would sound
sweetest in the eare, but this sinketh deepest into the
hart, whereof holy Scriptures written in a phrase
plaine inough, giue aboundant testimony. But as for
the faults of the presse, they could not but be many, by
reason of my owne absence from the Print: the most
principall I haue noted downe in the correctiue table,
the rest I leaue to thy fauourable correction, Farewell.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the village of <hi>Taburnia</hi> in Brittany,
hard by <hi>Emptor Towne,</hi> in the South of
England, there liued a man named
<hi>Calphurnius,</hi> who took to wife a french
Damoiselle named <hi>Conquessa,</hi> Neece to S. <hi>Martin
Archbishop of Tours in France.</hi> This holy couple,
liued togeather in great sanctity, and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
being iust before God, and walking in his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
and commandements without blame.
In processe of tyme, it pleased God to blesse
them with a holy, and happy issue, whome they
named <hi>Patricke,</hi> who was no sooner regenerated
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7147:12"/>
in the lauer of holy Baptisme, but God began
to denounce to the world, his admirable sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by the voyce of stupendious miracles, in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
following.</p>
               <p>2. A certaine man strucken with blindnes
from his mothers wombe, named <hi>Gormas,</hi> heard
in his sleep a voyce commanding him with the
right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the child <hi>Patrick</hi> (newly christened)
to make the signe of the Crosse on the ground:<note place="margin">The si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.</note>
which voice added further, that thereupon would
gush out a vaine of liuing water, wherewith if he
washed his eyes, he should recouer his sight. The
man obeyed the diuine oracle, &amp; found the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Siloe rieterated in that miraculous foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
Nay (which is more prodigious) at the same
tyme, his spirituall eyes were opened, being
illustrated with the guift of infused knowledged,
so that of an ingorant blind man, he became a
learned Reader, and vnderstander of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>3. The holy child <hi>Patricke,</hi> encreasing in
yeares, grew likewise in grace, and as a shop full
fraught with sweet perfumes, breathed forth the
fragrant odours of astonishing miracles. In <hi>Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
Towne,</hi> where the holy child and his sister <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pita</hi>
were brought vppe, vnder the care of an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7147:12"/>
Aunt of theirs, after the dissoluing of the frost,
a certaine sinke, or Va<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te, did so swell vp with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that it threatned the destruction of many
houses, and particulerly the inundation did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
the house wherein the holy child liued,
so that al the houshold stuffe was ouerflowen: the
Blessed child being hungry, called to his Nurce
for bread: Who answered, that he was neerer
drowning, then getting any thing to eate. With
that the holy child dipped his fingers in the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
waters, and sprinckling them thrice ouer the
same with the signe of the holy Crosse, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the sinke in the name of the most holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to retyre. It was a wounder to see, the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ceased, the sinke or Vault became sodainly
dry. For from his sacred fingers, it seemed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that stood by, in lieu of droppes of water, sparck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of fire to issue forth, which dryed vp those swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
waters.</p>
               <p>4. On a certaine day in the winter tyme, the
holy child being among a company of his play-fellowes,
gathered vp in his lap some pieces of Ice,
and carrying them home, layd them on the floor.
To whome his Nurce sayd, that it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and much more fitting for the season, to haue
brought home wood for the fire, then so to play
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7147:13"/>
the wanton with the peeces of Ice. The sweet child
answered wisely, saying: It is easy for the Author
of nature, to dispense with the course of nature,
aud to make euen this frozen water, seruiceable
for the vse of fire: Then he layd the peeces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and after praying and making the signe of
the Crosse vpon them, he blew them: with that
they tooke fire, which cast out such flammes, and
heat, as yeelded forth not only the benefit of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
but also ministred great matter of admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to all that saw it: which, what els could the same
foreshew, but that this great Saint, shold infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the cold and frozen hartes of many, and with
the word of God, breathed from his sacred soule,
inflame them in the loue of so potent a Lord?</p>
               <p>5. One tyme as <hi>Lupita, S. Patrickes</hi> sister, went
to weane the lambes from their Dames, she fell,
and in falling burst her head against a sharp edged
Flint, that wounded her cruelly: many ran to see
that great mischance, and among them the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
child <hi>Patricke,</hi> who by making the signe of the
crosse on her forehead, restored her to perfect
health. In like manner did the Blessed child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
his Vncle, who dyed of suddayne death, by
making the signe of the Crosse vpon him, and
offering his deuout prayers for him. <hi>S. Patricke</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:7147:13"/>
was by his Aunt, deputed to the charge of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
sheep; One day, as he ledd them out to their
pasture, there rushed out of a wood hard by, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished
wolfe, who carryed away one of the sheep:
his Aunt missing the sheep, imputed the losse of

               <p>3. One day as the Saint sayd Masse in the
sayd Church,<note place="margin">S. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trike said masse.</note> a sacrilegious Magician, the child of
perdition stood without, and with a rodd put in at
the window, cast down the chalice, &amp; shed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament; but God without delay seuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
so wicked a sacriledge, for the earth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his mouth after a most strange manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
the Magician, who descended a liue downe
to hell: the Saint sorrowed much for the effusion
of the Chalice, and as he afflicted himselfe with
bitter teares, the Chalice by diuine vertue was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in its owne place with the sacrament so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
that there appeared no signe, nor marke of
the effusion. The same seuere reuenge did almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God exercise vpon another Magitian, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to kill the Saint.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>S. Patricke</hi> leauing his furniture in the

himselfe, as he had purposed often, to visit his old
Master <hi>Milchoe,</hi> in hope by his preaching to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
him to the sweet yoke of our Sauiour, but the
wicked wretch fearing that S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> efficacious
preaching should soften his stony hart, and withal
disdayning to submit himselfe to the doctrine of
him, who in former tymes had beene his slaue,
when he heard of the Saints approching, being
giuen ouer into a reprobate sense, and gatheringe
all his substance in a heap togeather, he set fire to
it, and after cast himselfe into the midest of the
flames, as a sacrifice to the infernall Furyes: But
<hi>Milchoes</hi> two Daughters, were conuerted to the
faith by <hi>Saint Patricke,</hi> and receaued the grace
of Baptisme, wherein both were named <hi>Emeria.</hi>
These holy virgins were endued in their life, with
many ornaments both of grace,<note place="margin">Miracls wroght at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher of Saints</note> and vertue; and
the many miracles wherewith according to <hi>S. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes</hi>
prophecie God honoured their sepulcher
in <hi>Cluainbron,</hi> giue euident testimony, that they are
translated to a better life.</p>
               <p>5. As <hi>S. Patricke</hi> passed through the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try,
sowing the seed of euangelicall doctrine, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
acquainted with a youth named <hi>Mochna,</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7147:22"/>
willingly <hi>S. Patrickes</hi> doctrine; the Saint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
baptised him, and taught him his crosse row.
The youth within the compasse of one month
learned all the psalter, and before a yeare came to
an end, attayned the vnderstanding of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
After a while as <hi>S. Patricke</hi> passed by that
place, <hi>Mochna</hi> repaired to him, and being both
in talke of diuine matters, a pastorall staffe sent
from heauen, fell iust betweene them: <hi>S. Patricke</hi>
tooke great ioy in that miraculous guift, &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to <hi>Mochna,</hi> sayd to him: Know my deerest
child, that by this pastorall staffe, you are desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take vpon you the charge of soules, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
him therefore (though much against his
will) to holy orders, at last he installed him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Edruim.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Holy orders.</note> S. <hi>Mochna</hi> did great good in the
Church of God, by meanes of his holy conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and singular doctrine, and ascended to the
triumphant, being indued with the ornaments of
rare vertues, and glory of many miracles.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Leogarius</hi> the Monarch, to keepe his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
in awe, and subiection, constrayned all his
Princes, and great Lords, to giue him hostages of
their loyalty, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g others he had <hi>Dichues</hi> sonnes
as pledges of their Fathers fidelity: when King
<hi>Leogarius,</hi> who was wholly addicted to superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

and idolatry, heard that <hi>Dichu</hi> and all his family

into a great rage, and chafe against him, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that his two sonnes, who where hostages
should be put to death, by keeping all manner of
liquour, and drinke from them. The Saint know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by diuine reuelation of that most cruel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
had his recourse to his wonted wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of holy prayer; and loe the night following,
an Angell comming into the prison, presented to
the young noble men a soueraigne liquor, that
quenched their present thirst: and which is farre

               <p>THE solemne feast of our Sauiours trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Resurrection approached, which S.
<hi>Patricke</hi> determined to celebrat with great solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in a fayre, and spatious field called, <hi>Breage,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:7147:23"/>
and there by euangelizing the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and administring the sacrament of holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
to encrease the number of the faythful; for
which end he went to a certaine noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s house,
hard by the field aforesayd. The noble man,
whose name was <hi>Sesgnen,</hi> entertayned the Saint
very courteously, and was himselfe with all his
house, conuerted to the true fayth. This noble
man had a Son, whom at the sacred font, the Saint
called <hi>Benignus,</hi> a name rightly beseeming him;
for in his life and demeanour, he was most benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and sweet, being beloued both of God &amp; men,
worthy of eternall glory in heauen, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
of all men vpon earth. This holy child
could not be separated from the company of the
Saint; for when the Saint layd him downe to rest,
the child stealing from his Father and Mother,
fell downe at his feet, imbracing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and fixing many a sweete kisse vpon them.
The next morning as the Saint got vp into his
Coach, hauing one foot in the boote of his Coach
&amp; another vpon the ground, the child tooke him
by the feet, beseeching him after a most earnest
manner, not to leaue him behind: and returning
to his Parents, that laboured to detayne him, he
sayd weeping, &amp; crying out aloud: <hi>Get you hence,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7147:23"/>
Get you hence, dismisse me, I pray you, that I may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
my spirituall Father.</hi> The Saint behoulding,
&amp; admiring such great deuotion in such a tender
breast, gaue the child his benediction, &amp; prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied,
that he should be his Successour in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matship
of Ireland, which thing fell out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>2. The holy Bishop solemnised the Paschall
feast in the foresayd field,<note place="margin">Candels vsed in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> and according to the
custome of holy Church, did light the candells
with hallowed fire. The Idolatrous people cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
at that tyme, a great solemne feast of
theirs called Rach,<note place="margin">Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fire on Easter saturday</note> in which feast (dedicated to

vsed no light, for it was the custome with them,
to quench the fire in all places thereaboutes, and
it was treason for any to light it, before it were
seene lighted in the Kings pallace. King <hi>Leogarius</hi>
with all his nobility, then kept court at <hi>Tarach</hi>
his principall howse, from whence seeing the fire,
which the Saint had kindled, he raged extremely,
and diligently inquired who presumed to attempt
such a matter. One who was in the company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
answeared, as it were by way of prophecy;
If this fire be not extinguished this night, the
kindler of it with his followers, shal beare rule in

chariots, in regard that his Magicians put him in
the head, that that number was fortunate, and
prosperous.<note place="margin">Psal. 19. v. 8.</note> Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sight of all these chariots, the
Saint sung that verse of the psalme. <hi>These in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
and these in horses, but we will inuocate in the

neere the place, he sent for the Saint, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding
him to make his appearance before him. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
office being ended, the Saint came, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of the Courtiers, as the King commanded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
him any reuerence or honour, except one
<hi>Hercus,</hi> who rose &amp; saluted the Saint very offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
The Saint gaue him his benediction,
and promised him life euerlasting. <hi>Hercus</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the grace of regeneration, and leading a life
conspicuous both for miracles and vertues, being

               </p>
               <p>3. A certaine Magician that was in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with the King, &amp; whome the King honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as a God, opposed himself against S. <hi>Patrike,</hi>
euen in the same kind that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> resisted
the Apostle S. <hi>Peter:</hi> the miserable wretch being
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7147:24"/>
eleuated in the ayre by the ministery of Diuels,
the King and the people looked after him, as if he
were to scale the heauens, but the glorious Saint
with the force of his feruent prayers, cast him
downe vnto the ground, where dashing his head
against a hard flint, he re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred vp his wicked soule,
as a pray to the infernall Fiendes.</p>
               <p>4. The Magitians death put the King in a

for so cruell a masacre, he attempted to kill
the Saint. Who perceiuing their desperate inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Psal. 6<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

began to sing that verse of the Psalme: <hi>Let
God arise, and let his ennemyes be dispersed, let them
that hate him fly from his face.</hi> Almighty God, in
whose protection the Saint was, with thunder and
lightning stroke some of them downe starke dead,
and the rest he put to flight. The King hauing
but foure in his company, hid himselfe in a close
roome from the fury of God: the Queene falling
prostrate before the Saint, vndertooke in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he would adore the true
God, &amp; submit himselfe to the Saints directions,
who praying to Almighty God, the vehement
storme ceased; The King came, as the Queen had
promised, couering with the vaile of humility the
obstinate malice of his hart, in shew and outward
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7147:25"/>
adoration acknowledging the soueraigne maiesty
of God, he intreated the Saint, that he would be
pleased to come to his court, promising that he
would be wholy directed &amp; gouerned by the S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.:
wherto he condescended, albeit he were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Kinges deep &amp; wicked dissimulations</p>
               <p>5. But the wicked King being obdurate in
his malice, beset al the way, wherby the Saint was
to passe, with armed chariots; for euery seuerall
passage he belayd with nine chariots, to the end if
he escaped one passage, he should be intrapt in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
But the malice of man, cannot preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the goodnes of God, who conducted his
true seruant <hi>Patricke</hi> with eight more, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
youth <hi>Benignus</hi> inuisible through the midst of
their blood-thirsting ennemyes to <hi>Tarach,</hi> where
the King kept court. When the Saint entred the
Kings pallace, none did exhibite him: any honor,
or reuerence, excepting the Kings Poet, who with
great submission saluted him: which was reputed
in him to iustice, for he receaued the grace of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
&amp; the poems, which before he sung in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the false Gods, thence forwards he imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in praysing the true and liuing God.</p>
               <p>6. The wicked King seeing he could not by
force cut off the Saint, attempted to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7147:25"/>
by fraude; for by the hand of his Magitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he
offered the Saint a poysoned cuppe, which to the
great astonishment of all the company, he drunke
off without receauing any dommage thereby, but
the Magitian fearing to be ouercome with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall spels,
caused a fantasticall snow to fall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all the adioyning country: in like manner by
force of his magical charmes, he ouercast all the
land with a palpable darknes, the one or other he
was not able to remoue, as himselfe publikely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.
But <hi>S. Patricke,</hi> the child of light, offering
his deuout prayers to the Sunne of iustice, chased
away both the fantasticall snow, and diabolicall
darknes: the people of that Region, who sat in
darknes, now seeing this great light, praysed the
true God &amp; magnifyed his holy serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>S. Patricke</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. All this could not bring the child of Belliall,
the Magitian, to any good; therefore to discerne
the light of fayth from the darkenes of idolatry,
&amp; the verity of true doctrine, from the vanity of
magical leuity, a new course of tryal was set down:
for by the appointment of al the company, S. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi>
and the Magitian according thereunto, a
new house was built after a strange &amp; extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, the one halfe being made of greene
Oake, the other of dry, and withered Timber,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7147:26"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:7147:27"/>
then binding both Saint <hi>Benignus,</hi> and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
they placed them in the house opposite
one against another: <hi>S. Benignus</hi> attyred in the
Magitians apparell, was placed in the part that
was made of dry wood, and the Magitian with S.
<hi>Patrickes</hi> vestement, was placed in the part that
was built of greene Timber: this being done, fire
was put to the house. O strange and vnheard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the fire burnt the Magitian with the greene
part of the house, euen to ashes, leauing not so
much as the least signe of burning in the Saintes
vestement. But the holy youth <hi>Benignus</hi> was not
touched by the fire, nor receaued any harme by
it, the Magitians garment being consumed into
ashes. Behold then the renouation of the miracle
of the three Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Babylonian furnace,
registred by <hi>Daniel</hi> in his booke of prophecyes.</p>
               <p>8. For all this King <hi>Leogarius,</hi> relented not
from his wicked malice, but rather hardned his
hart like another <hi>Pharaoe;</hi> for in reuenge of the
Magitians death, he contriued by al meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Saints vtter destruction, finding many of
his subiects willing &amp; prompt to execute his blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
purpose but Almighty God the powerful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of his seruant, armed the zeale of senseles
creatures to fight against those senceles idolaters,
for the earth gaping horribly, swallowed downe to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7147:27"/>
the bottomles pit of hell those officers of malice,
and many of the Cittizens of <hi>Tarach,</hi> who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hand in this wicked designe. This seuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
strooke such a terrour in their mindes, that
all the people of the Country thereabout, fearing
to incurre the like danger, became Christians, &amp;
receaued the grace of Baptisme, but the wicked
King, he could not reclaime: therefore he thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred
out his malediction against him, denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically,
that none of his progeny should raigne

at his charity, yelded to his louing request, and
built the citty, which now is called <hi>Domnach Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druig,</hi>
that is, <hi>Saint Patrickes</hi> citty, and not farre
off, appointed a place for the building of a new
pallace for <hi>Conall,</hi> as himselfe desired. Then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by way of prophecy, he sayd:
<hi>Happy and fortunate shall his pallace be, and many shal
liue happily in it, Gods blessing will blesse thee, and will
establish thy throne, he will enlarge thy dominion, and
thy Brethrens ofspring shall serue thy posterity for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:7147:29"/>
5. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> determined with himselfe to
go into <hi>Connact,</hi> there to preach the Ghospell to
the inhabitants of that Prouince. By the way he
went to a place, where King <hi>Leogarius</hi> had an Idol,
gilded magnificently ouer with gold and siluer,
called <hi>Ceancrochie,</hi> that is, the head of the Gods.
This Idoll was compassed about with diuers petty
Gods made of brasse, that inclined towardes it in
signe of subiection.</p>
               <p>6. The Saint seeing he could neyther by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
Sermons, nor great miracles, reclayme the
people from the madnes of their Idolatry, had his
recourse to his wonted weapons of holy prayers,
no sooner did he then eleuate his pure handes in
prayer, for the subuersion of the Idol, and had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a threatning manner lifted vp the rod of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS
against it, but it fell downe vpon the left side,
and all the gold and siluer dissolued into dust, the
litle Gods were swallowed vp by the earth, euen
to their neckes. Hervpon many who saw that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
accident, belieued in the true and liuing
God, and were baptized in a fountaine, which the
Saint by his prayers produced out of the earth.</p>
               <p>7. After the subuersion of the Idols, the S.
held on his intended iorney, but when he drew
neare the frontiers of Connact, two Magitians
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7147:30"/>
their magicall charmes ouer cast all the region
with a horrible darcknes for the space of three
dayes, hoping by that meanes to debar his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
into the country; but the Saint with fastes
and prayers, chased away that diabolical obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so got into the country. King <hi>Leogarius</hi>
so often spoken of, had two daughters, one was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Ethne,</hi> and the other <hi>Fedella,</hi> both of them
were fostered by these Magitians. One daye that
these yong ladies walked abroad for their pastime
to a fountaine hard by, there they found the Saint
with his holy retinue, who indeuoured to bring
them into the waye of saluation, promising that if
they yelded to his persuasion, they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a holy matrimony with the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly spouse:
with which diuine exhortation, the virgins were
so inflamed, that they imbraced without all delay
the Christian Religion, and were baptised. Then
they requested the Saint in performance of his
promise, to exhibit to them the sight of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
spouse. The Saint answeared, you must first
receyue the B. blood, and flesh of your spouse, to
the end that being strenghtned by tasting of that
diuine <hi>viaticum,</hi> yow may passe to his heauenly
mansion. The holy virgins belieuing the Saint,
craued with great feruour the holy Eucharist, &amp;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7147:30"/>
receyued it, with no lesse deuotion, then giuing
nature her due, they ascended to their heauenly
spouses nuptiall feast: the Magitians, who foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, were also conuerted to the Christian
Religion, and receyued the grace of regeneration.</p>

               <p>AFTER this, a great and solemne Councell
of all the prouince was assembled, whether
came with a great retinue, the seauen sonnes of
<hi>Amlaic,</hi> a potent and rich noble man, who liued
in that prouince. To this assembly the Saint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
hoping to gayne many of that great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to Christ: A certaine Magitian opposed
himselfe against the Saint, and laboured extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to dispatch him out of the way, but Almighty
God stretched out his potent arme, &amp; with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of thunder, cut off the child of perdition, in
the presence of all the assembly. This great, &amp;
terrible miracle induced the sonnes of <hi>Amlaic,</hi>
with twelue thousand more, to embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, wherein they persisted firme, &amp;
constant euer after. Heere I forbeare to treat,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7147:31"/>
how the Saint conuerted the two holy Virgins,
daughters to <hi>Gauranus:</hi> how he brought a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
whome the earth had swallowed vp euen to
the eares, for attempting some mischeefe against
the Saint, to the detestation of Idolatry: and how
by rowling a stone, which a hundred men could
not stirre, he drew a grat multitude, to beleeue in
the corner stone, our deare Sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>2. The glorious bishop S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> ceased
not in all places to enlighten the hartes of such,
as were blinded with Idolatry, so that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the faythfull increased dayly. One day co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to a place called <hi>Fearta,</hi> he found two wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
dead, ouer whom inuocating the name of Christ,
he restored them againe to life, who being reuiued
exclaymed against the Idols, &amp; panyme Gods, &amp;
in the hearing of all the company, proclaymed
Christ to be the true and only God: all who were
present, gaue glory to God, &amp; deuoutly receaued
the sacrament of Baptisme. A certaine woman
named <hi>Fidelina,</hi> dyed in trauayle of child birth,
her friendes brought her dead corps, &amp; layd it
before the glorious Bishop, requesting him with
teares in their eyes, to restore her to the number
of the liuing, which the B. Saint did by vertue
of his feruent prayers: the woman after her resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7147:31"/>
to life againe, was deliuered of a sonne, &amp;
both of them were christned within a few dayes.
The woman relating what she had seene of the
glory of heauen, and paynes of hell, excited many
thousands to become Christian: this miracle the
Saint reiterated in another woman.</p>
               <p>3. The holy Saint trauailed about all <hi>Connact,</hi>
neuer ceasing from preaching, or working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
vntill such tyme as he brought all the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to imbrace the fayth of Christ. In many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he builded Churches, appointed Priests, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ecclesiasticall persons to direct them in the
way of saluation, &amp; to sing the diuine office. In a
fayre and spatious field farre distant from woods,
&amp; quarryes, he built by miracle a fayre Church,
which standeth to this day. Of two riuers that
were in those quarters, one called <hi>Dubh,</hi> abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
with fish, &amp; another called <hi>Drobhois,</hi> which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that commodity: the holy Bishop requested
some Fishers who drew in their nets full of Fish,
to help him to some, but the Fisher men deuoyd
of all charity, dismissed the faythfull seruant of
our Lord empty: but God the louer, and author
of charity, depriued <hi>Dubh</hi> of that benefit, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
it vpon <hi>Drobhois,</hi> which vntill that tyme,
had beene barren. Hereby the prudent Reader
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7147:32"/>
may learne, how meete it is to entertaine with all
charity, the true members of Christ, and faythful
seruants of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>4. In regard of the great scarsity of Churches
in Ireland, in the infancy of Christian Religion,
the Blessed Saint ordained, that at the sepulcher
of euery Christian, who could not be buryed in a
Church-yeard, a Crosse should be erected, the
better thereby to distinguish the faythfull sheep,
from the vnbeleeuers, as also to excite the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
who suruiued, to impart their charitable suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
to their deceased Brethren. It happened,
that at what tyme the Saint departed <hi>Connact,</hi> he
saw the head of one, at the tombes of two lately
interred, a crosse standing. The Saint bid his
coach man make a stand, then turning himselfe to
the graue where the crosse was, he questioned with
the dead, What sect or Religion he was? Who
answered, that he was a Pagan, ignorant of the
Christian Religion. To whome the Saint replyed,
what then haue you to doe with the Crosse of
Christ? The dead man answered, He that is buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neere vnto me, was a Christian: &amp; one of your
Religion (bringing a crosse by mistaking) fixed it
ouer our graue. The Saint without delay, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of his coach, to put the Crosse ouer the

               <p>SAINT <hi>Patricke</hi> hauing confirmed the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Connact</hi> in the Christian Religion,
made a iourney into <hi>Dalnardia</hi> in the North, wher
with his doctrine, example &amp; miracls, he brought
the inhabitants of that Country, to the profession
of Christianity; thence he departed, and passing
through <hi>Meath,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leinster,</hi> in all places he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Ghospell &amp; kingdome of heauen, &amp; in
places co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient he ordayned Bishops. It would
be a worke able to blunt the penne of the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent
Oratour, to set downe the stupendious
miracles, which he wrought in that iourney; for
euen like another S. <hi>Peter,</hi> with the very shadow
of his body did he worke miraculous cures, &amp; so
many as he receaued to Baptisme, knowing that
our aduersary would labour to entangle them in
his snares, he endeauoured to confirme in fayth,
fearing their relapse into infidelity. And because,
as witnesseth <hi>S. Iames</hi> the Apostle: <hi>Faith without
good workes is dead,</hi> yea which is more, that a dead
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7147:33"/>
fayth, is not fayth. The glorious Saint laboured
to excite in them that pure and sincere fayth,
which through loue performeth good workes.</p>
               <p>2. When S. <hi>Patricke</hi> came in his iourney,
so farre as <hi>Finglas,</hi> a place distant a mile from <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi>
being then but a little village, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
the place &amp; territory there about, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

wordes. <hi>That village which now is very small, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be

and dignity, neyther will it cease to increase, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
such tyme as it become the principall seate of all the
kingdome.</hi> The inhabitants of that village hearing
what great miracles, and signes God had wrought
by the meanes of his faythfull seruant <hi>Patricke,</hi>
went forth with great ioy to meet him. The Lord
of that places only sonne lay sicke, euen ready to
yeild vp his Ghost: the Saint being intreated by
his father, and all the assembly thereunto, went
to the place, where the sicke was, and by prayer
restored him to perfect health, the people seeing
this miracle, beleeued in the author of life, our
Sauiour Iesus.</p>
               <p>3. In that village, an honest matron, in
whose house then the Saint lodged, complained to
him of the penury of fresh water. The B. Bishop
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7147:33"/>
taking pitty of her, as also what the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
(newly regenerated) there suffered, &amp; that
he might inkindle their thirst after the fountaine
of life, our dearest Sauiour, he deemed it expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to mainfest his vertue and power. The next day
in the presence of many, he went to a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place, where stricking the earth with the end
of the staffe of IESVS, and making his prayer,
he produced thence a faire Well, full of sweet and
pleasant water, and soueraigne in curing many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
which well to this day is called S. <hi>Patrickes</hi>
Well.</p>
               <p>4. Here the course of my history requires,
that I declare how the glorious Bishop S. <hi>Patricke</hi>
came to the famous citty of <hi>Dublin</hi> which he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
lying in the suddes of Paganisme and Idolatry,
but the Saint washed it with the pure waters of
euangelicall doctrine, and that with great facility,
by reason of a memorable accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that happened,
the which was this. The King and all the Cittize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
were drowned in sorrow &amp; anguish, for the death
of the two flourishing hopes of the kingdome, the
Kinges only sonne, who dyed of a naturall death
in his bed roome, and the Kinges daughter, who
was drowned in the adioyning riuer; the young

layd by her brothers dead corps, to solemnise
their obsequies both together: In the meane time
newes was spread ouer ouer all the Citty; that S.
<hi>Patricke</hi> of Ardmuch, the potent reuiuer of many
dead to life, was seene in the towne. The King
hearing thereof, reioyced much, and caused him
to come where his two children were dead, &amp; full
of fayth promised, that if God by his prayers did
restore his children to life, he himselfe with all the
Citty, would become Christians. The Saint see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such gayne of soules in a readines, in the sight
of the King, his Nobles, and all the communalty
raysed from death to life the princely children,
whose corporall resurrection, cooperated much
to the spirituall resurrection of their Father, with
the rest of the people. The King was named <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinus,</hi>
his sonne <hi>Cochad,</hi> &amp; his daughter. <hi>Dublinia,</hi>
who gaue her owne name to the Citty. The King
and all the Citty being astonished at this great
miracle, abiured the worship of Idols, and were
baptised in S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> Well, which to encrease
the beliefe of the faythful, the Saint made to gush
out, by stricking the point of the staffe of Iesus in
the earth. From that day forwards King <hi>Alphinus,</hi>
with all the Cittizens of <hi>Dulbin</hi> obliged themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
by vow, and their posterity, to the seruice of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7147:35"/>

as a perpetuall gage of their seruice, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that euery company of trades-men, should
pay a yearely annuity to the Primat of <hi>Ardmach.</hi>
The King, and the Princes offering each of them
a talent of pure refined gold to the Saint, al which
liberall guifts, the true professour of pouerty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon the poore, reseruing o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly a part which
he kept for the building of Churches.</p>
               <p>5. The glorious Bishop, gaue his benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the people of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and taking his leaue of
them, he went to a towne called <hi>Cnoc,</hi> where he
sent often for one named <hi>Murinus,</hi> a man of Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
who would not in any wise present himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Saint, whose wisedome he deemed able to
conquere the hardest hart: the Saint sent for him
often, but all in vaine, for he caused answer to be
made, that the S. should suffer him to sleep. The
Saint knowing by inspiration of the holy Ghost,
that he was a child of perdition, adioyned therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
saying: <hi>Let him sleep, let him sleep, and before the
generall day of iudgment, let him not awake, or arise.</hi>
Which being sayd, the Saint hastned on his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the wicked wretch dyed a double death,
both of soule and body.</p>
               <p>6. A wicked man named <hi>Foilge,</hi> carryinge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7147:36"/>
great malice, and spite to the Saint, for the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the formentioned idoll, called the head

the Saints Coachman, and murdered him
in the Saints sight: the Saint stunge at the hart,
thundred out his malediction against the man of
Belial, who being stricken therwith, yelded vp his
wicked spirit to be ingulfed in hell fire: But as for

A principall motiue of the Kinges ioy, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7147:36"/>
his Idolatrous temple that morning to adore
his false Gods, he found them all prostrate vpon
the ground: and albeit he did set them often vp
in their owne place, yet still they tumbled downe;
for as <hi>Dagon</hi> could not stand before the Arke of
Gods couenant, so could not these Idols stand in
their place, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Blessed Bishop <hi>Patricke</hi> drew
neere vnto them, who deseruedly we may call the
Arke of the couenant, seeing in his cleane hart,
he carryed as in a golden vessel, the diuine Manna
of contemplatiue sweetnes, the table of the diuine
Law, and the Rod of heauenly discipline. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd
King, led the Saint with great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and honour to his Court at <hi>Cashell,</hi> where, vpon
the Saints preaching he beleeued in the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trinity, and receaued the grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. As the Saint gaue the King his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
by laying his sacred handes vpon his head,
the King requiring it often, &amp; with great deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it happened that the point of the Saints staffe
wounded the kinges foot, which yet put him to

with ardent charity, expelled all sense, &amp; feeling

of Christs ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner,<note place="margin">The si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.</note> he cured it perfectly. The
king reioycing, &amp; giuing thankes vnto God, for
so great a signe wrought vpon him, the holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
ful of the spirit of prophecy, spake to the king
as immediatly followeth: <hi>The blood of no King of
thy stocke, who shall fit in this place vpon thy throane,
shalbe shed, but of one only.</hi> Which prediction, the
inhabitants of that Country constantly auerre to
haue proued true, in as much as no king of his
posterity was euer kild, vnto the tenth generation
but only one.</p>
               <p>3. From <hi>Cayshell</hi> the holy Saint went into
<hi>Ormand,</hi> there to extirpate &amp; roote out the briers
of Idolatry, and to sow in steed thereof, the pure
wheate of Euangelicall doctrine, where God with
suddaine death seuerely punished a wicked wretch
with al his complices, for disgorging impious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies
against the Saint. At what time the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of peace <hi>S. Patricke</hi> passed through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Ciarragi,</hi> he saw two brothers named <hi>Bibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and <hi>Locradius,</hi> at mortall debate about the
parting of their Fathers inheritance, in so much
that from high words, they fell to bloody blowes,
and stroakes: the Saint fearing least so heinous a
sinne as fratricide, should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
with his holy prayers he so benummed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7147:37"/>
their handes, that they hunge stiffe and inflexible
in the ayre; vpon sight of that stupendious mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the two brethren referred their cause to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by the Saints arbitrement, who not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neued
between them the league of brotherly loue,
but also restored to them the perfect vse both of
their armes &amp; hands; the place where this miracle
hapned the two brothers, was bestowed vpon the
Saint towardes the building of a Church there.</p>

the multitude a spirituall and corporall refection,
commanded a Cow, by whose milke S. <hi>Frianus</hi>
liued, to be made ready for supper: but what was

great Stagges, and two great Hogges, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselues before the Saint, who comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they should be likewise made ready: so al
the company being set to supper, that little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
was layd before them, which by vertue of
the Saints sacred benediction, serued to satisfy all
the company so plentifully, that a great deale of
reuersion was gathered vp, and carryed thence,
which need not seeme incredible to any, who will
reflect with the eye of their consideration, vpon
our Sauiours promise: <hi>He that beleeueth in me, the
miracles that I doe, he shall also doe, and greater then
these shall he doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. This miraculous refection was seconded
by as miraculous a signe; for the holy Saint to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
and roote out of their harts the tares of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
in presence of that great assembly, restored
to life 19. dead bodyes at once: all those who were
so miraculously restored to the number of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
rehearsed in the hearing of all the assembly,
what they had seen touching the torments of hel,
proclayming <hi>Patrickes</hi> God, to be the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God. King <hi>Oengus,</hi> and his subiects magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
God, and honoured the Saint as their proper
Apostle: the men who were reuiued were christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; became Monkes vnder the obedience of <hi>S.

CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>THE holy Bishop came againe vnto the
North, where King <hi>Echu</hi> reigned, who had
a daughter named <hi>Cynnia,</hi> whome he loued most
tenderly. This young Princesse imbraced S. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes</hi>
doctrine, and against her Fathers will, &amp;
loathing a carnall wedlocke, she resolued to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her virginity to her heauenly spouse: her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeing the loue of chastity soe deeply rooted
in her hart, sent for the Saint, and spoke to him as
followeth; <hi>The hope I had by my daughter, to be blessed
with a copious posterity of Nephueus, is cut off by your
meanes; if then for the want of so great a blessing, you
promise me the kingdome of heauen, without compelling
me to receaue Baptisme, she shall serue her Creator, as
you shall thinke good, otherwise you shall misse of your
desire.</hi> The Saint full of confidence in God, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
all the matter to his diuine disposition, yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Kinges request. The young Lady, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vayled, &amp; consecrated by the Saint, led a life
so excelling with many ornaments of vertue, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7147:39"/>
she by her example, drew many to the seruice of
Christ, &amp; both in this life, &amp; after her death, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
aboundantly with the glory of miracles. The
Saint commended her to the care of S. <hi>Cethuberis,</hi>
who was the first of all the Irish Virgins, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
the veyle of virginity from the Saint: to
her being Superiour of the Monastry of <hi>Druimdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
where a great number of sacred virgins liued,
the Saint wrote a letter of exhortation.</p>
               <p>2. Within a few dayes King <hi>Echu</hi> departed
this life, who before his death commanded, that
his buriall should be deferred vntill such tyme as
the Saint came, who knowing by reuelation all
what happened, made al hast possible to the kings
court, where arriuing he offered his ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Almighty God in the behalfe of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
The King being reuiued, rehearsed what
he had seene touching the glory of heauen, and
the torments of the damned: and further added,
that he saw the place, which the Saint promised
him in the heauenly glory, whereof he could not
take possession, because he was not baptised: after
baptisme the Saint put the King to his choice,
eyther of prolonging his dayes in this life, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
speedily to heauen: the King misprising al the
glory of this world, in comparison of the celestial
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7147:39"/>
felicity, did choose to be dissolued, and to be with
Christ: so taking the diuine <hi>Viaticum</hi> of the holy
Eucharist, he was translated to an immortall life.</p>
               <p>3. The Blessed Saint by occasion of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
and doubtes, which in some places where he
preached the Ghospell, were obiected against the
last, &amp; generall resurrection of the dead, brought
to life againe men, whose bodyes were resolued
into cinders many yeares before, as himselfe in an
epistle directed to a deare friend of his beyonde
the seas, deposeth in these tearmes: <hi>Our Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to me, his vnworthy little one, the vertue of
doing such signes among this Pagan people, as we reade
neuer the like to haue beene wrought euen by the Apostles
themselues, so that in the name of our Lord Iesus, I haue
reuoked from the dead, bodyes turned into ashes many
yeares before, yet notwithstanding I pray that none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
me, for these or other like miracles, worthy to
stand in comparison with the Apostles, or any men of
perfection, considering I am a wretched sinner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</hi>
Stay thy selfe heere, courteous Reader,
and obserue to what height of perfection this B.
Bishop had attained, who working such, and so
great miracles, was so abiect, and so contemptible
in his owne eyes; for my part I admire more this
profound humility in him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the raysing of the

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7147:40"/>
4. My intended course of breuity, makes me
not to set down at large, how the Saint reclaymed
from idolatry a petty King called <hi>Elelius,</hi> with all
his kingdome, by reuiuing the kings sonne, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
swine had torne in peeces. As also a noble man,
who was very hard fauoured, and contemptible
in his person, by vertue of S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> prayers,
became very faire of complexion, and very
personable of stature, to the great astonishment
of all that knew him. A tender suckeling, found
in the tombe where his mother lay buryed, was
brought to S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> who named him <hi>Olcanus,</hi>
and set him to his booke, &amp; being come to riper
yeares, he passed into France, where he attayned
to great learning. Afterward comming into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
he taught in publick schooles, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of many a holy Bishop, and himselfe became
a Bishop of great merit and vertue.</p>
               <p>5. A certaine Prince named <hi>Conallus,</hi> sought
and obtayned S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> blessing: his younger
brother named <hi>Fergusus,</hi> came to the Saint with
the like intention: the Saint hauing first prayed,
blessed <hi>Fergusus</hi> with great attention; <hi>Conallus</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what diligence and deuotion the Saint vsed in
in blessing his younger brother aboue him selfe,
was not a little astonished, and troubled thereat.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7147:40"/>
S. <hi>Patricke</hi> obseruing that alteration in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
countenance, declared what moued him to vse
such diuersity in blessing them, fortelling prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically:
<hi>Blessing, I haue blessed thy brother</hi> Fergusus,
<hi>in regard of a blessed sonne that shall descend from him,
for his sonne</hi> Feleminus, <hi>shal beget a sonne, who shalbe
called</hi> Columba, <hi>a name very answerable to his holy
life, for from his Mothers wombe, he shalbe full of the
holy Ghost, and shalbe inriched with the treasures of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
wisedome, and vnderstanding: he wilhe the shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and burning lanterne of his generation, and shalbe
iustly called the Prophet of the highest, &amp; from the time
that he comes to yeares of discretion, a deliberate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
shall not escape out of his mouth.</hi> How truly this
hath beene presaged of S. <hi>Columba</hi> called <hi>Columcill,</hi>
who was the founder of an hundred Monasteryes,
the history of his life, sufficiently declareth.</p>
               <p>6. Within the compasse of seauen weekes,
which <hi>S. Patrike</hi> spent in the country called <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirini,</hi>
he builded seauen Churches, ouer which he
ordayned Pastour <hi>S. Connendus,</hi> a man of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and learning. After a few dayes <hi>S. Connedus</hi>
came to <hi>S. Patricke,</hi> who commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
back to his Church, fortelling that he need
not to feare the effusion of his blood, for that
none should be killed in that place for euer. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7147:41"/>
euent hath showed his prophecy to haue beene
most true. The B. Bishop prophecied of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity
of <hi>S. Treha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vayling of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> at whose consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a vayle was

CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Patricke</hi> seeing that in Ireland the
haruest was great, and the workemen few,
tooke shipping to passe into England, there to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many coadiutors and fellow-helpers, in cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuating
our Lords field. In those dayes the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
perfidy, and Pelagianisme tooke great rootinge
in England, which the Blessed Bishop laboured
to extirpate, by reclayming with signes &amp; sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
his deere Country-men to their former integrity
of fayth: so comming backe into Ireland, he
brought with him many learned and Religious
men, of which number, thirty were installed by
him Bishop in seuerall Episcopall seas. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
he conuerted the Isle of man, ordayninge a
learned and holy person named <hi>Germanus,</hi> Bishop
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7147:41"/>
ouer that young flocke, the like he did in seuerall
other Isles. It was his custome not only in citties,
but euen in principall townes, to install Bishops,
to the end the faythful should not be depriued of
the sacrament of Confirmation.</p>
               <p>2. After the Saints returne out of England,
he bestowed vpon six Cleargy-men, that were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in pilgrimage ouer the seas, a Whales skinne,
wherin himself was accustomed to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said
Masse; hauing that guift of the Saints loue, they
neuert felt in all the tyme of their trauaile, any
penury or want. In processe of tyme they all six
became very learned, and were made Bishops, &amp;
ended their dayes in great sanctity: their names
were <hi>Lugacius, Columbanus, Meldanus, Lugadius, Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus,
Ceranus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Three whole dayes without intermission,
did the Saint preach to infinite multitudes, that
flocked from all parts to heare him, they thought
they had not beene there one day, so sweet and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue
were the Saints doctrine &amp; discourses. In
that assembly, was present the most holy virgin
<hi>S. Brigit,</hi> who reclyning her head slept, which
Saint <hi>Patricke</hi> perceauing, forbad that any should
awake Gods beloued spouse, till she pleased her
selfe: by the issue it was manifest, that that passage
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7147:42"/>
of the Canticles might be fitly applyed to her: I
<hi>sleepe, but my hart waketh,</hi> in regard that her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
spouse imparted his secrets to her. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she
awaked, the Saint co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded her to tel in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of all the people, what she had seene, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
him, tould that she saw first a Synod of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all in white, with ploughes, oxen, and fieldes all
white: after that she saw them to be stayned with
spots, and lastly to become wholy blacke. <hi>S. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke</hi>
interpreted the former part to his own time
wherein good workes and fayth,<note place="margin">Faith &amp; good workes.</note> were vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and exercised: the second state to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
generation, which would indeed persist in
the candour of fayth, but would deface it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued
workes: the third state, he referred to the
insueing ages, wherein men would not only giue
ouer the exercise of good workes, but also would
prophane their liues with renouncing of their
fayth.</p>
               <p>4. On a tyme <hi>S. Patricke</hi> made a iourney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Dalnardia,</hi> as he passed by a place called <hi>Mucoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muir,</hi>
his disciple <hi>Benignus</hi> saw quires of Angells
inuironing that place with celestiall splendour, &amp;
piercing the skyes with the harmonious concent
of diuine prayses; the vision disappering, he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>S. Patricke,</hi> all what he had contemplated,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7147:42"/>
who being inspired by God, declared to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
what that admirable vision pretended: <hi>Know
then,</hi> sayd he, <hi>that a sonne of life, whose name shalbe
Colmanellus, will build a Church in that place, where he
will gather togeather manny sonnes of light, who will
become with the Angels, cohabitants of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly citty,
and he himselfe shalbe the primate and legate of all Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
In processe of time all fell out to be true, as
the Saint foretould.</p>
               <p>5. Another time <hi>S. Patricke</hi> with his holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
ascended a little mountaine, not far distant
from the valley, where afterwardes the monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Bangor</hi> was built: from the hill topp they
saw al the valley replenished with celestial bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and Angelicall quires: which admirable visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
moued all the company to intreate the Saint
to build a Church in that sacred valley, which the
Saint would not doe, but prophecying foretould:
<hi>After the space of 60. years completely expyred, there
will be borne a sonne of Light named</hi> Comgallus,
<hi>which is interpreted a fayre pledge, who shalbe beloued
both of God and men, and shall build in the place a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd,
a Church of Saints, wherein shalbe gathered innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
troupes of the children of light, that shall dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
themselues to the seruice of Christ.</hi> Not one iote
of all this did passe vnaccomplished; for in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7147:43"/>
tyme fortould, <hi>Comgallus</hi> being borne, built the
monastery of <hi>Bangor,</hi> wherein he begot to Christ
by meanes of the Ghospell, many thousands of
perfect Monkes: in so much, that that holy place,
the fruitfull mother of Saintes as a vine fructify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in sweetnes of odour, did extend its branches
to the sea, and its plants beyonde the sea; for it
filled Ireland, Scotland, and many other Ilandes
with perfect Monkes, and monasteries, as also
forraine Countryes. One of the sonnes of that
Monastery named <hi>Luanus</hi> founded a hundred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
another named <hi>Columbanus</hi> a most holy
man full of diuine grace, erected many Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and was the father of a numberles number of
holy Monkes: he builded the famous Monastery
of <hi>Luxonium</hi> in France, and <hi>Bobium</hi> in Italy, where
he ended his dayes most gloriously, and happily.</p>
               <p>6. A wicked man named <hi>Fergus,</hi> who liued in
<hi>Meath,</hi> hindered the Saint from building a church
within his territoryes, which the Saint taking in
euill part, prophecied, <hi>That none of his posterity
should inherit his liuing, or thriue in any other Country
except the infant yet shut vp in his Mothers wombe:</hi>
which fell out accordingly. As the Saint for the
like respect was to giue his curse vpon two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
named <hi>Fiechus,</hi> and <hi>Enda,</hi> his disciple <hi>S. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundinus</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:7147:43"/>
requested him not to lay his curse vpon
the man, but vpon the stones, that in great heaps
layd hard by, wherto the Saint condescended. A
marueilous thing ensued; for from that tyme for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
those stones proued vnseruiceable for any
building, or structure. <hi>Enda</hi> did pennance for the
iniury offered to the Saint, &amp; presented his ninth
sonne named <hi>Cormacus,</hi> with the ninth part of all
his liuing to S. <hi>Patrike:</hi> the child grew vp in years
and grace, and ended his dayes in great sanctity.</p>

CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>SAINT <hi>Lupita,</hi> S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> sister liued in one
house with <hi>S. Mell</hi> her nephew, by occasion
whereof, some suspected the holy Bishop S. <hi>Mell</hi>
with committing of incest with her, which asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the holy Bishop remoued by taking many
great Fishes on the dry land in S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> sight.
<hi>Lupita</hi> in like manner to declare her innocency,
carryed hoate embers in her lappe without signe
or token of any burning; <hi>S. Patricke</hi> seeing such
great miracles, pronounced them both innocent,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7147:44"/>
yet to cut off all occasion of scandall, he ordayned
that the men should liue in houses apart from the
women, building for them distinct houses, and
Churches.</p>
               <p>2. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> being to passe the <hi>Sinny,</hi> a deep
and vnwadable riuer, that runeth betweene <hi>Meath</hi>
and <hi>Connact,</hi> could not get a boate to ferry him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he prayed therfore to God for help; &amp; loe the
earth did ryse vp so high in the riuer, that it gaue
a dry passage ouer to the Saint, &amp; all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany.
The Saint thought it expedient for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to build a Church there in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
field, but the Lord who owed the place, gaue
him a repulse, &amp; would not giue way to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
vnles the Saint bought it with gold. The S.
offering his prayers to God, went to a place, wher
Swine had rooted vp the ground, and found there
so much as was sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to purchase the field. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
tyme also did he find in the same place, so
much gold, as serued to buy a peece of ground,
whereupon he ment to built a Church.</p>
               <p>3. In that Church called <hi>Ellfin, S. Patricke</hi>
installed one of his disciples named <hi>Asicus,</hi> who was
a Monke, making him a Bishop. S. <hi>Asicus,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Patricke</hi> had appointed, brought thither a great
company of Monkes, whom himselfe gouerned as

Abbot. This holy man vpon a certaine tyme told
a lye, when he should haue vttered the truth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
which ouerlashing of his tongue, he so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
chastised in himself, that he retyred himself

years, vnknowne, &amp; vnseene to any person where
he might be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: at last by his Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, they reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
him, that he wold returne home to his Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke,
but he would not yeild to their persuasion,
iudging, &amp; pronouncing himselfe vnworthy to
exercise episcopall authority, since his tongue had
beene defiled with a witting vntruth, which in the
mouth of a Priest is, as the holy Canons declare,
sacriledge; the forsayd Monkes would not in any
case depart from S. <hi>Asicus,</hi> but liued within that
place all the dayes of his life, after whose death
they builded a monastery there, wherein they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Almighty God in iustice, and sanctity.</p>
               <p>4. As some of S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> disciples came by
sea to visite him, there arose a great te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest, which
moued the Saint to great compassion for his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
children: some who were with him said, that
the ship was not able to sustayne so boysterous a
storme. The Saint immediatly betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
most feruently, to his prayers; and then
within a little while, in the hearing of all them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7147:45"/>
who were present, he commanded the windes &amp;
waues to become calme. O stupendious euent!
Without delay the wind was allayd, the seas ceased
to boyle, and there ensued a great calme: the same
day the disciples arriued, and tould how they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
that eminent danger. Another tyme the
disciples aforesayd, comming to visit their holy
father, and traualing by the sea side, they were
encompassed by the tide before they were aware,
which put them in great feare of death. The Saint
knowing in spirit, what danger his children were
in, commanded the sea in the name of God, to
giue his disciples a free passage: the sea obeyed the
Saints commandment, so that his discipls retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their father, to their great ioye, and to the
vnspeakable admiration of all those who heard of
so prodigious a miracle.</p>
               <p>5. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> of his profound humilty and
charity, kept alwaies in his company some lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
or other, whome himself tended most careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
washing with his owne hands his vlcerous soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and prouiding him of al his necessities. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
leaper that liued with the Saint, being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of his bodily health, laloured by frequent
prayers and other exercises of piety, to procure
and conserue the health of his soule. This leaper
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7147:45"/>
fearing to be offensiue to others, withdrew himself
from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of men, liuing solitary in a great
hollow tree: One day he requested a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
passed by, to bring him out of a place hard by, a
bundell of reedes, the man went to the place, and
as he pluckte vp the reedes, a faire fountaine gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
out, whereof he gaue notice to the leaper,
when he brought him the reedes, who replied:
Know then my deare brother, that God sent thee
hither to wash me in that fountaine, and lastly to

ghost: as the Christian washed the leaper in that
miraculous water, there remained not a spot of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy
vpon him, and so burying him he departed.
It hapned that <hi>S. Munis,</hi> much about that time,
bringing from Rome many relikes with him, was
forced to lodge neare that place. In the night he
saw squadrons of Angells to descend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and to keep watch, and warde about the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
sepulcher vntill it was moring, al which visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he related to S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> signifying that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to remoue that holy body out of that solitary
place. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> forbid him so to do, fortelling
that a sonne of light, not yet borne, whose name
should be <hi>Keranus,</hi> would inhabit in that place,
which he would furnish with a holy company of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7147:46"/>
Saints, and that he would exhibit great honour
to that leaprous body, all which fel out to be true
in processe of tyme.</p>
               <p>6. The foresayd S. <hi>Munis,</hi> with S. <hi>Patrickes</hi>
leaue, made him a cell in a certaine place, where
he suffered great distraction, and disturbance of
mind, by reason of the frequent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>course of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
who came ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to visite him from the kings
pallace, being built ouer a great water that lay
hard by the place, where S. <hi>Munis</hi> liued: which
difficulty he made knowne to S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> who
offered deuout and feruent prayers vp to God for
this effect. And loe the next night after, God tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the water and the pallace so farre of, that it
wrought his seruant no annoye, who afterwardes
(though very much against his will) was ordained
Bishop, &amp; departed this life, shining with vertues,

CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>A Young gentleman of excellent education,
and learning named <hi>Fiechus,</hi> had marryed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7147:46"/>
a wife, which within few dayes dyed. As this man
came where <hi>S. Patricke</hi> was, the Saint by inward
illustration of the holy Ghost, penetrating his
conscience, said: Behould a man or one wife, who
according to the Apostle may be worthely aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the sacred order of preisthood, and Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
diginty. The younge gentle man, admiring
how he came to see the secrets of his hart, receiued
the lauer of regeneration, and by vertue of Saint
<hi>Patricks</hi> blessing, made such progresse in learning,
that in one day he learned the whole Psalter, and
in a short time attayned to the vnderstanding of
sacred Scriptures; he was successiuely inuested
with holy orders, and in fine made Bishop in the

could not visite his Diocesse on foote, or exercice
his Bishop-like function, <hi>S. Patricke</hi> sent him a

to another Saints house, and the third night to S.
<hi>Fiechus</hi> house, where they stayed: giuing therby to
vnderstand, that they were chiefly sent to him.</p>
               <p>3. Another tyme the Angell commanded S.
<hi>Fiechus</hi> to build a monastery, and the Angell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
designed the Refectory, Oratory, &amp; all other
houses belonging thereunto. This holy Bishop
was accustomed in the beginning of lent,<note place="margin">Fasting of Lent.</note> to retire
himselfe to a solitary place, bringing with him for
his sustenance but fiue barly loaues mingled with
ashes. On Palme Sunday, or Maundy Thursday
he would returne, bringing with him halfe of one

followed, being renowned both for sanctity and

obstinate; for conspiring together against him,
they sent fifty men to kill him. As they entred a
certaine Forde to passe ouer it, the Saint seeing
them, and knowing by diuine instinct, what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe

               <p>5. Another tyme, some children of Beliall
digged vp deep pits and holes, in the way which
the Saint with al his retinue was to passe, couering
them ouer with greene grasse. The Saint full of
confidence in God, gaue his benediction to his
holy family, and so he, and they passed without
receauing any hurt or detriment, the green grasse
like solid earth yealding them firme passage. The
Saint commanded a yong mayd, who gaue them
notice of the ambush layd, for to call her Father,
whome with his ten sonnes, and three daughters

for a long time, &amp; hearing that S. <hi>Patricke</hi> passed

along in the way, he stunbled very often, which
moued a cleargy man who was in the Saints co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

shut the eyes of the cleargy man. The same day
did the Saint erect vpon their feet three criples.</p>

CHAP. XIIII.</head>
               <p>ONE of the noble men of <hi>Munster,</hi> named
<hi>Coruallus,</hi> would not permit <hi>S. Patricke</hi> to
build a Church within his territoryes. Not farre
from the noble mans house was a faire &amp; spacious
poole very pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to behold, but the house by the

of the pleasure of that gratful prospect: the Saint
vrged the noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, very much, to giue him leaue
to build a church: who answeared. If you remoue
this great mountaine, that depriues my house of
the pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prospect of the broad &amp; spatious poole
that lyes on the further side, I will then yeild to
your request. The Saint offered his prayers vp to
God, and with that the earth swallowed downe

the mountaine, notwithstanding the wicked man
would not stand to his former promise, wherefore
the Saint prayed to God, the second tyme, &amp; the
mountaine did forthwith swell vp to its former
height, &amp; greatnes.</p>
               <p>2. A wicked Tyrant named <hi>Euchodius,</hi> who
liued in the country of <hi>Vlibia,</hi> caused two holy
Virgins to be stiffled, and misprised <hi>S. Patricks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for them.<note place="margin">Holy Virgins.</note> The Saint denounced pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
to him, <hi>That none of his posterity should

to his younger brother.</hi> The Tyrants wife came, &amp;
begged the Saintes blessing both for her selfe, &amp;
for the child, which she carried in her wombe,
which the Saint gaue her, and foretould that she
should be deliuered of a most holy issue. The
childe being borne, was named <hi>Douengardus,</hi> and
was most renowned both for sanctity &amp; miracles.
<hi>Euchodius</hi> within a few dayes, was depriued both
of life, and of his lordship, which his yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
posterity inioyed, according to S. <hi>Patrickes</hi>
prophecy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>S. Patricke</hi> founded an Episcopall sea in
a place called <hi>Achadfouiur,</hi> where he made one of
his disciples namned <hi>Sennachus</hi> Bishop, a man of
admirable purity, and innocency. <hi>S. Patticke</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:7147:49"/>
blessed him, and all his family, prophecying, that
many Saintes and holy Pristes should spring out
of it, in which place <hi>Sennachus</hi> ended his daies in
great sanctity.</p>
               <p>4. As <hi>S. Patricke</hi> passed through a wood in
<hi>Midernia,</hi> he found there a great company of men,
cutting downe of great oaken trees, &amp; in regard
their axes were edge-lesse, and that they had no

wearied out of breath, the skin &amp; flesh was torne

The Saint compassionating their distresse, gaue
them his blessing, wherupon they recouered their
strength, their hands were healed vp, &amp; their hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets
so well edged, that they cut the solid oake
trees with as little difficulty, as if they had beene
tender twigges. This prodigious effecte of the
Saints blessing, did perseuer in them, vntill such
tyme as the Saint procured their release, for which
end, he went to their cruell Lord named <hi>Tremei,</hi>
but he wold not admit the Saints intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Fast and prayer.</note> The
Saint after three dayes fast &amp; prayer, came againe
with great submission to procure their exemption

but God reuenged the contempt offered his

nere by, &amp; the man of Belial being drowned, the
captiues were restored to their long expected and
wished liberty.</p>
               <p>5. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> intended to erect an episcopal
sea in a place called <hi>Luda,</hi> but an Angell wished
him to desist from that worke, for that S. <hi>Micheus;</hi>
who came out of England in pilgrimage into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
should there build and inhabit that place;
which fell out accordingly. One day as Saint <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke</hi>
and <hi>Micheus</hi> were in spiritual conference, an
Angell tendered them a letter, wherin S. <hi>Patricke</hi>
was commaunded to bestow that place, with all
the appartenaunces vpon <hi>S. Micheus,</hi> and himselfe
to erect his Archepiscopall sea at <hi>Ardmach.</hi> The
Saint obeyed willingly the diuine commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
committing to <hi>S. Micheus</hi> his care of twelue
leapers, whome himselfe was accustomed to tend,
and so departed.</p>
               <p>6. Twelue brethren, whose Father was lately
deceased, made a meeting for the parting of their
portions, and excluded their younger brother na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Fergusius</hi> from any share in that diuision: who
had recourse to Saint <hi>Patricke,</hi> by whose intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

he receaued a competent portion of his fathers
inheritance: the young noble man, bestowed one

which shall not only reigne in their owne country, but
also in foraine Kingdomes.</hi> This prophecy of the

would inioyne him. The holy Bishop reioycing

much at his deuotion, is reported to haue sayd to
him: <hi>Thou shalt carry a sheild, and staffe as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

               <p>2. A certaine man named <hi>Victor,</hi> hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

The Saint comming to the place where
<hi>Victor</hi> was, so bright &amp; subtill a light issued from
him, that the splendour thereof pearced euen to
the secret place, where <hi>Victor</hi> lay lurking. <hi>Victor</hi>
being conuicted, or rather attracted by so euident
a signe, became a Christian, bestowed all his estat

learning, and sanctity, that he was made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
               <p>3. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> had a disciple named <hi>Volchanusa</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7147:51"/>
a man of great vertu, but specially of most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable

wheresoeuer God would vouchsafe to prouide him

After <hi>Volchan</hi> had walked on all day long,

<hi>Volchan</hi> builded a Monastery, wherein himselfe
and many others liued and dyed in great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>4. S. <hi>Patricke</hi> had a <hi>Drouer</hi> named <hi>Rodanus,</hi>
who after became very learned, and a Bishop of
great merit, and miracles: the Saint likewise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<hi>S. Reuternus</hi> to the episcopall sea of <hi>Ciocher,</hi>
and when he had consecrated him Bishop, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed

child named <hi>Lunanus</hi> by vertue of the Saints bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
learned all the Psalter in fiften dayes, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>5. Some wicked men enuying the progresse

a woman that vsed to beate and to dresse flax,
in the way the Saint was to passe, to hide a great
quantity of the flax in a hollow tree not farre off,
and when the Saint should passe that way, they
wished her to exclaime against him, and his holy
company; as hauing stolne the flaxe. The woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
did as she was put in the head by those wicked
men, who rushed out of their dennes, when the
woman began to crye, and flocking about the
Saint, and his companions, they accused them as
theeues, guilty of torments, and of death: Neere
the place where this tumult was excited, there was
one buryed, whome the Saint reuiued; the reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
man by his testimony, cleared the innocency
of the Saint, and freed him from that slaunder,
shewing where the flaxe was hidden. The contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

to cleare himselfe of all suspition, swore that he
had no hand at all in the theft; loe the eaten goate
by a hideous noyse made in his belly, bewrayed

how gratefull it was in the eyes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
himselfe vouchsafed to manifest by this
insuing miracle. For as he, and a man of a most

their garmentes vpon the poore, behold there

<hi>Garbanus,</hi> whome they had couered with a cloake,
counterfeiting him for dead. The Saint could
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7147:53"/>
them that their iest was turned into a truth, and
so departed. The theeues found their companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
dead, and fearing that the like mischance might
fall vpon themselues, they rann apace after the
Saint, &amp; prostrated themselues before him, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
their heynous offence, they became
Christians. The Blessed Bishop at their request,
restored againe their dead companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of liuing.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Machaldus</hi> hauing confessed his sinnes,
requested the Saint to set downe for him some
course of pennance,<note place="margin">Penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of glory.</note> by which he might purchase
eternall life, the holy Bishop being inspired from
aboue, inioyned him to forsake his natiue soyle,
for euer, and to bestow all his substance vpon the
poore: then did he attyre himselfe in a course and
despiceable weed, and locked his feet in fetters,
casting the key into the sea: after he commanded
him to enter all alone into a boate, whither soeuer
the boate should carry him, there to liue all the
dayes of his life. The truely penitent <hi>Machaldus,</hi>
followed the Saints direction, and so committing
himself to the sea, he la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the Isle of <hi>Man.</hi> The
two holy Prelates <hi>Counidrius,</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> whome
<hi>S. Patricke</hi> sent to succeed <hi>S. German</hi> in the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
of that Isle, seeing the man in so miserable
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7147:54"/>
a plight, &amp; knowing the cause, intertayned him
very charitably, detayning him with themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
After the compasse of many yeares in the
belly of a fish, that by diuine prouidence, was
brought to <hi>Machaldus,</hi> was found a key which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked
his fetters. <hi>S. Machaldus</hi> attayned to such
eminent sanctity, that after the death of the two
forementioned Bishops, he was created Bishop of
the Iland, and ended his dayes there in great san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
being famous both for vertue, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>3. The glorious Saint by conuerting stones
into milke, &amp; milke into stones, conuerted a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitian
from the worshiping of stones, to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of the true and liuing God. Such reuerence
did the Blessed Saint carry to Sunday, in honour
of our Sauiours triumphant resurrection, that he
was neuer accustomed to trauaile vpon Sonday;
for wheresoeuer he was belated vpon Saterday,
there did he stay vntill Munday morning, giuing
himselfe wholy to diuine contemplation.</p>
               <p>4. One Saterday, he was benighted in a great
field farre from any shelter, it began to rayne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily,
but not a drop did touch the Saint, or any
of his company. This miracle was seconded with
a farre greater, for euen that night, the Saint was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7147:54"/>
thus sheltred miraculously from the rayne, the
plane was ouercast with so thicke a mist, that the
Saints coach-man could not find the coach horses
which he let out to pasture. The Saint knowing
in what affliction his faithfull seruant was, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
towardes him, he stretched out his sacred
hand, and loe an vnseene, and neuer heard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,
his fiue fingers like fiue brightsome Sunne
beames, illuminating all the country ouer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
the darknes into light, and the night into
day. By helpe of this immense splendour, the
coach man found his horses, and so returned ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and greatly conforted to his good Father.
Whiles the Saint preached the Ghospell to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
noble man, there came a flame out of the
Saints mouth, which entered in at the noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
mouth and eares, heating therewith his hart, and
also all his inward powers.</p>
               <p>5. A yong Lady named <hi>Memessa,</hi> daughter
to a great Prince in England, by contemplation
of the creatures, attayned to such perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and loue of the Creator, that for his loue
she misprised all the world; her parents laboured
very much, but could not nether by faire or foule
meanes enforce her, euer to contract with any of
the great Lordes that were suters to her, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7147:55"/>
she was in her purpose of dedicating her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity

which miracle comming to the notice of

               <p>2. The glorious Bishop, with Gods help and
fauour begun, &amp; throughly built a citty, faire for
the situation, greatnes, and compasse, &amp; brought
many principall cittizens to inhabit therein.
The citty it selfe, was adorned with faire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
churches, wherin were ordained by the Saint,
Cleargy men for the singing of the diuine office,
the gouernement of soules, and instruction of the
people. There were besides, Monasteryes furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with Monkes, and others replenished with
sacred Virgins. In a monastery of holy Virgins
liued a virgin the King of Englands daughter, &amp;
nine other ladyes which accompanyed her: when
she came to <hi>S. Patricke,</hi> the Saint saw with his
owne eyes, three of his holy number ascend vp to
heauen. In this Citty did the Saint erect his
Archepiscopall sea, intending to make it the

principall and metropolitan Church of all Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and that this his intention might be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for all succeeding ages, he purposed to make
a iourney to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to haue it confirmed, and
ratifyed by Apostolicall authority. The Angell
appearing, liked well thereof, and because for the

miraculously of coaches to carry him and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,

going and comming from <hi>Rome;</hi> for in all
places did he manifest signes of his sanctity. In

he built many Monasteryes, and repaired many
more destroyed by the Pagans, which he furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with Monkes, which liued according to the
forme of religious discipline &amp; life, that the Saint
prescribed them: he also prophetically foretould
many aduerse and prosperous euents, that should
happen in England. In like manner did he forsee
and fortell the sanctity of S. <hi>Dauid,</hi> being as yet
in his mothers wombe. After his returne from his
tedious &amp; paynefull iourney, bringing with him
from beyond the seas thirty Bishops, whome he

               <p>IRELAND since its first inhabitation was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
with a triple plague, to wit, with great
aboundance of venemous beastes, copious store
of Diuells visiblely appearing, and infinit multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

the most excellent Prelate taking the staffe or

al nations: after directing his face towards the Ile
of <hi>Man,</hi> &amp; blessing it with all the other Isles by

he procured them the same singuler benefit. Of
the Magitians he conuerted, and reclaimed very
many, and such as persisted incorrigible, he roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them out from the face of the earth. By his
prayers he obtayned of God, that the apparitions,
and illusions should not molest the Christians
from thence forwardes.</p>
               <p>2. To the end that Ireland neuer after should
be molested with venemous beasts, nor yet enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

who obserued it in the law of nature, and <hi>Elias,</hi>
who obserued it in the written law, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our deare Sauiour, who consecrated in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that mysticall fast. The Saint therfore ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the high mountaine of <hi>Cruachanailge,</hi> where
he disposed fiue stones in forme of a Crosse, and
in the midst of them he placed himselfe, shewing
aswell by the forme, and manner of his sitting, as
by the mortification of his abstinence, himselfe to
be the true seruant of Christs crosse. The Diuels
grieuing much that their power, and dominion
in Ireland had beene ouerthrowne and weakned,
thronged about the Saint in the shap of most vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and deformed birdes, labouring with their
horrid skrikes, to annoy and hinder the Saint
in his holy prayers, but he being preuented by
the grace of God, and assisted by his power, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the signe of Christes triumphant banner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those fowle fiendes, he chased them away
farre from him, and with frequent percussion of
his cymball, he draue them out of all the coastes
of Ireland, so that from that tyme euen to this
present day, no venemous beastes were seene in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7147:58"/>
Ireland, nor yet are the inhabitants since mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

be in other countryes the Saints cymball being
broken with often playing vpon it, was amended
by an Angell.</p>
               <p>3. By Gods fauour, whose wont it is after a

and driuen away, a great multitude of Angels il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
the mountaine with heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly splendour,
and recreated the Saint with their sweetest har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
the Saint after immolating the hostes of
thankesgiuing and prayses to God, for inabling
him to performe so long a fast, &amp; for conferring
such admirable fauours to Ireland at his interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
descended from the mountaine, and played
on his cymball, the sound wherof was heard ouer
all the kingdome: then eleuating his handes, he
blessed all Ireland, with the inhabitants thereof,
and commended them to Christ; then did he
make glad all the Church with his presence, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing
with great deuotion, our Sauiours tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant

               <p>4. The paschall festiuityes being duely, and
deuoutly accomplished, the Saint with a great
traine of spirituall children in his company, made
a circuit about the land, teaching the wayes of

               <p>THE B. Saint with great insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of praiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of God to know in what estate Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was
in his Maiestyes eyes. God did heare the desire of

flame of fire; flaming vpward euen to heauen, an
Angel telling him, that such was the estate of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in the eyes of God for that present. Within
a little while, he saw mountaines as it were of
fire, ascending to the cloudes; a short while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he saw brightsome torches shining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
small lightes, and lastly a few coals raked
in ashes, but yet aliue, to whome the Angell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
said: <hi>That by that variety was expressed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
seuerall estats Ireland should vnder go in the succeeding

redoubled that of the Royall Prophet: <hi>VVil

God reiect for euer? Or will he not add to be better
pleased? Or will be cut off his mercy for euer from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to generation? Or will God forget to haue
mercy? Or will be in his wrath keep in his mercyes?</hi>
The Angell sayd, looke towardes the North, &amp;
thou shalt see the mutation of the right hand of
the highest. The Saint lifted vp his eyes, and saw
a little light arising in <hi>Vlidia,</hi> which striuing for a
long space with the darknes, chased it away, and
after illuminated all the Country, neuer ceasing
to increase, vntill it brought Ireland to its free
resembling and florishing estate. By the Saints
interpretation, the fiery ardour, designed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
deuotion, and zeale of Religion and charity,
wherewith the inhabitants were inflamed in the
Saints dayes. The flaming mountains, the Saints
who were conspicuous for miracles, vertuous life
and learning. The diminution of light, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of sanctity; and the mist ouerclouding all
the land, the infidelity that should preuaile in
the Country.</p>
               <p>2. As some of S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> disciples discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
together of his guiftes &amp; vertues, one of them
sayd, he was the holiest man breathing vpon the
face of the earth: to whom S. <hi>Secundinus</hi> answered.
Truly he had beene most holy, had he not beene
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7147:60"/>
indued with lesse fraternall charity then it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him. Which comming to S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
he asked <hi>Secundinus</hi> what moued him to vtter
such censure against him. <hi>Secundinus</hi> answered,
because you accept not of the liuinges, and rich
presents that are offered you, with which you
might maintaine great multitude of holy men.
To whome S. <hi>Patricke</hi> replyed: Charity makes
me not to accept of such great charity; for if I did
accept of what would be giuen me, I should leaue
not so much as the pasture of two horses for the
Saints who shall liue after vs.</p>
               <p>3. The aforesaid S. <hi>Secundinus,</hi> being of great
learning and wisedome, signifyed to S. <hi>Patricke,</hi>
that he had a desire to compose a hymne in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Saint that yet was liuing, and because
it was S. <hi>Patricke</hi> himselfe he ment, he concealed
the Saints name; the glorious Bishop answered,
it is iust and reasonable, that people display the
vertues of Saintes, and that the Church declare
their prayses, which yet is more securely done
after their deaths, when all occasion of sinning is
cut off: but if you will put in execution what you
entende, do it quickly, loe death is at the doore,
of all the Bishops that are in Ireland, you are the
first that shal depart this life, <hi>Secundinus</hi> made the

fetch the soule of a flagitious sinner, who for his
many misdeedes, deserued to be buryed in Hell.
The Saint abiurde them at their returne, to let
him vnderstand the successe of the matter. After
a little respit the Diuels comming againe, tould: <hi>S.

by telling that miracle, excited many to sing that

Abbot <hi>S. Patrickes</hi> disciple named <hi>Colmanus,</hi> did
sing the foresayd hymne very often: being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the cause, he answered, that whilest he
sung it, he enioyed stil the Saints presence before
him, and that his eyes could neuer be satiated
with the contemplation of his delectable face:
wherby it is cleare how faythful a friend this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <p>OFtentims did the glorious Saint see our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
the heauens open, &amp; our Lord Iesus
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in the midst of the multituds of Angels, &amp;
this sometimes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayd masse, &amp; other times,
when he deuoutly sung <hi>S. Iohns</hi> reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: besides
the Angel <hi>Victor</hi> so often me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in this volum,
was wont to appeare to him thrice euery week for
to recreate him with his diuine colloquies, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses:
Of soules departing this life, our B. Saint
saw ful often, some to go to endure the paynes of
hel, &amp; others to be sent to enioy the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
one example very remarkable, which the
Saint himselfe for edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
I will here recount. A great noble man, who
liued in much prosperity, &amp; dyed with no lesse
glory, was accounted by them that knew his life
&amp; end, most happy, &amp; pleasing vnto God, wheras
a poore indige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lazar, who liued al his life in great
misery, &amp; after his death wanting the honour of
burial, became a prey to the fouls of the ayre, was
esteemed most wicked before God, but the B. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
seeing the blindnes of humane iudgement,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7147:62"/>
tould them that he saw the rich mans soule to be
buryed in hell, and the poore mans soule to be
carryed vp to heauen, and this which the Saint
saw concerning these two, he was wonte to recite
of many other.</p>
               <p>2. The fame of <hi>S. Patrickes</hi> vertues, excited
a holy man of great merit and vertue named <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuualoeus,</hi>
who liued in Britany in France, to leaue
his natiue soyle and to go for Ireland, there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> disciple, &amp; scholler. The night
before he was to begin his iourney, he saw in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
a most venerable man attyred in episcopal
robes, who tould him that himselfe was S. <hi>Patrike:</hi>
know my dearest <hi>Vinuualoeus</hi> that I am <hi>Patricke</hi> to
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you repaire, know that the time of my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is neere at hand, so that before you can come
where I am, I shall depart this life: it is the wil of
God that you forsake not this place; with that the
vision disappeared.</p>
               <p>3. The course which the Saint held in his
deuotion, as it was most admirable, so did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it daly without any intermission: euery day
was he wont to say deuoutly the whole Psalter,
with canticles, hymnes and <hi>S. Iohns</hi> reuelation,
besides two hundred other prayers: three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times in the day did he prostrate himselfe in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7147:62"/>
adoration before God, and in singing euery ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
hower, he was accustomed to blesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a hundrd times with the signe of the Crosse:
moreouer it was his wont euery day, to say masse
with great deuotion and reuerence, neither did
he omit to preach to the people or to teach his
disciples. The night tyme, which he deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three partes, he spent after a most heauenly
manner; the former part he imployed in reciting
twice fifty Psalmes, and in making two hundred
genuflexions: the second part he spent in saying
of the third quinquagenary of psalmes, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prayers, all which time he stood immersed
in colde water: the third part he allotted to his
sleep, hauing for his bed a bare stone, &amp; another
stone in steede of a bolster, giuing himselfe in
this manner to his rest, he would girde his loines
with a roughe, and course haire cloath steeped in
cold watter, to keepe his body in due subiection,
fearing it should stirr vp any dishonest motions
against the spirit: in this manner did the blessed
Bishop, offer himselfe a holy liuing and gratfull
victime vnto God.</p>

CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>THE glorious Bishop, ouer his other attire
wore a white robe, repesenting by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and colour of his attire, the candour of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
powers, nay he would accept of no guifts or
presents, esteeming it happier to giue, then to
receaue; and if sometymes rich men did bestow
any present vpon him, he would without delay
giue it to the poore, easing himselfe of it as of a
heauy burthen. In his countenance, in his aspect,
in his talke, in his gate, euen in the motion of his
members, and deportement of all his body, the
beholders might see and learne lessons of edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his speech being tempered with sweetnes,
and seasoned with the salt of discretion, he acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
himself to al sexes, people, &amp; occasions,
he was wel seene in foure languages, the English,
Irish, French and Latin, &amp; attained to good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in the Greeke, he wrote a volume called S.
<hi>Patrickes</hi> canons, which is furnished with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
doctrine for all sorts of people.</p>
               <p>2. When any difficulte or obscure questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7147:63"/>
were put vnto him, he was wont of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humility, first to answeare: I know not,
God knowes. He was indued with the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
&amp; whatsoeuer he foretould, fell out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ambiguity: He did prophecie of the
Saints of Ireland, and especially of all the Saints
of <hi>Munster</hi> &amp; <hi>Connact,</hi> that were to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of one hundred yeares, so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he fortould their names, liues and places
of their habitation. In giuing his benediction,
he extended his right hand, and in bestowing his
malediction, he stretched out his left hand: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he blessed, Gods blessing did light vpon
him, and whomesoeuer he cursed, Gods curse
came vpon him.</p>
               <p>3. And though in all vertues he did match,
or rather surpasse other Saints, yet in humility
he did farre surpasse himselfe, hence it came, that
in his missiue letters he styled himselfe: <hi>The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sinner in the world, the least and most despiceable
among them;</hi> and setting little by the signes he
wrought, he deemed himselfe vnworthy to be
compared to any perfect man. He exercised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the manuall workes as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did of til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the ground, and fishing, but especially in
building of Churches, three hundred and fifty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7147:64"/>
Bishops did he consecrate with his owne handes,
fiue hundred did he inuest with the holy functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Priesthood, the number of them, that were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
in inferiour orders, as also of Monkes, &amp;
Nunnes, is so numberlesse, that God alone doth
know them.</p>
               <p>4. The Blessed Bishop liuing and leading
a life of this tenour, shined with so many,
and so great miracles, that in them he was not
inferiour to any of the Saints that went before
him. It was in a manner a dayly exercise with
him to cleanse leapers, cripels, deafe, dumbe, to
cure palseies, lethurgies, lunatickes, epilephies,
to erect cripls, to restore sight to the blind, speach
to the dumbe, to the deafe hearing, &amp; in a word
to heale all diseases: he merited to be the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
reuiuer of three and thirty dead persons,
threescore and six treatises were written of his
giftes, vertues and miracles, a great part of them
perished by fire vnder the Pagan Princes <hi>Iur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi>
&amp; <hi>Turgesius.</hi> Foure volumes are yet extant
written by foure of his disciples S. <hi>Benignus, S.
Mell, S. Lumanus, S. Patricke</hi> the yonger, who lyes
buried in <hi>Glastenbury</hi> monastery in England: S.
<hi>Euinus</hi> compiled his actes and miracles partly in
Irish, and partely in Latin, out of which holy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7147:64"/>
authors, we haue extracted what we thought
good, and digested it into this volume.</p>
               <p>5. The most glorious bishop, being loaded
with yeares, and abounding with merits, knew by
diuine reuelation, that the dissolution of his
earthly tabernacle was neere at hand, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to goe towardes the citty of Armuch,
thinking to inrich that his Metropolita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church
with the pretious depositum of his sacred body,
but the Angell <hi>Victor</hi> appearing to him, tould
him that it was the diuine pleasure, he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the generall resurrection in the Cittie of
<hi>Downe</hi> in <hi>Vlidia.</hi> The Saint embracing with great
resignation the disposition of the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
returned backe againe to <hi>Vlidia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Within a few dayes after, as the most
holy Prelate S. <hi>Patricke</hi> preached of the glory of
heauen to a great multitude of religious and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
men, there descended from thence,
an immense splendour that illustrated a place in
the east part of the Church-yeard, the pearle of
Ireland S. <hi>Brigit</hi> being present. The Saint com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her to declare the mistery of that diuine
light, she tould in the hearing of all the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
how that celestial light, sanctifyed and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
the place, where a Saint most glorious, &amp;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7147:65"/>
most deare vnto God shold be shortly interred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then rounding S. <hi>Ephembria</hi> in her eare, she tould
it was the patron &amp; Apostle of Ireland, S. <hi>Patrik,</hi>
adding further, that she would account her selfe
happy, if his sacred body might be wraped in a
winding sheet which she had spunne, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with herown hands, &amp; had prepared for that
purpose.</p>
               <p>7. The Blessed Saint knowing by diuine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the holy Virgins desire, commanded her
to go, and bring that sheet, wherein for the most
tender loue he carryed to the most blessed vigin,
he would haue his sacred body wrapt: himselfe
went to the Monastery of <hi>Sauall,</hi> where sickning
he expected the end of this life, or rather the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the other life that hath no end: the B.
virgin <hi>Brigit</hi> was so ouer wearied with the length
and difficulty of the iourney, that she could not
come so soone as she purposed. The Blessed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
knowing in what distresse the holy virgin
was in, he sent his coach-man to meet her, &amp; the
sacred virgins that came in her company, so the
virgins comming to <hi>Sauall</hi> where the Saint laye
sicke, she presented him with the sheet, which he
receaued very gratefully, then kissing his feet &amp;
handes, she and her virgins receaued his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>THE Blessed Saint being brought very low
by his infirmity, as the Angell had admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
receaued the holy Sacraments at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of his disciple S. <hi>Tasach</hi> Bishop; &amp; eleuating
his eyes, he saw Iesus standing in the midst of a
multitude of Angels; then blessing his disciples,
and rendring thankes to God, he passed out of
this life, his blessed soule was receaued into the
ioyes of his Lord by the all-immaculate Virgin
the Mother of God, and sacred quires of virgins,
with the Patriarkes, Apostles, Martyrs, Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
and Angels, no maruaile that he was hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of all Saints, sith there shined in him, the
vertue of all Saints; an Angell he was, not by
nature but by office, since his lips did keep science
and the law of life: a Prophet, since few of the
Prophets were indued with the foresight of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thinges so copiously as he was: an Apostle
he was, since Ireland, and the neighbour Ilands,
are signes of his Apostleship: a Martyr he was, in
regard of the many coflicts he had against Kings
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7147:66"/>
Magitians, Idolaters, and Diuels. A confessour
he was, since that he neuer ceased from the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and confessing the name of Christ. A
virgin he was, for as much as he kept the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
fayth, in body &amp; soule. The glorious Saint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
at the age of a hundred and twenty three
yeares: he was sixteene yeares old, when he was
carryed away by the Pirates: six yeares did he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
in captiuity: eightene yeares did he liue with
S. <hi>German</hi> in France: he was fiue and fifty when
he came into Ireland to preach the Ghospell:
fiue and thirty yeares did he imploy in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of Ireland, and the adioyning Iles: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
for three and thirty yeares, he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the sweet rest of contemplation, eyther at
<hi>Ardmuch,</hi> or at <hi>Sauall</hi> monastery, during which
tyme he neuer came abroad, vnles it were for
great affaires, or keeping a Councel once a yeare
for the redresse of abuses.</p>
               <p>2. After his departure his sacred body was
wrapt vp in the sheet, which the blessed virgin
S. <hi>Bridgit</hi> had prepared, and a great multitude of
cleargy men and seculers, came to bemone the
death of their common father, and Apostle, and
to solemnize his funerals. The night following a
brightsome quier of Angels that kept watch at
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7147:66"/>
his body with their sweet harmony, cast all the
multitude into an extaticall sleepe, vntill their
departure, the next morning the Angels left so
fragrant an odour behind them, that it continued
for the space of twelue daies, whilst the holy body
was vnburied, during which time in all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they inioyed the brightnes of the day light,
without the interposition of any night. By occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this stupendious miracle, the Archmachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Vlidians fell into grat debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
for the possession of that sacred treasure,
and as they were vpon the poynt of entring into
a fierce and bloody conflict, they heard a voyce
from heauen, which seemed to be S. <hi>Patricks,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
them to surcease from the effusion of

swole vp so high, that it impeached their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
fight, and slaughter for the present.</p>
               <p>3. The Vlidians put the blessed Saints bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vpon a new wayne drawen by two kine, and
so carried it away, with great ioye and singing of
psalmes, hymnes, and spiritual canticles, wherat
the Ardmuchians fury was so inkindled, that
they intended by force of armes to detayne the
holy body of their patron, and primat: but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to stint that bloody strife, substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7147:67"/>
before the Ardmuchians eyes a phantasticall
wayne which resembled so fully the former, that
they being perswaded it was the same that carried
the rich treasure of the Saintes sacred body, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it so farre as the riuer <hi>Caulune,</hi> in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the prouince of Ardmuch, where that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
wayne disappeared out of their sight: in
the meane time the Vlidians entred the citty of
<hi>Downe,</hi> and after great solemnity of masses, they
interred the holy body in the place aforesaid. S.
Patricke departed this life in the yeare of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

of the ancient, and honorable
family of <hi>Etech</hi> in the kingdom of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
was borne at <hi>Fochart,</hi> a village a
mile distant from <hi>Dundalke</hi> in the country of
<hi>Louth.</hi> Her Father was a noble man of <hi>Leinster,</hi>
named <hi>Dubtacus,</hi> who falling in loue with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd
of his named <hi>Brocseca,</hi> a woman indued
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7147:68"/>
with singuler beauty, and admirable comlines, he
got her with child of this sacred virgin, which
when his owne wife perceiued, being in great
trouble therat, and taking the matter very gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily,
she said vnto him; cast out this handmayd,
fearing her posterity surpasse mine. <hi>Dubtacus</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
through his wiues importuinty, made
sale of her to a certaine Magitian, in whose house
falling in trauaile, she was safe deliuered of the
holy child; such as were present at her birth,
saw the cloath, wherewith her tender head was
couered, to burne with a flame of fire, whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hastning to quench it, they found no fire
at all.</p>
               <p>2. So much did the holy virgin loath to feed
of the Magitians meats, that she was constrayned
euery day to cast vp what she eate. The Magitian
considering attentiuely the cause therof, said: I
am vncleane, &amp; this holy virgin (ful of the spirit
of God) cannot taste of my meate; choosing out
therfore a white merch cow, he bestowed it vpon
her to liue by her milke. The holy virgin increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in vertue, no lesse then in yeares; for she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in all kind of holy conuersation and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of life, aed became very conspicuous for her
modestie, chastity and temperance, but aboue al
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7147:68"/>
her charity to the poore is most remarkable.</p>
               <p>3. The sacred virgin being deputed by the
Magitian to keepe his cowes, gaue all the butter,
and milke she could gather to releiue the present
wantes, and necessities of the poore. When the
Magitian saw but a small quantity of butter in a
great vesel, wherin the butter was to be kept, he
chafed extreamely. The Saint seeing what passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was in, offered her pure prayers vp to God,
and so by diuine vertue, filled the vessell with
butter euen vp to the topp: wherat the Magitian
was so much astonished and moued, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued
in Christ, setting both her, and her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at liberty.</p>
               <p>4. In regard she gaue to the poore, all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
she could lay handes vpon, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
her Fathers sword, he purposed to sel her;
for which end bringing her where the King was,
he requested him that he would be pleased to buy
his daughter. To whome the Kinge spoke in
this manner; what made you to giue away your
fathers sword, to the poore man? To whome she
answeared, I haue giuen it to Christ, &amp; Sir if my
God did aske your maiesty, and my father too
of me, I would bestow you both, and whatsoeuer

she fell prostrate before the venerable Prelate to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7147:69"/>
offer her selfe a holy, cleane and impolluted host
to her heauenly spouse, she touched the alter

part therof to eighteen Churches that were rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
about, and besides during all the octaue, that
small quantity sufficed aboundantly, and serued
to satisfy all those who would, and were desirous
to taste therof. At the same time a Leaper came
to the holy virgin, requesting her to help him to
a cow, but she hauing none said to him; Wil you
that we pray God to deliuer you from your sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?
who answeared, that he preferred his cure
before all other guiftes; whereupon she hauing
blessed water, sprinkled the leaper therwith, and
immediatly he became cleane: in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner two
sicke virgins taking water, which the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
had blessed, recouered their perfect health.</p>
               <p>3. Two blind men being Brittons, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
men by birth, with a leaper who was their
guide, came to her Church doore, and besought
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7147:70"/>
the sacred Virgin to help them to their bodily
health; She intreated them to haue patience a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and to enter into the lodging to refresh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and that she would in the meane time pray
to God in their behalfe; which delay they tooke
so impatiently, that with great indignation they
replied; you heale the diseased of your owne nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but as for vs being strangers, you neglect to
cure vs for Christs sake. The holy virgin recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this reproach, went forth vnto them, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
holy water vpon them, she cleansed the
leaper, and restored the blynd men to their
sight.</p>
               <p>4. A certaine woman, brought some apples

not a little offended, she answeared; You
haue done very ill in hindering vs to giue almes,
therfore your trees will neuer more produce any

and so it remayned fruitles alwayes after.</p>

to obserue the same custome euery night: but our

the poole dry without any water, and comming

mercy grew euen from her infancy, hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but flesh, that was boyling for some guests
that were to come, drew it out of the pot, and
gaue the doge a peece therof. When the flesh was
laid vpon the table, it appeared, so intire, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to reclaime nine men from fulfilling their
nefarious vow made of killing a man in the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes
of Iuly, yet for nothing that she could,

prayer for the desperate wretches, loe there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeared
before their eyes a figure, resembling to

by way of triumphe ouer their slaine ennemy,
came backe immediatly to the Saint with their

was brought to the Saint, to whome she sayd;
Preach to me the word of our Sauiour Iesus

feare thee, this being said, the diuell fled away
with a loud cry.</p>
               <p>3. As Saint <hi>Brigit</hi> sat at the table with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

Diuell sitting hard by her, the other virgin said:
I would fayne see him, if it were possible. It is
not impossible quoth <hi>S. Bridgit,</hi> but first signe
your eyes, that they may be able to sustaine his
sight, and contemplate his face: hauing signed
her eyes, she saw the ennemy in a most vgly, and
blacke shape, with a terrible great head, exhasing
forth at his nostrils smoke, and flames of fire.
Speake to vs Diuell, said S. <hi>Bridgit.</hi> To whome
he answeared, O most holy virgin, I cannot speak
to you, neither yet can I contemne your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
since you contemne not Godes
holy ordonances, and are so affable to his poore,

sayd the Blessed Virgin. I remaine with this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

them to digge vnder the adioyning earth,

Vpon the digging vp of the ground, there gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

I couet not a life, which I doe not see, neither

maydes hauing receiued from a certaine rich

ouer a water that was in the way, being therfore
destitute of all humane helpe, and assistance,
they inuocated the powerfull suffrages of their

assembly of his subiectes, to make abroade and
fayre high waye in a deep and impassible marsh,

fire of se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suality, &amp; likwise vexed with the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of conscience, she knew not what to do, but fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God, and S. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> prayd her earnestly,
that she would vouchsafe to helpe and assist her
being indistresse. At last she resolued with her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7147:78"/>
selfe to make a fire, putting her selfe therinto, so
by that meanes, with fire she quenched fire, and
with payne, ouercame payne; which S. <hi>Bridgit</hi>
knewe by diuine reuelation, yet neuertheles kept
it secret, to see the euent and issue of the virgins
combat. The next morning the virgin acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgd
her sin to Saint Bridgit, who sayd to her:
because in fighting couragiously this night, thou
hast burnt thy selfe, the fire of forincation shall
neuer annoye thee in this life, nor the fire of hel
burne thee in the next; then the holy virgin did
heale her feete, so that no marke of the burning
did appeare in them.</p>
               <p>4. Neither ought we to omit that great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
which this blessed Saint wrought in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Sauiour, by opening the eyes of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
who was blind fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his natiuity. A certaine Queen
that had no children, by the holy Virgins inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
obtayned issue. And as Almighty God
for her sake and merits, did help others in their
necessityes, so did he not fayle to assist her selfe
in her wantes: for vpon a certaine time the holy
virgin being in great necessity, besought God to
help her to some honny, and what she sought for,
she found it in great plenty, vpon the pauement
of her house.</p>

CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>SAINT Bridgit said to a certaine virgin who
begged almes of her; I heare that there are
many afflicted with sicknes in your country, take
therfore my girdle, and with it, steaped in water,
you shal in the name of our Sauiour Iesus Christ
deliuer them of their infirmityes, and they will
giue you both meate &amp; cloathes: who taking the
girdle, as the Saint commaunded, she cured dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
getting therby great gaynes, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
very rich, she her selfe afterwardes, dealt
great almes to the needy. Another time she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
water into good bere to giue to leapers,
who called to her for it. In like manner did she
for the comfort of a needy person, conuert a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
into salt. She likewise deuided one garment
betwene two poore men, and by diuine vertue,
each part became an entire garment.</p>
               <p>2. Among the many stupendious miracles
she wrought, this is not to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the least,
nor the least to be admired. To three leapers who
besought her to bestow some charity of them,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7147:79"/>
she gaue a siluer vessell; and fearing it should
be an occasion of debate, or discord amongst
them, if they deuided it themselues, she spoke to
the gold-smith to deuide it equally amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But he making his excuse, that he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
it into three equal partes, the most holy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
her selfe tooke it into her hand, and stroke it
against a stone, and soe deuided it iust into three
equall parcells: in so much that afterwardes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put in scales to be weighed, neither part did
ouerweigh the other, not so much as one dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me,
so equall were the deuisions, and so the leapers
departed away ioyfull with their shares, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause either of enuy, or any iniury.</p>
               <p>3. According to the example of holy Iob,
she neuer permitted the poore to departe from
her with empty handes, for she gaue them very
pretious, and rich garmentes, which a holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
named <hi>Conleath,</hi> vsed to weare in saying the
diuine mysteries of the Masse, vpon the higher
feastes of our Lord, and the Apostles. Now when
the time came, that the venerable Prelate should
according to his wonted manner, vse the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
episcopall robes, the holy virgin, who had
giuen them to Christ in his needy members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
other such robes fully resembling the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7147:79"/>
as well in the weauing, or texture, as in
colour, which were brought her in a waggon of
two horses, euen at the same houre that she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
gaue the others to the poore.</p>
               <p>4. So large and liberall was her charity to
the poore, that none euer had a repulse at her
handes, as it is cleare and euident by this ensuing
narration. For one time being abroad in the
feildes feeding of her flocke, one who was well
acquainted with the tendernes of her hart, and
largenes of her hand, came to her seauen times in
one day begging of almes, and euery time she
gaue him a weather; and when euening approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
she droue home the sheep, yet being tould
ouer twice or thrice, the flocke was found entire,
and complete, not one being missing to the great
wonder of those who knew what chaunced. It is
also recorded of her, that after prayer made for
that intent, she got miraculously a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
with which she ransommed a guilty person,
whome the King appointed to be put to death.</p>

               <p>A Certayne malitious woman, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

With that S. <hi>Bridgit</hi> signed the womans mouth

her head swelled vp with a great tumour, after
she blessed the young infants tongue, saying to
him; Who is your Father? The child made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare,
Bishop <hi>Broon</hi> is not my Father, but that
vilde and deformed man, who sitteth last among
the people: then all the assembly rendring many
thankes, and prayses to God, constrained the
lewed woman to do pennance for her folly.</p>
               <p>2. There was a certaine man named <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidinus,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:7147:80"/>
who was indued with such admirable
strength, and surpassing vigour of body, that he
himselfe alone could do so much worke as twelue
men, and who moreouer was so great a deuourer
of meate, as to eate at once so much, as might
well serue twelue men, for as in working he did
counteruaile twelue men; so likewise in eating
did he match that number. This man came to
S. Bridgit, beseeching her to obtaine of God,
that he would vouchsafe to temper, and bridle
the immoderate appetite of his deuouring, and
rauenous stomack, without diminishing or may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

neuer after did he take more, then was able to

so much worke as he was before, when he
did eate most of all.</p>
               <p>3. The sacred virgin sent for many worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>THE sacred virgin hauing run out the course
of her mortall dayes, in the exercise of all
kind of sanctimony, and innocency of life, the
time of the resolution of her terrene tabernacle
drew neere at hand, whose deposition, as her selfe
knew by reuelation, and foretould to one of her
virgins, was not farre off. The holy virgin gaue
vp her soule, to her heauenly spouse about the
yeare of our redemption 518. Her venerable
body, was placed in a sumptuous monument of
gould, and siluer, adorned with iewells, and
pretious stones, and was first interred in her
owne monasterie at <hi>Kildare,</hi> together with the

where it lyes together with the venerable bodies
of S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> and S. <hi>Columbe,</hi> the other two
glorious patrons of Ireland. At <hi>Kildare</hi> and other
places, many miracles haue been wrought by the
merits of Saint Bridgit, we will content our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
with the relation of some few, fearing to cloy
the Reader with to much tediousnes.</p>
               <p>2. The ouerseer of Saint Bridgits great and
famous monastery, sent workemen, and stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewers
to prouide a mill stone, they neither refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
vpon the difficulty of the way, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
that there was no meanes of getting
downe the stone, went vp to the topp of a most
high and craggy mountayne, where they hewed
out a great stone forming it into a mill stone, the
Ouerseer came with oxen and horses to carry
it away, but seeing it impossible with oxen and
horses to go where it was, in regard of the steepe
and craggy ascent, all begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to despaire of euer
getting it downe, and so were ready to departe.
But the prudent Ouerseer said; Not so, but
let vs in the name of God, and S. Bridgit (to
whome nothing is impossible) rowle it downe,
and so conceauing a firme faith of the holie vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
asistance, they cast it downe: and loe tho
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7147:82"/>
stone rowling amongst the rocky, &amp; stony crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
trunled downe without any detriment from
the mountaine, and thence was carried to the
mill. To which mill a certaine pagan sent his
corne by an ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; simple man to be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
when the corne was laid betweene the stones,
the aforesaid stone being the vppermost, stood ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoueable,
neither could the violent current of
the great riuer, nor yet the paynfull industry of
men, whele it about: at last, knowing that the
corne belonged to a pagan Magitian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Bridgits</hi> mill, would not grinde it, they
remoued and put it away, powring other graine
insteede therof, and then the stone without any
impediment, kept its ordinary, &amp; wonted course
in grinding.</p>
               <p>3. It hapned within a while after, that the
mill by some chaunce or other tooke fire, which
consumed the howse and the other stone to,
that was ioyned to this, but as for this stone, that
was particulerly dedicated to S. <hi>Bridgit,</hi> the fire
did not presume to touch, neither was it bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with any signe, or marke of burning, which
made them to bring the stone away, and to place
it neare to <hi>S. Bridgits</hi> church doore, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diseased meeting, by the only touch of this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7147:83"/>
stone, were deliuered from their maladies. Here
our author by occasion of this insueing miracle,
enlargeth himself in describing the magnificence
of Saint Bridgits church, the sumptuousnes of
the oratories, the curiosity of anticke workes,
and variety of curious portratures, with many
other remarkable particulers, worthy the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which we to continue our intended course
of breuity, do wittingly passe ouer, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

               <p>4. The gate of Saint Bridgits oratory, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
which she, and her holy virgins passed,
when they went to receaue the delicious viand
of our Sauiours sacred and pure body being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
downe, &amp; made wider, the carpenters setting
the former doore vpon the hinges which was
found, was lesse by a fourth part, or quarter:
wherupon they resolued, either to add another
peece to the ould doore, or to make another al
of new; and as they were debating the busines,
the principall worke maister sayd. Wee ought
this next night to watch and pray at S. <hi>Bridgits</hi>
monument, to the end that she may direct vs
in the morning, what is best to be done in this
matter: so passing al the night ouer at her shrine,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7147:83"/>
and rysing the next morning after, saying some
prayers, setting the ould doore vpon the hinges,
it fitted all the gate so iust, that it nether wanted,
nor yet exceeded any thing in conuenient big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
and in this manner was the doore by the
merits of Saint Bridgit, extended to an equall &amp;
commensuratiue proportion with the gate of the
church. Who can expresse (sayth our author
here) the admirable beauty of this Church, or
how can we declare the marueiles of this Citty?
Or who may recount the innumerable thronges,
and infinit multitudes of people flocking thither
from all countryes? Some come to delight them
selues with plentifull diuersity of banquets, some
to solace themselues with variety of pleasant
showes, and spectacles, others to obtayne the
cure of their diseases, and others with rich, and
great donaryes to solemnise Saint Bridgits natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

vpon which day in the yeare of Christ
518. as we haue touched aboue in the first para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe

passed from the miseries of this mortal life, to the
immortall ioyes of paradise. Whither God of

                  <p>2. <hi>S. Fintenus,</hi> who after became so famous
ouer all the Churches of Ireland, conceaued in
his younger yeares an earnest desire of forsaking
Ireland, and visiting our Saint <hi>Columbe.</hi> Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7147:86"/>
with this desire, he went to a certaine
friend of his, a very wise, and venerable man, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Columbus,</hi> to take his aduice in the matter,
who liked well of his holy resolution; thither at
the same tyme came two of <hi>S. Columbes</hi> monkes,
who being demanded touching their iourney,
answerd: We are newly come out of Brittany,
and this day from the monastery of the Oaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
<hi>Roboretum</hi> is your holy father S. <hi>Colomb</hi> wel,
and in good health, sayth <hi>Columb.</hi> With that they
sheding teares aboundantly replyed: truly our
father and Patron is well; for a few dayes past he
departed to Christ. Vpon knowledge whereof
<hi>Fintenus, Columbus,</hi> and the rest that were present,
falling downe prostrate vpon the ground, wept
bitrerly. <hi>Fintenus</hi> demanded further of them,
saying: whome did he ordaine his successour?
they made answere, his disciple <hi>Bathaneus,</hi> with
that <hi>Columbus</hi> asked <hi>Fintenus</hi> what he ment to do,
who answered: I will with Gods grace repaire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the wise and holy man <hi>Bathaneus,</hi> and will
take him for my Abbot: then taking his leaue

it knowne to <hi>Bathaneus,</hi> that he had a desire to
confer with him, who presently sent for him.
<hi>Fintenus</hi> being brought to <hi>Bathaneus</hi> his presence,
fell downe vpon his knees, but the Saint made
him rise, and sit downe with him. Then did
<hi>Fintenus</hi> recount to the saint his name, countrey,
kindred, conuersation, &amp; what had moued him
to vndertake that paineful nauigation; and lastly
closed vp his discourse with an humble request
in behalfe of his admittance. <hi>Bathaneus</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all, sayd: My child I am bound to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
many thankes to God for your arriuall, but
know this for certaine, that you cannot be a
monke of ours. <hi>Fintenus</hi> hearing this, became
very heauy and sadd, saying. Perchance I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to be your monke. To whome the old
Senior replyed: It is not as you say; for albeit I
had rather detaine you with me, then otherwise,
yet can I not prophane the commandement of
my patron S. <hi>Columbe,</hi> by whose mouth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

be receaued of you among the other monkes, but it is
not preordained for him in the prescience of God, that
he become a monke to be subiect, for he is preelected for
the Abbot of monkes, and for a captaine to leade many
soules to heauen, doe not therefore detaine the foresaid
man with you in our Ile, but send him backe againe
into Ireland, that he may build a monastery in</hi> Leyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<hi>on the bancke of the sea, where feding a flocke of
Christs sheep, he may conduct innumerable soules to the
ioyes of paradise.</hi> The young Saint hearing this,
and powring out aboundance of tears with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks
giuing to God, sayd: Be it done to me according
to the propheticall, &amp; marueilous prescience of
S. <hi>Columbe:</hi> so taking <hi>S. Bathaneus</hi> his benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he returned backe into Ireland.</p>
                  <p>4. About that tyme, that the holy man was
founding by diuine inspiration the monastery of
<hi>Diarmag,</hi> in the midle region of Ireland, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to visit the holy company that liued in <hi>S.
Kiaranus</hi> monastery at <hi>Cluayre.</hi> They vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of his approach, went all forth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their Abbot <hi>Alitherus</hi> to meet him, and
lead him honorably (singing of Psalmes &amp; Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes)
to the Church. At the same tyme a certaine
despicable familiar youth came behind the Saint,
and hiding himselfe so much as he could, he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7147:88"/>
thought to touch at vnawares the Saint, and
without his feeling the hem of his exteriour gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but what the Saint could not see with his
corporall eyes, he saw with his interiour, and
mentall eyes: for making a stand, he put his
hand behind him, &amp; so taking hold of the youth
by the necke, he placed him in presence of all the
people. Then all that were there present, sayd:
Dismisse him, dismisse him, why doe you detaine
that vnhappy boy? The Saint breathing out
from his pure breast these propheticall wordes,
sayd. <hi>Giue ouer now, brethren, giue ouer.</hi> And
then turning to the youth, that trembled, and,
quaked for feare, he sayd: <hi>O child open your mouth,
and put out your tongue.</hi> The youth did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
then the Saint extending his holy hand, and
blessing his tongue, diligently pronounced this
prophecy of him: <hi>Albeit this youth seemeth to you
vilde, and despiceable, let none therefore contemne
him; for from henceforth he wil not only displease you,
but he will proue very pleasing to you: in vertue, and
holy conuersation he will dayly goe forward, and from
hence forth his wisedome and prudence will more and
more increase, and in this our congregation he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a worthy member, and his tongue shalbe indued
by God, both with wholesome doctrine, and eloquence.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:7147:88"/>
This youth was <hi>Ereneus,</hi> who afterwards was so
famous, and well knowne throughout all the
Churches of Ireland.</p>

CHAP II.</head>
                  <p>THE saint being in his monastery of <hi>Hoy,</hi>
one day that the seas were very rough, and
the windes blew boisterously, commanded the
monkes to make ready the guest-roome, and to
draw water for some that were to come. One of
the Brothers asked, who can haue a prosperous
nauigation such a day as this, though the passage
be neuer so short? The saint answered: <hi>God will
prepare a calme amidst this tempest for a Saint, and
for one of his elect, that shall come to vs before eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
And loe the expected ship wherin <hi>S. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechus</hi>
was, arriued according to the saints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecye.
Another tyme likewise the saint being
in his owne great Church, he brooke forth after
a smiling manner into these wordes: <hi>Columbanus
sayling towards vs, is in danger amidst the swelling
waues, the Abbot fitting in the foredecke, eleuateth his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7147:89"/>
handes to heauen, and blesseth the fearefull, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sea, whome our Lord doth terrify, not that the
shipp shall suffer shipwracke, but to excite him to pray
more feruently, and so to come safe to vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Of <hi>Cormarus</hi> that holy man, who so often
sought for a wildernes in the sea, <hi>S. Columbe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed
in this manner. <hi>This</hi> Cormarus <hi>hoping
to find a desert, set out this day from that region that
lyeth beyond the riuer Moda, and is called</hi> Ircos, <hi>yet
shall he not find what he desires, for no other fault of
his, but that he brought with him in his company a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k
belonging to a Religious Abbot without his leaue.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
tyme the Saint commanded his seruant to
ring the bell in hast, to call the Monkes to the
Church, where falling vpon his knees, he sayd:
<hi>Now let vs offer our prayers very earnestly for this
people, and King Alban, for at this present they begin
to fight a battaile.</hi> Within a little while going out
of the oratory, and casting his eyes towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he sayd: <hi>Now the ennemyes are put to flight, for
the victory is granted to King</hi> Aldan. Before the
beginning of the foresayd warre, the Saint que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
with King Aldan, touching his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour,
who answeared, that he knew not which of
his three sonnes should raigne after him. The
saint consequently prophecied in this manner:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7147:89"/>
                     <hi>None of these three shalbe your successour, for they shall
be all slaine by their ennemyes, now if you haue any
younger children send for them, and he whom our Lord
hath elected to be King, will runne suddainly into my
lappe.</hi> They being called, <hi>Euchodius</hi> ran vnto
the Saint, who kissing him sayd to his father.
<hi>This is he that shall suruiue, and shalbe King after
you, and his children shal raigne after him.</hi> Al which
fell out to be true according to the Saints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Domnaldus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Aydo,</hi> being yet
but a child, was by his Nurses brought to S. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbe,</hi>
who asked them; Whose sonne is this you
haue brought me? They tould him, he was <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi>
whome they brought, to the end he might
be inriched with his blessing; whome when the
Saint had blessed, he presently adioyned. <hi>This
child shall ouerliue all his brethren, and shall become a
famous King, neyther shal he euer be deliuered into
the handes of his ennemyes, but shall in his old age dye
a quiet &amp; peacecible death in his own house.</hi> Al which
was fullfilled according to the Saints prophecy.
At the same tyme, and in the same place, he
went to visit <hi>Scandalanus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Colmanus,</hi>
being then detayned prisonner by King <hi>Aydus,</hi>
whom when the Saint had blessed, he sayd: <hi>Sonne
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7147:90"/>
be not heauy, but rather reioyce, and be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
King</hi> Aydus, <hi>whose captiue you are, will depart
this life before you, and after your banishment for a
little tyme, you shalbe King in your owne country for
thirty yeares, then shal you againe be chased out of
your kingdome, and shall liue in exile for a few dayes,
which dayes being expired, the people will proclaime
you King againe, ouer whome you shall beare rule for
three shorte tymes.</hi> All this was accomplished in
forme and manner, as the Saint had prophecyed;
for after thirty yeares reigne, he was driuen out
of the kingdome for a certaine space, being after
recalled by the people, he reigned not three years
as he thought, but three months only, and then
dyed without delay. Two country men brought
their sonnes to the Saint in the Ile of <hi>Hoy,</hi> to the
one, he told his sonne should dye the same week,
and to the other, that his sonne should liue to see
his nephewes, and that he should after a good
old age, be buryed in the same Iland.</p>
                  <p>4. One of the Saints Monkes named <hi>Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
being to sayle to the Iland of <hi>Ethica,</hi> came
to the Saint to craue his blessing, to whome the
Saint sayd: <hi>Beware my sonne, you hould not your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
course of Ethica, by sayling along the wide seas,
but rather take your course winding about the little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7147:90"/>
fearing that otherwyse you should not escape by
reason of the terrour of a monstruous prodigie.</hi> Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
receauing the Saints blessing departed, and
so getting into the ship, regarding but little the
Saintes admonition, he sayled directly through
the broad seas, &amp; loe he and they that were with
him, saw a mighty huge Whale, like to a bigge
mountaine to rise vp ouer the waters, whose sight
strucke a great terrour into their mindes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the marriners strucke downe their sayle,
and turning backe againe, hardly could they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
that danger arising from the tempestuous
agitation of the VVhale, the they called to mind
the Saints propheticall prediction, not without
admiration. <hi>Bathaneus</hi> being to passe the same
morning to the prementioned Ile, the Saint ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
him of the Whale, to whome <hi>Batha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
answered: I, and the beast are vnder Godes
power, then the Saint sayd: <hi>Goe in peace, thy faith
in Christ will preserue thee from this danger.</hi> So Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaneus
tooke the Saints benediction, &amp; launced
out from the hauen, &amp; after sayling forth a good
space into the sea, he and his companions saw the
VVhale, which put them all in great feare, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Bathaneus</hi> without any terrour lifting vp his
handes, blessed the seas &amp; the VVhale, and loe in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7147:91"/>
the selfe same moment, the VVhale sunke downe
vnder the waues, and neuer after appeared to
them. The saint prophecyed of a certaine wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, who had committed fratricide, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
incest with his owne mother, that he should
be slaine by his ennemyes, which happened true

CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>AS one of the Saints Monks named <hi>Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi>
came vpon a tyme to the saint, he
could not looke vpon his face, being couered
ouer with a marueilous rednes, whereat concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
great feare, he ran away; whome the saint
called backe, asking him what was the cause of
his running away? he answeared, because I was
in great feare. And within a little while dealing
with the saint more confidently, he made bould
to aske of the saint, whether any fearefull vision
had beene manifested to him, the saint then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared:
<hi>A terrible vengeance hath beene now exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in a remote part of the world.</hi> VVhat vengean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7147:91"/>
was it? Or in what country did it happen? The
Saint replyed. <hi>A sulphurous flame was powred downe
at this houre vpon a citty of the Romane dominion,
within the marches of Italy, whereby three thousand
men besides women and children, were almost consumed,
and before this present yeare be expired, there wil come
marchants out of france, who will tell you the same
newes.</hi> At a placed called <hi>Camprio-Regionis, Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus</hi>
found a french pilot, of whome he learned al
the Saint had foretould him.</p>
                  <p>2. Vpon a certaine very colde winter daye,
the saint sorrowed much, and wept exceedingly.
His familiar seruant <hi>Diarmitius,</hi> asked him the
cause of his sorrow, who receaued this answere:
O my little child, I do not sorrow at this present
without cause, seeing how <hi>Laifranus</hi> toyleth my
Monkes, already weary in the building of a great
house, which disgusteth me much. A wonder to
be spoken, in the selfe same moment <hi>Laifranus</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the monastery of the Oken-field, being
forced in a manner by coaction, and inflamed
as it were with fire interiourly, commanded the
Monkes to cease from the worke, &amp; some recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of meate to be prepared, &amp; gaue them leaue
to rest, not only for that day, but also so long as
the hard season coutinued. The saint hearing in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7147:92"/>
spirit these comfortable words spoken by <hi>Laifra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
forbere to weep, &amp; reioyced exceedingly, &amp;
tould the brethren there present, al what passed,
and withall gaue his benediction to <hi>Laifranus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As the saint sat one day vpon the top of
an high mountaine, hanging ouer the monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
turning to his familiar seruant <hi>Diarmitius,</hi> he
sayd: <hi>I marueile what it is, that stayes a shippe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of Ireland, which carryeth in it a wise man,
who for a certaine sinne whereinto he hath falne, doth
bitter pennance.</hi> Within a little while, the familiar
Brother looking towardes the South, he saw the
sayles of the shippe approaching to the hauen,
and showed it to the Saint, who sayd: <hi>Rise in hast
and let vs go meet the proselite, whose true pennance
Christ hath regarded. Fechnaus</hi> comming a shoare,
fell downe prostrate, and weeping bitterly, vpon
his knees, he confessed his sinnes in presence of
all the company. The Saint out of compassion,
weeping with him, sayd: <hi>Rise my sonne, and be of
good cheare, for your sinnes are forgiuen you, because
it is written: A contrite and humble hart, God wil not
despise:</hi> who afterwardes being very louingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
of the Saint, he sent him to <hi>Bathaneus</hi>
liuing at a place called <hi>Lungefield.</hi> Another tyme
the Saint sent two monkes for one of his Monks
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7147:92"/>
named <hi>Cailtanus,</hi> biding him to repaire in al hast
to him. <hi>Cailtanus</hi> vnderstanding of the Saintes
pleasure came speedily in company with the Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
that went for him. VVhen the Saint saw <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iltanus,</hi>
he spoke to him in manner following. <hi>O
Cailtanus, you haue done very well in hastning to me
so obediently, rest you a little. Louing you as a friend I
inuited you to come, that you might finish the course
of your mortall life heere with me in true obedience;
for before this weeke come to an end, you shall render
your soule in peace to God.</hi> Then <hi>Cailtanus</hi> with
thankes to God kissed the saint, and to receauing
his benediction, went to the guest roome, the
night following he sickned, and according the
saints word, departed the selfe same weeke to a
better life.</p>
                  <p>4. On a certayne Sunday some cryed from
the further side of the often mentioned sea. The
Saint hearing the cry, sayd to the brethren: Goe
in all hast, and bring the pilgrimes that come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a farre Country: they went as the saint appointed
them, and brought them to his presence, whom
when he had saluted, he began to question with
them concerning their iourney: they tould him,
they came to seiourne with him for that yeare, to
whome the saint replyed: <hi>You may not liue with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7147:93"/>
me a yeare as you desire, vnlesse you tye your selues to
the obseruance of the monasticall vowes.</hi> The eldest
made answere: Truely we had no such intention
hetherto, notwithstanding we will embrace your
counsell inspired by God, as we beleeue. To be
short, they followed the Saint deuoutly into the
oratory, and there on their knees obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the monasticall vowes. Then the saint
conuerting his speach to the brothers there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
sayd: These two proselites exhibiting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
a liuing hoste to God, and accomplishing
in a few dayes the course of Christian perfection,
shall yield vp their soules to Christ before this
present month run to an end; and so it fell out;
for both of them fell sicke one after another, and
departed to a better life, within the tearme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed
and perfixed by the saint.</p>

few dayes remayned in Ireland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7147:93"/>
at a place bordering on the sea, he struck the
earth with his staffe, saying to the Monkes that
were with him. Behould my little children, a
certaine Gentil, who al his life tyme followed the
good instincts, and propensions of nature, shall
this day be baptized, dye, and be buryed in this
place: and loe within the space as it were of an
houre, a shippe strucke into the same hauen, in
whose foredecke sate an ancient Pagan named
<hi>Geone,</hi> whome two young men lifted vp between
them &amp; brought him to the saints presence: the

Immediatly after the receipt of holy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
he gaue vp his ghost, and was buryed in
the same place by the Saints companions.</p>
                  <p>2. During the Saints aboade in the foresayd
region, he went one Sunday to a neighbour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
named <hi>Trioint,</hi> and seeing the same day a
certaine Priest celebrating the holy misteryes of
the Eucharist, whome the Monkes made choise
of for that purpose, for that they deemed him a
man of a very holy and religious life, he suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounced this fearefull sentence: <hi>Cleane and
vncleane thinges, are now mingled togeather,</hi> to wit,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7147:94"/>
the cleane misteryes of the sacred oblation, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled

some enormious sinne: the party of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he had spoken in this kind, confessed his sinne
before all the company, which with great astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shement
admired in the Saint this stupendious
knowledge, penetrating euen to the secrets of
mens harts.</p>
                  <p>3. Another time the Saint being in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of <hi>Hoy,</hi> he called to him two of his Monkes
named <hi>Lugbeus,</hi> and <hi>Silnanus,</hi> and sayd to them:
sayle ouer into the Ile of <hi>Malea,</hi> and neere the sea
banke seeke out the theefe <hi>Ertus,</hi> who lurketh
there, expecting in the night tyme to get ouer to
the little Ile, where our sea-calues breed, to steale
some away, and bring them home to his house.
They did accordingly, and found the theefe in
the place premonstrated, whome they brought
to the saint, as he had commanded. The saint
seeing him, sayd: <hi>Wherefore dost thou trespasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the diuine commandement, in stealing away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods so often? when thou art driuen to any
necessity, come to vs, and we will releeue thy wantes.</hi>
And with this he appointed that some weathers
should be kild, and giuen to the miserable theef,
that he might not return home to his house with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7147:94"/>
empty handes. Within a short tyme the saint
knew by reuelation that the theeues death drew
neere: he sent him therefore a fat Cow, &amp; seauen
measures of corne which were spent at his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>railles.
In like manner the saint foresaw and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould
the death of a Scottish poet named <hi>Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It happened another tyme in the same
Iland of <hi>Hoy,</hi> as the saint was at his booke rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he cast out deep and sorrowfull sighes:
<hi>Lugbeus</hi> who was present, began to demande the
cause of his suddaine griefe; the Saint made this
answere: <hi>In Scotland two noble men of the bloud royal
haue kild one another, at a place not farre distant from
the Monastery of</hi> Cellarois, <hi>in the Prouince of the</hi>
Magdeni, <hi>and the eight day hence, there will come one
out of Ireland, who wil report the truth of al this.</hi> The
man whose comming the Saint foresaw, came on
the presaged day, and among many other newes,
reported that <hi>Colmancanus,</hi> and <hi>Romanus</hi> had slaine
one another. After this, <hi>Lugbeus</hi> the souldier of
Christ, getting the Saint at his leasure, sayd to
him: I beseech you let me know how &amp; in what
manner these propheticall reuelations are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to you, whether you know them by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
of your eyes, or by the help of your ears,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7147:95"/>
or after some strange manner vnknowne of to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. The Saint answered: <hi>I cannot acquaint
you with any thing touching this subtile matter you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after, vnlesse you first take an othe on your knees
neuer to speake of this obscure sacrament all the dayes
of my life.</hi> Lugbeus swore as the saint would haue
him: then the saint spoke as followeth: <hi>There are
some, albeit they be but few in number, that by Godes
speciall grace clearely contemplate with one single as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and in one mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the compasse of the whole world
the heauens, the sea, and land, by reason of the maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
dilatation of their mind.</hi> Though the saint see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to report this of others, for the auoidance
of all vaine glory, and selfe esteeme, yet that
he meant it of himself indirectly, is cleare to any
that hath perused the vessell of election <hi>S. Paul</hi>
in his 2. to the Corinthians. For he discoursing
of visions and rapts happening to himself, wrote
not, I know of my selfe, but I know such a man
that he was rapt into paradise, which though he
seeme to recount of another, yet none can doubt
but he spoke of himselfe.</p>
                  <p>5. It fell out another tyme, that one of the
brothers came to the place where the faint was
writting, and sayd to him: I beseech you blesse
this Iron I hould in my hand: the saint stretched
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7147:95"/>
out his hand holding the pen, &amp; blessed the Iron
according to the brothers request, in the meane
tyme, he held his face towards the book he wrot:
the brother being gone away, the saint asked.
What Iron he had blessed for the Brother. <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi>
his familiar tender, answered. A knife
wherewith Beeues are killed: then the saint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
<hi>I trust firmely in our Lord, that this weapon
I haue blessed, will neuer do hurt to man, nor beast:</hi>
The truth of which sentence of the Saint, was
showen in effect the selfe same houre. For the
brother going out of the monastery with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to kill a Cow, endeauoured thrice therunto,
and yet could not so much as pierce her skinne.
Another tyme the Saints faythfull tender <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi>
sickened euen to death, the Saint came to
visit him in that extremity, and standing by the
beds side, prayed after this manner: <hi>I beseech thee
O Lord be fauourable to me, and let not the soule of my
pious tender, be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this mortal life before I end
the course of my dayes.</hi> After praying thus, he held
his peace for a little space, then opening his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
mouth, he sayd: <hi>This my louing child shal not
only escape the danger of this present infirmity, but
shall moreouer liue for many yeares after my death:
Diarmitius</hi> was deliuered incontinently of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7147:96"/>
and suruiued the Saint many a longe yeare.</p>

CHAP. V.</head>
                  <p>THERE came out of the Prouince of the
<hi>Numinenses,</hi> a certaine proselit to visit the
saint, this man being a Bishop, dissembled al that
he could his degree and estate, yet could he not
keep it hidden from the saints al-piercing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For the proselit being to consecrate the
next sunday our Sauiours holy body, the saint
sayd to him: <hi>Since you are a Bishop breake this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
bread after the manner, and with the same sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
a Bishop ought to breake it, now we know ful wel
that you are a Bishop; why did you conceale your selfe
from vs, by occasion wherof we did not demean our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
towards you, with that respect &amp; veneration your
place and calling requires.</hi> The humble harted pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
hearing him speake in this kind, glorifyed
Christ in his holy seruant <hi>Columbe.</hi> Another time
the venerable Abbot sent his vncle <hi>Ernanus</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7147:96"/>
the monastery of <hi>Humba,</hi> of whome at his
departure he pronounced this prophecy: <hi>This
my friend, whome I now send away, I neuer hope to see
him liuing againe in this world.</hi> Within a few dayes
<hi>Ernanus</hi> fell sicke, and would haue himselfe cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
backe to the saint, who was very glad thereof,
and went forth to meet him. <hi>Ernanus</hi> though he
were very weake and sickly, yet would he needes
go on his feet, and loe in the way he gaue vp his
ghost suddainly, before the saint could haue a
sight of him.</p>
                  <p>2. The saint tould a certaine Peasant that
came to his monastery: <hi>Loe the barbarous ennemies
sacke and spoile all the Prouince you inhabit.</hi> VVhich
dolefull newes made the poore fellow fall into
pittiful lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for his wife, &amp; children. The
saint seeing him drowned in sorrow, &amp; anguish,
sayd to him: your wife and family, haue escaped
to the mountaines, but you goods and cattle, the
ennemy hath taken away: the man going home
found all to be true as the saint had tould him.
A certaine valiant, and strong man named <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
would faine learne of the saint what kind of
death himselfe should dy of. The saint told him:
You shall not be slaine in the field, nor drowned
in the sea, but the companion of your way whom
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7147:97"/>
you lest distrust or suspect, shall be the cause of
your death; within some years after the foresayd
<hi>Gorens,</hi> seeing men fighting, &amp; at mortal debate,
ran in haste to separate them, in the meane tyme
by some chance or other he let his knife fall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely,
which wounded him in the knee, of
which wounde, after the sickenesse of some
moneths, he dyed: and so the prophecy of the
Saint was fullfilled.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Another tyme likewise, the saint being
in the often mentioned Iland of</hi> Hoy, <hi>he called
one of the monkes to him, and commanded him
as followeth:</hi> The third day next ensuing, you shall
goe to the Weast part of this Ile, and shall expect the
comming of a certaine Crane from the North part of
Ireland, which Crane being driuen by the force of the
blustering windes through the spacious Regions of the
ayre, all weary and turmoyld, shal arriue there after
the ninth houre, and hauing all her forces and vigour
consumed, she will fall downe on the shoare before you;
forget not to take her vp mercifully, and to bring her
to the next house, where you shall entertaine her libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and feed her carefully for three dayes, by which
tyme her strength shall be well repayred, and her selfe
being vnwilling to soiourne with vs any longer, will
returne backe to Scotland her sweet country, where she
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7147:97"/>
was borne, and my motiue of commending her so seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to your care is, because she is of one country with
vs. <hi>The brother obeyed willingly, and the third
day at the place and tyme appointed, expected
the arriuall of the new guest, whome he tooke vp
of the shoare, and brought her weake, and faint
to the lodging, where he fed her carefully: to
whome after his comming to the monastery in
the euening the Saint sayd:</hi> Gods blessing haue you
my child for tending so carefully the strange guest, who
will make no long delay in her pilgrimage, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
back to her natiue soyle after three dayes abode.
<hi>What the saint pronounced the euent showed to
be true: for the Crane after three dayes charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
entertaynement, winded her selfe gently vp
into the ayre in presence of her officious mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
and after kept her course directly towardes
Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. On a certaine tyme many presents were
layd in the street that leadeth to the Saints mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery
to be blessed of him as he passed by, wher
poynting at the guift of a rich man, and naming
the party, he sayd. The mercy of God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
the bestower of this guift, giuen for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of the poore: after he poynted likwise at the
present of a wise, but couetous man, saying: I can
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7147:98"/>
in no wise taste of this guift, vnlesse the giuer do
pennance for his auarice, which word being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
among the people, <hi>Columbus</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Aidus</hi> came in haste, and falling on his knees did
pennance, and promised euer after to abiure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes,
and withall to amend his life, and to
become more liberall. The rich and liberall man
named <hi>Brendanus,</hi> hearing in like manner what
the Saint spoke of him, came likewise, and fell
downe at his feet, beseching him to pray for him;
<hi>Brendanus</hi> being rebuked for some offences, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
amendement from that tyme forwardes, &amp;
so it came to passe, that both of them amended
their faults.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HILST the holy Saint liued in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
with S. <hi>Findbarrus,</hi> to be trayned
vp in the study of holy Scriptures, it
happened one day, that no wine could
be found for the sacrificall mystery. The holy
young man being then a Deacon, takinge the
cruet, went to the fountaine for water, and by
inuocating the name of our B. Sauiour, who at
the marriage feast of Cana, conuerted cold water
into good wine, merited to worke the same stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
signe: all who knew of it rendred many
thankes to God, but the holy young man decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all selfe esteeme, ascribed the operation of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7147:99"/>
that great signe, to the holy Bishop <hi>Vinnian.</hi> And
as by this admirable miracle, our Sauiour made
this the beginning of the many miracles, which
himselfe wrought, so did he by it giue the first
manifestation of the sanctity of his Blessed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
S. <hi>Columbe.</hi> Hard by the monastery of the
Oaken-field, was a very fruitfull apple-tree, but
so bitter, that no good came of it: the Saint
knowing so much, went forth in the haruest to
the place, where the tree was loaden with fruit,
and eleuating his sacred hand blessed it, saying:
<hi>In the name of Almighty God, O bitter tree, let al this
bitternes depart from thee: and thy apples, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
haue beene most sowre, let them now become most
sweet, and pleasant to the tast.</hi> And without delay
the apples suddenly became marueilous delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to all those who tasted of them.</p>
                  <p>2. The holy Saint sent some of his Monks to
fetch out of the fields of a certaine countryman,
some rods, and twigges for the building of a cell,
they brought their boate well loaden, and withal
signifyed to the Saint, that the farmer conceaued
great griefe at the matter, in regard of the losse
he sustayned thereby. Then the Saint sayd; <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the man should be scandalized at vs, let there be
nine measures of barley carryed to him, and let him
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7147:99"/>
sow them in his fields, euen at this present tyme.</hi> The
corne being sent, and deliuered with the former
errand, the man receaued it gratefully, but sayd;
How can corne grow against the nature of this
country, being sowen after Midsommer? To
whome his wife answered. Do as the Saint hath
commanded, to whome our Lord will graunt
what thing soeuer he shall demand. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
man out of obedience to the Saint, fell a
ploughing the land, and sowing the corne: which
in the midst of Iune, grew so fast, and ripened so
soone, that to the great astonishment of all the
Neighbours, he cut it downe in the beginning
of August.</p>
                  <p>3. Another time the Saint saw a thicke, &amp;
misty cloud to come from the South, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he perceaued, he sayd to a Monke of his named
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> that sat with him: <hi>This cloud will proue
very noysome, both to men and beasts; for flying away
hence, it will extend it selfe ouer a part of Ireland, &amp;
showre downe towards the euening a contagious rayne,
that will ingender in men, and in the duggs of beasts
pestilent vlceres, and with these pestilent soares, men
will sicken euen to death, but we ought of compassion
to prouide some remedy against their disease: Descend
therefore with me, O Syluanus, &amp; make your selfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

promptly, and hauing by Gods fauour a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>ANOTHER tyme the Saint called vpon a
Brother named <hi>Lugaidus,</hi> and spoke to
him in this manner. Put your selfe in readines to
passe spedily into Ireland; for I must send vnto
the monastery of <hi>Chilnocherum.</hi> For this last
night the holy Virgin <hi>Maugina,</hi> comming after
masse out of the Oratary, by chance stumbled,
and broke her huckle bone into two parts; she
by inuocating often vpon my name, hopeth by
my intercession, to receaue comfort from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Lugaidus</hi> being ready to depart, the saint gaue
him a boxe made of <hi>Pine,</hi> with a certain hollowed
thing within it, and sayd: <hi>This benediction, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
arriue where</hi> Maugina <hi>is, you shal steep it in water, &amp;
the water you shal wil be to powred on her huckle bone,
and with that the broken bone will be ioyned togeather
againe, and the virgin shal receaue her health, &amp; I wil
write in the couer of this boxe, the number of three and
twenty yeares that she shall liue in this world after the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7147:101"/>
cure of her hurt.</hi> Lugaidus left nothing vnperfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that the Saint gaue him in charge to do, &amp;
so the holy virgin recouered her health, &amp; liued
out the number of three and twenty years in the
exercise of good workes, according to the Saintes
prophecy.</p>
                  <p>2. The venerable Prelate, as we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the tradition of them that knew it, cured
the languors of many sicke persons, during the
little tyme he made aboade in the place called in
latin <hi>Dorsum Cetae,</hi> whither he went to be present
at the meeting of Kinges, for with the touch, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his holy hand, hemme of his garment, or
with salt, bread, water, or any thing els blessed
by him, did he restore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their perfect health.
A woman that had an inflammation in her eye,
vsed a <hi>Petrasalis,</hi> which the Saint had blessed. It fell out after some dayes, that the house wherein
the <hi>Petrasalis</hi> was, tooke fire, al the house was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
into ashes, excepting the pearch, wheron
the <hi>Petrasalis</hi> hung, and a part of the wall that
sustayned it. A yong man, that carryed about
him a leafe written by <hi>S. Columbes</hi> holy hand,
was drowned in a riuer: his body after twenty
dayes being extracted out of the waters, the leafe
was found as drye, and vncorrupted, as if it had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7147:101"/>
beene lockt vp close in a casket.</p>
                  <p>3. As the Saint was one time trauailing, the
parents of a young infant, brought the child to
the Saint to be christned, and in regard no water
could be found in the adioyning places, the saint
declined to a rocke hardby, where after praying a
little vpon his knees, he blessed the rocke, out of
which gushed a streame of water, wherin he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
the young suckling, of whome also he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed,
<hi>that in his youth he would loose the raines to
lust, and sensuality, but afterwardes that he should
giue himselfe to the study of christian perfection, and
should dye in a good ould age.</hi> All which fell out to
be true. The Saint being in Pictland, he heard
great report of a pagan fountaine, which the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
people being blinded by the Diuell, held in
great veneration; but whosoeuer tasted of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or washed their handes or feet in it, became
by diabolicall fascination (God permitting it)
blind, leaprous, or weake with some infirmity.
The saint came to the fountaine, wherat the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians
whome he often confounded and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
were very glad, hoping that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
some mischance. The saint first inuocating
vpon the name of Christ, washed his handes &amp;
feet, and after blessing the water, drunke of it,

which from that day forwardes, bred no hurt or

vertue of the Saints benediction, the water of

the cure of many diseases.</p>

CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>VPON a certaine tyme, the Saint was in
danger at sea, for the ship was soare shaken
with huge waues, the raging violence of the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
windes beating vpon it, the Saint in that
distresse helped them what he could in pumping
out the water, whereupon the marriners sayd,
What you do now, auailes vs but litle in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
it is more fitting for you to pray for vs,
being ready almost to be cast away. With that the
Saint began to power out before God a sweet and
feruent prayer. O great wonder! No sooner did
the Saint, standing in the foredecke of the ship,
addresse his handes in prayer to the Omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
but that the tempest of the ayre, and boyling of
the sea ceased, whereupon followed a most serene
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7147:103"/>
and pleasant calme, they who were in the shippe
being strucken with admiration, glorifyed God
in his blessed seruant.</p>
                  <p>2. Another tyme the Saint being in great
danger, by occasion of a fearefull and vehement
tempest, his companions cryed to him to pray
for them, but he made answere: That belongeth
not to me to doe; for it is the holy Abbot <hi>Cahin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechus</hi>
turne to pray for you this day. <hi>Cahinnechus</hi>
being then in his own monastery called <hi>Cowfield,</hi>
heard the foresayd speach of S. <hi>Columbe</hi> by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the holy Ghost; for when he had begun
after the ninth houre to sit downe to dinner, he
arose quickly from the table, and hauing one
shooe on, &amp; leauing the other for hast, he ranne
to the Church, saying all the way, It is not tyme
for vs now to dine, when S. <hi>Columbs</hi> ship is in
imminent danger at sea, who calleth often vpon
the name of <hi>Cahinnechus,</hi> desiring him to pray
for him, and his companions: hauing spoken
these words, <hi>Cahinnechus</hi> entred the oratory and
prayed a little vpon his knees, and loe our Lord
heard incontinently his prayer; for the tempest
ceased, and the sea became calme. S. <hi>Columbe</hi>
seeing in spirit S. <hi>Cahinnechus</hi> his preparation,
and promptnes in running to the Church, he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7147:104"/>
pronounced out of his pure breast, this maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
saying. <hi>Now I know,</hi> O Cahinnechus, <hi>that God
hath heard your prayer, for your hasty running to the
church with one of your shoes only, auayles vs much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Bathaneus</hi> and other holy men came to
the Saint, entreating him to obtayne the next
day from God a prosperous wind for them, being
to passe to contrary places. The Saint answered:
<hi>Bathaneus</hi> shal haue in the morning a prosperous
wind, vntill he arriue at the hauen of <hi>Lungefield:</hi>
which God granted him according to the Saints
wordes. Then at nine of the clocke the Saint
sent for <hi>Columbanus</hi> the Priest, bidding him to
make himselfe ready, and telling him that the
south wind that fauoured <hi>Bathaneus,</hi> should turn
to the north, so <hi>Columbanus</hi> e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>barked himselfe for
Ireland. This stupendious miracle was wrought
by vertue of the saints prayers, because as it is
written: <hi>All things are possible to him that beleeueth.</hi>
After <hi>Columbanus</hi> his departure, S. <hi>Columbe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this prophecy of him: <hi>The holy man</hi>
Columbanus, <hi>shall neuer more see me in this life.</hi> So
it fell out, for <hi>S. Columbe</hi> departed to our Lord
the selfe same yeare.</p>
                  <p>4. A certaine young man named <hi>Columba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
brought a vessell full of milke to the place
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7147:104"/>
where the saint was, requesting him to blesse it,
as he was accustomed. As the Saint made the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
signe of the Crosse in the ayre, the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
began to shake, the couer fell to the ground,
&amp; the most part of the milke was shed; the youth
layd downe the vessell, with the little milke that
was left vpon the ground, &amp; fell humbly on his
knees, to whome the Saint sayd: <hi>Rise vp</hi> Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,
<hi>for you haue been negligent in performing of your
duty, this day, because you did not chase away with
the signe of the crosse the Diuell, that lurcked in the
bottome of the empty vessell, before you powred in the
milke, the vertue of which sacred signe, he being vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to sustaine, he is now fled away.</hi> Then the Saint
blessed the little milke, that was left, and loe the
vessell that was almost empty, vnder the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his sacred hand, became brimfull.</p>

                  <p>THe Saint hauing lodged one night at the
house of one <hi>Columbanus,</hi> a very poore and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7147:105"/>
dy man, in the morning he questioned with him
concerning the quantity, and quality of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
The poore man answered: I haue fiue
Cowes, which if you vouchsafe to blesse, I doubt
not, but they will increase to a greater number.
The saint commanded him to bring them to his
presence, where blessing them, he sayd: <hi>You shal
by Gods grace haue a hundred and fiue cowes, and this
benediction shal remaine to your children, &amp; nephewes.</hi>
Which prophetical prediction fel out to be most
true, the cowes being multiplyed to the foresaid
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; how many soeuer exceeded that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
perished by seuerall mischances, excepting
those he spent in maintenance of his family, or
gaue by way of almes.</p>
                  <p>2. The saint loued intirely the foresayd ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for many kindnesses, and pious offices he had
done him. A certaine wicked man descending of
the blood royall, persecuted <hi>Columbanus</hi> the saints
deare friend, and robbed his house three seuerall
tymes, and tooke away all his goodes: the third
tyme it was his fortune to meet with the saint,
who rebuked him for his wickednes, and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to restore the goodes vniustly taken:
but he regarding nothing the saints prayers, yea
rather laughing and scoffing at him, the saint
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7147:105"/>
followed him euen to the sea side, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the salt water vp to the knees, &amp; in that place
offered his prayers most feruently to Christ, who
glorifyeth his elect that glorify him; hauing
made an end of his prayer, he returned to the
dry shoare, where sitting downe with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
he pronounced these fearefull wordes:
<hi>This miserable wretch, who hath this day misprised
Christ in his seruants, shall neuer returne to the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whence he departed, nor yet arriue to any other, but
shallbe drowned in the midst of the Ocean waues, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with his wicked complices.</hi> Which dreadful,
though iust prophecy of the saint, was fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in the presence of them all.</p>
                  <p>3. The glorious saint commended a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
noble man of Pictland, to the care of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
wealthy man, entreating him for his res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to entertaine him as a friend for the space of
some monthes. The cruell man, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the saints intreaty and commendations, put
the noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death within a few dayes, which
grieuous sinne when it came to the saints hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
he spoke in this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>That vnhappy man
hath not lyed to me but to God, his name shalbe blotted
out of the booke of life. This I say now in sommer but,
hefore he tast in Autumne of porke, that hath been fed

with accornes, he shall dye suddainly, and be buryed
in hell.</hi> The cursed wretch laughed to scorne the
Saints propheticall threatning: the haruest season
being now come, the wicked man commanded a
hogge fatted with accornes, and kirnelles of nuts
to be killed, and ordained that a peece thereof
should be rosted, so that by tasting of it he might
frustrate, and make voyde the oth of the Saints
prophecy. The flesh being rosted, the wretch
stretched out his hand to take a morsell of it, but
before he could put it into his mouth, he fell
downe dead, exhaling out his wicked soule to be
buryed in hel, they who heard, and saw this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
effect of Gods iustice, honoured Christ
in his holy prophet.</p>
                  <p>4. During the Saints abode in Pictland, he
preached by an interpreter to a certaine country
man, who imbraced the Christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few dayes, one of the countreymens sonnes
fell sicke to death, whereupon the Magitians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deride the man, to extoll the power of
their owne God, and to hit him in the teeth with
the weaknes of the God of the Christians. When
these thinges were made knowne to the Saint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inflamed thereat with the zeale of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he went together with his companions to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7147:107"/>
the house, where the comfortlesse parents, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
the doleful funeralles of their dead sonne.
The Saint seeing them drowned in sorrow, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
them with comfortable speaches, &amp; after
went himselfe all alone into the place, where the
dead corps lay, where falling prostrate on his
knees, and bathing his face in teares, he offered
his prayers to Christ, afterwardes he rose vp, &amp;
conuerting him to the dead, he sayd: <hi>In the name
of our Lord Iesus, returne to life, and stand vpon thy
feet.</hi> With that venerable voice of Gods true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
the soule returned to the body, and the
dead man opened his eyes, whome the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
saint tooke by the hand, raysing him vpon
his feet, and so brought him forth in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and restored him liuing to his parents: then
did the people giue a great shout, because sorrow
was conuerted into ioy, and the God of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
was glorifyed.</p>

Saint sayled securely, notwithstanding the tempest
raysed by the Magitian: as also how he opened

CHAP V.</head>
                  <p>AT the same tyme the venerable Prelate
made earnest suite to <hi>Brochan</hi> the Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
for the release of an Irish mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-slaue, but he
would not yeild to the saints mercifull request,
wherefore the Saint spoke to him as followeth.
<hi>Know, O Brochan, that vnles you dismisse, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
this strange captiue, that before I depart this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
you shall dye.</hi> This he sayd before King
<hi>Brudeus,</hi> and so departed towards the riuer <hi>Neyse,</hi>
out of which he tooke a white stone, saying to
his companions: <hi>Keepe this stone, by which God wil
worke many cures of diseased persons in that pagan
people.</hi> Hauing spoken this, he added: <hi>Now Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan
is smitten greuously; for an Angel sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen
striking him cruelly, broke the glasse, out of which he
drunke into many peeces, and left him euen ready to
dy, let vs expect heere two messingers sent vs from the
King, for to relieue in hast</hi> Brochan <hi>being at the point
of death; now</hi> Brochan <hi>is willing to dismisse the mayd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7147:108"/>
slaue.</hi> As the Saint was yet talking, loe the Kings
messengers came, who reported all what happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in manner and forme as the Saint foresaw
them: they added further, that the King, and his
Nobles sent vs to you, <hi>Vt subuenias nutritio eius
Brochano mox morituro,</hi> to help his nurse Brocha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
being ready to dye. With that the Saint sent two
of his companions to the King with the stone,
which he had blessed, saying: <hi>If Brochanus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to release the captiue, and after shall drinke of
the water, wherein this stone shalbe dipped, he shall
recouer his health, but if he doe not set the woman at
liberty, he shall dye without delay.</hi> Brochanus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
the woman free, and dranke of the water
wherein the stone was steeped, and so was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
perfectly to the health of his body.</p>
                  <p>2. After these thinges had passed in this
kind, <hi>Brochanus</hi> sayd to the glorious Saint. Tell
me, O <hi>Columbe,</hi> when do you intend to sayle. The
Saint answered: <hi>I purpose with Gods grace, to go to
sea within these three dayes.</hi> But you shal not quoth
<hi>Brochanus,</hi> for I can cause a contrary wind, and
besides, I can induce a darke, and obscure mist.
To whome the Saint answered: <hi>The power of God
ouer-ruleth all, in whose name all our actions are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</hi>
The Saint went the same day to the Riuer
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7147:109"/>
                     <hi>Neyse,</hi> whither he was attended vpon by a great
company. The Magitians began to reioyce at the
spreading abroad of the thicke mist, and boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
contrary wind. The holy Saint seeing the
elements to be stirred vp against him, called to
our Sauiour for his help; then ascending the ship
he caused the sayles to be hoysed vp, which being
done in sight of all the company, the ship sayled
extreame swiftly against the wind, and within a
little space the contrary winds, to the great asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of all, turned to serue the saint in his
voyage, so that hauing a pleasant gayle of wind
all day, the saint came towardes euening to the
wished hauen.</p>
                  <p>3. When the saint went first to King <hi>Brude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
court, the King being puffed vp with pride, &amp;
arrogancy, caused the gates of his Pallace to be
shut against him. Gods true seruant <hi>Columbe</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
therof, came to the gates, and first
in drawing the figure of Christs victorious signe
or crosse vpon the doores, and then after pulling
them with his handes, loe they opened of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and so the saint, and his holy family got
in. The King perceauing what had passed, went
forth to meet the holy man, and euer after had
him in great veneration. Another tyme being
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7147:109"/>
in Ireland, he went to visit the Monkes liuing in
the monastery of the <hi>Holy-field,</hi> the monkes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Saint to the church doore, where the
keyes could not be found, the Saint sayd: <hi>Our
Lord is able to open the doores of his house for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi>
And loe suddainly the leaues of the doore
opened wide, and so the Saint entered not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admiration of all the company.</p>
                  <p>4. Another time a very poore and needy
man came to the Saint, bemoning himselfe that
he had nothing wherewith to sustaine his wife &amp;
children: <hi>Goe</hi> (sayd he) <hi>and cut in the next woode a
longe pole, and bring it vnto me in haste.</hi> Which he
brought without delay, and sharpened it with
his owne handes, forming it into a sharp poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
spit, and blessing it likewise he deliuered it to
the poore man, saying: <hi>Keepe this spit, for so long
tyme as you inioy it, your house shall neuer want copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
prouision of venision.</hi> The poore man reioyced
not a little thereat, and returned home to his
house, then bringing the spit with him, he fixed
it in a place where wild beasts haunted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the next morning to see it, he found a great
stagge pierced therewith. Euery day he found a
stagge, Roe, or some other wilde beast stucke on
the spit, by meanes whereof he got such store of

that he was glad to sell great quantity
thereof to his neighbours; at last the man being
seduced by his wiues councell, cut the spit in
peeces, and burnt it, whereupon he fell into his
former want, and misery.</p>

CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>THE Saint being in the often mentioned I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of <hi>Hoy,</hi> he interrupted suddenly the
studdy of holy reading, and after a smilling ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
sayd: <hi>I must now hasten to pray in behalfe of a
poore kinswoman of myne, who existing in Ireland, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
often on the name of</hi> Columbe, <hi>hoping confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be deliuered from the bitter pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and griping conuulsions of child-birth wherewith
she is cruelly tormented.</hi> After making an end of
this speech, the B. Prelate of tender pitty to his
poore distressed kinswoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ranne to the church,
&amp; falling o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his knees, directed his ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayers
to our sweet Sauiour for the ease of the womans
distresse. After finishing his prayer, he went out
of the Oratory, saying: Our Lord Iesus who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7147:111"/>
to be borne of a woman, hath beene fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and propitious to this woman, whome he
hath eased of her anguishes; for she is safely
deliuered of a sonne. At the selfe same houre, the
saint prophecied in this kind, the afflicted woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
recouered her health, as it was after reported by
some that came out of Scotland.</p>
                  <p>2. When the holy man liued in the Iland
<hi>Rechrea,</hi> a certaine Peasant came to him, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that his wife would not lye in bed with
him. The Saint hearing therof, sent for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and spoke to her as followeth. <hi>Wherfore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
dost thou striue to put away thyne owne flesh, since
our Lord sayth: They shall be two in one flesh?</hi> The
woman made answere: All thinges you please to
commande me, how painefull soeuer they be, I
am willing to performe, this only excepted, that
you will not compell me to lie in bed with <hi>Lugne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
(so her husband was called) I doe not refuse to
take on me the care of all the house: or if you wil
haue it so, I am content to crosse the seas, &amp; liue
in a Monastery of holy virgins. <hi>What you propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi>
(replyed the saint) <hi>cannot be lawfully done, as long
as your husband liues.</hi> And added further: <hi>This day
will we three, your husband, your selfe, and I, fast &amp;
pray, for the happy successe of this affaire.</hi> So they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7147:112"/>
all three condescended with one accord to fast &amp;
pray. The night following, the Saint offered his
prayer deuoutly for them: the next morning he
called for the woman, saying: <hi>Tell vs, o woman,
whether this day you be of the same mind you were
yesterday, of going to liue in a monastery of women?</hi> I
know your prayers haue beene heard, for whome
I hated yesterday, I loue most tenderly this day,
my hart I know (by what meanes I know not) is
wholy changed in me. From that day forwards
to her last gaspe, her soule was linked with indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble
affection to her husband, so that she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
after refused to discharge the behoofes of a
wife.</p>
                  <p>3. The holy man <hi>Cormacus,</hi> of whome we
spoke in the first booke, laboured the second
tyme to find a wildernes in the Ocean, whome S.
<hi>Columbe</hi> commended to the King of the <hi>Orcades</hi>
in presence of King <hi>Brudeus,</hi> with whome the
Saint was at that tyme, and requested King <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi>
to do the same. This the Saint did, because
he knew by reuelation, that <hi>Cormacus</hi> after a long
and painefull nauigation, should be driuen to the
<hi>Orcades,</hi> and so he was, and for respect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
commendation, he escaped the danger of
death. As some of the Saints Monks fell in talke
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7147:112"/>
of <hi>Cormarus,</hi> saying it was not knowne, what issue
good or bad his nauigation had. The saint ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
them talking in this manner, and sayd:
<hi>Cormacus of whome you speake now, you shall see this
very day.</hi> And so within one houres space, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus</hi>
arriued to the great ioy and admiration of
all the company.</p>
                  <p>4. The third tyme that the sayd venerable
man <hi>Cormacus,</hi> attempted to find out a wildernes
in the sea, he fell into great dangers; for being
driuen by a strong south-wind that blew for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
dayes without intermission, he sayled into
the North seas, beyond the course and limits of
human nauigation, and in these vnknowne seas,
there arose most fearefull, and vnsupportable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments,
certaine vnseene and terrible beasts
assailed the shippe furiously, &amp; were euen ready
and like to pierce it through. With the sight of
these and other monsters, <hi>Cormacus</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
were so amated, &amp; amazed, that with tears
trickling downe their face, they addressed their
prayers to God, who alone is the most sure and
soueraigne refuge in all distresse. At the same
tyme, S. <hi>Columbe</hi> was present in spirit with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus,</hi>
he caused therefore a signe to be made for
to call the Monkes to the Oratory, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7147:113"/>
after his wonted manner, he sayd: <hi>Deere
brethren, pray most earnestly for</hi> Cormacus <hi>who now
sustaineth monstruous affrightments neuer seene before,
we ought therefore to conceaue a tender compassion on
our deare commembers, being in such manifest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and to pray to God for their comfort and safety.</hi>
After speaking this &amp; much more in this kind,
he fell downe prostrate on his knees before the
Altar, and with a pensiue hart and doleful voice,
besought the Omnipotent moderator of windes,
and waues for them: After prayer, he rose vp, &amp;
refrayning teares he ioyfully sayd: <hi>Let vs reioyce
with our deere brethren, for God hath conuerted the
south wind into a Northren gale, that wil deliuer them
out of all danger, and bring them safe hither.</hi> And
incontinently the south-wind ceased, and the
north began to blow. After many dayes <hi>Corma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
arriued safe, &amp; gladded all the company with
his presence. By this the Reader may coniecture,
how great the holy Abbot was in Gods eyes, who
could by inuocating on Christs name, command
the blustring windes, and swelling billowes. Let
this much suffice touching the miracls the Saint
wrought in this present life. Let the Reader fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Because, answeared he, that it appertaines to me

that the woman saw the robe to be drawen longer

with its ouerlarge dimensions, to couer moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

which voyce, the woman awaked. Another night
the childs foster-father, a Priest of a very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life, comming after masse out of the church,
found all the house illustrated with an immense

the holy infants face, at which strange sight he

a farre of, he rose vp in haste, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him. For which being reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by some of
the ancientest of the assembly, who asked him:
Why do not you feare to rise to honour an exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
person, and to embrace him? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
Had you knowne the thinges our Lord
hath vouchafed to manifest to me touching this
his faythfull seruant, you would neuer haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
him, whome our Lord doth not
only not excommunicate, but doth alwayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify
him more and more. And added further:
I saw a firy and brightsome piller going before
this man of God, whome you contemne, and
the Angels accompanying him along the fields.
I dare not therefore to contemne this man,
whome I see preordayned by God, to be the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of many that shall attaine to the immortall
life of glory. These things being sayd by him, al
the assembly honoured the Saint very much. As
<hi>S. Finnian</hi> the Saints master, saw him one day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to the place where himselfe resided,
he sayd to some that were present: Loe you see
<hi>S. Columbe</hi> comming, who hath merited to haue
an Angell for the companion of his iourney. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7147:115"/>
the same tyme the Saint, with twelue of his
disciples sayled into Brittany.</p>
                  <p>3. Whilest the Saint liued in the Iland of
<hi>Himbria,</hi> he fell into an extasis, wherein he saw an
Angell of our Lord sent to him, who held in his
hand the booke contayning the ceremonyes of
the enstalling of Kinges, which he offered to the
Saint, commanding him to read it: but when he
would not ordayne <hi>Aydanus</hi> King as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and commanded in the booke, in regard
he loued <hi>Iogenan, Aydans</hi> younger brother better,
the Angell suddainly stretching out his hand,
strucke the Saint with a whip (whose blew print,
or whaile, remayned on his side all the dayes of
his life) and added further: Know for certaine,
that I am sent to you, to cause you according as
is set downe in the booke, to ordayne <hi>Aydanus</hi>
King, and if you doe not not obey, I will strike
you againe. The Saint thereupon obeyed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction

in manner following, as recordeth <hi>Commeneus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.
I beleeue without all question, O King</hi> Aydan,
<hi>that none of your ennemyes shal be able to make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

to their sonnes, and nephewes; fearing otherwise that

their handes. For at what tyme soeuer they shal work
any harme to me, or to my kinsmen in Ireland, the
scourge I haue sustayned for your sake, shalbe turned
on them by the hand of our Lord, and they will leese
the harts of men, and their ennemyes shall insult ouer

                  <p>ONE of the Saints monkes, a Britton by
byrth, a man much giuen to the exercise
of good workes, fell sicke to death, and dyed.
The Saint saw the Angells, and Diuells fighting

preuayled, and conducted the soule to the
ioyes of Paradise. All this the saint tould one of
his Monkes, charging him not to reueale it all
the dayes of his life. Whilest the Saint liued in
<hi>Leinster</hi> to be trayned vp in wisedom, &amp; learning,
it fortuned that a wicked man, a cruell persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

her brother an old man, who was master to

the end that they might both iointly defend her
from the cruell persecutors hands; who came no
sooner to the place, but in their eyes he slue her
without regarding them any whit: whereat the
good old monke was so grieued and strucke with
anguish, that turning to <hi>S. Columbe</hi> he sayd: How
long, o holy youth Columbe, will God the iust
iudge suffer this wickednesse ioyned with our
dishonour, to passe vnpunished? The Saint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this iust, though dreadfull sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the flagitious murderer: <hi>The selfe same hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that the maydens soule shal ascend vp to heauen, his

blowen ouer many Churches of Scotland, to the

                  <p>2. A certaine pilgrime came to seiourne with
the Saint in the Ile of <hi>Hoy</hi> for some monethes, to
whome the Saint sayd: <hi>This day a certaine cleargie
man of your prouince, whose name I know not, is now
a carrying betweene the Angels to heauen.</hi> The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hearing this, began to muse with himselfe,
and to call to mind the mans name, so after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
while, he sayd to the saint: I know a seruant of
Christ named <hi>Diarmitius,</hi> who built him a little
monastery in the selfe same territory, wherein I
kept my residence. <hi>It is the selfe same party you
name,</hi> answered the Saint, <hi>whome the celestiall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
bring to the ioyes of Paradise.</hi> Neyther is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligently
to be obserued, how that the glorious
Saint kept from the notice of men, many secrets
that were reuealed to him, and this for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as himselfe signifyed to a few of his monks.
First to auoyde ostentation, and selfe esteeme:
secondly to auoyd the molestation that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
would put him in, inquiring after seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
affaires, and matters.</p>
                  <p>3. Another tyme the saint sought in the
woodes, a solitary place vnfrequented by men, &amp;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7147:117"/>
commodious for the exercise of holy prayer; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he began to pray, suddenly he saw an vgly and
deformed army of Diuells, to fight against him
with Iron spits, who intended, as the Saint knew
by the inward illustration of the holy Ghost, to
assaile his monastery, &amp; to kill with their poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
stakes, many of his monkes. But he albeit all
alone, tooke <hi>S. Pauls</hi> armour, and fought coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
against the whole host of his infernal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries:
and so the conflict continued for the
most part of the day, neither could they ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
him, nor yet he driue them out of his Ile, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the Angells came to his helpe, whose terrour
made the Diuels depart. After their departure,
the saint prophecyed, how they would inuade
the monasteryes of <hi>Ethica,</hi> and inflict pestilent
diseases on the inhabitants, wherof many would
dye. Within two dayes likewise the saint fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould,
how <hi>Bathaneus</hi> by the help of prayers and
fasts, preserued his monastery from their inuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in so much, that none dyed but one.</p>
                  <p>4. In the middle region of Ireland, liued a
certaine Smith, a man much addicted to almes
deeds, and other good workes: when this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Artizan came to the finall period of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
life, the Saint spoke to a few that were about
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7147:117"/>
him in this manner. <hi>The Smith did not labour in
vaine, who with the labour of his handes, hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
euerlasting rewardes, his soule is now carryed
by the Angels, to the ioyes of the heauenly Country.</hi>
Another tyme did he see the soule of a poore, but
very holy woman, comming in company of the
Angells to meete her husbands soule at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
and this he made knowne to one of his
Monkes named <hi>Genereus,</hi> a Saxon by birth.</p>

                     <hi>ANother tyme likewise, whilest the saint
siued in the Ile of</hi> Hoy, <hi>in the morning ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earely, he called vpon his familiar tender</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armitius,
<hi>and sayd to him:</hi> Let the sacred miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
of the Eucharist be made ready in all haste; for
this day is the deposition of S. Brendan. <hi>Why (quoth</hi>
Diarmitius) <hi>doe you command such solemnityes
of masses to be made ready this day, seeing none
came out of Ireland that might bring vs newes
of that holy mans death?</hi> Goe, <hi>sayd the Saint,</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7147:118"/>
obey my word, for this last night I saw the heauens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and quires of Angels descending downe to meet S.
<hi>Brendans</hi> soule, with whose bright and incomparable
splendour, the compasse of al the world was enlightned
and illustrated.</p>
                  <p>2. Another day also, as the monkes put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in a readinesse for the seueral works of the
monastery, the saint co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them to rest that
day, &amp; to make ready the furniture of the sacred
oblation, and their portions to be encreased as
on Sunday. For sayd he, albeit I be altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
yet must I this day celebrate the sacred
mysteryes of the Eucharist, in honour of that
soule which this night hath been carryed among
the holy quires of Angells, to the interminable
ioyes of Paradise. These things being spoken, the
Religious obeyed very promptly, and all thinges
for the celebrating of the diuine seruice were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
After they went with their holy Abbot
to the Church, where after singing part of the
office, they came to the Hymne where mention
is made of <hi>S. Martin.</hi> The Saint sayd to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
<hi>This day you must sing of Columbanus the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe.</hi>
Then all the Monkes who were present,
vnderstood <hi>Columbanus</hi> the Bishop of Leynster
<hi>S. Columbs</hi> deare friend, to be translated to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7147:118"/>
life. Within a few dayes, there came out of
Leynster, who reported that he departed the self
same night, that his death was reuealed to the
Saint.</p>
                  <p>3. Another tyme, when the Saint sate wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in his cell, his face was suddenly altered, &amp;
he pronounced this voyce from his pure breast:
<hi>Helpe, helpe:</hi> two brothers who stood at the doore,
to wit, <hi>Colgus</hi> and <hi>Lugneus,</hi> demanded the cause of
that suddaine voice? To whome the venerable
Abbot made this answeare: <hi>I commanded an Angel
of our Lord, who stood with you, to succour one of the
brothers falling downe from the toppe of a great house
that is now building in the monastery of the</hi> Oaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.
The Saint added further: <hi>Very admirable,
and scarce ineffable is the quicknesse of the angelicall
motion; for that heauen-dweller, who flew away from
vs when yonder man began to fall, as it were in the
shutting of an eye, preuented him before he touched the
earth, neither could the party that fell, feele ane bruse
or payne.</hi> O how stupendious is this most swift,
and oportune subuention, that could so speedily
be performed, such spaces of sea and land lying
in the way?</p>
                  <p>4. The Saint on a tyme, called all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
togeather, and straightly charged them in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7147:119"/>
this manner. <hi>I meane to go out all alone to the western
field of this Ile, let none therfore presume to follow me.</hi>
They all obeyed excepting one brother, who
went another way, and hid himselfe on the top
of a little hillocke, whence he might espy the
cause of the Saints solitary retyre, whom the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
brother saw standing on a little hill
with his hands and eyes cast towardes heauen: &amp;
lo suddenly a strange thing appeared, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels the inhabitants of the heauenly citty,
being all white, flow downe, and enuironed the
Saint as he prayed, and after some conference
with him, that heauenly squadron returned soon
againe to their heauenly mansions. The Saint
likewise after that angelicall meeting returned to
the monastery, and calling all the company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
againe, not without a seuere reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he began to examine which of them had tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
against his commandement. The guilty
party being not able to conceale what he had
done, fell prostrate before the saint, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his fault, &amp; begging pardon very humbly.
The saint brought him aside, &amp; with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
charged him not to reueale the matter
all the dayes of his life. By this we may wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture,
the many apparitions, and angelic all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations,

the grace of the holy Ghost so copiously desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
on him, that remayning the space of three entire
dayes lockt vp in his cell, he was so replenished
during that tyme with diuine light, that he did
neyther eate, or permitted any to come at him,
In the night two beames of immense brightnes,
issued out at the chinckes of the doore, and holes
of the locke: he was likewise heard to sing, most
sweet and ineffable verses; many secrets that were
hidden from the knowledge of men, since the
beginning of the world, were manifested to him;
the eyes of his most pure hart, pierced into the
difficultyes of the most obscure and abstruse pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

in the loue of God, entred the Church one night
all alone, &amp; sat him downe to pray in one of the
oratories. Within the space as it were of an houre
<hi>S.</hi> Columbe likewise entred the sayd holy house,

so astonished and terrifyed, that no strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned

called on <hi>Virgnous,</hi> speaking these comfortable
wordes to him: <hi>O my little child, you haue pleased
almighty God much yesternight by casting your eyes on
the earth; for had you not done so, your eyes had beene
blinded with the lustre of that diuine light: beware you
neuer bring this diuine visitation to the knowledge of

saint admonished the next day, not to speake of
it to any, all his life tyme.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Another tyme the saint charged one of
his disciples named</hi> Brochanus: Beware my sonne,
you approach not this night to my cell, as you are wont.
<hi>Who notwithstanding the saints forbidding,
went to the doore, and looked in at the key-hole,
thinking with himselfe, as it fell out, that the
saint had within some heauenly vision; for at that
tyme the saints little lodging was replenished

speaking to him in this manner:</hi> My sonne, you
haue sinned before God, this last night, in thinking it
possible to conceale your crafty prying, for if the holy
Ghost did not, yet I behould you comming &amp; returning

cause of that sad, &amp; strange alteration, to whom
he spoke in this manner:</hi> Loe to this present day;

and to call me to his heauenly mansion, &amp; this
was the cause of my ioy; for I saw the Angels sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the throne of glory, to meet my soule after its departure
out of my body: &amp; loe being now suddenly stayd, they
stand on the rocke at further side of our sea, &amp; would

his face to the Orient, he blessed the Iland
with all the inhabitants. From that tyme for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the Iland was neuer molested with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
of vipers: within a few dayes after, whilest
the masses were a celebrating, as the Saint eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp his gracious countenance, it was suddenly
dyed with a most delectable and liuely rednes;
for at that houre, he saw the Angell of our Lord
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7147:122"/>
flitting vp and downe in the Oratory, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the admirable aspect of an Angel instilleth
ioy into the harts of the elect, the Saint therfore
here abounded with ioy: and when some that
were present enquired after the cause of his ioy,
he answered: <hi>Loe an Angell of our Lord, sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a certaine depositum very deere to God, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, and after looking downe ouer vs, and
blessing vs, departed.</hi> None of them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
vnderstood what depositum was that the
Angell came for. But our holy Patron called his
owne soule which God committed to his charge
by the name of depositum, which he rendred
vp within six dayes after.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>On the next Saturday, the holy Abbot,
and his faythfull tender</hi> Diarmitius, <hi>went out to
blesse a Barne, where the Saint seeing two heaps
of grayne, sayd:</hi> I congratulate much with my mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
for if I must needs depart; this yeare, they haue
sufficient prouision. Diarmitius <hi>hearing this senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
became very heauy: you constristate vs so
often this yeare, because you speake so often of
your departure: to whome he sayd.</hi> I will acquaint
you with a secret touching my death, so that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
faythfully not to disclose it before I dye. Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius
<hi>gaue him his faithfull word and promise.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7147:123"/>
Then the glorious Saint added:</hi> This day in the
sacred volumes, is called Sabbaoth, that is interprettd
rest, and truly this day is a Sabbaoth to me, because it
is the last of my laborious life, wherein after the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of my trauailes, I sabbaoth, and this next ensuing
midnight of the venerable Sunday, I shall be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the holy Fathers; for now our Lord Iesus vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chsafeth
to inuite me, to whome I shal depart at night,
as himselfe hath reuealed to me. <hi>After this he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
backe towardes the Monastery; In the way
he ascended a little mountaine ouerlooking the
monastery, &amp; standing on the top of the hill, &amp;
eleuating his handes, he blessed his monastery,
saying:</hi> The Kinges not only of Scotland with their
subiects, but euen the Kinges of foraine nations with
their vassalls, will honor much this place, though it be
now narrow and despiseable: and the Saints of other
Churches, will giue no small veneration to it.</p>

CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>AFTER he had bestowed his sacred bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7147:123"/>
he returned to his monastery, and sate
him downe to write the Psalter, and comming to
that verse of the 33. Psalme: <hi>Inquirentes Dominum
non minuentur omni bono. They that seeke after our
Lord, shall not be diminished of any good.</hi> Here must
I pause in the end of this page. Let <hi>Bathaneus</hi>
write what followeth: The last verse which the
Saint wrote, befitteth him very much, since he
shall neuer be depriued of the interminable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of heauen, and the subsequent verse: <hi>Come
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare me, I wil teach you the feare of our Lord,</hi>
becommeth his successor <hi>Bathaneus,</hi> as being his
successor, not only in the office of teaching, but
also in the charge in writing. After the Saint had
giuen a stoppe to his pen at the foresayd verse, he
entred into the Church, to heare sundayes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
masse, which being done, he came backe
to his cell, and sate in his bed, where he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed
of a bed, a bare stone, and another stone in
lieu of a bolster; sitting in that place he bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
to his ghostly children, these his last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in the hearing only of <hi>Diarmitius.</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to you my children, these my last wordes:
conserue true and vnfained charity and peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and if you obserue this, according to
the example of the Saints, God the comforter
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7147:124"/>
of the good, will help you: and I being with him
will intercede for you, and he will affoarde you,
both what you all want in this life, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the ioyes which are prepared for them that
keepe his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>2. After finishing these sacred documents,
the glorious Saint held his peace: at midnight
when the bell rung to matines, he rose, &amp; going
sooner then any of the company to the Church,
he fell downe on his knees before the Altar. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armitius</hi>
following slowly after, saw all the church
illustrated with Angelicall splendour, which
at his approach disappeared; entring in therfore
into the Church, he called oft to the Saint with
a weeping voice, saying: <hi>O father, where are you?</hi>
And so groping vp and downe in the darke, he
found him lying prostrate before the Altar. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armitius</hi>
sate him downe by the Saint, and laid his
head in his sacred lappe, in the meane tyme the
Monkes came, who seeing their holy Father rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to dye, began to lament: euen at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
of the separation of his soule, as we heard
from some who were eye-witnesses, he looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him with a viuacious and pleasant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
contemplating the holy Angells that
came to fetch him. Then <hi>Diarmitius</hi> tooke vpp
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7147:124"/>
his holy hand to blesse his mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks: the Saint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
did what he coule to moue his hand to giue
them his blessing, with the motion thereof since
he could not performe it with the voice of his
mouth: after this his sacred benediction giuen
in this kind, the Saint yeilded vp suddenly his
happy soule. The Angelicall sight left such a
cheerefullnesse remayning in his countenance,
that it seemed rather the sweete aspect of one cast
in a pleasant slumber, then the ghostly sight of a
dead corse. Heere we will relate some visions,
which certaine holy men had at that very houre
of the Saints happy passage. In a certaine Irish
monastery, there liued a very holy and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seruant of Christ, named <hi>Lugildius,</hi> who was
both wise and iust: this holy monke not without
great sorrow, related to a deere companion of
his, a man of no lesse holy conuersation, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vision he had: This last midnight <hi>S. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbe,</hi>
the piller of many Churches, departed to
the immortall ioyes of heauen, and I saw in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
all the Ile of <hi>Hoy</hi> where I neuer was in person,
illustrated with celestiall and angelicall bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; al the spaciousnes of the ayre was to the
skyes, enlightned with the splendour of Angels.
Angels were sent that descended to conduct his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7147:125"/>
holy soule to euerlasting rest. I heard likewise
most sweet hymnes and harmonious canticles,
that resounded melodiously at the same tyme:
this angelicall manifestation <hi>Virgnous</hi> learnt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the mouth of the foresayd holy old man.</p>
                  <p>3. Another ancient and religious seruant
of Christs, and a holy monke named <hi>Ferrelus,</hi>
related to me <hi>Adamnanus,</hi> with no small protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and asseueration of the truth thereof, this
ensuing vision. That night of <hi>S. Columbes</hi> happy
passage out of this life, I, and others with me
being fishing in the fishy riuer <hi>Fende,</hi> we saw all
the region of the ayre suddenly illustrated: being
much moued with the suddennesse of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
we conuerted our eyes to the East, and loe
there appeared as it were a great fiery piller, that
ascending to heauen wards, seemed to illuminate
all the world, as a summers day, or meridian
Sunne: and when that pillar had penetrated the
heauens, then darkenesse ensued as after the Sun
set, neither did the vision appeare to vs alone,
for many other fishers that were vp and downe
about the riuer, beheld it: these visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s appearing
at the very houre of our Patrons departur, make
remonstrance of the glory he inioyeth before
God. Now let vs returne thether, from whence
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7147:125"/>
we haue digressed.</p>
                  <p>4. The matins office being ended, his holy
body was carryed back with sweet symphony of
psalmes to his little lodging: his obsequies were
solemnized with no lesse honour then deuotion,
for the space of three dayes, and three nights;
which time being spent in the diuine prayses, the
body of our glorious Patron, wrapped in cleane
syndons, was interred in a decent tombe, with
great veneration. Heere we thinke not amisse to
tell what the Saint had prophecied touching the
foresayd three dayes of his exequies. On a tyme
one of the Monkes after a simple manner, sayd
to the venerable Abbot: It is thought, that all
the people of these prouinces will sayle hether
to this Iland of <hi>Hoy,</hi> to celebrate your funeralls.
My sonne, answeared the Saint, it shall not
be as you say; for the vulgar sort, shall not be
able by any meanes to come to my obsequies,
only my owne familiar monkes shal accomplish
my funerall rights and duties. Which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
prenunciation, the diuine Omnipotence,
put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for during the three dayes of his
holy funeralls, so boisterous a wind blew, that it
was not possible for any to go to sea: but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
after the Saints sepulture, the wind ceased
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7147:126"/>
and the sea became calme; such then was the end
of our glorious Patrons life, such were the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
beginning of his merits, who is admitted into
the society of the glorious Patriarkes, of the holy
Apostles, of the sacred Martyrs, and immaculate
Virgins, by the fauour of our sweet Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
To whome togeather with the Father, and
the holy Ghost, be all praise, honour, vertue &amp;
glory, world without end, Amen.</p>
