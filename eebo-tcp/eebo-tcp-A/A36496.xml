         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

out of the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the <hi>Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the High and Mighty Lords <hi>Eſtates General</hi>
of the <hi>

Sir <hi>George Downing, Envoy Extraordinary</hi> from the
King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi>]</hi> did not at all think it fit for
him to take any notice thereof, but to paſs it by as
a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> (of which ſort there come out too
many here every day:) in regard that no ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44130:3"/>
had been communicated to <hi>Him</hi> by their
<hi>Lordſhips,</hi> nor any one word given him in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to
his ſaid <hi>Memorial:</hi> And he had accordingly paſt it
by, without taking any notice thereof, had he not
ſince by accident been informed by ſeveral <hi>Publick
Miniſters</hi> reſiding here, that the ſaid pretended <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi>
had been brought to them by the <hi>Agent de
Heyde;</hi> Whereupon he now holds Himſelf obliged
to <hi>Complain</hi> in moſt ſerious terms to their <hi>Lordſhips</hi>
the <hi>Eſtates General</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> of this
ſtrange and irregular way of proceeding; That
while he is Reſiding here on the behalf of the
<hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter:</hi> Papers, in form of <hi>Anſwers</hi> to his
<hi>Memorials,</hi> ſhould be given to <hi>other Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
here</hi> and <hi>elſewhere,</hi> and ſent all over the
World, and yet concealed from <hi>Him;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
neither opportunity of being convinced, if any
thing of reaſon ſhould have been ſaid therein, nor
on the contrary of vindicating the Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the King his Maſter in what he is therein
unjuſtly charged and defamed withall.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that he the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi>
ſhould have proceeded in that manner, and have
given the <hi>Memorial</hi> (to which the ſaid Paper is a
Reply) to all <hi>Publick Miniſters</hi> reſiding here; and
have ſent it to all Courts abroad, and ſhould have
<hi>Printed,</hi> and expoſed it to the view of the World,
without giving it to their Lordſhips, what would
they have thought thereof? and what might have
been expected that they would have ſaid to it?
Can their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> imagine that this way of acting
doth tend any way to the Juſtifying of their <hi>Cauſe,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44130:3"/>
as to the working of better impreſſions concerning
the ſame in the minds of thoſe <hi>Publick Miniſters,</hi> or
their <hi>Maſters?</hi> Or rather, that they muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ſcandalized thereat, as looking more
like a <hi>Surprize</hi> of them and their Judgments, then
otherwiſe; and conſidering that they may to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
be dealt with in like manner, in relation to any
Paper they may give in; and ſee the Affairs of
their Maſters traduced and defamed without
any opportunity or poſſibility of clearing the
ſame.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the ſaid Paper; Is it
enough to ſay in general terms, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<hi>was ill grounded, or abuſively informed,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
particularizing at all <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>wherein;</hi> or ſo
much as excepting againſt any one word thereof,
much leſs diſproving the ſame.</p>
            <p>And again; If the things wherewith they are
charged therein be <hi>true</hi> (as they both are, and
muſt now be taken by all men to be, ſince nothing
is made out by their Lordſhips to the contrary) To
what purpoſe is the whole ſequel of the ſaid Paper?
If it be true (as it is) That the <hi>Royal Maſter</hi> of the
ſaid <hi>Envoy</hi> was no ſooner returned to His Kingdoms,
but that he was immediately, and from day to day
troubled and importuned with a Crowd of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of His Subjects againſt thoſe of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
all which notwithſtanding, His Majeſty
did not grant any one <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Marque,</hi> nor
betake himſelf to any way of <hi>force</hi> for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their reparation and ſatisfaction; But in
ſtead thereof, for an Everlaſting memorial of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44130:4"/>
great kindneſs and good will towards this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and for the facilitating of the bringing to a
Concluſion the late <hi>Treaty</hi> with them, (finding
the <hi>Complaints</hi> and <hi>Pretenſions</hi> of his Subjects to
be ſo numerous and great,) was pleaſed after all
to ſuffer very many of them, and thoſe to a vaſt
value, to be utterly mortified and extinguiſhed;
and the reſt (except the buſineſs of the Ships <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadventure,</hi>
and <hi>Bon-Eſperanza)</hi> after ſo much
mony and time had been already expended in the
purſuit thereof, and many of them ready for a
determination, to be put in a LIST, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon anew according to the fifteenth <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
thereof; no ways doubting, but that all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſpeed would have thereupon been uſed in
bringing the matter to an iſſue, and that for
the future better order would have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
towards His Subjects: But having waited now
above 27 <hi>months</hi> ſince the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the ſaid
<hi>Treaty;</hi> and in that time their Lordſhips being
continually call'd upon by His Said Majeſties
<hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> yea by His Majeſty himſelf
in ſeveral <hi>Audiences</hi> to their <hi>Embaſſador;</hi> Yet ſo
it is, that thoſe matters are ſtill ſo far from being
ended, that in truth they ſeem to be now rather
further from it then at the day of the <hi>ſigning</hi> of
the ſaid <hi>Treaty;</hi> and on the other ſide, new injuries
daily heaped, and the ſame deſigns of the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
and <hi>Weſt-Indie-Companies</hi> carried on for the utter
overthrow of all the <hi>Trade</hi> of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in thoſe parts of the world, as appeared by the
buſineſs of the Ships <hi>Hopewell, Leopard,</hi> and other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44130:4"/>
Ships in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and by the buſineſs of the
<hi>Charles, James, Mary, Sampſon, Hopeful Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
Speedwell,</hi> &amp;c. upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa:</hi>
All which are matters hapned ſince the <hi>Concluſion</hi>
of the ſaid <hi>Treaty.</hi> And after all this, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
His <hi>Parliaments</hi> application to Him
upon the account of His aggrieved Subjects, in ſo
ſolemn and extraordinary a manner; His Majeſty
was yet ſo far from being inclined to any other
then ways of accommodation, as that he did by a
publick Writing, or <hi>Declaration</hi> declare, That he
would yet try what could be done by amicable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> before he would make uſe
of any other means; (the which was alſo very
well known to their Lordſhips) and did thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
accordingly give orders to his <hi>Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
to preſs them afreſh: And further to make
out his peaceable and moderate intentions, and to
take off all <hi>umbrage</hi> from their Lordſhips, to let
them know, (as accordingly he did in publick
Conferences with their Deputies) That His Majeſty
would not in any kind trouble their Fleets which
they then expected from the <hi>Streights,</hi> and
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> nor their <hi>Fiſheries</hi> upon His Coaſts;
Yea, further to put them out of all doubt, ordered
a far leſs equipage of Shipping for the <hi>Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi>
then had been known theſe many years;
but all this was ſo far from working the deſired and
intended effect, as that on the contrary their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
betook themſelves to Arms in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner, ordering the fitting out with all ſpeed
a great <hi>Fleet,</hi> and <hi>hundreds</hi> of <hi>Carpenters</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44130:5"/>
diſpatched to work upon it night and day,
(holy days as well as working days); whereby His
Majeſty ſeeing himſelf wholly defeated of His good
intentions, and inſtead of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
braved and threatned with thoſe <hi>equipages,</hi>
which could have no other regard but upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
was at laſt inforced for His own defenſe,
(though very much contrary to His inclinations
and intentions) to arm alſo.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be pretended, as if their
<hi>Lordſhips</hi> having fitted <hi>Their Fleet,</hi> did deſire that
His Majeſty would be pleaſed, (for avoyding of
all inconveniences) to keep <hi>His Fleet</hi> within His
<hi>Harbours,</hi> and that then they would keep in <hi>Theirs</hi>
alſo; It is to be Conſidered, that <hi>This Propoſition
was not made until that they had actually put to Sea,
a Fleet near as numerous as the whole that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was equipping, and which was actually gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
His Coaſts;</hi> ſo that this could not but be
conſtrued to be rather a <hi>mocquerie,</hi> then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
for that thereby they had a Fleet at Sea to
do what they pleaſed, and in the mean while His
Majeſty had tyed His own hands and obliged Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to keep within doors; but he was yet pleaſed to
aſſure them, that His (if it did go out) ſhould
not do them the leaſt Injury; ſtill in the mean
while preſſing here at the <hi>Hague</hi> by His <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>
and Himſelf urging their <hi>Ambaſsador</hi> at
<hi>London,</hi> to haſten the diſpatch of the matters in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
And as a further teſtimony of His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of living in good Correſpondence with <hi>This
Country,</hi> He did declare His willingneſs to enter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44130:5"/>
into a <hi>Treaty</hi> for the better regulating of the Trade
and Navigation of both, and the prevention of
ſuch diſorders for the future; and for the quicker
diſpatch and ripening of ſo good a work, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thereof was in His Name tendred to them
long ago, and yet to this day not one word of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
thereupon.</p>
            <p>And if it be alſo <hi>true,</hi> (as it is) that their <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>
began the <hi>ſeizing</hi> of Ships in theſe Parts;
ſtopping the Ship from <hi>Gottenburg</hi> bound for
<hi>London,</hi> and though preſſed again and again to ſet
her at liberty, yet ſtill retain'd her, and to this
day not ſo much as a word of anſwer why or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what account.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, can there be any doubt
who is the <hi>Attacquer</hi> or <hi>Aggreſſor,</hi> unleſs it muſt
be held for a <hi>Maxim,</hi> That let their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> and
<hi>Their Subjects</hi> deal with his afore-ſaid Majeſty and
His Subjects from time to time and from year to

never ſo many years ſufferings, and all amicable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
firſt tryed to have obtained their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
without to this very day having been

of <hi>piracy</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> committed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>This Country</hi> againſt them, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
hath been made from time to time unto
their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> by His Majeſties <hi>Miniſter:</hi> If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, any thing be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> done by them towards the

and reputed the <hi>Attacquer</hi> and the <hi>Aggreſſor.</hi> Let
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44130:6"/>
their Lordſhips make out, That the complaints in
the ſaid <hi>Memorial</hi> are ungrounded, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will yield unto them: but if otherwiſe, Who
will think it ſtrange if at laſt ſomething be done
towards the righting of them.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Particulars</hi> mentioned in the ſaid
Paper to have been ſuffered by them from the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> though thoſe matters have not been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of between their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Envoy
Extraordinary,</hi> but between the King his <hi>Master</hi>
and their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> ſo that it is
not properly his buſineſs to reply thereunto, but to
refer them to that anſwer which his Majeſty hath
promiſed to give concerning the ſame; yet ſeeing
their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> have been pleaſed not only to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and inſiſt thereupon in the afore-ſaid <hi>paper,</hi> but
indeed to ſay nothing elſe by way of <hi>anſwer</hi> to the
<hi>complaints</hi> in his <hi>Memorial,</hi> he cannot but ſay thus
much thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">That the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> ſaid to be taken from
them, were all belonging to the <hi>Weſt-Indie-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
of <hi>this Country;</hi> and nothing complain'd of in
the paper to have been taken from them belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any elſe of <hi>Theſe Countries;</hi> And when it
ſhall be conſidered, that in the LIST of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
alone, there appears to have been near <hi>twenty
Engliſh Ships</hi> ſucceſſively, within a very few years
before the concluſion of the late <hi>Treaty,</hi> taken in a
hoſtile manner upon the <hi>Coaſt</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> only
by the Shipping of the ſaid <hi>Weſt-Indie-Company,</hi>
with their whole Lading, to a very great value;
and not onely ſo, but the men that belonged to</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44130:6"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">them, very many of them moſt barbarouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly

midſt of their own excrements, nothing but bread
and water given them, and thereof not enough to
ſuſtein Nature, their Bodies tortured with
exquiſite and horrid tortures; and when
any of them dyed, the living and the dead left
together, and ſuch as eſcaped, turned out to periſh
by hunger, or wild beaſts in thoſe miſerable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
or to be carry'd away Captives by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
by which means, ſeveral <hi>hundreds</hi> of his
Majeſties good Subjects have periſhed and been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
And to this hour, notwithſtanding all ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
and endeavours, not one penny of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

the ſaid Ships; And ever ſince the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the

they have not proceeded ſo far as to take more of
the Shipping of his Majeſtie's Subjects, yet they
have done that which is equivalent, and as ruinous
to that Trade; ſtopping and hindring every one
that they met withall from all Commerce, and to
that effect purſuing them in an hoſtile manner from
place to place: And where-ever any <hi>Engliſh</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored

concerning which alſo <hi>Proofs</hi> have been ſince given
to their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi>
ſo that there was an abſolute neceſſity impos'd
upon his Majeſty and his Subjects, either of looſing
all that had been actually taken from them, and
withall abandoning for ever that Trade it ſelf, or
otherwiſe of betaking themſelves to ſome other
wayes for their relief. And it will rather be
thought ſtrange that their patience did hold out
ſo long, then that now at laſt ſomething ſhould be
done, towards the righting of themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, as to the buſineſs of <hi>Capo Corco,</hi> did not
the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> long agoe complain
in the name, and by Order of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi>
in <hi>Publick Conferences</hi> both with the <hi>Deputies</hi> of
their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> the <hi>Eſtates General,</hi> and alſo with
thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> of the injurious poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
and keeping of that place by thoſe of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44130:7"/>
ſaid <hi>Weſt-Indie-Company,</hi> deducing and remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at large his Maſters Right thereunto, the <hi>ground</hi>
having been bought by <hi>His Subjects,</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>That Country</hi> for a valuable conſideration, and
a <hi>Lodge</hi> or <hi>Factory</hi> built thereupon; and thoſe of
the <hi>Weſt-Indie-Company</hi> of <hi>this Country</hi> being got
into the poſſeſſion of the place, meerly by <hi>fraud</hi>
and <hi>treachery;</hi> but no reflection made thereupon
by their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> much leſs any hopes given of
ever obtaining any reſtitution thereof from them.
And indeed, if His Majeſty had not been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
out of their hands the leaſt Boat, or peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
of Goods ſince His return to His Kingdoms,
(concerning which) complaint had been made by
His <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,</hi> of its being forceably
taken by them from His Subjects,) what hopes of
their quitting to him any ſuch place, eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that buſineſs of the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Poleroon</hi> in
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which hath been a reſtoring by
them ever ſince the year 1622. at which time it was
by <hi>ſolemn</hi> and <hi>particular Treaty</hi> promiſed to be
done; and again, by <hi>another Treaty,</hi> in the year 1654.
and by Orders of the <hi>Estates General</hi> and <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die-Company</hi>
of this Country, in the year 1661. and
again, by <hi>Treaty</hi> in the year 1662. and yet to this
day we know nothing of its being delivered; and
can it be thought ſtrange, if invited thereunto by
the <hi>King</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Country,</hi> that His Majeſty ſhould
after ſo fair warning condeſcend to ſuffer His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to endeavour to repoſſeſs themſelves thereof?</p>
            <p>And as to the buſineſs of <hi>New-Netherland</hi> (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
this is very far from being a ſurprize, or any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44130:8"/>
thing of that nature, it being notoriouſly known,
that <hi>That ſpot of Land</hi> lyes within the limits, and is
part of the poſſeſſion of His Subjects of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(as appears moſt evidently by their <hi>Charter)</hi>
and that thoſe few <hi>Dutch</hi> that have lived there, have
lived there meerly upon connivence and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and not as having any right thereunto;
and that this hath from time to time, and from
year to year been declared unto them, but
yet ſo as that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were contented to
ſuffer them to remain there, provided they
would demean themſelves peaceably and quietly;
but that the ſaid <hi>Dutch,</hi> not contenting themſelves
therewith, did ſtill endeavour to incroach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and further upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> impoſing their
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> and endeavouring to raiſe
<hi>Contributions</hi> and <hi>Exciſes</hi> upon them, and in places
where no <hi>Dutch</hi> were or had ever been; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they have formerly been neceſſitated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times to ſend Souldiers for the repelling of
them.</p>
            <p>And as to what is ſaid in the ſaid Paper, as if
though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould formerly have had any
<hi>pretence</hi> to the ſaid place, that yet the ſaid <hi>pretence</hi>
is cut off by the fifteenth <hi>Article</hi> of the late <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
To this he doth Reply, That <hi>That Article</hi> doth
only cut off matters of <hi>Pyracies, Robberies,</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
but as to the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Inheritances</hi> of
<hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Juriſdictions,</hi> that it doth not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
or intermeddle with the ſame. And that this is
ſo, there needs no other Argument but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of ſeveral <hi>Examples</hi> out of their own
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44130:8"/>
               <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> whereby it will appear that indeed as
to the Plundering and Taking of Ships, or the like,
that all ſuch cauſes (if hapned before the time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſaid <hi>Treaty)</hi> did ceaſe upon the Concluſion
thereof; but as to ſuch as were then depending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Inheritances</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> that they have ſtill
continued to be purſued: As for Example, the
Caſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Lower,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> for
certain <hi>Lands</hi> claimed by him in <hi>Zealand.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
thoſe of <hi>New Neather-Lands,</hi> had ſince the
<hi>Concluſion</hi> of the Late <hi>Treaty,</hi> made new <hi>Incurſions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and given them many new <hi>Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and by their <hi>Charters</hi> they have <hi>Jura Belli</hi> within
Themſelves, without <hi>Appealing</hi> firſt into <hi>Europe;</hi> And
if after all this, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath ſuffered them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto to reſcue themſelves from ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Vexations and Miſchiefs; Can <hi>Any Prince</hi>
think it ſtrange, or be ſurprized thereat, much leſſe
<hi>the moſt Chriſtian King?</hi> (For whoſe Satisfaction this
Paper ſeems to be more particularly Calculated:)
Whereas <hi>He hath been pleaſed this very ſame year, to
Order or Suffer</hi> (with his Privity) His Subjects <hi>to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe
themſelves in like manner by Force and Armes, of a
certain Place called</hi> Cayenne, <hi>which they pretend to have
been wrongfully poſſeſſed and kept from them by the ſame</hi>
Weſt Indie Company.</p>
            <p>And as to the buſineſs of <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their Ships, and what elſe is alleadged to have
been done in thoſe parts (except that of <hi>Cabo-Corco:</hi>)
'Twas but in the month of <hi>June last,</hi> that the firſt
Complaint was made thereof to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and did
he not immediately return for Anſwer, That he had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44130:9"/>
given no Order or Direction to <hi>Captain Holmes,</hi> the
Perſon complained of, for the doing thereof; That he
did expect him Home very ſpeedily, and that upon
his Return, he would cauſe thoſe matters to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and Right to be done them, and the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
puniſhed? And did not the ſaid <hi>Envoy Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
upon the <hi>Twenty Seventh day</hi> of <hi>July laſt</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a <hi>Memoriall</hi> to them to the like Effect? And
could more be ſaid or done for their Satisfaction?
Yea could their <hi>Lordſhips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Themſelves within their
own Countries demand more of any of their <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,</hi>
or moſt <hi>Inferiour Court of Juſtice?</hi> And doth not
the <hi>Fourteenth Article</hi> of the <hi>Late Treaty</hi> ſay in expreſs
Termes, that <hi>In caſe any thing ſhould happen upon the
Coaſt of</hi> Africa, <hi>either by Sea or Land, that</hi> Twelve
Months time <hi>ſhall be given after Complaint, for the doing
of Juſtice;</hi> Yet did they not within about <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
weeks after; Reſolve to ſend a Conſiderable
Fleet of Theirs into thoſe Parts, to the Number of
<hi>Ten Men of War</hi> (beſides the Ships of the ſaid <hi>Weſt-Indie
Company,)</hi> under the Command of one <hi>Van
Campen,</hi> and ſtrengthened with a Conſiderable Body
of their <hi>Milice,</hi> under the Command of one <hi>Herts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg?</hi>
And did they not within about <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven
Weeks</hi> after that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put a <hi>Reſolution</hi> into the hands of the
ſaid <hi>Envoy Extraordinary</hi> by their <hi>Agent de Heyde,</hi> and
about the ſame time give it to the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> by
their <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> Denoting and Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Inſtruction given to the ſaid <hi>Van Campen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas they are pleaſed to Complement His
moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> in the ſaid Paper, as if upon his
ſcore in hopes of the good Effects of his good Offices
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44130:9"/>
for the Accommodating of Matters, and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their Cauſe the more clear, they had hitherto
forborn the Proceeding againſt his <hi>Majeſties Subjects</hi> as
they might have done: Is it not therein expreſly
Declared and ſet Down, that <hi>That Force was not ſent
thither barely to Defend what they had, and to take Care that
nothing more ſhould be Attempted upon them; but in down
right Termes,</hi> to Attacque <hi>and</hi> Fall upon <hi>His Majeſties
Subjects, and to Carve out their own Satisfaction and Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and to paſs by his door's for the doing thereof?</hi>
And that, <hi>Seconded</hi> and <hi>Backed</hi> with <hi>another Great Fleet</hi>
under their <hi>Chief Sea Officers;</hi> An Affront and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
too great for the Name of <hi>King</hi> to Suffer, and
Digeſt without Juſt Reſentment.</p>
            <p>And moreover, whereas their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> had lately
invited his Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes</hi> to ſend <hi>Fleets</hi> into the <hi>Mid-land-Sea</hi> to
Act Joyntly againſt thoſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> And that he
did accordingly Declare unto them (in Writing,
and by his <hi>Envoy Extraordinary,)</hi> his Intentions of
Sending, and that his <hi>Fleet</hi> ſhould Act <hi>Junctis Conſiliis</hi>
with theirs; Yet ſo it is, that while it was Acting
there, Purſuant thereunto, and in Expectation of
being <hi>Seconded</hi> and <hi>Appuyed</hi> by theirs, according to
their Promiſe, <hi>De Ruyther</hi> was on a ſuddain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thence.</p>
            <p>And whereas their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> would make the
World believe that they had Proceeded with ſuch
Singular and Extraordinary <hi>Franchiſe,</hi> and <hi>Clearneſſe</hi>
towards his ſaid <hi>Majesty,</hi> in Communicating their
Intentions and Deſigns (as aboveſaid;) Yet, <hi>Is it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44130:10"/>
not evident that the ſaid Orders muſt have been given to</hi>
De Ruyther <hi>much about the ſame time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though Sir <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> and his <hi>Majesties Fleet</hi>
hapned to be in the <hi>ſame Port</hi> with <hi>De Ruyther,</hi> when
he quitted thoſe Parts; yet neither did he in the leaſt
impart unto him his Intentions of quitting the ſame,
or whither he was going; and though the King of
<hi>Great Brittain</hi> hath ſince, ſeveral times preſſed their
<hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> at <hi>London</hi> to be Informed whither he was
gone, and upon what account, yet to this day his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
hath not been able to obtain any Satisfaction or
Aſſurance concerning that matter; Whereupon,
and all other Circumſtances being laid together, He
hath Juſt Reaſon to ſuppoſe and believe, that he is
ſent, and imployed againſt Him; And that while
his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was continuing (according to common
Conſert and Agreement between them,) his <hi>Fleet</hi>
againſt the <hi>Common Enemies</hi> of the very <hi>Name</hi> of
CHRISTIAN, and at a ſeaſon, when it more
then ordinarily becomed every one to ſhew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their Zeal againſt them; Theirs is call'd off
and turn'd againſt him: Nor is it to be imagined
that <hi>De Ruythers Inſtructions,</hi> which are <hi>Concealed,</hi>
ſhould be more <hi>Favourable</hi> then thoſe which were
<hi>Avowed</hi> to be given to <hi>Van Campen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it then to be wondered, that his <hi>Majesty</hi>
ſhews himſelf a little Concerned? Or is it now to be
doubted, who is the <hi>Attacquer,</hi> or <hi>Aggreſſor?</hi> And if
<hi>De Ruyther</hi> is in one part of the World, making War
againſt him, what is to be ſaid againſt it, if his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
not having at this time in thoſe Parts a ſuitable
Force to Reſiſt him, doth make uſe of what he hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44130:10"/>
nearer home to endeavour to ſecure himſelf, or to
get ſomething of theirs into his hands? Doth either
<hi>Common Right,</hi> or His <hi>Majeſties Treaty</hi> with <hi>This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
oblige to ſeek Satisfaction only in that part of the
World where the Injury is done; and ſo doth that
at all alter the Caſe, becauſe that their Forces acting
againſt <hi>Him out</hi> of <hi>Europe, His</hi> do ſomething againſt
<hi>Them, in Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majesty</hi> hath been very far from beginning
with them in any Part of the World, but if at this
time they are Actually with a Conſiderable <hi>Fleet</hi> of
the <hi>Eſtates</hi> falling upon <hi>Him,</hi> and his <hi>Subjects;</hi> and He
hath thereupon given Order to the ſtopping of ſome
of their Ships in Theſe Parts; Will not all the
World Juſtifie His <hi>Majeſty</hi> herein? And when
