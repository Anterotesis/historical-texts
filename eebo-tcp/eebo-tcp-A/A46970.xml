            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of ſeveral of their Majeſties Loyal Subjects very much Oppreſſed, contrary to the Laws of this Land (as they are adviſed) humbly repreſented to the Honourable the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>BY Act of Parliament in the Year</hi> 1663. 400. <hi>Hackney Coachmen were Licenſed to Ply in and about the Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>during that Parliament, and untill the firſt Seſſions of the next Parliament and no longer, except continued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſaid Parliament being Diſſolved, and another called and Diſſolved, and nothing done in that Affair, the Act expired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We the number of</hi> 100. <hi>Ancient Coachmen, who have ſerved Perſons of Honour, and Gentlemen of Quality, all of us Loyal Subjects, and many of us ſufferers for our Loyalty and Affections to King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt, of ever Bleſſed Memory, preſented our Petition to the then next Parliament, praying, for the Reaſons following, to be Added to the</hi> 400. <hi>formerly Licenſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſons;</hi> 1. That the Buildings and the Inhabitants were ſo much increaſed, that there was more occaſion for 500. than for 400. when the Act was made.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we being Ancient Coachmen bred up only to that Imploy, and had no other way to get Bread for our ſelves and poor Families.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we ſuppoſing that after the expiration of the aforeſaid Act of Parliament, the ſame liberty might extend to us that all other Coachmen had, did lay out all our little Subſtance in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coach, Horſes, and other Conveniencies for our Calling, and accordingly followed our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling until about <hi>May</hi> 1683. We were by an Act of Common Council prohibited from letting our Coaches to Hire in the City and Liberties of <hi>London,</hi> and had ſeveral of our Coaches ſeized and carried to the <hi>Green-Yard,</hi> and forced to redeem them with Fines, ſome 20 <hi>s.</hi> others 40 <hi>s.</hi> and ſome 50 <hi>s.</hi> and ſome have paid 5 <hi>l.</hi> in ten days time: Others have been ſold by them both Coach and Horſes, according to the will and pleaſure of thoſe Arbitrary Law-makers, ſome of our Perſons impriſoned, and then Fined as they were pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And by the exerciſe of this Cruelty upon us, the Coachmen pretended to be Licenſed by the Common Councel, did joyn together, and appoint 27. of their Number to meet, and hold Conſults for raiſing of Money amongſt themſelves to ſuppreſs and ruine us in our Callings in the City and Liberty of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> alſo, and did with Money hire Men and keep us from our imploy untill we did make our Agrievances known by our humble Petition to his moſt Gracious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> of ever Bleſſed Memory; and the better to effect their deſign to ruine us, they have raiſed ſeveral great ſums of Money.</p>
            <p>That after the death of his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. the ſaid 400. endeavouring ſtill to ſuppreſs and deſtroy us the 100. Obtained a Grant from his late Majeſty King <hi>James</hi> the 2 d. to be executed by five Commiſſioners (moſt of whom were known Papiſts) to whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced 1000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> more, and over and above what the Act of Parliament allowed; and conſtituted 16. Undertakers or chief Managers to proſecute us, obtained a Proclamation to be iſſued forth for us within Ten days time to put off our Coaches, Horſes, and Trade, to the utter ruin of many of us, not being ſuffered to follow our Callings, and being indebted to ſeveral Tradeſmen that came preſently upon us for their Money.</p>
            <p>That ſeveral of the 400. are <hi>Vintners, Inkeepers,</hi> and ſeveral other Trades and Employments, ſome have Eſtates, others have ſold, forfeited, and loſt their right to the ſame, ſo that it is verily believed that not one half that had the firſt Right by Act of Parliament, have any juſt Title to the ſame at this time; So that their Quallifications are humbly ſubmitted to this Honourable Houſe to Enquire into and Determine as they ſhall think fit, the 100. being truly Qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent and meaning of the late Act of Parliament, as by their ſeveral Certificates at large appears.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, we the Oppreſſed have, to our ruins, ſtood ſeveral Suits with the ſaid 400. and in all the ſaid Suits caſt them (unleſs in one Caſe ſince the time of the Popiſh Commiſſion Mr. <hi>Powis</hi> the Attorney-General granted a <hi>Noli Proſe<expan>

            <closer>Wherefore we moſt humbly beſeech Your Honours to take the Premiſes into Your Serious Conſideration, That when our Petition ſhall be preſented unto You, You will pleaſe to Vouchſafe us Relief according as Your Wiſdom ſhall ſeem meete; And we and all the reſt, as in Duty bound, ſhall ever Pray, &amp;c.
