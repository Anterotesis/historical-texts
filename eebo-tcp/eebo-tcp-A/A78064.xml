            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <figure/> In the <hi>Strand</hi> near the Middle <hi>Exchange</hi> in <hi>Salisbury</hi> Street, at the Second Houſe on the Right hand where a Barber's Pole hangs out, Liveth <hi>John Butler,</hi> An Expert Operator and Oculiſt.</head>
            <p>YOu may find him there from Seven in the Morning till Twelve, And then he goes into <hi>Sweeting</hi>'s Alley, to that which was <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, now called the <hi>Flanders</hi> Coffee-Houſe, next Door to the Sign of the Horſe-Shoe near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> there he ſtayes till Four of the Clock, who (by Gods Bleſſing) Cureth the Diſtempers following, (<hi>Viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>He Cureth Blindneſs by Couching of Cataracts, He taketh Specks off the Eyes, and Cureth Defluxions of Rheums in the Eyes; He hath ſingular good Skill and Knowledg in Curing of Deafneſs, when the Party comes to him, he will tell them the cauſe of their Deafneſs, whether the Deafneſs be Internal or External, or whether curable or no. He Cureth Noiſes, Singing or Buzzing in the Ears; He cureth Burſten Bellies, he cureth Ulcerated Legs, and Itch in any part of the Body; He hath an Excellent Art in drawing forth of Corns out of the Feet and Toes with the whole ſubſtance in length and ſimilitude of a Clove, and drawing no blood, nor putting the Party to any pain at all: And by the Operation of a Plaiſter to kill them, that no other Corns will ever come again in the ſame places.</p>
            <p>He is none of thoſe which you call by that Vulgar name Corn-Cutters, could he perform it no better than ſuch perſons, he would ſcorn to ſet it forth in Print. For every Corn he draweth in his Chamber is Six pence; if any perſon ſends for him to their dwelling places, he expects Twelve pence. If any perſon doth conjecture that other Corns will come again in the ſame places, upon Conſideration he will admit of a Years trial and take nothing for the preſent; And if other Corns do come again in the ſame places within the Year, then he will expect nothing.</p>
            <p>Alderman <hi>Rugg</hi> dwelling in St. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> he was very Lame with Corns, he had Five and Fifty Corns taken out 26 years ago by this Profeſſor, and never any other Corns came again in the ſame places.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Body</hi> dwelling in <hi>London</hi>-Street in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> had Thirty Corns taken out Three years ago, and never any came ſince; he was ſo troubled with them, that he was forc'd to Ride up and down to do his buſineſs; but now goes very well without any pain.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> a Herald-Painter in <hi>Thredneedle</hi>-Street near the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> he was much troubled with Corns, I took them out Two Years ago. And he was never troubled with any Corns ſince that time.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Peck</hi> now dwelling in <hi>Noble</hi>-Street, he had Fourteen Corns taken out by the Profeſſor hereof Four and Twenty Years ago, and was never troubled with any Corns ſince.</p>
            <p>He can give Teſtimonies of ſome Hundreds of Perſons more that he hath Cured of the Particulars aboveſaid, ſince his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>London,</hi> which will be too Tedious to Inſert here. He cureth many other Diſtempers not here mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Oculiſt has a Large Houſe and Shop wherein he now dwells, known by the Sign of the <hi>BELL</hi> in <hi>Pye-Corner</hi> near <hi>Smithfield,</hi> which he is willing to Sell, Lett, or Exchange for another of the like Value in or near the City.</p>
            <p>If any Perſon pleaſe to ſend for him, they are deſired to leave a Note at his Chamber.</p>
