            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A Preface to the following</hi> Tryals; <hi>giving a brief</hi> Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Account <hi>of the Life of</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>and the occaſions that brought both Her, and the Duke of</hi> Norfolk, <hi>to their</hi> Tragical Ends, <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Arundel <hi>to his Trial,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange or <hi>unſeaſonable,</hi> while the <hi>Preſs</hi> labours daily with the <hi>preſent Popiſh Plot,</hi> to trouble the world with that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns only <hi>Thoſe,</hi> that ſo long ago are paſt and gone: But as there are <hi>too many</hi> amongſt us, that queſtion the <hi>Reality</hi> of the preſent Conſpiracy; ſo there are not <hi>a few</hi> that deny the Truth of thoſe heretofore. Or if they acknowledge any thing either of the <hi>Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or <hi>Babingtons Conſpiracy,</hi> they extenuate the ſame almoſt to nothing, by alledging, that they were attempted by <hi>a few</hi> Private High-Spirited Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, extreamly provoked with great Injuries and bitter uſage, which were the only cauſes of their deſperate Reſolutions, for which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently ſuffered; and that therefore their <hi>Treaſons</hi> are no more to be filed to the Account of their <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. But by the following papers, I conceive theſe Evaſions will be ſilenced, for thereby it will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was during a great part of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Series</hi> of Popiſh Treaſons <hi>ſucceſſively,</hi> (though God be bleſſed <hi>unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully)</hi> carried on, and that not by a few <hi>Deſperado</hi>'s, but by a <hi>great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of perſons of the moſt conſiderable Fortunes and Abilities of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> That the main intentive and <hi>ſcope</hi> of the ſaid Conſpirators, as every where they declare, was to root out <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> and ſet up Popery, unto which Attempts they were chiefly animated by the proſpect of an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor, viz.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> That the Papiſts then were to make uſe of the <hi>ſame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage;</hi> as now they do, <hi>viz.</hi> to raiſe Lyes and Slanders of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and prerend that they deſigned Rebellion, only to colour <hi>their own real</hi> Treaſons, as appears by the Queen of <hi>Scots Letter to</hi> Babington.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> That theſe fatal Councils of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> and Popiſh <hi>Priests,</hi> brought that <hi>great Princeſs</hi> (who had the misfortune to be led by them) to Ruine; ſo that by endeavouring to <hi>anticipate</hi> the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> ſhe not only loſt it, but alſo her <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſeveral other <hi>Remarkables,</hi> which no doubt the Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will obſerve in the peruſal, occaſioned the publication of the enſuing papers at this time; 'Tis confeſſed, the ſame are not <hi>ſo exactly</hi> taken, as the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the preſent Age; The Ingenious Skill of <hi>Speedy</hi> and <hi>ſhort writing</hi> being much improved ſince thoſe times; yet it is evident by the <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> that there was no little care and diligence uſed therein, ſo that nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſeems to have eſcaped, nor do any Hiſtorians give ſo punctual an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66112:3"/>
of the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> as theſe papers, which before never ſaw the Light; concerning the <hi>Authentickneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of which, the Antientneſs of the hand-writing of the <hi>Original,</hi> might be a ſufficient Teſtimony, had we not <hi>another</hi> more probable Argument; which is, That they were lately found amongſt ſome <hi>Ancient papers</hi> that heretofore belonged to <hi>a Secretary</hi> of Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> an eminent Miniſter of State at that juncture; For whoſe uſe 'tis very credible the ſame were ſo curiouſly collected. Beſides, If any ſhall be be at the pains to examine them, they will find them to agree <hi>in the main</hi> with the Hiſtories of thoſe times, not only with the Learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> and the reſt of our own Writers, but with the Great <hi>Thaunus,</hi> nay with the Jeſuit <hi>Strada</hi> too.</p>
            <p>But for the ſatisfaction of thoſe Readers that are not ſo converſant in Hiſtory, that they may the better underſtand what they meet with in theſe Tryals: we conceive it will not be unwelcome to prefix a brief Account of the <hi>Life</hi> and unhappy <hi>Fortunes</hi> of the Illuſtrious <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on whoſe Adventures all theſe proſecutions did depend; wherein we ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially ſtate matter of Fact without the Reflections of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable flatteries of <hi>Cauſin</hi> the Jeſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Queen of</hi> Scots, was the daughter, and ſole Legitimate Iſſue of <hi>James</hi> the fifth, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>Mary</hi> his Queen (a daughter of the houſe of <hi>Lorrain)</hi> born in <hi>December,</hi> 1541. ſhe was ſcarce eight dayes old, when the King her Father dyed, and the Scottiſh Nobility being divided into Factions, (whereof the Family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> were the reſpective Heads; The one ſide ſupported by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and the other by the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond) ſhe was by her Mother (who being a <hi>French-woman,</hi> inclined unto that Kings Intereſt) ſent into <hi>France</hi> about five or ſix years of Age, to learn the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Court.</p>
            <p>There ſhe was educated under the <hi>French</hi> King, and the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> her Uncles, who being deſperate Enemies to the Reformation, ſeaſoned her with violent principles againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> ſhe was a Lady very proper and beautiful, of a great Wit and Courage beyond her Sex. Theſe Advantages, and much more ſeveral important <hi>Reaſons of State,</hi> induced the <hi>French</hi> King to conclude her a fit Match for his Son <hi>the Dauphin:</hi> For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thought themſelves not only ſure to <hi>unite</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (ſhe being Sovereign Queen of the latter, as he was Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the former) but alſo had a proſpect of the <hi>Crown of</hi> England, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as Great Grand-child to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; to be the next Heireſs thereunto after <hi>Mary,</hi> who had by this time mounted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne; For as for her ſiſter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they not only knew her to be one they called an <hi>Heretick,</hi> but alſo gave out, ſhe was <hi>Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,</hi> and ſo on both Accounts repreſented her as uncapable to ſucceed. Hereupon a Marriage was ſolemnized between the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, <hi>Apr. 24th.</hi> 1588. in <hi>Noſtredam</hi> Church at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> following, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> after a ſhort Reign (rendred <hi>infamous</hi> to all Poſterity, by the Butcheries committed on <hi>Proteſtants:)</hi> departed this Life; And though <hi>Elizabeth</hi> according to her undoubted Right, was with the general conſent and applauſe of the Lords, Commons, and all the people proclaimed Queen, and moſt happily ſucceeded her in the Throne: yet had the <hi>Guiſes</hi> inveigled the French-King into ſuch ſtrong hopes of adjoyning <hi>England</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> by the aforeſaid Title of their <hi>Neece</hi> the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that he openly own'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66112:3"/>
the claim thereof, ſo that thenceforwards his <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter in Law</hi> uſed the ſtile in all their Acts of State, <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, King</hi> and <hi>Queen;</hi> and cauſed the Arms of <hi>England</hi> to be Engraven and Painted on their Palaces, Houſholdſtuff, and Heralds-Coats. And the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> dying ſhortly after, this <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſucceeded him by the name of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, and <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (by the Council of the ſaid <hi>Guiſes,</hi> who bore great ſway in <hi>France)</hi> publickly aſſumed to themſelves the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as that of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> pretending to Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, who complained thereof ſometime, that the Queen of <hi>Scots bore the Arms of</hi> England only to ſhew the nearneſs of her Blood to that Royal Line; and ſometimes, that ſhe did it only to cauſe the Queen of <hi>England</hi> to forbear bearing <hi>thoſe</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much diſpute there was about this matter, which Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as ſhe had reaſon, reſented very grievouſly; But at laſt in the Year 1560. upon a Treaty at <hi>Edenborough,</hi> It was amongſt other matters agreed, that <hi>the</hi> French <hi>King, and his Wife Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>ſhould henceforwards relinquiſh the Title and Arms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland. But when the ſame came to be confirm'd in <hi>France,</hi> they ſought Evaſions, and delay'd ſo long, that in the <hi>interim</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, not being Eighteen years old, <hi>dyed,</hi> and left the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> a Widow of Nineteen, who thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to leave <hi>France,</hi> and to return to her own Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Ambaſſador, before ſhe went, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs'd her to confirm the ſaid <hi>Treaty of Edenborough,</hi> which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, alledging, ſhe muſt firſt conſult with the Nobility of <hi>Scotland:</hi> This refuſal ſo nettled Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that ſhe refuſed to grant her a <hi>ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> for her paſſage: However, taking the opportunity of a <hi>Fog,</hi> ſhe ſet Sail from <hi>Callice,</hi> and paſſing the Channel, arrived ſafely in <hi>Scotland:</hi> From thence ſhe ſent Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> promiſing all care to make and conſerve <hi>Amity</hi> with her; and requeſting that a laſting Peace might be made between the <hi>two Crowns.</hi> And in order thereunto deſired, that Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> would in Parliament declare her her next Heir, if ſhe her ſelf ſhould have no iſſue.</p>
            <p>This propoſition ſtartled Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who rather look't for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Treaty of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> which ſhe had ſo often promiſed; and therefore return'd Anſwer in theſe words, <hi>That as concerning the Succſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe hoped the Queen of</hi> Scotland <hi>would not by violence take away her Crown from her, and her Children, if ſhe had any: She promiſed not to derogate any thing of her right unto the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>although ſhe had claimed the Title and Arms of</hi> England <hi>thorough the too much haſty ambition of other men; for which injury it was meet that ſhe made ſatisfaction. By ſetting down her Succeſſor, ſhe feared leſt their friendſhip ſhould be rather diſſevered than conſolidated; for that unto men eſtabliſhed in Government, their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are alwaies ſuſpected and hated: the people, ſuch is their inconſtancy upon a diſlike of preſent things, do look after the riſing Sun, and forſake the Sun ſetting; and the Succeſſors deſigned cannot keepwithin the bounds of Juſtice and Truth, their own hopes, and other mens lewd deſires. Moreover, if ſhe ſhould confirm the Succeſſion unto her, ſhe ſhould thereby cut off the hope of her own ſecurity, and being alive, hang her Winding-ſheet before her own eyes; yea, make her own Funeral-feaſt alive, and ſee the ſame.</hi>

But this Remonſtrance took but little effect, and therefore ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards an <hi>Interview</hi> was projected to be had between the two Queens, but after a long Treaty, relinquiſht; the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen refuſing it, unleſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would adopt her her Daughter, or declare her her Heir apparent by Authority of Parliament. This Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would not conſent to: but adviſed her to a Marriage with <hi>Robert Dudely</hi> (who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was made Earl of <hi>Leiceſter)</hi> which Alliance the <hi>French</hi> rail'd upon as diſhonourable; and as for her matching with any <hi>Forrein</hi> Prince, the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> natural Brother to the <hi>Scots</hi> Queen, diverted her from it, and propoſed to her <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darnly,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> whereunto both <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> ſeem'd to give their ſuffrages; for as he was one of the moſt <hi>proper and goodly</hi> young Gentlemen in the world, ſo likewiſe was he next <hi>Heir</hi> after her to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that ſhe might at once gratifie her <hi>Fancy,</hi> and ſortifie her <hi>Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Noble-man was born, and at this time reſided in <hi>England,</hi> the Earl his Father having upon the troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> retreated thither in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time: And upon the firſt return of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had confin'd both Father and Son for holding correſpondence with her. But after ſome time, firſt the Father, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Son, on ſeveral ſpecious pretences, got leave to go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> promiſing to return within ſuch a Term.</p>
            <p>Being there, a <hi>Marriage</hi> was quickly concluded and ſolemnized between the Queen and this young Lord, at which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> appear'd much diſſatisfied; nor did their <hi>Nuptial Joys</hi> remain long <hi>un-eclips'd,</hi> but diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents (which as eaſily climb to the <hi>glorious beds</hi> of Princes, as to the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>pallets</hi> of Peaſants) aroſe between them; whether it were, that he thought he had not <hi>enough,</hi> or took upon him <hi>too much</hi> ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or on ſome more <hi>private diſguſt,</hi> I determine not, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow the reports of thoſe prejudic'd Authors who have ſullied this great Princeſſes <hi>Fame,</hi> when the reſpect due to the Honour of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> eſpecially the Majeſty of a <hi>Crowned Head,</hi> ought to have taught them more modeſty. From what ever ground theſe animoſities ſprung, they ſoon grew to ſuch an unhappy height, that one Evening the King attended with ſeveral others, ruſh't into the Queens Apartment, as ſhe was at Supper, and ſeizing upon one <hi>David Rizius</hi> (a Native of <hi>Piemont,</hi> by profeſſion a Muſitian, but for his Wit and Dexterity receiv'd into great favour with the Queen, and made a kind of <hi>Secretary)</hi> they aſſaulted him with their <hi>naked Swords;</hi> and dragging him to the door, gave him ſeveral mortal wounds, whereof he inſtantly died. The Queen was then great with Child of him who was afterwards <hi>James</hi> the <hi>1ſt, Monarch of Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> And though Providence was pleaſed to prevent her <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> yet the ſight of ſo diſmal a Tragedy could not but ſurprize her with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſtoniſhment, inſomuch that ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> will needs have it, that King <hi>James</hi> retain'd an averſion to the ſight of <hi>naked Weapons,</hi> and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the ſame to the impreſſions of this unparellel'd violence.</p>
            <p>Of which the King ('tis ſaid) ſoon repented, and craved the Queens pardon, charging <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Morton</hi> as the perſons that inſtigated him thereunto. But the King himſelf did not long <hi>ſurvive</hi> this Aſſaſſination; for within a month or two after, he himſelf in a tempeſtuous night was ſtrangled in his bed, and then his body caſt forth into a Garden: Who were the <hi>Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> of his murther, muſt perhaps remain a ſecret till the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is certain, that ſoon after her Majeſty was adviſed again to <hi>Marry,</hi> and <hi>James Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> being then much in her favour, and eminent for his Valour, was recommended ('tis ſaid, <hi>deſignedly</hi> by <hi>Murray</hi> and his party) as a perſon moſt fit for her acceptance; and though he were more than ſuſpected to be concern'd in the murder, yet being thereof in a pretended <hi>Legal</hi> manner acquitted, and having obtain'd for that purpoſe a <hi>Divorce</hi> from his former Wife, the Queen was prevail'd with to accept him for her <hi>Husband,</hi> not without the conſent of many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>This cauſed a <hi>ſuſpition</hi> in many, that ſhe was conſcious to the murder (which moſt Hiſtorians repreſent as the chief deſign of the Conſpirators in promoting of that unhappy Match); and theſe ſuſpitions were ſo far improv'd, that quickly after Arms were raiſed on that pretence, and <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> forc'd to fly, and the Queen her ſelf <hi>ſeized,</hi> and made Priſoner in <hi>Lechlevyn</hi> under the cuſtody of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Mother, formerly a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> where threatning to proſecute her for <hi>Incontinency,</hi> and for the Kings murder, and for Tyranny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they at laſt wrought ſo far upon her, as to compel her to reſign her Kingdom to her <hi>Son,</hi> then ſcarce Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months old, and to appoint <hi>Murray Regent</hi> during his Minority. But after Eleven months Conſinement, ſhe made her <hi>eſcape,</hi> and declaring, that theſe Conceſſions were extorted by <hi>Dureſs,</hi> and <hi>juſt fear,</hi> raiſed an Army of 7000 men, which were defeated by <hi>Murray,</hi> and the Queen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſave her ſelf by a flight of 60 Miles in one day to the houſe of the Lord <hi>Heris,</hi> where diſpairing of ſafety, and promiſing her ſelf better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than from her own Subjects, ſhe from thence in a ſmall Bark, and with few friends, put to Sea, and Landed at <hi>Wickington</hi> in <hi>Cumberland, May</hi> the <hi>17th,</hi> 1568. and immediately diſpatch't Letters to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> deſiring to be <hi>conducted</hi> to her preſence; who in Anſwer, promiſed her aſſiſtance according to the <hi>Equity</hi> of her Cauſe; but denied her <hi>Acceſs,</hi> for that ſhe was held guilty of many Crimes, and ordered her to be conveyed to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> as a place of ſafety; withal, writing to the <hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he ſhould come in Perſon, or by ſufficient <hi>Deputies,</hi> to anſwer the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> complaint againſt him and his accomplices, and render ſufficient reaſons for depoſing her, or otherwiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66112:5"/>
ſhe would eſpouſe her cauſe, and with all the force ſhe could make, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſettle her in her Kingdom. Whereupon <hi>Murray</hi> with ſeven more met at <hi>York</hi> ſeveral Noblemen commiſſionated by Queen <hi>Flizabeth</hi> to hear and treat of the matter; amongſt whom, <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> was the chief; and likewiſe the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and others impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, did there attend: but after a long Treaty they broke up, and nothing was concluded.</p>
            <p>At this <hi>Treaty</hi> a propoſal was ſecretly made (ſome ſay by <hi>Murray,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe)</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to marry the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> which proved fatal to him, as you will find by the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, containing his Tryal and Condemnation for the ſame. And alſo it was given out, that he had paſſed away her Right to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to a Foreigner, and that the ſame was ratified at <hi>Rome;</hi> and Letters ſhewn, wherein ſhe accuſed Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> for not performing her promiſes to her; and boaſted, of Succors ſhe expected from others; which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a diſcovery made, That one <hi>Ridolph</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Merchant was employed by <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth the then Pope, to make a ſecret Commotion of <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in her favour: Whereupon ſhe was removed to a place of greater ſecurity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> had notice of the Intrigue between her and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> upon which <hi>He</hi> was queſtion'd; but promiſing to deſiſt, and ſeeming to ſlight that Alliance, was diſmiſſed: But preſently a Rebellion was raiſed in the <hi>North</hi> by the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> inſtigated by one <hi>Nicholas Morton,</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt ſent over by the Pope to pronounce Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and to have loſt on that account all right and ſoveraignty. And theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Rebels proceeded to that outrage, that at <hi>Durham</hi> they tore in pieces all the <hi>Bibles</hi> they could meet with. But finding themſelves too weak to withſtand the Forces raiſed againſt them, fled without fighting; the firſt being betray'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Beheaded at <hi>York,</hi> and the other <hi>died</hi> abroad miſerably. About the ſame time <hi>Murray,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon a private Grudge, was ſhot, as he Rid along the ſtreet, by one <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the <hi>Regency</hi> was conferr'd upon <hi>Matthew</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the young Kings Granfather, he being Father to the late murder'd King, before his Marriage with the Queen, ſtiled the Lord <hi>Darnly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings were now urgent with Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> liberty; who made anſwer, <hi>That as ſhe would omit nothing that might ſerve for the reconciling the ſaid Queen and her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ſo ſhe muſt have leave to provide for her own and her peoples ſafety, as Nature, Reaſon, and her own Honour required.</hi> Whereupon finding thoſe <hi>Forreign</hi> applications ineffectual, <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Plots were ſet on foot to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it by <hi>force;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, ſome eminent perſons undertook it; but being diſcovered, were ſoon apprehended, and ſome of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors executed.</p>
            <p>Nor was it long, but the Duke being found by <hi>intercepted</hi> Letters (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his aforeſaid promiſes) ſtill to continue his affection to, and correſpondence with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, was brought to his <hi>Trial</hi> (here <hi>printed),</hi> and for the Crimes therein ſpecified condemned and beheaded.</p>
            <p>Some few days after his Execution, <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>de la Ware</hi> and others were ſent to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (who was then full of <hi>grief</hi> and ſorrow for his death; owning that a <hi>contract of Marriage</hi> had paſſed between him and her) to expoſtulate with her, and charge her with divers matters; as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66112:5"/>
that ſhe had uſurp'd the <hi>Title and Arms</hi> of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and had not renounced the ſame, as ſhe ought to have done by the Treaty of <hi>Edenbourgh:</hi> that ſhe had ſought to <hi>Marry</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> (a Subject of <hi>England)</hi> without the Queens privity; and to effect the ſame Marriage, had tried all means by her Agents and Miniſters, to <hi>reſcue</hi> the ſaid Duke out of Priſon by force: that ſhe had raiſed the Rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>relieved</hi> the Rebles (after they were put to <hi>flight)</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> that ſhe had by <hi>Ridolph</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> importun'd both the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and others, for <hi>Forrein</hi> Forces to invade <hi>England:</hi> that ſhe had conſpired with ſeveral <hi>Engliſh Subjects</hi> to take her out of Priſon by force, and proclaim her <hi>Queen of England:</hi> that ſhe had received Letters from the Pope, wherein (to uſe his own words) he promiſed to cheriſh her <hi>as the Hen doth her Chickins,</hi> and to account thoſe that ſtood for her, the <hi>true Children of the Church. Laſtly,</hi> that ſhe had procured the <hi>Popes Bull</hi> againſt the Queen, and had ſuffered her ſelf publickly to be ſtiled <hi>Queen of England</hi> by her Miniſters in Forrein Courts.</p>
            <p>Whereunto proteſting, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſhe was a free abſolute Queen, and ſubject to none, ſhe with a ſettled countenance and courage anſwered:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſhe had not uſurped the <hi>Title and Arms</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but that the King of <hi>France,</hi> and her Husband, had <hi>impoſed</hi> them upon her, being very <hi>young,</hi> and under the direction of her Husband, and therefore not to be laid upon her for a fault: and that as ſhe did not after her Husband's death, ſo neither would ſhe claim them as long as Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or any Children ſhe might have, ſhould live.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſhe never imagined any detriment or hurt to the Queen by her Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being perſwaded it would be for the <hi>good</hi> of the Common-wealth; and that ſhe did not renounce it, becauſe ſhe had given her Faith and Troth unto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſhe willed the Duke by ſome means to get out of danger and Priſon, which ſhe did out of the duty ſhe owed to him as her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That ſhe had not raiſed rebellion, nor was privy to the ſame, but was always ready to reveal all attempts againſt the Queens life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That ſhe never relieved the <hi>Engliſh Rebels,</hi> only that in her Letters ſhe recommended the Counteſs of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That ſhe uſed <hi>Ridolph</hi> (whom ſhe knew to be highly in the Popes favour) in many matters, yet receiv'd no Letters from him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That ſhe never moved any to attempt her deliverance; yet that ſhe willingly gave ear unto them that offered their labour therein; and for that purpoſe, that ſhe communicated to <hi>Rolſton</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi> a private Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That ſhe had receiv'd ſometimes Letters from the Pope, very pious and conſolatory, wherein were no ſuch Expreſſions or Phraſes.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That ſhe procured not the <hi>Bull;</hi> that ſhe only ſaw the Printed Copy thereof, and when ſhe had read it, ſhe threw it into the fire.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That if any in Forrein parts writ, or nam'd her otherwiſe than they ought, they, and not ſhe were to anſwer it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That ſhe never by Letters required aid of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to invade <hi>England,</hi> but only to be <hi>reſtored</hi> into her Kingdom by their means, and not without the Queens privity.</p>

12 But if any queſtion or doubt be made of thoſe Letters of effecting the Marriage by force of Arms, ſhe requeſted (ſince ſhe was born of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood of <hi>England)</hi> that ſhe might anſwer Perſonally in the next <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How far theſe ſpecious Allegations were credited by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> we find not; 'tis certain they produc'd little effect towards her <hi>delivery.</hi> But on the contrary, it being about the ſame time diſcovered that ſhe held Correſpondence with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that the Lord <hi>Seton</hi> who landed in <hi>Eſſex</hi> diſguiſed like a Mariner, had brought a promiſe of Aid to her from the Duke of <hi>Alva;</hi> ſhe was confined more ſtrictly, and with greater Guard.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to prevent the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> deſign, which was to make uſe of the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi>'s favour with the King to withdraw his affection from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Gowry</hi> and others reſolve by all means to remove <hi>Lenox</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> from the King.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſhe ſhould condemn all the <hi>practiſes</hi> ever ſince that time, and ingenuouſly renounce them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. She ſhould bind her ſelf not to practiſe any thing directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Government of the Realm of <hi>England</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical or Civil affairs; but by all manner of means oppoſe her ſelf, and reſiſt ſuch practiſers as publick enemies.</p>

the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was too much addicted to, and influenced by the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> and their Councils, who as they made uſe of her name to colour their traiterous deſigns againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and therefore gave out, as if they had acted out of pure <hi>zeal</hi> to the Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> (as many of them will <hi>boaſt</hi> to this very day); yet 'tis plain, that in all theſe ſtirs they really minded nothing but their <hi>own Intereſt;</hi> for when they met with ſo many diſappointments in their Plots, to bring the ſaid <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, before her time, to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown; and withal deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of turning her Son, King <hi>James,</hi> to <hi>their Religion,</hi> they preſently began to ſtart variety of <hi>new Titles,</hi> witneſs <hi>Parſons,</hi> alias <hi>Doleman</hi>'s Book of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and other Pamphlets by them flung abroad about thoſe times: Nay, 'tis more than ſuſpected, that as they <hi>egg'd</hi> on the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen to ill practiſes againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo when they had done (imitating their Father the Devil, who firſt tempts and then accuſes), they <hi>betray'd</hi> her too, by making a ſecret diſcovery of thoſe very Conſpiracies in which they themſelves had engag'd her; and ſo were treacherouſly <hi>inſtrumental</hi> to haſten her death, hoping to take off Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and put by King <hi>James,</hi> and play a new Game, more for their advantage, with ſome other <hi>Pretender,</hi> as will more fully appear by and by.</p>
            <p>But to return in the mean time to our Hiſtory: King <hi>James</hi> being, as you heard, in little better Condition than that of a <hi>Priſoner</hi> to Earl <hi>Gowry</hi> and his Confederates, or at leaſt eſteeming himſelf as ſuch, on a ſudden with a ſmall Company conveyed himſelf to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then about 18 years of Age, to whom ſeveral of the Nobility with armed Troops repaired; and then he began to exerciſe his Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of himſelf, and declared in a great Aſſembly of the States, the Force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon him to have been <hi>traiterouſly</hi> impoſed, yet thought it moſt ſafe not to proceed with <hi>Rigour</hi> againſt his Surprizers, only adviſing them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Court, and promiſed them <hi>pardon,</hi> if they would ask it within a time limited, which they declining, fled ſome into <hi>England,</hi> and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other parts, only <hi>Gowry</hi> attempting a new Conſpiracy, ſoon after loſt his life.</p>
            <p>It was now the year 1584. And in <hi>England</hi> divers <hi>lewd Books</hi> were ſpread by the Jeſuits, and other Popiſh Factors, aſſerting, that Princes <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ſometime before had been by the Pope, were not to have any <hi>Allegiance</hi> paid unto them, but ought to be <hi>depoſed,</hi> &amp;c.

of all the <hi>Ports</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> the other of the <hi>Nobilitry and Gentry</hi> that favoured the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and that he had communicated all this to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, then in <hi>England;</hi> whereupon he was condemned, and though he had twice confeſs'd the fact, yet (like our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Popiſh</hi> Traitors) at the Gallows he ſtoutly <hi>deny'd all,</hi> and would needs be thought to dye as innocent as the <hi>child unborn.</hi> However, <hi>Mendoza</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus violated, and forfeited the Priviledg of an <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded forthwith to depart with ſhame, at which the <hi>Spaniſh Court</hi> being diſſatisfied, the Queen ſent over Sir <hi>William Wade</hi> to juſtify the Action: But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> not admitting him into his preſence, but ſlightingly putting him off to his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> he in diſdain refus'd to communicate it at all, and ſo returned home <hi>unheard,</hi> whereby a greater animoſity aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two <hi>Crowns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party leſs buſy in fomenting diſturbances in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> that had wrote ſeveral <hi>Pestilent Books,</hi> having drawn in the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> to Rebellion, and finding him defeated, and his <hi>Head</hi> ſent into <hi>England,</hi> died miſerably of <hi>famine,</hi> as he roamed up and down the Mountains, guilty and deſperate as <hi>Cain,</hi> fearing each man he met would deſervedly ſlay him. Likewiſe about the ſame time Providence was pleas'd in a <hi>wonderful manner</hi> to make a diſcovery of ſome other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes in agitation againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> for one <hi>Creighton,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Jeſuit ſailing in a ſmall Veſſel from the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> certain Sea-rovers of <hi>Holland</hi> (which then was revolted and at enmity with the reſt of the Subjects of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King) happening to come up with them, took the ſaid Ship; and though the Jeſuit to conceal his Inſtructions and miſchievous errand, <hi>tore</hi> ſeveral of his Papers to <hi>pieces,</hi> and flung them <hi>over-board,</hi> yet the wind <hi>miraculouſly</hi> (as he himſelf confeſt afterwards) drove them back again, and caſt them upon the Deck; which the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> perceiving, and imagining that they might be of conſequence, gather'd them up carefully, and ſent them to <hi>England,</hi> where by the great skill and induſtry of Sir <hi>William Wade,</hi> they were ſo <hi>join'd</hi> together again, that the Contents were legible, and the <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> on foot detected.</p>
            <p>The good Subjects of <hi>England</hi> finding their Country in this danger from <hi>abroad,</hi> and the life of their Queen (whereon the ſafety of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Liberties did ſeem at that juncture wholly under God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend) daily attempted by various Plots and Machinations at home, all carried on by <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of a proſpect of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> did think fit of their own accord ſolemnly to oblige themſelves each to other for her ſafety, and to revenge her death on any that ſhould occaſion it; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement they call'd an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> and was entred into by abundance of perſons of all <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> throughout the Nation. The Tenor whereof was as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOraſmuch as Almighty God hath ordained Kings, Queens and Princes, to have Dominion and Rule over all their Subjects, and to</hi> preſerve them in the poſſeſſion, <hi>and obſervation of the true Christian Religion, according to his holy word and commandment.

            <p>The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen was too quick ſighted, not to perceive, that this <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation</hi> was an Arrow level'd principally againſt her; yet whether puſh't on by the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of her ſpirit, or the <hi>blindneſs</hi> of her Fate, or rather <hi>ſeduc'd</hi> by affording an ear as well to the <hi>treacherous</hi> counſel of her enemies, as unto the <hi>pernicious</hi> devices of her friends, ſhe was ſtill buſy in Intrigues for procuring her Liberty; and particularly Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had private informations from one <hi>Hart,</hi> a Romiſh Prieſt, that Dr. <hi>Allen,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive (advanc'd by the Pope to the <hi>Cardinalate)</hi> for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>England,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Inglefeild</hi> for the Laity, and the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> for the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had unanimouſly <hi>undertaken,</hi> and with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, and conſent of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> decreed, that Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhould be <hi>depoſed,</hi> and the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> diſinherited of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as being <hi>both</hi> manifeſt and notorious <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to be married to ſome <hi>Catholick Nobleman,</hi> who ſhould be choſen King of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks, and the Election <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> by the Pope, and the lawful <hi>iſſue</hi> of this man by the Queen of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be declared <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

work to take away the lives of Princes <hi>excommunicated,</hi> who thereupon made a <hi>ſolemn Vow</hi> to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> To render his attempt more feaſible, and to rock the Queen and her Council into ſecurity, that the danger might ſo much the more certainly overwhelm them, by how much it was leſs apprehended, the Jeſuits and Seminary Prieſts publiſh't a Book, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> to <hi>attempt nothing</hi> againſt their Prince, and to uſe only the Chriſtian weapons, <hi>prayers and tears,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Babington</hi> being thus inform'd of <hi>Savage</hi>'s Vow, reſolving to have the murder of Queen <hi>Elizabeth effectually</hi> perform'd, would needs <hi>aſſociate</hi> Five more with him for that attempt, and alſo drew in divers other Popiſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, no leſs fiery zealous than himſelf, into the Conſpiracy, as <hi>Edward Windſor,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Windſor, Thomas Salisbury,</hi> of a good Family in <hi>Denbyſhire, Charles Tilney,</hi> of an ancient worſhipful Houſe, the only hope of his Family, and one of the Gentlemen-Penſioners to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> (the laſt Two being lately reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Ballard), Chidiock Tichburn,</hi> of <hi>Hampſhire, Edward Abington,</hi> whoſe Father had been <hi>Cofferer</hi> to the Queen, <hi>Robert Gage,</hi> of <hi>Surry, John Travers</hi> and <hi>John Charnock,</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire, John Jones,</hi> whoſe Father had been Tailor to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> one <hi>Barnwell</hi> of an honourable Family in <hi>Ireland, Henry Dun,</hi> a Clerk in the <hi>Firſt-Fruits-Office,</hi> and ſeveral others; but thoſe that were to aſſaſſinate Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were the before-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Savage, Abington, Barnwell, Tilney</hi> and <hi>Tichburn,</hi> the Conſpirators were all Sworn to Secrecy, and had ſeveral Conſults, as in <hi>Pauls-Church,</hi> St. <hi>Giles in the Fields,</hi> and in divers Taverns; and proceeded to that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that they had alſo their <hi>Pictures</hi> drawn to the Life, all in one Table, with <hi>Babington</hi> in the midſt, thus Circumſcrib'd,

The <hi>Plot</hi> being thus laid to murder Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and at the ſame inſtant to free the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> Forrein Forces to land, Rebels at home ready to joyn with them, and all things in ſo forward a poſture, it will be convenient to obſerve how this <hi>deſperate Contrivance</hi> was brought to nought: The before-mentioned <hi>Gifford,</hi> the Prieſt, born in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> not far from <hi>Chartley,</hi> where the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> was kept, was ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver about this time by the Fugitives into <hi>England,</hi> under the counterfeit name of <hi>Luſon,</hi> to remember <hi>Savage</hi> of his Oath, and ſecrerly to <hi>convey Letters</hi> to and fro, between the Queen and her Correſpondents, which for ſome time he performed; for by corrupting a <hi>Brewer</hi> belonging to <hi>Amias Paulet,</hi> at a hole in a Wall, into which a ſtone was put, ſo that it might be taken out, he ſecretly ſent in, and receiv'd back Letters; but the ſaid <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> whether troubled in <hi>conſcience,</hi> or corrupted with <hi>bribes;</hi> or terrified through <hi>fear,</hi> or (which I eſteem more probable) <hi>appointed ſo to do,</hi> that he might precipitate the Queen to deſtruction, diſcloſed the whole Intrigue to Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> and communicated to him all the Letters that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way he receiv'd, who <hi>unſeal'd</hi> and <hi>Copied</hi> them, and then by the rare skill of one <hi>Phillips,</hi> found out a Key to the Ciphers, and by the dexterity of one <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſealed them up again, ſo that <hi>they</hi> could not be perceiv'd to have been <hi>open'd,</hi> and then diſpatch't them away, as directed.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by this means having notice of the ſtorm that hung o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her head, thought fit to prevent it in time; and when <hi>Walſingham</hi> would have ſuffered them to have proceeded further, the Queen refuſed, <hi>leſt</hi> (as ſhe ſaid) <hi>in not taking heed of danger when ſhe might, ſhe ſhould ſeem more to tempt God than to hope in him.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Babington</hi> and the reſt were ſought after, and having in vain endeavour'd to abſcond, were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and upon a fair Tryal, and their own <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being much exaſperated againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> cauſed her Cabinets and <hi>Papers</hi> to be ſeized, wherein many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were found, and Copies of Letters both to and from <hi>Strangers,</hi> and alſo from divers <hi>Noblemen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> prudently diſſembled and buried in ſilence. As for <hi>Gifford,</hi> who made the diſcovery, he was ſoon after ſent into <hi>France,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Baniſhment.</hi> Now that this <hi>Gifford</hi> might be ſet on work by the Jeſuits, is very <hi>ſuſpitious;</hi> for 'tis very unlikely, that he who firſt labour'd to perſwade <hi>Savage</hi> of the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of murdering of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and came over on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to <hi>remind</hi> him of that Vow, ſhould all on a <hi>ſudden</hi> have ſo tender a Conſcience, or ſo much <hi>love,</hi> forſooth, to his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> as of his own accord to diſcover the Intrigue, had he not a ſecret <hi>deſign</hi> to manage thereby, which is more probable, becauſe 'tis plain they were now grown out of hope of reſtoring their Religion, either by the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> or her Son, and therefore began to ſet up a <hi>feigned Title</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and imploy'd one of their Society into <hi>England</hi> (as is affirmed by <hi>Paſquier</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Author) to draw off the <hi>Gentry</hi> from her to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to thruſt her <hi>headlong into theſe dangerous counſels,</hi> which brought her to her end; and at the ſame time, leſt the <hi>Guiſes</hi> her kindred ſhould give her any aſſiſtance, ſtirred them up to new enterpriſes againſt the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varr,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her ſelf was not unacquainted with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to ſet up the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> for amongſt other things we find, ſhe one time uſed theſe words<hi>—When I being in Priſon, and languiſhed with care, without</hi>

               <hi>hope of Liberty, and there was not any more hope left for ever bringing to paſs theſe things, which very many expected of me in my ſickneſs and declining age, many thought it fit that the Succeſſion of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>or in a Catholick</hi> Engliſh <hi>man; and a Book was brought to prove the Right of the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>which being not admitted by me, I offended many.—Hiſtory of the Life and Death of</hi> Mary Steuart <hi>Queen of</hi> Scotland, <hi>dedicated to her Son King</hi> James, <hi>p.</hi> 400.</p>
            <p>But leaving this <hi>Conjecture</hi> to the Judicious Reader, however it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, the <hi>event</hi> proved Funerous to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen: for her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being examined about the <hi>Papers</hi> found in her Cloſet, of their own accord acknowledged, that theſe in her Name were of their hand-writings, but <hi>Indited</hi> by her in <hi>French,</hi> that ſhe <hi>receiv'd</hi> Letters from <hi>Babington,</hi> and that they wrote back <hi>by her commandment</hi> the Anſwers there found.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Queen after ſome debate reſolved to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her upon the before recited Act of <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> But when it was ſaid, That according to the Formalities of Law ſhe ought to be Tried at the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> by a Country Jury, and to hold up her hand at the <hi>Bar,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would by no means hear thereof, judging it very unbecoming her <hi>Royal Quality;</hi> and therefore choſe rather to iſſue forth a Commiſſion to divers <hi>Noblemen,</hi> and chief Perſonages of the Realm, together with the Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who met at <hi>Fodringhay-</hi>Caſtle in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> (where ſhe was then kept) on the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1586. and proceeded as in the ſubſequent Papers is related.</p>
            <p>And afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of the ſame Month, in the <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (to which time and place the Commiſſioners had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd themſelves) the <hi>ſentence</hi> againſt her was pronounc'd and confirm'd with the <hi>Seals</hi> and Subſcriptions of the Commiſſioners. Whereupon both the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, ſpeedily ſent their Ambaſſadors to intercede on her behalf with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> uſing all perſwaſive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; that <hi>natural affection</hi> in the one, and likeneſs of Condition, and ancient friendſhip in the other could ſuggeſt. But when the loud voice of <hi>neceſſity</hi> of State ſeem'd to drown all their Reaſons, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador <hi>l' Aubeſpine,</hi> reſolves to prevent Blood with Blood; (and to ſave the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> life, contrives to take away Queen <hi>Elizabeths;</hi> and deals with one Mr. <hi>Stafford</hi> (whoſe Mother was of the Bed-Chamber to Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> about it, who having not an heart to act ſuch a Villany him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, recommended one <hi>Moody</hi> a deſperate Ruſſian taken out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Goal, who for money undertook it. But then they could not agree in the manner; <hi>Moody</hi> propounded <hi>Poyſon,</hi> or to lay a <hi>Bag</hi> of Gunpowder under the Queens Bed, and ſuddenly fire it, (ſo that the Treaſon of that kind againſt King <hi>James,</hi> was not altogether a <hi>new invention,</hi> but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had long before inſpired ſome <hi>bloody Papiſts</hi> with the notion); but <hi>Trap</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors Secretary liked neither of there Expedients, but would have her kill'd as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was late before, who was ſhot into the Body with three Bullets, by one <hi>Balthazar Gerard</hi> a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> inſtigated thereunto by the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But whilſt they were th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Yet never did <hi>Clemency</hi> and <hi>good nature</hi> more bravely reſiſt the charms of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and dread of danger, than in the noble breaſt of our Queen; for how extreamly loth ſhe was to conſent to the death of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> appears by the ſeveral Applications made by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to move her thereunto. As firſt, at <hi>Richmond</hi> on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Pucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> Speaker of the Houſe of Commons did in the name of that Houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto her Majeſty the divers apparent and imminent dangers that might grow to her <hi>Royal perſon,</hi> and to her Realm from the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen and her Adherents, if remedy were not provided, which he delivered as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt touching the danger of her Majeſties Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Both this</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Queen and her Favourers do think her to have Right not only to ſucceed, but to enjoy</hi> your Crown <hi>in poſſeſſion; and therefore as ſhe is a moſt Impatient Competitor, ſo will ſhe not ſpare any means whatſoever that may bereave us of your Majeſty, the only impediment that ſhe enjoyeth not her deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>She is obdurate in malice againſt your Royal Perſon, notwithſtanding you have ſhewed her all favour and mercy, as well in preſerving her Kingdom, as ſaving her life, and ſalving her honour. And therefore there is no place for</hi> mercy, <hi>ſince there is</hi> no hope <hi>ſhe will deſiſt from moſt wicked attempts, the rather for that her malice appeareth ſuch, that ſhe maketh (as it were) her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of the ſame, to be executed after her death, and appointeth her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors to perform it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>She openly and boldly profeſſed it lawful for her to move Invaſion upon you; and therefore as of Invaſion victory may enſue, and of victory the death of the vanquiſhed: ſo did ſhe thereby not obſcurely bewray, that ſhe thought it lawful for her to deſtroy your Sacred Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>She thinks it not only</hi> lawful, <hi>but honourable alſo, and meritorious to take your life from you, as being already deprived of your Crown by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the</hi> Holy Father, <hi>and therefore it is like ſhe will (as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe hath done) continually ſeek it by whatſoever means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That ſhe is greedy of your Majeſties</hi> death, <hi>and preferred it before her own life and ſafety. For in her direction to one of her late Complices, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed under covert terms that whatſoever ſhould become of her, that Tragical Execution ſhould be perform'd on you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Touching the danger of the overthrow of the true Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is moſt perilous to ſpare her, that continually hath ſought the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and ſuppreſſion of true Religion, infected with Popery from her tender youth, and being after confederate in that</hi> Holy League <hi>when ſhe came to age, and ever ſince a profeſſed enemy againſt the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>She reſteth wholly upon</hi> Popiſh hopes <hi>to deliver and advance her, and is thereby ſo devoted to that profeſſion, that as well for ſatisfaction of others, as for feeding of her own humour, ſhe will ſupplant the Goſpel, where and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe may, which evil is ſo much the greater, and the more to be avoided, as that it ſlayeth the</hi> very ſoul, <hi>and will ſpread it ſelf not only over</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>but alſo in thoſe parts beyond Sea, where the Goſpel of God is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the which cannot but be exceedingly weakned by the defection of this Noble Iſland.</hi>

               <hi>Thirdly, Touching the peril of the ſtate of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As the</hi> Lydians <hi>ſaid,</hi> Unum Regem agnoſcunt Lydi, duos autem to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerare non poſſunt; <hi>ſo we ſay,</hi> Unicam Reginam Elizabethem agnoſcunt Angli, duas autem tolerare non poſſunt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As ſhe hath already by her allurements brought to deſtruction more</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen <hi>and their houſes, together with a greater multitude of the</hi> Commons <hi>of this Realm, during her being here, than ſhe ſhould have been able to do, if ſhe had been in poſſeſſion of her own Crown, and armed in the</hi> Field <hi>againſt us: ſo will ſhe be the continual cauſe of the like ſpoils, to the greater loſs and peril of this Eſtate; and therefore this Realm neither</hi> can <hi>nor</hi> may <hi>endure her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Again, She is the</hi> only hope of all diſcontented Subjects; <hi>ſhe is the</hi> foundation <hi>whereon</hi> all the evil-diſpoſed do build; <hi>ſhe is the</hi> Root from whence all Rebellions and Treacheries do ſpring; <hi>and therefore whilſt this hope laſteth, this foundation ſtandeth, and this Root liveth, they will retain heart, and</hi> ſet on foot all their deviſes <hi>againſt the Realm, which</hi> otherwiſe <hi>will fall away, die, and come to nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Mercy now in this caſe towards her, would in the end prove</hi> Cruelty <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us all,</hi> Nam eſt quaedam Crudelis Miſericordia, <hi>and therefore to</hi> ſpare <hi>her is to</hi> ſpill <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Beſides, It will exceedingly grieve, and in a manner deadly wound the hearts of all good Subjects of your Land, if they ſhall ſee a Conſpiracy ſo horrible not condignly puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Thouſands of your Majeſties moſt Leige and Loving Subjects of all ſorts and degrees, that in a tender zeal of your Majeſties ſafety, have moſt willingly both by open Subſcription and</hi> ſolemn Vow, <hi>entered into a firm and</hi> loyal Aſſociation, <hi>and have thereby proteſted to purſue unto the death by all forcible and poſſible means ſuch as ſhe is by juſt Sentence found to be; can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcharge their love, nor well ſave their</hi> Oaths, <hi>if your Majeſty ſhall keep her alive; of which burden your Majeſties Subjects are moſt deſirous to be</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>as the ſame may be if Juſtice be done.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, <hi>Your Majeſties moſt loving and dutiful Commons doubt not, but as your Majesty is duly exerciſed in reading the</hi> Book of God, <hi>ſo it will pleaſe you to call to your Princely remembrance, how fearful the examples of Gods vengeance be, that are to be found against King</hi> Saul <hi>for</hi> ſparing <hi>King</hi> Agag, <hi>and against King</hi> Ahab <hi>for ſaving the life of</hi> Benhadad; <hi>both which were by the just Judgment of God</hi> deprived of their Kingdoms, <hi>for ſparing thoſe wicked Princes whom God had delivered into their hands of purpoſe to be</hi> ſlain <hi>by them, as by the Ministers of his Eternal and Divine Justice; wherein full wiſely</hi> Solomon <hi>proceeded to puniſhment when he took the life of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural elder Brother</hi> Adonias, <hi>for the only intention of a Marriage that gave ſuſpition of</hi> Treaſon <hi>against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herein We your Majesties most loving and dutiful Subjects earnestly depend upon your Princely reſolution, which we aſſure our ſelves ſhall be to</hi> God <hi>most acceptable, and to us no other than the state of your Regal Authority may afford us, and the approved Arguments of your tender care for our ſafety under your Charge, doth promiſe to our expectation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Addreſs the Queen returned Anſwer in a <hi>large Speech,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Printed,</hi> and too long here to recite; but amongſt other things ſhe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe expreſſions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albeit, I find my life hath been dangerouſly ſought, and my death contrived</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66112:12"/>
               <hi>without deſert, yet I am therein ſo clear from malice, as I proteſt it is, and hath been to me the greateſt grief, that one not different in Sex, of like Eſtate, and near of kin, ſhould fall into ſo great a crime: yea, I had ſo little purpoſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue her with malice, that as it is not unknown to ſome of my Lords here, I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wrote her a Better upon the diſcovery of ſeveral Treaſons, that if ſhe would privately acknowledg them by her Letters to my ſelf, ſhe ſhould never be called ſo publickly in queſtion for them; neither did I that to circumvent her, for I knew then as much as ſhe could confeſs, and ſo did I write. And if even yet, now that the matter is made but too apparent, I thought ſhe truly would repent (as perhaps ſhe would eaſily appear in outward ſhew to do,) and that for her, none other would take the matter upon them, or that but mine own life only were in danger, and not the whole eſtate of your Religion and well doings; I proteſt I would moſt willingly pardon and remit this offence. Or if by my death other Nations and Kingdoms might ſay, that this Realm had attained an ever proſperous and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Eſtate, I would (I aſſure you) not deſire to live, but gladly give my life, to the end it might procure you a better Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not unmindful of your Oath made in the Aſſociation, manifeſting your great good wills and affections, taken and entred into, upon good Conſcience and true knowledg of the guilt, for ſafety of my perſon, and conſervation of my life, done, I proteſt to God before I heard it, or ever thought of ſuch a matter, until a great number of hands, with many obligations, were ſhewed me, which as I do acknowledg as a perfect argument of your true hearts and great zeal to my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo ſhall my bond be ſtronger tied to greater care for all your good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But foraſmuch as this matter is rare, weighty and of great conſequence, I think you do not look for any preſent reſolution; the rather for that, as it is not my manner in matters of farleſs moment to give ſpeedy anſwer without due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; ſo in this of ſuch importance, I think it very requiſite with earnest prayers to beſeech the Divine Majesty ſo to illuminate my understanding, and inſpire me with his grace, as I may determine that which ſhall ſerve to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his Church, preſervation of your Estates, and the proſperity of this Commonwealth under my charge, wherein (for that I know delay is dangerous) you ſhall have with all conveniency our reſolution delivered by our Meſſage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this, her Majeſty ſent to <hi>both Houſes,</hi> earneſtly charging them to conſider of ſome expedients, whereby ſhe might ſpare the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, and yet preſerve her own Life and State; who having ſeverally in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Houſes, and jointly at ſeveral <hi>Conferences</hi> debated the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Nemine contra dicente,</hi> That there was no other effectual means or <hi>expedient</hi> could be ſound out for continuance of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> (I uſe herein their own words,) quiet of the Realm, and ſafety of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties <hi>Perſon,</hi> than that which was contained in their former Petition: Which was back't by another <hi>Speech</hi> of the Speaker of the Commons, aſſigning, by the direction of the Houſe, theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> for ſuch their reſolution, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if her Majesty ſhould be ſafe without taking away the life of the</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <hi>Queen, the ſame were most probably, by one of theſe means following,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That happily ſhe might be</hi> reclaimed, <hi>and become a</hi> Repentant-Convert, <hi>aſſigning her Majesties great mercy and favours in remitting her heinous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by her</hi> Loyalty <hi>hereafter perform the fruits of ſuch Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Or elſe, by a more</hi> ſtreight Guard <hi>be ſo kept, as there ſhould be no fear of the like attempts hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Or that good aſſurance might be given by</hi> Oath, <hi>Bonds or Hostages, as cautions for her good and loyal demeanour from henceforth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:66112:12"/>
4. <hi>Or, laſtly, by Baniſhment, the Realm might be voided of her Perſon, and thereby the perils further removed that grow to her Majeſty by her Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which being duly pondered, did yet appear ſo light in all their Judgments, that they durſt not adviſe any ſecurity to reſt in any, no not in all of them. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Touching her</hi> Converſion, <hi>it was conſidered, That if Piety or Duty could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained her from ſuch heinous Attempts, there was cauſe enough miniſtred to her on her Majeſties behalf, when ſhe not only protected her againſt the violence of her own Subjects, who purſued her to death by Juſtice, but covered her</hi> Honour, <hi>when the ſame by publick Fame was touched, and the very Heinous and Capital Crimes objected againſt her before certain Commiſſary Delegates aſſigned to examine the ſame; and ſpared her Life, when for her former Conſpiracies and Confederacies with the Northern Rebels, Her Highneſs was with great Inſtance preſſed by both Houſes in the 14th year of her Majeſties Reign, to do like juſtice upon her, as is now deſired, and as her Treaſonable practiſes then had moſt juſtly deſerved. And whereas the Penalty of this Act ſufficiently notified unto her, ſhould have terrified her from ſo wicked attempts; ſhe hath nevertheleſs inſiſted in her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practiſes, as a perſon obdurate in Malice againſt her Majeſty, and irrecoverable; ſo as there was no probable hope of any Converſion, but rather great doubt and fear of Relapſe, foraſmuch as ſhe ſtood obſtinately in the denial of matter moſt evidently proved, and now moſt juſtly ſentenced againſt her, and was not entred into the firſt part of Repentance, the Recognition of her offence, and ſo much the farther off from the true fruits that ſhould accompany the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As for a</hi> ſurer Guard, <hi>and more ſtrait Impriſonment, it was reſolved, That there was no ſecurity therein nor yet in the</hi> two other <hi>means propounded of</hi> Bonds <hi>and</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages: <hi>For aſmuch as the ſame means that ſhould be practiſed to take her Majeſties Life away (which God forbid), would aptly ſerve both for the Delivery of her Perſon, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of the Bonds and Hoſtages that ſhould be given for Cautions in that behalf; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unhappily atchieved, and to our irrepairable loſs, who ſhould ſue the Bonds, or detain the Hoſtages? or being detained, what proportion was there in Bonds or Hoſtages whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to countervail the value of ſo precious and ineſtimable a Jewel, as her Majeſty is to this Realm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But ſhe will ſolemnly</hi> vow <hi>and take</hi> an Oath, <hi>that ſhe will not attempt any thing to the hurt of her Majeſties Perſon. She hath already ſundry times falſified her Word, her Writing, and her Oath, and holdeth it for an Article of Religion, That</hi> Faith is not to be holden with Hereticks, <hi>of which ſort ſhe accounteth your Majeſty and all the profeſſers of the Goſpel to be; and therefore have we little reaſon to truſt her in that, whereof ſhe maketh ſo ſmall a conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>As for</hi> Baniſhment, <hi>that were a ſtop</hi> à malo in pejus, <hi>to ſet her at liberty; a thing ſo greatly deſired and thirſted for by her Adherents, and by ſome Princes her Allies, who ſought her Enlargement chiefly to make her</hi> a Head <hi>to ſet up againſt her Majeſty in time of Invaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore her Majeſties Death being ſo earneſtly ſought for Advancement of this Competitor, Her Highneſs could not remain in quietneſs or ſecurity, if the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Queen ſhould longer continue her Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding all theſe Applications and Reaſons, the Queen ſuſpended her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and Anſwered this ſecond Addreſs with a Reſerv'd Speech, which at once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd her Love and Tenderneſs to her Kinſwoman, and her Regards to the ſafety of her People; proteſting, That ſhe was ſo far from <hi>Cruelty,</hi> that for her own Life ſhe would not touch Hers; and that her Care had not been ſo much how to <hi>preſerve her ſelf,</hi> as <hi>both,</hi> which ſhe was ſorry was become ſo hard, or rather impoſſible; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That as ſhe conceived their Conſultations <hi>Wiſe, Honourable and Conſciencious;</hi> ſo ſhe deſired for the preſent to ſuſpend her poſitive Anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far was this Pious Queen <hi>perplext</hi> in this Affair, that ſhe abandon'd the Comforts of Society, and would oft ſit <hi>ſolitary,</hi> without ſpeaking a word to any: But at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Daviſon,</hi> one of her Secretaries, a <hi>Warrant</hi> ſigned with her own hand, for the Iſſuing a Commiſſion under the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it might be ready upon any Imminent danger; yet charging him not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint any therewith. And the very next day ſent him a <hi>Countermand;</hi> but he then acquainted her Majeſty, that the Commiſſion was already made, and paſs'd the <hi>Seal;</hi> at which the Queen appear'd angry, and blam'd him for his haſte. And indeed he had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66112:13"/>
Communicated the buſineſs to ſeveral of the Council, and perſwaded them, who were apt enough to <hi>believe</hi> what they <hi>deſired,</hi> that the Queen Commanded that it ſhould be put in Execution without delay. And ſo (having obtain'd ſuch <hi>Warrant</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion)</hi> they without her Majeſties privity, ſent down one <hi>Beal</hi> with Authority directed to the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Kent, Darby</hi> and others, to ſee her Executed. Which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd accordingly; The Manner and Circumſtances whereof, the Reader may find in the enſuing <hi>Narrative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was put to Death the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1587. in the Six and fortieth year of her Age, and <hi>18th</hi> of her Confinement; her Body being Honourably Buried in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deal of <hi>Peterborough;</hi> and from thence afterwards removed by her Son King <hi>Jame's,</hi> and laid under a Royal Monument in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chappel at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Variouſly was this Action cenſur'd; and I ſhall only ſay, That though the <hi>Phyſick</hi> was <hi>violent</hi> and extraordinary, yet it wrought a <hi>Cure,</hi> and preſerv'd the Body-politick from thoſe Domeſtick Paroxiſms of Treaſon and Rebellion, that before daily diſturb'd and endanger'd it; for we do not find after that, any, or at leaſt very few Conſpiracies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt the Queens Life, or the Government, though ſhe lived afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 14 and 15 years: For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, though it happened two years after, was not only a thing <hi>Foreign,</hi> but Contriv'd and Deſign'd before the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Death.</p>
            <p>And as for the Proceedings againſt the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Crimes for which he was proſecuted had their Riſe likewiſe in precedent times: For firſt having been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned and confined to his Houſe, and then ſet at Liberty, he attempted to fly beyond Sea, and therefore was Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> not only for the ſame, but likewiſe for Harbouring Prieſts, and Correſponding with <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuits, was fined 10000 Marks; and afterwards continuing his Diſloyal practiſes, was for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the following Papers ſpecified, Condemned; though by the Queens mercy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved,</hi> and dyed naturally in the <hi>Tower</hi> in the year 1595.</p>
            <p>Two things further I muſt Remark: 1. What a ſtrange <hi>Bias,</hi> and almoſt prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Influence <hi>Popery</hi> has even on the <hi>beſt</hi> diſpoſitions, prevailing ſo far with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Earl, that even contrary to <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf (and yet bate but his Religion, he is Repreſented as a <hi>good-Natur'd</hi> man), He rejoyced with hopes of the <hi>Ruine</hi> of his Countrey. <hi>2ly,</hi> That if you look over the <hi>Liſts</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> Commiſſionated in theſe Tranſactions, you will find them to be of great and ancient Houſes; and though ſome of their Families have almoſt ever ſince been of the <hi>Roman</hi> perſwaſion, yet they were then ſo well ſatisfied with the Proceedings, that we meet not with <hi>One Voice</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a <hi>Not Guilty</hi> in all the three Tryals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is one of the beſt Tutors of <hi>Policy,</hi> whereby the Ingenious will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how far <hi>former</hi> Occurrences hold parallel with, or may be conſidered in relation to <hi>Modern</hi> Affairs.</p>

               <note place="margin">Duke.</note> to my Charge, and exaſperate the matters which be not Treaſon; you may do your Duty, yet conſcionably: and then, ſomewhat ſmiling, he ſaid, I had almoſt forgotten, <hi>a man ſuſpected is half condemned.</hi> I have been charged with an Oath, I proteſt I took the Oath but to part, and that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66112:15"/>
I ſhall prove; I pray you lay it not to my Diſcredit. Then ſaid Serjeant <hi>Barnham,</hi> He that will marry one that Claimeth the Crown, meaneth to <note place="margin">Barnham.</note> 
               <hi>aſpire</hi> to the ſame. This matter begun at the ſame time, as the Duke was one of the Commiſſioners, for the hearing of the Cauſe betwixt the late Scottiſh Queen, and the Lords of <hi>Scotland;</hi> at which time the Duke took an <hi>Oath</hi> to deal directly therein, and to weigh uprightly both the occaſions and anſwers; wherein, notwitſtanding, he dealt <hi>indirectly,</hi> and partially, thereby committing <hi>Perjury,</hi> and diſcloſing the Queens <hi>Secrets,</hi> if he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, then we will prove it. Then ſaid the Duke, The Caſe hath divers parts cleane out of the Compaſs of Treaſon. Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Barnham,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">Duke. <hi>Barnham.</hi> Duke.</note> knowledge, if he knew the <hi>Claiming of the Crown?</hi> The Duke did here digreſs, and anſwered <hi>not directly:</hi> Wherefore the Lord Steward ſaid, <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note> Your Lordſhip muſt anſwer directly. And after upon the urging of <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Queens Attorney, The Duke confeſſed the Claim, but not the <hi>Continuance:</hi> Then <hi>Barnham</hi> ſhewed the continuance by her Refuſal <note place="margin">Barnham.</note> hitherto to acknowledge the Queens Majeſty to be <hi>Lawful</hi> Queen, and that ſhe hath not yet <hi>Renounced</hi> her Claim; and yet you have ſo far dealt with her as being the Queens Commiſſioner to hear the matters, you opened to her the occaſions, you gave her inſtructions how ſhe might deal, that the matters might not come to light; and you conferred with the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> about the ſame, for proof whereof was ſhewed the <hi>Examination of Roſſe,</hi> taken the Sixth day of <hi>November,</hi> 1571, declaring that the Duke ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi>
               </note> unto him all that he underſtood of the matter, and promiſed what help he could; but he ſpoke nothing of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> but referred all to <hi>Liddington,</hi> who cauſed the Duke to ſtay the Conference, and ſhewed her good will; And how he was ſent to accompany the Earl of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and to convey the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queens Letters away, and to counterfeit others; and this was proved by a Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſes</hi> to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, where he ſhewed, that the Duke did Advertiſe him, that he went about to diſcredit the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen, with the people of <hi>England;</hi> that he might be the leſs able to attempt any thing againſt the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this matter the Duke anſwered at large, That <hi>Liddington</hi> onely moved the <hi>Marriage</hi> unto him, which he at that time refuſed, and that he <note place="margin">Duke.</note> told the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> that he could not deal to take up the matter, and therefore to what end ſhould he utter any thing to him, he only ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would only turn to his <hi>diſhonour;</hi> and that he ſhould never be able to win it out: And then he prayed that <hi>Roſſe</hi> might be brought preſently before him.</p>
            <p>Then was ſhewed a Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſes,</hi> wherein it was contain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, that whereas it was appointed, that the Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi> ſhould have been <hi>murthered</hi> in the North, going from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court to <hi>Scotland:</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke had communed with the Earl of <hi>Murrey</hi> at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, touching the ſame matter; and had his Aſſent thereunto, the murther ſhould be ſtayed: There was alſo a Letter of the Dukes ſhewed, moving the marriage at that time, and that it ſhould be for the benefit of the whole Iſland: And yet the Duke, when the Rumour was ſpread that he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to marry the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Queen as one ſeeming to be much offended therewith, came to the Queen and ſhewed her thereof, and found much fault with the ſaid Rumour: and ſaid he miſliked her for her former Life, And that the <hi>whole Revenue</hi> of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> (the Charges Deducted) was not ſo <hi>good as his living in</hi> England; and that he thought himſelf as <hi>good</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:66112:15"/>
               <hi>a Prince</hi> in his bowling Alley at <hi>Norwich,</hi> as if he were King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this was affirmed by Mr. <hi>Barnham,</hi> That he heard the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty her ſelf ſpeak it, and by the Dukes Examination, taken the Sixth <note place="margin">Affirmations of <hi>Barnham.</hi>
               </note> day of <hi>November,</hi> 1571. It is evident.</p>
            <p>Alſo he ſaid it was further ſhewed, that at <hi>Tichfield</hi> he had ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment not to proceed in that Marriage any further; and that <hi>contrary to that Commandment</hi> he had proceeded; and yet the Duke himſelf had conceived an evil Opinion of her; and had declared unto <hi>Baniſter,</hi> that <note place="margin">Baniſter.</note> he thought verily the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen was privy to the murther of her Husband: All theſe things were affirmed by <hi>Barnham,</hi> to prove that the proceeding in this Marriage, could be for no other cauſe, but to Aſpire to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, <hi>This Year is very far fetched</hi> to prove the deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Duke.</note> of the Queen, and the deſtruction of her Perſon.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Barnham,</hi> to come ſomewhat near, it is not unknown, that you have gone about to procure it by <hi>force,</hi> and to have conſpired to <note place="margin">Barnham.</note> take the <hi>Tower;</hi> this being true, you muſt needs go about the diſtruction of the Queens perſon: For the Jealouſie of a Kingdom is ſuch, as will not ſuffer them to <hi>live,</hi> that would hinder the ſame: And at the ſame time the Duke departed into <hi>Norfolk</hi> to levy a Force.</p>
            <p>Alſo there was Read a Letter written by the Duke to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen, that proved the Negotiating the ſaid marriage.</p>
            <p>And there was as alſo Read many ill Letters of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queens ſent to <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whereby it could not be that he pretended the Marriage for love of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but for the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the taking of the Tower; the Duke ſaid, that <hi>Owen Hopton</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke. <hi>Owen Hopton</hi> Servant to a Noble man of the Realm. Earl of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook.</hi>
               </note> came to him, and adviſed him to take the Tower, which he diſliked.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Barnham,</hi> why did you then afterwards Conſult with the Earl of <hi>Penbrook,</hi> touching the ſame matter? Who diſcomforted you therein?</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, what do you gather thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barnham</hi> ſaid, they uſe not to <hi>Cut Vines while they be green, that would have</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke.</note> 
               <hi>them grow again.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Barnham.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo ſhewed further, That whereas the Queens Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen, and certain Caſtles in her Poſſeſſion, and the Rebels delivered unto her: The Duke gave adviſe to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen to the contrary, and againſt the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo he was charged, That he went about to procure the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen to be <hi>ſtolen away,</hi> and that after his Submiſſion, wherein he promis'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand and Seal, never to deal in that matter of the Marriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>There was alſo ſhewed a Proviſion, which he ſhewed to one <hi>Robert Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hickford.</note> which was proved by the Examination of <hi>Hickford,</hi> to whom he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, terming it a <hi>fooliſh Gawd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, you may perceive I did not eſteem of it, when I <note place="margin">Duke.</note> termed it a <hi>fooliſh Gawd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then was brought forth one <hi>Candiſh,</hi> who was Sworn in this manner. <hi>The Evidence that you ſhall give to the Peers and Nobles here aſſembled,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Candiſh</hi> his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be the Troth, and the whole Troth, ſo help you God, and the Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The effect of his Evidence was, That being at <hi>South-Hampton</hi> with the Duke, and walking in his Chamber, he gave adviſe to the Duke to travel
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66112:16"/>
for the Queens good-will in the Marriage of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queen.</p>
            <p>And the Duke anſwered He <hi>would have her, or elſe it ſhould coſt him his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke.</note> 
               <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at another time the Lord <hi>Lomley</hi> being at <hi>Haywards</hi> place, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Duke. <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Lomley.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Duke turned unto <hi>Candiſh,</hi> and asking him, ſaying, Canſt <note place="margin">Duke.</note> thou accuſe me of any thing, I defie thee to thy Teeth.</p>
            <p>And he anſwered, That he would accuſe him of nothing except it were about the Marriage. And alſo the ſaid <hi>Candiſh</hi> ſaid. That the Duke at <note place="margin">Candiſh.</note> 
               <hi>Kemminghall</hi> when he went from the <hi>Charter-Houſe</hi> Church-yard, did ſay to the ſaid <hi>Candiſh,</hi> there was nothing to undo them, but the riſing of the <hi>Northern</hi> Lords, if they ſhould then ariſe; and that the Duke did farther ask him <hi>if the Queen were dead,</hi> and whether by means thereof he might procure his Unckle <hi>Candiſh</hi> to be on his ſide.</p>
            <p>Theſe maters the Duke utterly denyed, and declared of how <hi>ſmall Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> the ſaid <hi>Candiſh</hi> was, and how he <hi>gave him money;</hi> and that he was of <note place="margin">Duke.</note> no Eſtimation.</p>
            <p>It was further ſhewed how the Duke ſent one <hi>Haber</hi> to the Earls, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Candiſh.</note> them not to riſe, for if they did they were all undone.</p>
            <p>There was alſo ſhewed a Letter of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Queens writing to the Duke in <hi>Cyphers,</hi> which was Read and Decyphered, which declared her ſorrow upon a Rumour, that the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was taken long before the riſing. <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>To all theſe matters the Duke anſwered, That it was unlikely that he ſhould thus proceed, if it were true that he were charged with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing <note place="margin">Duke.</note> and imagining the Queens deprivation, and that the chiefeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him was <hi>Roſſe,</hi> who by <hi>Bracton</hi> ought not to be received as a Witneſs, nor to be credited, and therefore no Evidence to prove any over-fact. Alſo he further ſaid, that <hi>Haber</hi> never came to the Earls of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Meſſage, and that he never offer'd <hi>to fly,</hi> which he might have done, if he had thought himſelf Guilty. He ſaid alſo he never eſteemed ſo of thoſe two Earls, that he would truſt them with his Life; if they can prove any ſuch thing, he would yield himſelf Guilty.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Jarrat,</hi> the Queens Attorney General, you have heard the Attempt of the Marriage, well and ſufficiently proved. For the <note place="margin">Jarrat.</note> firſt over-fact, wherein is proved the compaſſing of the deprivation of the Queens Highneſs.</p>
            <p>The Second over-fact is the dealing with the Pope, King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> for the bringing in of a Power to land within this Realm, <note place="margin">Pope, King <hi>Philip,</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
               </note> which God hath revealed wonderfully according to the ſaying <hi>nihil eſt tam occultum quod non revelatur,</hi> when it was firſt opened, it came by ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds Delivered and Sealed in a Bag to one of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> only for <hi>Fifty, Pounds,</hi> who could not be in quiet untill it was opened to ſome of the Council that then by occaſion were here in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen and the Council underſtanding of the whole matter, and after by occaſion of Letters directed to 40. and 30.</p>
            <p>But now it appeareth that by 40 the Duke is meant, and by 30 another noble man.</p>
            <p>The Dukes Secretary dealing with <hi>Ranolph</hi> found the Cyphers hidden in the Tiles of the Houſe; and found it out by chance. Alſo a Letter Decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered <note place="margin">Dukes Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</note> by <hi>Hickford</hi> commanded by the Duke to to be <hi>burnt</hi> was found out under the Mat going to the Dukes Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66112:16"/>
Theſe Matters are to be proved by the Examination of thoſe that are neither indicted nor convicted of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The Duke hereunto made a large Anſwer: The effect was,</p>
            <p>That it was a Courſe intended by others, which he wholly <hi>miſliked;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke.</note> and that they ſhould be guilty of their own Treaſons, and not to lay it on his Shoulders, to eaſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Jarrat,</hi> you had Conference your ſelf with <hi>Ranolph</hi> for <note place="margin">Jarrat.</note> the bringing in of 10000 Men out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be landed at <hi>Harwich;</hi> whereof 3000 ſhould be Horſe-men of proof.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof was read the Examination of <hi>Baker</hi> to the ninth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogative.</p>
            <p>It was further ſhewed, that <hi>Ranolph</hi> and he conferred about ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching the ſame matters.</p>
            <p>The Letters were, one to King <hi>Phillip,</hi> and the other to the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that <hi>Ranolph</hi> ſhould ſend thoſe Men, and return himſelf within ſix Weeks, that the Duke, before the end of the Parliament, might confer with his Friends.</p>
            <p>But when theſe Letters were made, the Duke would not ſubſcribe unto them: and then it was deviſed by <hi>Roſſe,</hi> that the Duke ſhould ſend <hi>Baker</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, to ſhew him that the Duke was contented with thoſe Letters, and that they ſhould paſs as his, and that he did <hi>allow them as his own,</hi> and that the Spaniſh Ambaſſador ſhould certifie him thereof.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, My Memory is too weak to anſwer theſe many numbers of matters: you of the Queen's Council have <hi>Notes</hi> of all things, <note place="margin">Duke.</note> and I at a ſuddain muſt anſwer you all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is very unlikely I ſhould deal with the <hi>Pope;</hi> I had rather be torn with wild Horſes than change my Faith.</p>
            <p>The unlikelineſs of <hi>Harwich</hi> may be ſufficient matter to anſwer all. It is known very well how hard it is for a Power to travel in that Country, which is all Lanes, Ditches and Hedges. If I had gone about any ſuch matter, I would have made proviſion for Armour: I have not beſtowed above ten pound in Armour this ten years, except it were eight Corſlets of proof; I have not two Barrels of Gun-powder. All theſe things I would have provided if I had meant any ſuch things. Alſo, I would never have ſent <hi>Baker</hi> of any ſuch Meſſage; but rather <hi>Baniſter,</hi> who I truſted better than twenty <hi>Bakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was then ſhewed forth a Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſes</hi> to the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſes.</hi>
               </note> Queen, which he writ ſince his Impriſonment: which opened the whole matter of the former Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Then the Duke deſired to ſee the Letter, for he doubted whether it was <note place="margin">Duke.</note> his Hand.</p>
            <p>To whom the Lord Steward ſpake, and ſaid; you need not doubt but <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note> that it is the Hand of <hi>Roſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was alſo read a Letter of the Duke's to <hi>Bonells,</hi> written with <hi>Red</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Red O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note> 
               <hi>Oker</hi> ſince the Duke came into the Tower; willing him to bury the Bag of Letters which <hi>Barker</hi> had laid in a certain place, and to lay it on <hi>Roſſe,</hi> whom the <hi>Law</hi> could not touch, becauſe he was an <hi>Ambaſſador.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke anſwered, I received a Letter that I had accuſed divers, and <note place="margin">Duke.</note> that Letter was Anſwer to the ſame: and when I ſaw ſuch ſearching, I gave advice in that matter, for the avoiding of further trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66112:17"/>
There was alſo another Letter of the Duke's, that he could be charged <note place="margin">A Letter.</note> no further than conſenting to that: therefore, if he loved his Life, he ſhould take heed whom he accuſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bromley,</hi> the Queen's Sollicitor General, ſhewed Letters of <hi>Radolphe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bromley.</note> ſent by <hi>Roſſes</hi> Servant to <hi>Charles Bayliffe:</hi> by the which it appeared how the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> liked the matter, and how he enquired how far <hi>Harwich</hi> was from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo he ſhewed the <hi>Pope's Letters,</hi> dated the fourth day of <hi>May,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anſwer of the Letters ſent by the Duke.</p>
            <p>And he further opened, how the whole Courſe of Conſpiracy was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Antwerp</hi> to an Ambaſſador of a Forein Prince, who thereof certified his Lord; and that Forein Prince brought the whole Diſcourſe to the Queen's Majeſty: which, becauſe it touched <hi>others</hi> as well as the Duke, it ſhould be opened to the <hi>Peers,</hi> when they were aſſembled together by thoſe that were of the Queen's Council.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Wilbrome</hi> made an excellent Diſcourſe for the Credit of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and other the Servants of the Duke. <note place="margin">Wilbrome.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Duke anſwered, That he could hardly come after ſo <hi>ſmooth a Tale</hi> as the Attorney of the Court of Wards could tell. But yet, ſaid he, <note place="margin">Duke.</note> in all his Tale he touched nothing what <hi>Fear</hi> could do. And further cited <hi>Bracton</hi> for the diſproof of thoſe Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catlin</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice anſwered, that in ſuch Caſes and matters <note place="margin">Catlin.</note> of Treaſon, the Depoſitions of <hi>Strangers</hi> might be taken; and it lay in the Peers to credit the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then they proceeded to the ſecond Point of Treaſon contained in the Indictment. Which was, to prove the Aid of the <hi>Rebels</hi> after they fled. Which was proved by Order given by the Duke to diſtribute amongſt them his great Reward; whereof the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had part, and the Counteſs of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and the reſidue had other parts.</p>
            <p>Then was ſhewed a Letter of the Counteſs of <hi>Northumberland</hi> of thanks <note place="margin">A Letter.</note> for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Third</hi> Point of Treaſon was the Aiding of the Scotiſh Rebels, the Queen's Enemies. Which was proved by a Letter written by the Duke to <hi>Baniſter;</hi> and alſo, by the Examination of <hi>Baniſter,</hi> and the Delivery <note place="margin">Baniſter.</note> of the Money to <hi>Browne</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and the Earls Letter with the ſame. <note place="margin">Browne.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Duke required the Opinion of the Judges, whether the <hi>Subjects of another Prince,</hi> that Prince being in League with the Queen, may <note place="margin">Duke.</note> be accounted the Queen's <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Catlin</hi> anſwered, that they might well enough; as the Queen <note place="margin">Catlin.</note> may War with any Duke in <hi>France,</hi> and have Peace with the King.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Lord Steward to the Duke, Have you any thing elſe to <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note> ſay.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, I truſt to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Right.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Duke.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Lord Steward; Lieutenant of the Tower, withdraw your Priſoner from us a while. <note place="margin">Lord Steward. Lieutenant.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then was <hi>O yes</hi> made, and Silence proclaimed, and the Lord Steward ſaid: <note place="margin">O yes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You, my Lords here have heard, how that</hi> Thomas <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolk <hi>hath been <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note> indicted of divers Points of High Treaſon, and he hath hereunto pleaded</hi> Not Guilty, <hi>and did put himſelf upon the Tryal of God and You his Peers. You are</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66112:17"/>
               <hi>now therefore to conſider of his whole Indictment which you have heard, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be Guilty, or not Guilty, and thereon ſay your minds upon your Honours and Conſciences.</hi> And ſo he willed them to depart together, and return ſo ſoon as they could; and ſo they departed to a place for that purpoſe, where the <hi>Chancery</hi> is kept, and there they conferred in the ſight of all that were in the Hall, and when they returned to ſit in their places, the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> commanded the Duke to be had further out of hearing. <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Then he asked the <hi>youngeſt</hi> Lord; how ſay you, my Lord <hi>De Laware,</hi> is <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk Guilty</hi> of theſe Treaſons that he hath been Indicted of, yea, or no, and he ſtanding up in his place, anſwered <hi>Guilty;</hi> and the like queſtion was asked of all the Lords ſeverally one after another, and every one anſwered Guilty.</p>
            <p>Then was the Lieutenant willed to bring his Priſoner to the Bar again, <note place="margin">Lieutenant.</note> who being put in his place,</p>
            <p>The Lord Steward ſaid: <hi>Thou,</hi> Thomas <hi>Duke of</hi> Norfolk, <hi>haſt been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note> 
               <hi>of ſeveral points of High Treaſon, and haſt pleaded thereunto not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and haſt put thy ſelf upon Tryal of God, and thy Peers, who have all found thee Guilty; what canſt thou ſay, why Judgment ſhould not be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke anſwered, the Lords will be done; God be Judge between <note place="margin">Duke.</note> me and my <hi>falſe accuſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was made a pawſe a good while, and forthwith the <hi>edge</hi> of the Ax of the Tower was <hi>turned towards</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Barnham</hi> to the Lord Steward, may it pleaſe your Grace to underſtand how <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> hath been Indicted of ſeveral <note place="margin">Barnham.</note> Treaſons, and hath pleaded <hi>not Guilty,</hi> and did put himſelf upon Tryal of the Peers who have found him <hi>Guilty;</hi> I am therefore in the behalf of our Sovereign Lady the Queen to pray <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Lord Steward, whereas thou <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lo. Steward.</note> haſt been Indicted of ſeveral Treoſons, and haſt pleaded thereunto not Guilty; and didſt put thy ſelf upon Tryal of thy Peers who have found thee Guilty.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Court doth award, That <hi>thou ſhalt be had from hence to the Tower, and from thence to be laid upon a Hurdle; and drawn through the midſt of the City to</hi> Tyburn <hi>and there be Hanged until thou be half dead, and then thy bowels to be taken out and burned before thy Face, thy Head to be cut off, and thy Body to be quartered, and thy Head and Quarters to be at Queens Majeſties pleaſure, and the Lord have have mercy on thy Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Duke, You have ſaid to me as unto a Traytor; but I <note place="margin">Duke</note> truſt to God and to the Queen; and foraſmuch as I am excluded your company, I truſt to be where I ſhall find <hi>better company,</hi> I am at the point, I will never <hi>ſue for mercy:</hi> Yet one ſuit I have to you, my Lords, that it will pleaſe you to move the Queens Majeſty to be good to my <hi>poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and to my Servants, and to pay my <hi>Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Lieutenant was commanded to have him away, and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amation <note place="margin">Lieutenant.</note> was made that every man ſhould depart in Gods Name, and the Peace of the Queens Majeſty: And then the Lord Steward <hi>brake his Rod,</hi> and ſo all ended, 1571. <note place="margin">Lord Steward.</note>

                  <hi>IT is not rare, good People, to ſee a man come to die; although,</hi> thanks <hi>be to God, ſince the beginning of the Queens Majeſties Reign, in this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Duke.</note> 
                  <hi>place hath not been</hi> any. <hi>But ſince it is my Fortune to be the</hi> firſt, <hi>I pray God I may be the laſt: Such hath been, and is the mercifulneſs of her Majeſty, whom God long preſerve. You know I have been long looked for in this preſent caſe of mine, divers times in this place; but by her Majeſties Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency prolonged hitherto: It is not common to ſee a man of my Vocation to be a</hi> Speaker: <hi>Nevertheleſs I will be brief, and gladly ſhew you the Eſtate of thoſe</hi> offences <hi>which my Conſcience doth burthen me for: I have been found by my Peers worthy of Death, whereof I do acquit them; for I come not hither to</hi> Juſtifie <hi>my ſelf, neither yet to charge my Peers with Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but rather ſubmit my ſelf to this which God hath prepared for me: And thus conſidering the weakneſs of my Fleſh and Blood, that at ſuch time a mans ſences will partly fail, I do mind to divide my Speeches into</hi> three parts, <hi>deſiring you to take it full and whole, and not to tear it in pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And firſt in dealing in matters</hi> temporal <hi>towards the Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>I dealt not as a good Subject, for that I made not the Queens Majeſty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Duke.</note> 
                  <hi>privy thereunto, which indeed I confeſs I ought not ſo to have done; for this offence I was committed to this houſe [pointing to the Tower,] and upon my humble ſubmiſſion delivered; then making promiſe to the Queens Majeſty, (whom I pray God long to proſper) never to deal in thoſe matters again: But contrary to my ſubmiſſion and Promiſe made to the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, abuſing her Clemency towards me; which hath and doth grieve me more than any one thing hath done; I dealt in this matter again, perfectly for ſaving my Life, and other Cauſes which I could alledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Mr. Sheriff</hi> Branch, <hi>ſtanding by the Duke deſired him very courteouſſy to make an end as ſhort as might be, for the time did ſpend.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Duke beginning again ſaid, it hath been bruited, that I took</hi> my Oath <hi>and received the Sacrament, that I ſhould never deal in thoſe matters again; which is untrue, and yet the Oath too much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now Mr.</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>one of the Officers hearing theſe words, deſired the Duke to be ſhort: We are come hither ſaid he, to</hi> ſee you put to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Chriſtopher.</note> 
                  <hi>and we muſt not delay while theſe Speeches paſs from you, for in this we hazard our Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Duke ſaid, I do not excuſe my ſelf; but I come to diſcharge my Conſcience and to acquit my Peers, and not to complain of any injuſtice, for I have deſerved this, and more a great deal; in that I have abuſed the Queens Majeſties mercy towards me; whom once again with Hands lifted up, I pray God long to Preſerve and Reign over you, and that my death may be an end of all troubles; and to Augment my fault, it is ſaid I had familiarity with evil dealers: Indeed I will confeſs and tell you that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, nor never had Conference, but once with one</hi> Radolph, <hi>and yet never againſt the Queens Majeſty, God is my Judge; although many lewd offers and motions were made to me: For it is well known I had to do with him, by reaſon I was bound to him by Recogniſance for a great ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:66112:18"/>
                  <hi>and for two Letters that came from the</hi> Pope. <hi>I confeſs I did ſee them, the one Cyphered, the other Deſcyphered, I never conſented to them; neither was I conſenting to the late Rebellion in the North, notwithſtanding I come not hither as unguilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the</hi> ſecond <hi>part, I know I have not onely been thought to be a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Duke.</note> 
                  <hi>favourer of Papiſts and a maintainer of them, God is my judge before whom I ſtand (lifting up his Eyes) I thank God I was never</hi> a Papiſt <hi>ſince I knew what Religion meant, but I did always deteſt Papiſtry, and all the vain Toyes thereof, imbracing ever from the bottom of my Heart the true Religion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, truſting by the aſſurance of my Faith in his blood, that is my only Redeemer and Saviour: Indeed I muſt confeſs that I had Servants and Friends that were Papiſts; But if thereby I have offended Gods Church, or any</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, <hi>I deſire God and them to forgive me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well now to the</hi> Third <hi>point wherein I am to ſhew how much I am bound to the Queens Majeſty for her mercifulneſs towards me, in that her Majeſty hath promiſed to be good and gracious to my poor Children. I remember good Father</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>making a Sermon in a more honourable place than this is, out of the Pulpit, (neither do I compare my ſelf to him) He ſaid, That</hi> God did often times take away a good and gracious Prince, for the ſins and diſobedience of his Subjects, <hi>which God grant not to be in theſe days; but that it will pleaſe God to continue and increaſe her Majeſties Years; yea, until the Worlds end, if it be his bleſſed will and pleaſure: You have a moſt gracious Queen as I muſt needs confeſs, and alſo Godly Religion, therefore look that your Livings and Converſations be anſwerable to the Religion of Chriſt, that proves you: That God may proſper the Prince, overthrow the Pope, and maintain your Wealth and Quietneſs. Let not my Perſon, good People, make my</hi> Speech <hi>worſe; they that have Factions (I ſpeak not particularly but generally) let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they be given over betimes; ſeek not to</hi> breviate <hi>Gods doings, leſt God prevent yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then the Sheriff haſtening him, he turned to the People, and embracing Sir</hi> Henry Lee, <hi>ſaid, I have, and always have had as true a Heart to my Prince</hi>

                  <hi>did on his knees deſire forgivneſs of his Death, who did very Courteouſly forgive him; and put into the hand of the Executioner</hi> four Soveraigns of Gold and Eighteen Shillings Six pence of Silver: <hi>This done the Duke kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <hi>down, and the Dean of</hi> Pauls <hi>with him, he made his Prayers to God, and reading the</hi> 51 Pſalm, <hi>ſaying on the laſt Verſe ſaving one, which doth ſay, and</hi> build up the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem, he pawſed and ſaid,</hi> the Walls of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> good Lord: <hi>That Pſalm finiſhed, he began to read another, and at the Seventh Verſe of the Pſalm; he pawſed and ſaid, I had almoſt forgotten, but not too late, I ask all the World forgiveneſs, and I forgive all the World: The Pſalm and theſe words finiſhed, and other Prayers, he wrote one Prayer Counted in effect a Petition to God, that his Faith now at his laſt hour</hi> might not fail, <hi>and finiſhing the Prayer in theſe words, in</hi> Latine <hi>and</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>ſaying:</hi> In manus tuus Domine commendo Spiritum meum, Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Hands I commend my Spirit. <hi>He roſe up and pulled of his Velvet Gown, his Black Sattin Doublet, and his Velvet Night-cap, and gave them to</hi>

            <p>The Lord Treaſurer anſwered, ſaying, Madam, the Queen puts no man to <hi>Death</hi> for his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> but they might enjoy the Liberty of <note place="margin">Lo.

            <l>The Queen, ſaid ſhe had read it ſo in a <hi>Book.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Lord Treaſurer ſaid, they that did write ſo, Madam, did write <note place="margin">Qu. of <hi>Scots.</hi> Lo. Treaſurer.</note> that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>no Queen.</hi>
            </l>

               </note> her ſore <hi>Enemy and her Son's,</hi> and had practiſed with certain perſons againſt her; but ſaid ſhe, Mr. <hi>Walſingham,</hi> I think you are an honeſt man, and I pray you ſay in the word of an honeſt man, whether you have been ſo unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66112:21"/>
Mr. Secretary roſe up and came to the end of the Table, ſtanding <note place="margin">Mr. Secretary <hi>Walſingham.</hi>
               </note> in the midſt before his ſeat ſaying, Madam. I ſtand charged by you, to have practiſed ſomething againſt you: I call God and the World to Witneſs, I have done nothing as a <hi>private man</hi> unworthy of an honeſt man, nor as a publick perſon unworthy of my <hi>calling,</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God, that as a Man careful of my Miſtreſſes ſafety, I have been curious; and if <hi>Ballard</hi> had offered me his Service, I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him: but if he were practiſed with by me, why did he not plead it for his Life?</p>
            <p>Here again ſhe <hi>wept.</hi> and proteſted that ſhe would not make Ship wreck <note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> of her <hi>Soul</hi> in conſpiring againſt her <hi>good Siſter;</hi> and that thoſe whom Mr. Secretary had ſet over her as <hi>Spies,</hi> were Spies for her againſt him, and had likewiſe told her things of him.</p>
            <p>Then the Queen's Attorney proved that the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was <hi>privy to</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Queen's Sollicitor proved both the Points of the Statute agreeing to <note place="margin">Queen's Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor.</note> the Points of the Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſhe was privy to the Conſpiracy in that ſhe received <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Letters, wherein the Conſpiracy was contained <hi>to kill the Queen:</hi> To which ſhe gave Anſwer, as hath been depoſed by her Secretaries; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Oaths and voluntary Confeſſion, did ſet down, according to their Memory, the Minutes and Points of <hi>Babington</hi>'s Letters to the Queen, and her Anſwer to <hi>Babington:</hi> Wherein, eſpecially, they remember the Points of the Conſpiracy particularly confeſſed alſo by <hi>Babington,</hi> before he was apprehended, and at large; when he thought to have executed it, and been advanced by it. He alſo ſhewed her Letters and Anſwers to <hi>Ballard, Savadge</hi> and <hi>Tuchborne:</hi> and they confeſſed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He proved that ſhe her ſelf did conſpire and compaſs the <hi>Queens Death;</hi> for, beſides the approving of <hi>Babington</hi>'s Plot, ſhe addeth in her own Letters the Manner and Order of the Execution of this Deſignment.</p>
            <p>The Secretaries, at the view of her Letters, do write thus; <hi>Per le ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe</hi>

               <note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Confeſſion.</note> was an honeſt Man, but ſhe would not be judged by him; and that <hi>Nave</hi> was the King's Secretary of <hi>France,</hi> and that he had been Secretary to the Cardinal of <hi>Guyſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when ſhe ſaid ſhe knew not <hi>Babington</hi> nor <hi>Ballard,</hi> my Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <note place="margin">Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> ſaid: Madam, I will tell you whom you know: You know <hi>Morgain,</hi> who hired <hi>Parry</hi> to kill the Queen; and after you knew it, you gave him a Penſion.

            </p>
            <p>Then ſhe ſaid, He hath loſt all for my ſake; but you give Pentions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt me, to my Son. <note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Treaſurer ſaid, The Queen, becauſe the Revenues of the <note place="margin">Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> Crown are diminiſhed, giveth the King a <hi>Benevolence,</hi> being her Kinſman.</p>
            <p>The Second Day, at her firſt coming, ſhe renewed her Proteſtation; <note place="margin">Second Day, Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> ſaying, I am <hi>A Sacred and Anointed Queen,</hi> and ought not to be judged by the Law. I am <hi>A Free Prince,</hi> and owe no more to any Prince than
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66112:22"/>
they owe to me. I come hither for the Juſtification of my Honour, and that which is laid to my charge, that I ſhould do againſt my Siſter. Her Oration was very long, and of many things.</p>
            <p>I like not, ſaid ſhe, to take this Courſe; though I deſire the <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſhould be delivered out of their Perſecution, I had rather play the part of <hi>Heſter</hi> than of <hi>Judith;</hi> to pray for my people, than to take any other way to deliver my People. God forbid that I ſhould deſerve to be denied of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt before his Father. They gave it out that I was of <hi>no Religion;</hi> for there was a time when I tender'd my ſelf, but they cared not for my Soul. But, my Lords, when you have done all that you can, and put me from that I ſhould have, yet you ſhall not obtain your Cauſe of <hi>Mary Steward.</hi> And here ſhe wept and blubbered that they could not conceive her ſpeech. I deſire, ſaid ſhe, that another Aſſembly may be called where <note place="margin">She wept.</note> I may have my Council: I appeal to God firſt, who is the <hi>Juſt Judge;</hi> and <note place="margin">She deſireth another Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</note> to Princes, my Allies.</p>
            <p>Here my Lord Treaſurer ſaid; Madam, We have ſet down your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations under a Notaries Hand, and we have proteſted that your Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> be not prejudicial to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen ſaid; Indeed, My Lord, you take no Commiſſion but that <note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> may ſerve your own turn; you have done the worſt you can: I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten offered, if I might be at liberty, that I would do all duty and labour to quench the Troubles that are made; but I could not be heard. I was made believe that I ſhould be at liberty, and I promiſed <hi>Hoſtages</hi> for my Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, my own Son and my Couſin <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Son.</p>
            <p>The Lord Treaſurer anſwered, it is true the Queen was contented, and ſo was the Council, you offered Hoſtages, as you ſay. But it is as true that <note place="margin">Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not conſent that the King ſhould come.</p>
            <p>The Queen ſaid, But I told you, that if I might be at liberty, I would <note place="margin">Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note> effect it.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid the Lord Treaſurer, the Queen ſhall ſet you at liberty, and you ſhall ſeek her deſtruction: for all this practice of your Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> was nothing elſe but a Plot againſt the Queen; for, even then, when it was adoing, your Man <hi>Morgan</hi> hired <hi>Parry to kill the Queen.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Morgan</hi> a Traitor hired <hi>Parry</hi> to kill the Queen. Qu. of <hi>Scots.</hi> Ld. Treaſurer. Qu. of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, quoth ſhe, you are my Enemy.</p>
            <p>No, ſaid my Lord Treaſurer, I am Enemy to the Queen's Enemies.</p>
            <p>Was it not reported, ſaid the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſhould never be free from Practices until I were ſet at liberty? and I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired that the occaſion might be taken away.</p>
            <p>Then was read a Letter to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, wherein <note place="margin">Mendoza.</note> ſhe promiſed to give the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if her Son would not be reclaimed from that <hi>Hereſie</hi> wherein ſhe ſaid he was miſled.</p>

               </note> Sir <hi>Francis Englefield:</hi> In every of which Letters ſhe ſaith, ſhe hath given direction to the <hi>Catholicks on this ſide for a Diſpatch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here ſhe being preſſed with Truths of the Conſpiracy, and becauſe her own Man had ſworn it, ſhe ſaid, ſhe thought <hi>he made no Conſcience of an</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Qu. of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </note>

Hereat the whole Houſe murmured concerning the giving away the <note place="margin">Murmuring of the Lords.</note> Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Writing to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> ſhe advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him thus; <hi>Let not this be known, for if it ſhould, it would be, in</hi> France <hi>the Loſs of my Dowry, in</hi> Scotland <hi>the Breach with my Son, and in</hi> England <hi>my total Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. Sollicitor remembred the Lords, that if a Forein Prince had <note place="margin">Mr. Sollicitor.</note> the Kingdom, as ſhe would aſſign it, what ſhould become of their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Eſtates?</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid my Lord Treaſurer, The Succeſſion of the Crown, who ſoever hath it, <hi>cannot give it to a Forein Prince;</hi> it muſt go, by the Laws <note place="margin">Lo.

               <hi>of</hi> ſingular Zeal <hi>to the</hi> Catholick Cauſe, <hi>and Your Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

Whereupon, moſt dread Sovereign, according to the great care which thoſe Princes have of the preſervation and ſafe deliverance of Your Majeſty's Sacred Perſon, I adviſed of means and conſidered of Circumſtances accordingly, to and with ſo many of the wiſeſt and moſt truſty as with ſafety I might commend the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy <hi>thereof unto: I do find, by the Aſſiſtance of the</hi> Lord Jeſus, <hi>aſſurance of good Effect, and deſired Fruit of your Travel.

               <hi>The Anſwer of the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Queen to a Letter written by</hi> Anthony Babington, <hi>the Traitor, as followeth:</hi>
            </head>
            <p>TRuſty and well-beloved! according to the <hi>zeal</hi> and intire affection <note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Letter to <hi>Anthony Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi> the Traitor.</note> which I have known in you towards the <hi>Common Cauſe of Religion,</hi> and mine, having always made account of you as a Principal and <hi>right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> member to be imployed both in the one and in the other; it hath been no leſs Conſolation unto me to know your eſtate, as I have done by your laſt Letter, and to have further means to renew my <hi>intelligence</hi> with you, than I have felt griefs all this while paſt, to be without the ſame. I pray you therefore to write unto me hereafter, ſo often as you can, of all Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, which you may judg in any ſort importunate to the good of mine affairs, wherein I ſhall not fail to correſpond with all the care and diligence that ſhall be by poſſibility: For diverſe great and importunate Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were here too long to be deducted, I cannot but greatly praiſe and commend your common deſire to prevent, in time, the deſignment of our enemies, for the extirpation of our <hi>Religion</hi> out of this Realm, with the ruin of us all; for I have long ago ſhewed to the <hi>Forreign Catholick</hi> Princes, what they have done againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in the time <note place="margin">King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> the Catholicks here remaining, expoſed to all perſecutions and cruelty, do daily diminiſh in number, forces, means, and power, ſo as if remedy be not thereunto <hi>ſpeedily</hi> provided, I fear not a little but that they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogether <hi>unable for ever</hi> to ariſe again to receive any aid at all when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is offered. Then for my own part, I pray you aſſure our principal friends, that albeit I had no <hi>particular intereſt</hi> in this caſe, that <hi>all</hi> that I may pretend unto, being of no conſideration to me in reſpect of the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good</hi> of the State, I ſhall be always ready, and moſt willing to imploy therein my life, and all that I have, or may look for in this world. Now to ground ſubſtantially this enterpriſe, and to bring it to good ſucceſs, you muſt examine duly, <hi>Firſt,</hi> What <hi>Forces,</hi> as well on Foot as on Horſe, you may raiſe among you all, and what Captains you ſhall appoint for them in every <hi>Shire,</hi> in caſe a <hi>General</hi> cannot be had. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Which Towns, <hi>Ports</hi> and Havens you may aſſure your ſelves, as well on the <hi>North, Weſt,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> to receive ſuccors, as well from the <hi>Low Countries, Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as from other parts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What place you eſteem fitteſt, and of moſt advantage to aſſemble the principal Company of your Forces at the ſame time, which would be compaſſed conform to the proportion of your own. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For how long <hi>Pay,</hi> and Munition, and Ports fitteſt for their <hi>landing</hi> in this Realm, from the foreſaid Three Forreign Countries. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> What proviſion of Moneys and <hi>Armor,</hi> in caſe you ſhould want, you would ask. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By what means do the 6. <hi>Gent.</hi> deliberate to proceed. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The manner of my <hi>getting forth</hi> of this hold. Which points having taken amongſt you who are the principal Actors, and alſo as <hi>few</hi> in number as you can; the beſt reſolution in my device is; That you impart the ſame, with all diligence, to <hi>Barnardin de Mendoſſa,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Leiger for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who beſides the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">

               </note> he hath of the Eſtate on this ſide, I may aſſure you, will imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt willingly: I ſhall not fail to <hi>write</hi> to him of the matter, with all the recommendations I can, as alſo I ſhall do in any wiſe what ſhall be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But you muſt take <hi>choice</hi> men for the managing of the affairs with the ſail <hi>Mendoſſa,</hi> and others out of the Realm, of ſome faithful and very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eret,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66112:26"/>
both in wiſdom and perſonage, unto whom <hi>only</hi> you muſt commit your ſelves, to the end things may be kept the more <hi>ſecret,</hi> which for your own ſecurity I commend to your ſelf. If your meſſenger bring you back again ſure promiſe, and ſufficient aſſurance of the <hi>Succors</hi> which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then thereafter (but not <hi>ſooner,</hi> for that it were in vain) take diligent order, that all thoſe on your part make, ſecretly as they can, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Armor, fit <hi>Horſes,</hi> and ready <hi>money,</hi> wherewith to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a readineſs to march ſo ſoon as it ſhall be ſignified unto you by the Chief and <hi>Principal</hi> of every Shire: And for the better colouring of the matter, reſerving to the <hi>Principals</hi> the <hi>knowledg</hi> of the <hi>ground</hi> of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, it ſhall be enough at the beginning to give it out to the reſt, that the ſaid <hi>proviſions</hi> are made <hi>only for the fortifying of your ſelves, in caſe of need, againſt the Puritans</hi> of this Realm, the Principal whereof having the chief Forces thereof in the Low-Countries, as you may let the <hi>bruit go,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, do ſeek the ruin and overthrow at their return home of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and to uſurp the Crown, not only <hi>againſt me</hi> and all other lawful pretenders thereto, but <hi>againſt their own Queen that now is, if ſhe will not altogether ſubmit her ſelf to their government.</hi> Theſe precepts may ſerve to ſound and eſtabliſh amongſt all aſſociations, or conſiderations general, as done only for your preſervation and defence, as well in Religion as lands, lives and goods, againſt the oppreſſion and contempts of the ſaid <hi>Puritans,</hi> without directly <hi>writing, or giving out any thing againſt the Queen,</hi> but <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewing your ſelves willing to maintain her and her lawful heirs after her, unnaming me.</hi> The affairs being thus <hi>prepared,</hi> and Forces in readineſs, both without and within the Realm, then ſhall it be time to ſet the <hi>Six Gent. on work,</hi> taking good order upon the accompliſhment of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, I may be ſuddenly tranſported out of this place, and meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tarrying for the arrival of the forrein aid, which then muſt be haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all diligence. Now for that there can be no <hi>certain day</hi> appointed for the accompliſhment of the ſaid <hi>Gentlemens deſignment,</hi> to the end o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be in a readineſs to take me from hence, I would that the ſaid <hi>Gent.</hi> had always about them, or at leaſt at Court, divers and ſundry <hi>ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> furniſhed with good and ſpeedy Horſes, ſo ſoon as <hi>the deſign</hi> ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, to come with all diligence to <hi>advertiſe me</hi> thereof, and thoſe that ſhall be appointed for my tranſporting, to the end, that immediately after they may be at the place of mine abode before my <hi>Keeper</hi> can have adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of the execution of the ſaid deſignment, or at the leaſt, before he can fortifie himſelf within the houſe, or carry me out of the ſame: It were neceſſary to diſpatch two or three of the ſaid advertiſers by divers ways, to the end, if one be <hi>ſtaid,</hi> the other may come through: At the ſame inſtant it were needful alſo to aſſay to <hi>cut off the Poſts ordinary ways.</hi> This is the <hi>Plot</hi> that I think beſt for this enterpriſe, and the order whereby we ſhall conduct the ſame for our common ſecurity: for ſtirring on this ſide before you be ſure of ſufficient <hi>Forrein</hi> Forces, that were but for nothing to put our ſelves in danger of following the miſerable fortune of ſuch as have heretofore travelled in the like Actions: and if you take me out of this place, be well aſſured to ſet me in the midſt of a <hi>good Army,</hi> or ſome very good ſtrength, where I may ſafely ſtay till the aſſembly of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and arrival of the ſaid Forrein ſuccors. It were ſufficient cauſe given to the Queen in catching me again, to incloſe me in ſome hold, out of the which I ſhould never eſcape, if ſhe did uſe me no worſe; and to purſue with all extremity thoſe that aſſiſted me, which would grieve me more
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66112:26"/>
than all the unhappineſs might fall upon my ſelf. Earneſtly as you can, look and take heed moſt carefully and vigilantly to compaſs and aſſure all ſo well, that ſhall be neceſſary for the effecting of the ſaid enterpriſe, as <hi>with the grace of God</hi> you may bring the ſame to happy end, remitting to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your principal friends on this ſide, with whom you have to deal, therein to ordain and conclude upon this preſent, which may ſerve you for an overture of ſuch propoſitions as you ſhall amongſt you find beſt; and to your ſelf in particular <hi>I refer the Gent. aforementioned,</hi> to be aſſured of all that ſhall be requiſite for the <hi>intire execution</hi> of their good wills. I leave their common reſolution to advice, in caſe the deſign do not take hold, as may happen whether they will or no, do not purſue my tranſport, and the execution of the reſt of the enterpriſe. But if the miſhap ſhould fall out, that you might not come by me, being ſet in the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> or in any other ſtrength, with ſtrong guard; yet notwithſtanding, leave not for <hi>Gods ſake to proceed</hi> in the enterpriſe, for I ſhall at any time dye moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, underſtanding of your delivery out of the ſervitude wherein you are holden as <hi>Slaves;</hi> I ſhall aſſay, that at the ſame time that the work ſhall be in hand, at that preſent to make the <hi>Catholicks of</hi> Scotland <hi>to ariſe,</hi> and put my Son into their hands, to the effect, that from thence our enemies here may not prevail by any ſuccor; I would alſo that <hi>ſome ſtirring</hi> were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it were laboured to begin ſome time before any thing be done here, and then that the Alarm might begin thereby on the flat <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide,</hi> that the ſtroak may come from your deſigns, to have ſome General, or chief aid very permanent; and therefore were it good to ſend obſcurely for the purpoſe to the <hi>Earl of Arundell,</hi> or ſome of his brethren; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66112:27"/>
but few people do paſs, let Fifty or Threeſcore Horſemen, well Mounted and Armed come to take me away, as they may eaſily, my Keeper having with him but XVIII. or XX.

And the <hi>Third</hi> is, ſome there be that bring <hi>Carts</hi> hither early in the morning; Three Carts may be ſo prepared, that being in the midſt of the <hi>great Gate,</hi> the Carts might fall down, or overthrow; that thereupon you might come ſuddenly and make your ſelves Maſters of the houſe, and carry me ſuddenly away; ſo you might eaſily do before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number of Souldiers, who lodg in ſundry places forth of this place, ſome half a Mile, and ſome a whole Mile, could come to relieve; whatſoever iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the matter taketh, I do, and ſhall think my ſelf obliged, ſo long as I live, towards you for the offers you make to hazard your ſelf as you do for my deliverance, and by any means that ever I may have, I ſhall do my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to recogniſe by effects your deſerts; therein I have commanded a more ample Alphabet to be made for you, which herewith you ſhall receive.

               <hi>the dangers whereinto I was fallen, I went to Sir</hi> John Peters <hi>in</hi> Eſſex, <hi>and appointed my horſes ſhould meet me at</hi> London, <hi>intending to go down into the Country: I came to</hi> London, <hi>and there heard, that all was</hi> bewrayed; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, like</hi> Adam, <hi>we fled into the</hi> Woods <hi>to hide our ſelves, and there were apprehended. My dear Country-men! my ſorrows may be your joy, yet mix your</hi> ſmiles <hi>with</hi> tears, <hi>and pity my caſe; I am deſcended from an houſe, from two hundred years before the Conqueſt, never ſtained till this my misfortune; I have a Wife and one child, my Wife</hi> Agnes, <hi>my</hi> dear Wife, <hi>and there's my grief, and ſix Siſters left on my hand; my poor ſervants, I know, their Maſter being taken, were diſperſed, for all which I do moſt heartily grieve; I expected ſome favour, though I deſerved nothing leſs, that the remainder of my years might in ſome ſort have recompenced my former guilt, which ſeeing I have miſſed, let me now meditate upon the joys I hope to injoy.</hi> Thus done, he prayed firſt in <hi>Latin,</hi> and then in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> asking her Majeſty, and all the world, heartily, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that he hoped ſtedfaſtly, now at this his laſt hour, his faith would not fail; and ſo was executed.</p>

Then ſhe ſpake much to <hi>Melin,</hi> her man, and charged him, as he would anſwer before God, to deliver her Speeches and Meſſages to her Son, in ſuch ſort as ſhe did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. All which tended to will him to govern wiſely, and in the fear of God; to take heed to whom he betook his chiefeſt truſt; and not to give occaſions to be evil thought on by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> her good Siſter: And to certifie him, ſhe died a true <hi>Scot,</hi> true <hi>French,</hi> and true <hi>Catholick.</hi> And about 10 of the Clock ſhe was brought into the great Hall, where, in the midſt of the Hall, and againſt the Chimney (in which was a great fire) was a Scaffold ſet up of two Foot high, and Twelve Foot broad, having two Steps to come up; about the Scaffold went a Rail, half a Yard high round, covered with black Cotton, ſo was her Stool, the Boards, and the Block, and a Pillow to kneel upon: There did ſit upon the Scaffold, the two Earls, the Sheriff ſtood, and the two Executiones: When they were placed, Mr. <hi>Beale,</hi> Clerk of the Council did read her Majeſties Commiſſion aforeſaid, under the great Seal: after which, the Dean of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> by direction of the Lords, being provided, began to ſpeak unto her, for her better preparation, to die as a penitent Chriſtian in the true faith of Chriſt. But when he began his exhortation, ſhe ſtaid him immediately, refuſing to hear him, and ſaid, ſhe had nothing to do with him, nor he with her, for ſhe was ſettled in the Catholick Roman Faith, which ſhe would die in. Then the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> willed Mr. Dean to pray for her, that if it might ſtand with Gods Will, ſhe might have her heart lightned with the true knowledg of God, and die therein; which was pronounced by him accordingly, and followed of the beholders: All which while, ſhe having a Crucifix of white bone between her hands, prayed in <hi>Latin</hi> very loud: prayer being ended, ſhe kneeled down, and prayed to this effect, for Chriſts afflicted Church,

and an end of their troubles, for her Son, for the Queens Majeſty that ſhe might proſper, and ſerve God; and confeſſed, that ſhe hoped to be ſaved only by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, at the foot of whoſe Crucifix ſhe would ſhed her blood; that God would avert his plagues from this Iſland, that God would give her grace and forgiveneſs of her ſins. Then ſhe roſe up, and was, by both the Executioners, diſrobed: She ſaid, ſhe was not wont to be undreſſed by ſuch Grooms, and deſired to have two of her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women to unrobe her; the which was granted, and being ſtripped into her Petticoat; which being done, ſhe kiſſed her women, and willed them not to cry for her, but to rejoice; and lifted up her hand and bleſſed them, and alſo her men, not ſtanding far off. Then ſhe kneeled down moſt reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without all fear of death; and after one of her women had knit a Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew before her eyes, ſhe ſpake aloud the Pſalm in <hi>Latin, In te Domine confido, non confundor in eternum. Juſtitia tua libera me.</hi> Then lay ſhe down, and ſtretched out her body, and her neck upon the Block; ſhe cryed, <hi>In manus tuus Domine,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo received two ſtroaks. The people cryed, God ſave the Queen, and ſo periſh all Papiſts and her Majeſties ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>All things were taken from the Executioners, and not ſuffered to have ſo much as the Aprons, before they were waſhed; the Blood, and Cloaths, and whatſoever was bloody, was burned in the fire made in the Chimney, in the Hall, and by the Scaffold.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bennet</hi> alſo promiſed to keep his Councel, and divers others.</p>
               <p>Then were Sir <hi>Thomas Gerrard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shelly, Bennet,</hi> the Prieſt, and divers <note place="margin">Proved. <hi>Bennet.</hi> Priſoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movid.</note> others removed from the Tower to ſeveral other Priſons, and upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation confeſſed all as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>My Lord hearing all theſe matters laid hard againſt him by Mr. <hi>Sollicitor,</hi> grew into ſome <hi>Agony,</hi> and called for his Accuſers face to face, which the Learned Counſel did not <hi>yet</hi> yield unto. <note place="margin">Earl.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He was likewiſe charged that he came once meerly to <hi>Bennet</hi> the Prieſt in the Tower, ſaying, Come Mr. <hi>Bennet, let us go pray that the</hi> Spaniards <hi>may beat down</hi> London-Bridge, and promiſed to give him a <hi>Damask Gown</hi> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that he hoped to make him <hi>Dean of</hi> Pauls ere it were long; that the time of their delivery was at hand, and willed them in any wiſe to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, for if he ſhould reveal theſe things, he would deny them to his face.</p>
               <p>When News came to the Tower that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was <hi>driven away,</hi> my Lord ſaid, <hi>We are all undone,</hi> there is no hope for us this year, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot provide ſuch a power again this five or ſix years, <note place="margin">The Earl is ſorry for this News.</note> ſome of us may be <hi>dead and rotten</hi> ere that time.</p>
               <p>There were then brought into the Court <hi>vivâ voce</hi> upon their ſeveral Oaths <hi>Anthony Hall,</hi> and <hi>Richard Young,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, who aimed ſomething by hearſay to the proof of the former matters. <note place="margin">Witneſſes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo Sir <hi>Thomas Gerrard, William Bennet, Tuchnon, Snoden,</hi> and <hi>Ithel,</hi> and divers others were cloſely kept in a place over the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> cloſed in <note place="margin">Priſoners to witneſs,</note> with <hi>Arras,</hi> and were thereupon ſeverally called into the Court <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> upon their ſeveral <hi>Oaths</hi> to affirm that which is ſpecified before Sithence Mr. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> began to ſpeak, at this <hi>Marke Bennet</hi> the Prieſt was charged with a Letter written to my Lord, wherein he ſhould be ſorry for the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe matters as aforeſaid againſt my Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:66112:36"/>
One <hi>Randal</hi> had writ this Letter in <hi>Bennets</hi> name, by advice of my Lord of <hi>Arundel,</hi> to blind his practiſes; <hi>Bennet</hi> openly denyed the writing of <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Gray.</hi>
                  </note> that Letter; whereupon my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and my Lord <hi>Nroris,</hi> asked <hi>Bennet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Norris.</hi>
                  </note> if he knew of the Letter, yea or no? for their better evidence <hi>Bennet</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had been moved to ſuch a matter, but he did it not.</p>
               <p>Againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Gerrard</hi> my Lord ſtood very ſtoutly in denyal of what he witneſſed, willing him to <hi>look him in the face,</hi> and charging him as he would anſwer before God, in whoſe preſence he ſpoke, to tell nothing of him but Truth: In Anſwer whereof, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> referred himſelf to his Depoſitions before read, to which he ſaid he was ſworn, yea, twice ſworn.</p>
               <p>There were called into the <hi>Court</hi> two Witneſſes more, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Walton,</hi> and one <hi>Church,</hi> who juſtified Letters were brought from <hi>England</hi> to <note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Rehnes,</hi> where they both were; which Letters were ſent by one <hi>Hill,</hi> one of my <hi>Lords Faction,</hi> that the <hi>Earl of</hi> Arundel <hi>ſhould be General of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> when the <hi>Tower</hi> ſhould be ſurprized.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Walton</hi> my Lord took exception, affirming, that he was <hi>a naughty, leud Fellow,</hi> who had ſold that little Land he had to three ſeveral men, and of the other Witneſſes he ſaid, that ſome were <hi>attainted,</hi> ſome <hi>Indicted, bad men</hi> and <hi>Priſoners;</hi> and that their words were <hi>worth little credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Popham,</hi> they were never tortured, but confeſſed all this <note place="margin">Popham.</note> willingly, and they are <hi>ſuch</hi> as you have accompanied.</p>
               <p>Here ended every man his Speech, and the <hi>Noble-men</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> of the Jury <note place="margin">The Jury.</note> went together.</p>
               <p>My Lord humbly having ſubmitted himſelf to the conſideration of his <hi>Peers,</hi> with proteſtation of Loyalty, the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> brought him from the <hi>Bar</hi> unto a <hi>Seat</hi> near unto the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> where the <hi>Warders</hi> attended upon him.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord Steward</hi> likewiſe withdrew himſelf a little while, as it ſeemed <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Steward.</hi>
                  </note> to take ſome <hi>Refection,</hi> having all the day for the time of this buſineſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to eat any thing, and preſently returned to his Seat of <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within one hour after, the <hi>Noble-men</hi> of the <hi>Jury</hi> came every one back, and were again placed by <hi>Garter</hi> King of <hi>Heraulds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> asked every man of the <hi>Jury,</hi> ſeverally, beginning at my Lord <hi>Norris,</hi> the youngeſt <hi>Baron,</hi> and proceeding to my Lord <hi>Treaſure</hi> the Fore-man, whether the Priſoner were guilty, yea, or no.</p>
               <p>Which every one of them laying their hands upon their hearts, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <note place="margin">Verdict.</note> in their Conſciences, and upon their <hi>honours, that he was guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> called to bring his Priſoner to the <hi>Bar,</hi> who was brought accordingly, attended as before.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Sands</hi> unto him, that he had been indicted of ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sands.</hi>
                  </note> and that he had put himſelf upon the Tryal of his <hi>Peers,</hi> who had found him guilty, and therefore asked why Judgment ſhould not be given againſt him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon my Lord making three very low <hi>Obeyſances</hi> upon his knees, <note place="margin">Earl.</note> did humbly ſubmit himſelf to my <hi>Lord Steward his Grace,</hi> and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the reſt of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> there preſent, and beſought them to be <hi>Mediators</hi> for him, that he might obtain at her Majeſties hands, to have order taken for his <hi>debts,</hi> and to have Conference with his Officers, and to talk with his wife, and to ſee his <hi>Infant,</hi> born after his Impriſonment, whom he had never ſeen.</p>
               <p>Then my <hi>Lords Grace</hi> pronounced judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the place from whence he came, and from thence to the place of <note place="margin">Judgment.</note>

Execution, and there to be <hi>hanged until he were half dead, his members to be cut off, his bowels to be caſt into the Fire, his head to be cut off, his quarters to be divided into four ſeveral parts, and to be beſtowed in four ſeveral places; and ſo</hi> (ſaid my <hi>Lord Steward) the Lord have mercy on thy Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> ſaid, as it were ſoftly to himſelf, <hi>Fiat volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Dei.</hi> And ſo having made a low Obeyſance to the <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> took him away, Mr. <hi>Shelton</hi> going before him with the Edge of the Axe <hi>towards</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Then was there an <hi>O Yes</hi> made by the <hi>Serjeant</hi> at Arms, and the Court, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my Lord Stewards Commiſſion diſſolved; which done, my Lord of <hi>Darby</hi> took the <hi>whitewand</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Winckfields</hi> hand, and <hi>broke</hi> the ſame in pieces, and every man cryed, <hi>God ſave the Queen.</hi>
