            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HOwsoever ther be many vnknown motiues which lead men
in these dayes unto conformitie, yet those which are openly
professed, may be referred either vnto M. Sprints way,
who confesseth the ceremonies to be imposed contrary unto
the rules of Gods word, and yet contendeth that they are to be used in
case of deprivation: Or else to D. Mortons way, who avoucheth the
sayd cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>monies to be agreeable unto the rules of Gods word, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch as ought to be observed simply. Now he that considereth wel
of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter, shall find that there is no ground for the conscience to
rest on in either of these wayes. As for M. Sprint, (to speak nothing
of his mis-alledging very many authors) he hath but three main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:
and to all three he hath given sufficient answer himselfe.
His first argument is taken from the doctrine and practise of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
about the Iewish ceremonies. Now all the force of this reason
doth depend upon that paritie or equalitie which is supposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our ceremonies and the Iewish, our ministers warrant and the
Apostles: so that if this paritie faileth, the whole argument falleth.
Yet M. Sprint himselfe confesseth, pag. 250. 256. that those Iewish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
were not every way so evill as ours are: neither doth or dare
he say, that ministers now haue such particular warrant for conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as the Apostles had for applying themselves a little while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some of the Iewish ceremonies.</p>
            <p>His second reason is, that a lesser dutie must yeeld unto a greater.
Now this case by his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession p. 30. doth not hold so, as that a man
should doe a thing formally, simply, and in nature evill, for any good.
Now he knoweth, as appeareth p. 45. that the ceremonies in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
are esteemed such by most of these that now oppose them. So
that this reason can be of no force with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:216:3"/>
His third reason is, because refusall of conformitie in case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
tendeth to condemne in a manner all true Churches which
haue taught and practised otherwise. Hee meaneth by <hi>condemning,</hi>
accusing of error. Now M. Sprint himselfe doth thus condemne all
or the most of the Churches which he alledgeth to haue practised such
ceremonies. For in confessing our ceremonies to be inconvenient, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
evill, such as the urging of them cannot be justified, and yet
affirming that almost all Churches haue appointed and used such, even
out of the case of deprivation or such like necessitie, doth he not plainly
accuse all those Churches of error? These things considered, I thought
is needless to spend much time in examining M. Sprints booke any
further. But according to your desire, I will shew you mine opinion in
briefe concerning the chiefe passages which are in Thomas Chesters, or
as he was wont to be called, Doctor Mortons Defence of three ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
commonly used in our Churches, which I doe the more
willingly vndertake, because divers things are therin handled of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vse in divinitie, whereof I profess my selfe a Student, though in
the ministerie I cannot find a setled station. But before I come to the
Defence it selfe, first, I would faine vnderstand the reason why
<hi>three Ceremonies</hi> are onely defended, seeing there be many threes of
those things which stay many godly men from subscription and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
as is to be seen even in that abridgement which this Defender
doth chiefly oppose? Is it because our best Prelats haue onely a care to
perswade if it may be, those that are in the ministery, to that conformity
which is most of all noted, not regarding in the meane time, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
of so many godly learned yong men, who not onely for these,
but for divers other corruptions also, are forced to turne away from
the ministerie, whereunto their education, gifts and hearts did carry
them, while many lewd fellowes, the chiefe spots and blots of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
doe possess their places.</p>
            <p>I would know also what the reason should be, that the <hi>innocencie</hi>
onely of these ceremonies is defended? Is this all that is required in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
forcibly obtruded upon ministers and people, even to the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
excommunicating, and uttter undoing of many hundreds? Is this
all, I say, that is required, that such ceremonies be in some sence inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
or not hurtfull? surely not scripture onely, and sound reason, but
common sense will looke for some good necessarie use in such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb facs="tcp:216:3"/>
and not innocencie alone.</p>
            <p>And then what is the sence (trow you) in which these ceremonies
may be called <hi>Innocent?</hi> when Calvin (whom the Defender calleth
an honorable witnes) would devise a charitable title for them, he stiles
them <hi>tolerabiles incptiae,</hi> viz. tolerable fooleries, or fopperies, Epist.
200. &amp; 206. When he speaketh more out of iudgement, hee not onely
calleth them frivoulous and unprofitable, but saith plainlie that their
proper name is hurtfull, noxious, or nocent, cleane contrarie to this
Defendants language. Surely one of these writers, not differing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but flatly opposing and contradicting the other, must needs be farre
wide.</p>
            <p>Innocent indeed these ceremonies may be called in regard of their
materials, and the fashions also which they haue in their naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for the cloth of a Surpless and the fashion of it is innocent, and
so are all the idols of Papists and Heathens verie innocent: so that
this is no praise. But if we look at the use whereunto they haue been
applyed, and wherein they haue beene a long time employed, I may
truely say by the devill, not onely among the Papists, but even in our
Churches, to the breeding of dissention and distraction among bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron,
to quenching of many, and many a burning shining light, to the
grieving and unsetling of so many good soules, and to the advancing
of the Kingdome of darkeness: If these things I say be considered,
then it is more then manifest, that this licking them over with a fair
word will make them no more innocent indeed then Pilats hands
were when they were washed. The fashion of a Surplice naturall or
artificiall in another use, as if a Porter or Baker weare such a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is indifferent.</p>
            <p>If it shall be said, that notwithstanding these accidentall abuses,
yet the ceremonies are innocent in their own nature and use: I answer,
first, they having no necessary use otherwaies, and these being the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
effects which haue followed on them, there is no rule of Logick
much less of zeale that will allow the Defendant simply to call them
innocent. 2 It is a shame for our Prelates to talk of the ceremonies
innocencie, when they cannot defend their own innocencie in obtruding
and urging of them. They are wont to say, the practise and manner
of urging we will not defend, but the lawfulness or innocencie of the
things themselues. Indeed for a private man to stand upon such
<pb facs="tcp:216:4"/>
termes is tolerable: but for the Prelates, whose hands are chiefe in
this trespass, to cover their owne guiltiness under figleaved innocencie
of three ceremonies, is too too grosse. If Thomas or D. Morton in
times past had pleaded for the ceremonies innocencie, it might haue been
well interpreted: but for Thomas Chester, Thomas Lichfild, or any
that bear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th a Cathedrall name, to write of the innocencie of three ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
passing by three hundred foule nocencies which are plainly
to be seen in the Prelates urging and managing of these ceremonies,
this is somewhat like as if Samson when he had sent Foxes with fire-brands
in their tailes among the corn, should then haue written unto
the owners of that corne a long letter concerning the innocencie of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes
and Fire-brands.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, it is sufficiently proved, and shall (by Gods
grace) be further maintained against this Defendant, that these
three ceremonies are not innocent or lawfull in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se.</p>
            <p>This I had to say concerning the Title. Now before I come to the
book it selfe, some few things are to be questioned in the Epistles,
which are three, according to the number of the ceremonies defended.
In the first Epistle to the Marquis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I would willingly learn, what
that Church is, which is the mother of the Non-conformists? it must
of necessitie be either the faithfull Congregations which are in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
collectiuely considered: or else the Hierarchie, consisting of
Archbishops, Bishops and their Officers. If the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
then this Defence is begunne with a Slander. For neither is
the Non-conformist an adversarie impugning those Congregations, nor
doe they defame their religious worship, nor infringe their wholesome
libertie, nor contemne their just authoritie: but of all these things are
the Prelates manifestly guiltie. For they in their Lordly humours, doe
scorne and defame the most religious people as Puritanes: they hinder
the people from hearing of Sermons in another parish, though they haue
none, or worse then none at home: they are enemies to that preaching
wherby the godly people finde themselues most edified: they inslaue
both Minister and people, not onely to themselues, but even to their
Chancellors, Commissaries, officials, and such like officers of their own
making, to whom not Christ onely, but all the Primitiue Church saith
plainely, Depart from me I know you not: they denie anie authoritie
at all to be either in the Congregations, or in their Ministers, except it
<pb facs="tcp:216:4"/>
be a little of courtesie from the Ordinarie. These things are so well
known, that they need no proofe.</p>
            <p>If by the Church heer be meant the Hierarhie, then wee profess
plainely we acknowledge no such mother. She is a Step-dams, usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this title and authoritie, without all warrant from God our Father.
Shee is a creature of mans making, and may more lawfullie be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when it pleaseth man, then ever she was by him crected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I marvaile with what conscience this man can spend a
great part of his Epistle in stirring up a Courtier unto the opposing of.
Non-conformists? As if this were a great point of admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and zeale, as he calleth it: and the Courtiers such, as stood in
most need of instigations to the zeale of Formalitie, being otherwise
for substance such as they should be.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, what agreement is there in this Argument, to conjure a
man by the obligation of his Baptisme, to stand for the defence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ceremonies? was he baptized into the faith of the cermonies?
or is he bound to maintaine everie ceremonie which men haue brought
into that Church where he was baptized? If he were conjured by his
Bishoping to such things as these, there would be more reason in the
consequence.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, what need is there that great men should be called to aide
and assist the Prelats against Non-conformists? haue they not power
enough in their own hands? can they not at their own pleasure suspend,
depriue, excommunicate, &amp; what almost they please? Do they not tread
these poore men under their feet? Is it because that the Prelats cannot
yet sufficientlie prevaile against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the consciences of men, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call for further help in vaine? Or is the meaning, that such men
should be helped unto great Bishoprickes, as are most Zealous against
Non-conformists? If this be the matter, I dare say the Petition shall be
granted, and yet the Petitioner, except he make great progresse in this
eagerness, will hardlie get beyond Lichfild, at least not to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie.</p>
            <p>In the second Epistle to the Non-conformists, manie things are jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together, which afterward must be examined, but here cannot.
For this Epistle taketh the whole book for unanswerable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should rather haue been set at the end then at the beginning: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one ridiculous piece of Rhetorick is to be touched, wherein (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
<pb facs="tcp:216:5"/>
the Non-conformists aboue all their other faults wherewith
they are usuallie charged and loaded, are now as it were lovinglie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to acknowledge themselues guiltie of superstition. The reason
is rendred, because there is a negatiue superstition, the formall cause
whereof is the forbearing and forbidding of things lawfull as unholy
and profane: and the Non-conformists haue such negatiue opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as kneel not, cross not, weare not, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All this is nothing else but a trick of prevention usuall with craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
men, who choose to lay that upon their adversaries which they know
more properly to belong unto themselues. But I would that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
or rather Accusant, had given us some plaine reason of his
new opinion, there is no definition of superstition, properly so called,
that will father this conclusion. The Schoolemen doe with one consent
place superstition in a kind of excess of Religions worship, Thom. 2. 2.
q. 92. art. 1, from whom in this point our Divines doe not dissent.
Now though this excess do seem sometims to consist in a negation, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
excess or errour in negation, is never called by any author that ever writ
(I dare say) superstition, when he meaneth to speake properly, except
that very negation, abstinence or forbearing be held as a special worship.
Now in the Non-conformists there is no such thing to be found: they
doe not abstaine from these Ceremonies, but as they doe from other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
corruptions. Suppose they erre, yet everie erronious deniall of
things lawfull is not superstition.</p>
            <p>The Defendant therefore heere being overhastie to charge his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
considered not well what weapon he choose. But if he had
well remembred what is said of superstition, not onely by our Divines,
but even by some of the Papists themselues, he would haue forborne to
make mention of this word. For our Divines, let honourable Calvin
speak, Iust. l. 1 c. 12. s. 1 <hi>Inde mihi videtur dicta superstitio,

If this touch not the Defendant, I would desire him to peruse what
<pb facs="tcp:216:5"/>
Mr. Parker hath written concerning the superstition of the Crosse,
and giue some answer to the same, before he threaten any more such
kindness as this is upon the Nonconformists.</p>
            <p>Another thing also is by a figure of praetermition ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nuated in
this Epistle, not unworthie consideration, viz. that many Parliaments
and Convocations haue established these rites. To this I answer, 1 the
Prelats in such matters as these, haue no respect unto the authoritie of
Parliaments. For they frame Canons, urge and excute them with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut
the consent of any Parliament, nay flatly against them. For so
wee reade in the Records of that worthie Parliament which was ann:
1610. <hi>Among the Canons late made by the Clergie of England
in their Convocation, it vvas thought that some of their Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns
did extend to charge the bodies, lands, and goods of the subjects of
the Realme, further then vvas lawfull and meet. We therefore
made a good law to make voide such Canons as doe charge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
lands, and goods of the subjects, unlesse that the same canons
vvere confirmed by Parliament.</hi> 2 The Defendant cannot bring
forth one Act of Parliament now in force, that doth allow of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
and Conformitie to be urged as now it is by the Prelats. This
appeareth by the judgement of the foresaid Parliament in those words
of their petition, where they complaine, That <hi>diverse painfull and
learned Pastors that haue long travelled in the vvork of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
vvith good fruit and blessing of their labours, vvho vvere
ever readie to performe the legall Subscription, appointed by the
Statute of 13 Eliz. which onely concerneth the Confession of the
true Christian Faith, and doctrine of the Sacraments, yet for not
conforming in some points of Ceremonies, and refusing the
Subscription directed by the late Canons, haue been removed
from their Ecclesiasticall livings, being their freehold, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from all meanes of maintenance, to the great griefe of sundry
well-affected Subjects.</hi> 3 It is well known that the Prelates
themselues in their proceedings about these matters, doe so farre vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Statutes of Parliament, that they are by law subject unto a
Praemunire.</p>
            <p>Now as for Convocations, not to dispute here what manner of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
they be, 1 It is well known that they consist now of a Faction,
and that in memorie of man, they never concluded any thing for the
common good of the Church more then by others was better done to their
hands: but much evill hath come from among them, and more would
<pb facs="tcp:216:6"/>
but that many times their commission serveth not but onely to giue
Subsidies, and then to tell the clock. 2 They are servile to those on
whom they depend, and tirannicall over the poore that are subject unto
them: 3 there are verie few that haue place in them which are not gross
offenders against the most ancient Canons. As for example, it
was observed that in that Convocation which established and revived
these corruptions, of 300 or 400, there were not aboue twise three,
which were not, or had not been gross Non-residents or Pluralists.
D. Morton himselfe, in a Latine Sermon had before a Convocation
some 8 yeares since, described well the most part of them (though
he did not speak distinctlie of the number) to be unsavorie salt. For
he gaue us three notes whereby corrupt Ministers in England might
be discerned. 1 That they studied chieflie and stuft their Sermons
with Friers and Iesuits: 2 that they sought occasions to disgrace Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin:
and 3 that if anie neighbour Minister be more diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
then they, they brand him straight with the name of Puritan.
These notes are well known to agree unto most of our convocated Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.
4 The authoritie of this Convocation either against or without
consent of Parliament, is not to be regarded, much less against the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>In the Epistle to the Reader, this onelie I would inquire of, what
is the reason, that seeing he choose to himselfe for <hi>Cheife Opposites,</hi>
the Lincolneshire Ministers, he doth not deale with all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor the twentieth part of their Allegations, but onelie with such
as he thought fittest for his purpose? Of this I will not saie all. But
this I maie not omit, that considering he knew how much hath
been said against the Ceremonies by them and others, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
by M. Parker, which he never attempted to
answer, neither hee, nor others for him, had
anie cause to triumph in this booke,
as in a compleate
Defense.</p>

he commeth to oppose in the proofes of it: Which is a
strange course, in him especially that professeth a distinct lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
proceeding.</p>
                  <p>In the propounding of our confirmation, I note two things
once here in the beginning for all following occasions to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
1 this Defendant doth us wrong in distributing our confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
into those vvhich are taken from Scriptures, and those
that are from the Fathers, and those that are from Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:
as if these were in our estimation of the same kinde.
Wheras we professe that vvee ascribe no force unto any testimony
of man, as if it vvere a proofe, but onely bring such allegations
in as illustrations in regard of our adversaries perverse prejudice.
2 He vvrongeth us likewise in that difference vvhich he insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
betwixt the Fathers and our Divines, calling their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<hi>Iudgements,</hi> and the other onely <hi>Confessions:</hi> we acknowledge
no such imparitie. If this vvere nothing but idle rhetorick in the
Defendant, it may be passed by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:216:7"/>
In the answer brought to Heb. 3 2, vve haue this distinction
given us: <hi>some points concerning religion are doctrinall, and some meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ceremoniall. The former are sufficiently revealed in Scripture: but the
latter are left to the libertie of the Church.</hi> But 1 vvhy is that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here by a distinction, which passed vvithout deniall or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the former section? 2 vvhat kind of distinction is this,
vvhich doth not distinguish of any terme vvhich is in the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
3 the Defendant should haue done vvell to haue explained
and confirmed his distinction. For <hi>doctrinall</hi> opposed to <hi>ceremoniall</hi>
in the formall signification of these vvords, I never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I remember: and sure I am no sound reason vvill allow.
<hi>Ceremoniall</hi> is opposed to <hi>Morall,</hi> and sometime to <hi>substantiall;</hi>
but to <hi>doctrinall</hi> it cannot properly, because there is ceremoniall
doctrine as vvell as morall or substantiall. 4 To vvhich of these
points vvill the Def referre the Hierarchie of Bishops? or are
they no points of Religion? For the negatiue part of this answer,
that <hi>ceremoniall points of Religion are not revealed in the Scripture, but
left to the libertie of the Church:</hi> it is too too nakedly set down for
to beare any colour of truth vvith it. For 1 vvas this true before
the comming of Christ? then all the ceremoniall law is Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall.
2 is this true universally (as it is heere set down) in the new
Testament? then vvater in baptisme, and bread and wine in the
Lords Supper, are no ceremoniall points of Religion. 3 the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is given Deut. 4. 2 and such like, did they not conteyne
in them ceremoniall points of Religion? then it vvas lawfull for
the Iewes, to adde, detract, and alter the ceremonies according to
their pleasure; and doth not that law binde us as vvell as the Iewes?
then vve doe the Papists wrong, in putting them to so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as vve doe in finding out shifts to avoide the dint vvhich such
places giue them.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue this mishapen distinction: An answer is given at
length to the place alledged out of Heb. 3. 2 concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
betwixt Christ and Moses: sect. 4 5.</p>

                  <p>IN this Section comparison is made betwixt Christ and Moses
in reall faithfulnes, as he calleth it. But this sufficeth not to loose
the knot. For Moses vvas faithfull in all the house of God,
and Christ vvas not inferiour, but in all parts of his office Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
concerning all points of Religion, vvas no doubt as
faithfull as Moses.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V.</head>
                  <p>HEre the Defendant can find nothing to bring out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
for Christs faithfulnesse in rituall ordinances, but as
<hi>Moses</hi> appointed ceremonies, so Christ removed them. Is
not this a proper explication of Scripture, to interpret a similitude
by a dissimilitude? The Scripture maketh Christ like unto <hi>Moses:</hi>
this Defendant expoundeth the likenesse to be in this, that Christ
pulled down that which <hi>Moses</hi> had set up.</p>
                  <p>Out of M. <hi>Calvin, Instit. lib. 4. c. 10. S.</hi> 30. he taketh upon
him to decide this question. But he should haue dealt more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and according to the scope of his author, if he had cited <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
de pont. l. 4. c.</hi> 17. where the same words are according to his
meaning. For in that place of <hi>Calvin</hi> there is nothing at all which
vvithout grosse aequivocation will serve the Defendants purpose:
For <hi>Calvins</hi> meaning was nothing lesse then to teach that Christ
had given libertie unto men for to prescribe at their discretion
mysticall signes in the Church: but onely to dispose of such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
as in their kind are necessarie, but in particular deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
doe varie. He instanceth in the next section in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of time, vvhat houre the congregation should meet:
in the place, how large, or in what fashion the Church should bee
built: in meere order, what Psalmes should be sung at one time,
and what another time. These and such like circumstances of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and comelinesse, equally necessary in civill and religious
actions are understood by <hi>Calvin:</hi> not significant ceremonies,
proper unto religious worship, such as ours are now in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
This allegation therefore borroweth all the shew it hath from
the ambiguous meaning of the word ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>The same deceit is in the known case which the Defendant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
to <hi>Calvins</hi> words. For if by <hi>Rites</hi> he meaneth such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of order and decencie, as were before mentioned, then I
grant all he saith: but if by <hi>Rites</hi> he meaneth ceremonies properly
of religious nature, use, and signification, such as the crosse in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and surplice are knowne to be, then there is no reason in his
speech. For 1. there is no necessitie that in any nation the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
should haue any religious ceremonie of spirituall significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beside those which Christ hath appointed to all: and if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
can shew any such necessitie, then I would desire him also
to shew by what rules, and for vvhat cause these religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
imposed upon us in England, are fitter for us, or tend more to
our edification, then other ceremonies would, or then they would
in any other nation under heaven. Except both these positions be
proved, the words of this section are all but wind: and proved I
am sure they never were nor will be.</p>

                  <p>THe second place of Scripture handled by the defendant, is 2.
Sam. 7. 7. Where I cannot but marvell why so resolute a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter
would passe by in silence, Deu. 4. 2. &amp; 12. 32. Prov. 30. 6.
Lev. 10. 12. all which places are alledged by the Lincolnshire mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
(against whom he professeth principally to write) &amp; choose
this place which they bring in after the former. Was there not a
cause? But to take him as we finde him, he professeth plainly, that
it vvas lawfull for David vvithout speciall vvarrant to build a
house unto God: and in this he is so peremptory, that he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the contrary opinion of notable precipitancie, and presumeth
to make this example a ground of confutation against his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
disputing as he pedantically speaketh first by <hi>extortion,</hi> and
then by <hi>retortion</hi> out of this place. But if his extortion bee meere
torting and torturing of the text, we need not feare his retortion.</p>
                  <p>Now that the purpose of <hi>David</hi> vvas partly condemned, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
plainly, 1. because it vvas prohibited, as here the Defendant in
his answer expressely granteth. 2. Because as honorable M. <hi>Calvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi>
well observeth on Act. 7. 46. <hi>It was not lawfull for man to choose a
place for Gods Name &amp; Ark, but it was to be placed in that place which
God himselfe should shew, as Moses doth often admonish. Neither durst
David himselfe bring the Ark into the threshing floore of Arauna, vntill
the Lord by an Angel from heaven had witnessed unto him that that was
the place chosen by himselfe, 2. Sam.</hi> 24. 11. 3. Because it cannot bee
absolutely excused from some mixture of rashnesse vvith zeal, that
he should resolue absolutely to build an house unto God, before he
knew either vvhat manner of house God vvould haue built, or
when, or by whom: seeing vvithout the especiall direction and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Gods spirit, nothing of this kind could bee well done.
How could <hi>David</hi> haue built a house, except the Lord had filled
vvith the spirit of vvisedome <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aboliab,</hi> or some such?</p>
                  <p>The Arguments brought by the Defendant for the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
are nothing worth. 1. <hi>Nathan</hi> (sayth he) <hi>had allowed the
purpose of David, v.</hi> 3. But iudicious <hi>Iunius</hi> answereth (in his notes
upon that place) that so <hi>Samuel</hi> out of humane infirmitie, said that
<hi>Eliab</hi> vvas the man vvhom God vvould haue king, 1. Sam. 16. 7.
2. <hi>God calleth Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>id his servant, which hee never doth in reproofe.</hi>
Which is not true, though the reproofe be for a thing simply evill:
as is plainly to be seen Isa. 1. 3, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er. 2. 13. and in many such places,
vvhere <hi>my people</hi> is as much as <hi>my servant.</hi> But the very word <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
also is twice thus used in one verse, Isa. 42. 19. much lesse
when the affection is good in the generall, and blemished onely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:216:8"/>
by some circumstance. For then why may not a good title bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as an allowance of that vvhich is good, and yet the evill be at
the same time reproved? so many learned divines doe interpret
that of the Midwiues, Exod. 1. 19. 20. 21. Moses was reproved and
brought to his graue for a sinne, and yet when his death is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it is sayd that <hi>Moses the servant of the Lord died, Deut. vlt.</hi> The
Churches are sharply reproved Rev. 2. &amp; 3. and yet are stiled by the
name of <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>golden Candlestickes:</hi> and their ministers who
are chiefly reproved are called <hi>Starres. 3. there is another reason ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by Salomon of this restraint. 1. Reg.</hi> 5. 3. 4. But the Defendant
should mark that one reason doth not exclude another. In this
place of <hi>Samuel</hi> two reasons are rendred, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi>
note, the second of which is taken (as he saith) from the example
of <hi>Davids</hi> auncestors, vvho never vndertook any such thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew the calling of God vvas to be exspected. 4. <hi>God
himselfe commended this purpose of David. 1. King.</hi> 8. 17. As if the
same affection may not in divers respects be both commended and
condemned. <hi>But this evasion of Mr. Hy. 1 passe over,</hi> sayth the
Defender, <hi>as childish and absurd.</hi> And why so I pray? 1. <hi>Because
God himselfe did interpret this affection for a deed. 2. Hee did note this
deed as speciall, saying in both respects, thou didst well, that it was in thy
heart.</hi> In which words if there be any consequence, or good sence,
then not onely Mr. Hy. his evasion, but logick it selfe is childish
and absurd.</p>

                  <p>THe last place of Scripture handled in this Argument, is Yer. 7.
31. the force of which, as it pertaineth to the purpose in hand,
is in the last vvords, <hi>which I commanded them not, neither came it
into my heart.</hi> The reason lieth thus (to take honorable <hi>Calvins</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
upon the place) <hi>seing God under this title onely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that which the Iewes did, because hee had not commanded it them:
therefore no other reason need be sought for the confutation of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then that they are not by commandement from God.</hi> Now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
answereth, <hi>that this was a thing forbidden, and in that sence
was sayd not to be commanded.</hi> What is this to the purpose? therein
lieth the strength of our argument: that not to command in
things that pertaine to worship, is all one with forbidding. <hi>But
you collect</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that this was not against,</hi> but onely <hi>besides the
word.</hi> It is not our collection but his owne vaine conceit. Our
argument is drawne from the forme of speech here used. See Mr.

his distinction of mortall and veniall sinne.</hi> He was as it seemeth, in a

our late Divines, but at <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also, as symbolizing with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
vvhen he in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. doth so distinguish betwixt teaching
contrary to the Gospell, and beside the Gospell? Why doth he not
wondringly also accuse <hi>Iunius</hi> for symbolizing with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
while he refuteth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by this distinction, <hi>contr. 3. l. 4. c. 17.

that though the things they stand upon be beside the word, yet

                  <p>IN this Section answer is made to some allegations brought
out of Protestant Writers (not unto all vvhich the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
citeth for the perfection of the Scriptures) where 1. the
Defendant answereth for himselfe, that his meaning was not of
<hi>matters meerly ceremoniall.</hi> And so, say I, the meaning of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vvas not of such meere ceremonies as the Defendant here
<pb facs="tcp:216:10"/>
describeth in the end of this Section, if he meane by meere cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
mere order and decencie: but our ceremonies are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature, because they haue doctrine or teaching in them, and
therefore are doctrinall, as he pleaseth to speak, or mixt, 2. confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that in one place he speaketh of ceremonies, he limiteth his
speech to such ceremonies as are made essentiall parts of a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as Milke in stead of Wine: sopping in of bread into
the cup, and wringing in of the grape; these ceremonies hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
doctrinall. But here I vvould faine heare a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
vvhy sopping of the bread into the cup is more doctrinall, or
more against the vvord, then the crosse in baptisme. Bread and
Wine were ordained by Christ to a holy use in the Church: so is
not the crosse: sopping hath some agreement vvith reason: cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
hath none; sopping was vsed by Christ himselfe the same
night, and at the same table vvhere the sacrament was appointed:
crossing vvas never used by Christ or his Apostles. In sopping
there is no new materiall signe appointed, but a new fashion onely
of vsing the old: in crossing a new signe is obtruded. So that sop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
seemeth to bee better then crossing. If opinion of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
use doth put a difference: our men can easily conclude in the
Convocation house, that it is not the opinion of the Church of
England, and then all will be well. If sopping seeme to bee a
part of the sacrament: crossing when it is done in the very act of
sprinkling, (as many times it is) maketh as much shew of bearing
a part in baptisme. But what if out of the Lords Supper, a little
before, or a little after, vvhile the prayers are making vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Supper, there should be appointed such a sopping to
bee used of all that communicate for mysticall signification, I
vvould know of the Defendant whether this were allowable or
no by his doctrinall distinction? If not, vvhy should he shew more
favour to the crosse?</p>
                  <p>In excusing of B. <hi>Iewel,</hi> and D. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> nothing is sayd by the
Defendant, which hath not formerly been confuted.</p>
                  <p>Now it might bee here expected, that the Defendant should
haue sayd something concerning those generall rules which God
hath set downe in his vvord for the direction of the Church in
rites and orders Ecclesiasticall, mentioned by the Lincolne-shire
Ministers in this argument, p. 44. But neither here, nor in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place of this booke, doth the Defendant so much as indevour
to shew that our ceremonies are <hi>needfull and profitable for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the people, by the more comely and orderly performance of
that service which hee hath expresly prescribed in his word.</hi> This is a
main matter vrged in the Abridgement, vvithout which the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

hath hitherto endevoured to answer is in the Abridgement
brought in to other end then to proue that no ceremonies are to
be brought into the Church vvithout those conditions: and yet
for all this, our ceremonies in this chiefe poynt are left destitute of
all defence. If therefore all were granted which the Defendants
argumonts or answers in this booke maintaine, yet the ceremonies
wil be found nocent, and to be rejected, if it be but for their unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablenesse,
according to that of Basil, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>THE Defendant here undertaketh to proue, that God in the
scriptures hath granted a generall licence or authoritie to all
Churches, to ordaine any ceremonies that may be fit for the
better serving of God. But what if this were granted? what is it to
the purpose? what maketh it for our ceremonies in controversie,
except he can shew that they are fit for the better serving of God?
Now this he no where undertaketh to prove, nor dare, I thinke,
professe so much in writing, without many vnwarrantable limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>The onely scripture he bringeth is, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. 40. concerning
<hi>order</hi> and <hi>decencie,</hi> a place much profaned by the patrons of our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
as shall be shewed. <hi>This place is vsed</hi> (sayth he) <hi>by Fathers
and all Divines, for one and the same conclusion.</hi> It is much used, I
grant, and as much abused. But 1. it is not used by all Divines, to
proue the institution of such ceremonies as ours lawfull. For they
are much mistaken vvhich think our ceremonies to be mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of order: and as for decencie, they haue been often proved to
be farre from it: which of it selfe to every indifferent eye is more
then apparant. 2. it is not used to this purpose by any that haue
authoritie sufficient to perswade us that it will beare such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
except they will shew us by what Logick they form their
consequence, which the Defendant is not able to doe for them.
3. This scripture being rightly understood, doth not onely not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
such ceremonies as ours, but plainly condemneth them. For
the manifesting of which assertion, because it may seem strange to
those eares that are accustomed to other sounds, I will here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
set down an argument drawn out of these words, against
such ceremonies as ours are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All that is left vnto the Churches liberty in things pertaining unto Gods
worship, is to order them in comely maner.</hi> This is manifestly collected
out of the place in question: so the Defendant seemeth to grant,
so <hi>P. Martyr</hi> vnderstandeth it, as is to be seen in his commentarie
upon 1 Sam. 14. which judgement of his is cited and approved by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:216:11"/>
D. <hi>Whitaker de Pont p. 841. &amp;</hi> 844. confirmed also by <hi>Iunius</hi> against
<hi>Bell. cont. 3. l. 4. c. 16. n. 86. 87. &amp;c. 17. n.</hi> 9. 10. 12. 13. where he sheweth
that Christ is the onely law-giver that appointeth things in his
Church: and that he hath appointed all that are requisite: and that
the Church maketh no lawes (properly so called) to appoint any
new things to be used, but onely canons, orders, directions, ordering
in seemly maner those things which Christ hath appointed: and
that if she addeth any thing of her own, she doth decline. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because unto her is commited no authoritie of appointing
new things, but a ministerie to observe and doe such things which
Christ hath appointed. <hi>vide etiam Iun. de transl. imper. l. 1. c. 2. n. 26. 27.
31.</hi> This is also confirmed by sound reason, both in respect of the
wisdome required in all law-makers, &amp; perfectly found in Christ,
and also in regard of the nature of such institutions. For the former
reason teacheth, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sheweth <hi>Rhet.</hi> 1. 3.) that all which
possibly may, should be appointed in the law by the giuer of it, and
nothing left unto the ministerial iudges, but that which must needs
be left, as matters of fact, &amp;c. Now in the worship of God, all but
particular circumstances of order, may easily bee appointed (as in
very deed they were) by our law-giver Christ. As for the nature of
such institutions, that doth also require so much: for whatsoever is
aboue civilitie therein, if it bee not a circumstance of order, it is
worship, and therfore invented by man, unlawfull will-worship.
For vvhatsoever is used or acted by him that worshippeth God, in
that act, it must needs be either grounded on civill humane consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
and therefore civilitie: or an act and means of worship,
and therfore worship: or the ordering and manner of disposing
those acts &amp; meanes, and therefore lawfull, if lawfully and fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
or else, at the least, idle and vaine, and therefore to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
according to that of Basil, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: A
fift cannot be given. By all this it may appeare, that the authority
of the Church is not to appoint what she will, no not of things in
their own nature indifferent, and say they be in order, or for order:
but onely to order those things vvhich God hath appointed.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre the proposition, or first part of my syllogisme: the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to appoint &amp; use the ceremonies as we doe, is not to order in comely
manner any thing pertaining to Gods worship.</hi> The reason is, because
order requireth not the institution or usage of any new thing, but
onely the right placing and disposing of things which are formerly
instituted. This appeareth 1. by the notation which is given of the
word it selfe, which both in greek &amp; latine is taken from the rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

disposition which fit places to things equall and unequall, id est,</hi> when
things are handsomely ranked, some to goe before, and some to
follow, as P. Martyr expoundeth it, loc. com. cl. 4 c. 5.</p>
                  <p>3 The same also is confirmed by our Divines, vvho usually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
instances of <hi>order,</hi> doe infist in time, place, and such like
circumstances, making a difference betwixt mysticall ceremonies
and order, many times condemning the one, and allowing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

and therfore importeth nothing but that peaceable proceeding
vvhereby they that should speak, speak one by one, and the rest
attend, &amp;c. v. 30 31. So <hi>Basil</hi> expoundeth it, shewing order to
consist in sorting of persons, some to this, and some to that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>Lastly, neither Luk. 1 8, neither in any place of Scripture doth
the word <hi>order</hi> import any more then hath been said.</p>
                  <p>As for comelinesse, that is nothing but the seemlinesse of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> saith in 1 Cor. 11: it is such a tempering of
actions as vvherby they may more fitly atteine their end. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
it may conteine that natural or civill handsomenesse, which
is spoken of ch. 11 13, as it doth ch. 12 23, and so includeth all
that which is grounded on civility, as a faire cloth and cup for
the communion, a faire and firme vessell for baptisme: but not
the appointing of new mysticall ceremonies, for then such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
were here commanded to all Churches, vvhich the Def.
I think vvill not say: and then the Apostolick Assemblies should

Thus we haue both proposition and assumption of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the ceremonies confirmed out of this place, which
the Defendant choose as the onely place that could be brought for
them. Now I hope vve may adde the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to appoint and use the ceremonies as we doe, is not left to

                  <p>HEre the Protestants themselues are brought in confessing as
much as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> said of them. But the first witnesse <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>
saith nothing, but that some Ecclesiasticall rites, though
they haue no commandement or testimonie in Scripture are not
to be rejected: vvhich in the sense now often expounded, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
grant. Yet the Def. should not in stead of <hi>Testimonie</hi> of
Scripture, haue put <hi>warrant</hi> of Scripture: For <hi>testimonie</hi> neither in
usuall acception, nor yet in <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his own meaning, is so large
as <hi>warrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The place of <hi>Calvin</hi> hath been answered before. <hi>Iunius</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the same minde, and so to be interpreted, so also <hi>Zanchius,
Daneus</hi> and <hi>Whitaker:</hi> But because <hi>Iunius</hi> is stiled here by the Def.
vvith his deserved title of <hi>Iudicious,</hi> it will not be amisse to shew
his judgement fully about such additions as our ceremonies are.
To name therefore one place for all at this time, because there he
speaketh professedly his judgement, and bindeth it with a solemn
oath, for the sincerity and impartialnesse of his conscience in that
behalfe: The place I meane is in his <hi>Ecclestasticus, lib. 3 cap.</hi> 5. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end. Where first he distinguisheth betwixt things <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,</hi>
and others <hi>not necessarie</hi> in the administration of the Church:
and concerning even the latter sort, he modestly, but throughly
sheweth how little libertie is left unto men. <hi>If any man</hi> (saith he)
<hi>either by Civill or Ecclesiasticall authority will adde things not necessarie
nor agreable to order, wee would not pertinaciously contend with him,
but desire onely that he would seriously consider of three things. 1 By
what authority or example he is led to thinke that the holy Church of
God, and the simplicity of the mysteries of Christ (whose voyce onely is

2 To what end he judgeth that his things should be added unto those that
are divine? For if the end be conformitie with others, it were more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that other Churches should conforme to those which come neerest to
the word of God, as</hi> Cyprians <hi>counsell is, then that these should conforme
to the other. If the end be comelinesse, what is more comely then the
simplicity of Christ? what is more simple then that comelinesse? If there
be no other reason beside will, then that of</hi> Tertullian <hi>is to be thought of,
the will of God is the chiefe necessitie, and that the Church of God is not
tyed unto mans wills in things divine. The 3 thing to be thought on it,
what event alwaies hath followed upon humane Traditions, as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
doth shew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This vvas the judgement of Iudicious <hi>Iunius,</hi> vvherby it is
manifest that he favoured not our ceremonies, nor would haue
pleaded for them as the Def. under colour of his name.</p>
                  <p>Because <hi>Zanchius</hi> also is brought in with his deserved Title of a
<hi>profound</hi> Divine, speaking nothing to the purpose in hand, I will
set down his judgement concerning this point, out of that Epistle
to famous Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> vvhere he treateth expresly of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and of our ceremonies. <hi>Est autem Ecclesia sicut in doctrina, sic
etiam in ceremoniis ad Ecclesiae Apostlicae regulam informanda.</hi> The
Church must be ordered by the rule of the Apostolicall Church,
as vvell in ceremonies as in doctrine. What can be said more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the Def. his distinction?</p>

                  <p>AT length vve are come to <hi>Reason.</hi> But if this reason were
sound and certaine, I see no cause vvhy it should not haue
had the upper hand of humane testimonies.</p>
                  <p>1 The first reason is grounded on the Defendants phantasie
meerly. For it supposeth that vve hold some points of Religion
to be onely besides the Word, and no vvay against it: vvhich
not onely I haue confuted before as a cavill, but M. <hi>Cartwright</hi>
long since in his Reply, p. 56: the very vvords also of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Def. here opposeth doe shew that vvee hold such
things <hi>condemned</hi> by the Scriptures, and therefore against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule of them, though onely beside their particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
                  <p>2 The second reason concludeth nothing vvhich we will not
grant, in the sense formerly expressed, <hi>viz.</hi> that by those some ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
be meant circumstances of meere order, and by man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

invention, be understood mans particular determination. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:216:13"/>
the assumption is palpably false. Beside the proposition also
is untrue, if <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>3 The third and last reason is taken from the difference of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
vvhich may and must be in the Churches of Christ. The
answer is, that this difference ought to bee onely in determination
of particular circumstances of order, for time, place, &amp;c.</p>

these ceremonies are divine: and yet dare not deny but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting

                  <p>AFter al this adoe about the proposition of the first argument,
now vve are told of an assumption out of the Abridgment,
and M. <hi>Hy. viz.</hi> that <hi>these Ceremonies haue no warrant from the
word of God.</hi> For M. <hi>Hy.</hi> I cannot say much: But I am sure the
Authors of the Abridgement haue great vvrong done them. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
vvill turne to the place quoted by the Def. in the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shall presently see that the words vvhich our Def. hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into a Proposition, are there but part of an illustration belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to this Proposition, <hi>All ceremonies that swerue from the rules
given in the word for the Churches direction in matters of ceremonie, are
unlawfull.</hi> The assumption of vvhich is, <hi>but the ceremonies in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
swerue from those Rules.</hi> Now all the chiefe pith both of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and assumption is by the Def. omitted: a by thing is put
in place of the proposition, a new assumption is formed: and yet,
all fatherd upon the Abridgment. But to passe by that, the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here set down is defensable enough.</p>
                  <p>He telleth us that <hi>in generall and in permissiue appointment, these
ceremonies are from God, and divine.</hi> A <hi>permissive appointment,</hi> I never
heard of before, nor can understand how it vvill be excused from
<pb facs="tcp:216:14"/>
an implicit contradiction. But for the explaining of himselfe, he
bringeth <hi>Calvin</hi> affirming that some constitutions of the Church
founded in Scripture, may be called divine, because they are parts
of that decencie vvhich God hath commanded. All which being
granted, and the like saying of <hi>Vrsin,</hi> maketh nothing at all for
such ceremoniess as ours are, except the Def. can proue, that they
are constitutions of meer order and decencie, agreeable also to the
other rules prescribed: the contrary whereof hath been formerly
declared. One rule of direction vvhich he calleth equity, is heere
onely touched, and commeth after to be handled, to vvhich place
I reserue it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the maintenance of that Argument which the

                  <p>THIS second Argument is taken from the kind, unto
vvhich such ceremonies as ours are, doe in their nature
belong, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are parts of divine worship, and
therefore (being mans inventions) unlawfull. Heere
the Def. comes out with a <hi>wedge</hi> as he calleth it, distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>proper</hi> or <hi>essentiall</hi> parts of Gods worship, and <hi>improper</hi> or
<hi>accidentall.</hi> But first he should haue done vvell to haue considered
the nature and measure of the thing which he vvould cleaue, by
the light of a definition. For otherwise he may spend his wedge,
his beetle, and all his labour in vaine.</p>
                  <p>And so indeed he hath, as may appeare by his explication of this
distinction. <hi>By proper and essentiall parts</hi> (saith he) <hi>we understand such
ceremonies, which are so necessarily required to Gods service, as that the
contrarie thereof must needs displease him. By accidentall parts</hi> (or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances)
<hi>such as serue onely as accessorie complements, ordained for
the more convenient discharge of the necessarie worship of God, i. e. for
decorum and edification.</hi> For 1 if all those ceremonies be essentiall
parts of Gods worship, vvhich are such as the contrarity of them
must needs displease God, then certainely all ceremonies vvhich
serue for <hi>decorum</hi> and <hi>edification</hi> must needs be essentiall parts of
Gods worship: because the contrarie of <hi>decorum</hi> and <hi>edification</hi> must
needs displease God in his worship. 2 What kind of wedging is
this, so to distinguish the parts of Gods worship, as that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
onely, and not the essentiall shall serue for edification?
3 What cleaving or dissolving is this of the parts of worship,
where the accidentall parts are rather said to bee appurtenances
then parts, and yet granted to be parts? 4 What worship of God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:216:14"/>
is there that is not essentiall? If it hath no essence of vvorship in
it, surely it is no vvorship. 5 The accidentall parts of worship
haue not so much communion vvith the essentiall, as the <hi>haire</hi> of
the bodie (vvhich is but an excrement) hath vvith the bodie: this
the Def. expresly granteth in this Sect. and shall that which is not
so much as an excrement unto the chiefe vvorship, be accounted
or called a part of worship.</p>

                  <p>FOr the proofe of this, that <hi>no humane inventions are lawfull parts
of Gods worship,</hi> the Abridgement alledgeth <hi>Exod. 20 4. Deut.
12 32 Es. 1 12 Mat. 15 9 Col.</hi> 2 23, three of which are onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

put of with miserable shifts? <hi>By the precepts of men Es. 29 9 are sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified</hi>
(saith he) <hi>such humane ordinances as were expresly contrary to the
commandements of God.</hi> But 1 if here he taketh the word <hi>expresly</hi>
as opposite unto <hi>pregnant consequence,</hi> as he doth p. 2 then I hope he
will grant that there is the same reason of those humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are not expresly contrary. If he taketh it largely, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
such consequence, then he saith nothing to the purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in that sense all Religious vvorship invented by man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
contrary to the commandements of God. 2 Christ himselfe
Mat. 15 9, doth interprete this very place of vvil-worship in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
where for brevity sake, I refer the Def. unto M. <hi>Calvin</hi> whom
he calleth an honourable Witnesse in this controversie. He after
long discourse concludeth thus, <hi>fixum ergo illud maneat, fictitios
omnes cultus coram deo vanos esse: imo, teste propheta maledictos &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testabiles,
i. e.</hi> This must be held for certaine, that all vvorships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by man are before God, vaine, accursed and detestable. <hi>By
adding and diminishing Deut. 12 32 is not meant</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of preservation, but addition of corruption.</hi> Where 1 the phrase is
strange, <hi>by adding and diminishing is meant addition.</hi> 2 This glosse is
cleane contrarie to the text, for the Lord chargeth that we doe not
adde to the word, that so we may keep or preserue it Deu. 4 2 even
as we keep or preserue carefully that which is committed to our
trust 1 Tim. 6 20: now the Def. relleth us that some addition is the
meanes of keeping or preservation. Card. <hi>Cajetan</hi> himselfe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the place far more judiciously and religiously, <hi>inhibetur additio
etiam pretextu custodiendi mandata Dei,</hi> even of additions that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for preservation of Gods law, com. in <hi>Deu.</hi> 10. 3 He should
haue done well to haue manifested unto us the addition of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by some example: for that which he talketh of the coyner
pertaineth onely to <hi>corruption,</hi> of vvhich no man doubteth. 4 I
would know if there be not also a diminution of preservation, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:216:15"/>
well as an addition? in the text they are joyned together. 5 This
pretence vvas the old shoeing-horne to draw on superstition into
the Church, as <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth on Mat. 15 2, <hi>Legislatores ipsi non jacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and place, <hi>de effect. sacr. l. 2 c. 32 prohibet dominus additionem corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentem,</hi>

                  <p>HEre are two testimonies brought to confute the Non-conf.
his interpretation of Scripture, wherby he would infer that
all kinde of will-worship is unlawfull. For that is here the
question and nothing else. The first Witnesse is <hi>Danaeus,</hi> where
the consequence lyeth thus, if <hi>Danaeus</hi> in one place doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
these Scriptures to grosser will-worship then our is, then he
doth not allow that they condemne all kind of wil-worship; but
the first is true: <hi>ergo.</hi> is not this a faire kinde of reasoning: just as
the Papist <hi>Gregorius de Valentia</hi> reasoneth, abominable idolatry is
condemned, 1 Pet. 4. 3, therfore not all idolatry.</p>
                  <p>The other Witnesse is <hi>Zanchius</hi> in Col. 2 23, where beside that
the like consequence is made as before, I would desire any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
man to consider these vvords of <hi>Zanchie</hi> found in that verie
place. <hi>One kind of wil-worship is if any new worship, wherby God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
be invented and brought into the Church. For God will onely be
worshipped, and onely with that worship which he himselfe hath appointed,
Deut. 6 Mat.</hi> 15, also those in 1 <hi>Thes. 1 9. By an idol in generall is meant
whatsoever in Religion is brought in without the word of God.</hi> He that

bringeth forth his wedge again, distinguishing betwixt essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:216:15"/>
for now he telleth us, that <hi>essentiall worship is that wherein i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, which serveth for the more consonant and convenient discharge
of that essentiall worship.</hi> But these are but words. For 1. worship
doth not varie according to mens opinion: but consisteth in the
nature of the action it selfe. Otherwise a man may goe to Masse,
conceiving a privat opinion to himselfe, that he doth it not for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
sanctity, efficacie, or divine necessity, but for some other cause.

2. Sanctitie cannot be separated vvholly from such ceremonies
vvhich are proper unto religion. i. appropriated unto religious
persons, actions, and purposes onely, in the solemne vvorship of
God. For they must either be holy, or civill, or prophane. But ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
they are not; for then the bare omission of them vvould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
rudenesse and incivilitie: nor prophane, I hope, in the Def.
opinion: therefore they must needs be holy. 3. There is no judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

true, neither was any reader so sottish, as ever tooke that to be his
meaning. For vvhat sence could there be in these words, <hi>all humane

grate upon the ill sound which these words have, <hi>the inward vertue
of worship consisteth in an opinion.</hi> 2. How can an inward vertue be
placed in an outward ceremonie? 3. The proper nature of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is not in holinesse and justice, but in the honouring of God:
and all externall ceremonies vvhose proper use is the honouring of
God, are externall vvorship, as all diuinitie sheweth. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but an idle unlearned evasion, to talk of holinesse, and justice,
in opinion, vvhen the question is of vvorship. <hi>Calvin</hi> never
thought of such toyes. He amplifieth indeed his accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Papists by such circumstances as those are, according as

onely a ceremony which is among the Papists made <hi>necessarie.</hi> But
he should shew two things if hee would answer soundly: 1 that
<hi>Chemnitius</hi> doth distinguish, as he doth, of will worship, as some
were lawfull, and some onely unlawfull. 2. hee should shew us at
the least, that there is some vvorship which is not necessarie: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

                        </gap>emnitius</hi> in condemning will-worship that is imposed
as necessarie, doth condemne all wil-worship. Now we in our sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
divinitie (for so it will be accounted) conceiue thus: All wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is that honour, dutie, and reverence vvhich the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creature doth owe to the creator: and therfore cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
how such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dutie is not necessary to be performed: or
how there can be a vvorship, which being part of this tribute, may
rest in mans choyce vvhether it shall be paid or no. Perhaps this
necessitie pertaineth onely to the vvorship commanded by God:
but in that vvhich man diviseth of himselfe, there is more libertie,
there being no reason, that voluntary service should be constrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
If this be the cause, then the vvorship appointed by man, is no
part of his love towards God, nor any testification of it. For if it
vvere, surely it should be necessarie, seeing it is necessary to loue
God vvith all our hearts, vvith all our soules, and vvith all our
strength.</p>
                  <p>The third vvitnesse is <hi>P. Martyr, loc. com.</hi> 770. vvhere he sayth,
concerning things in their own nature indifferent, that <hi>speciall care
must be had, lest any such thing be thought to make towards the worship
of God, because divine worship dependeth not on mans will, but on Gods
counsell.</hi> A man vvould think that these vvords are plaine enough
for the condemning of all vvil-vvorship. <hi>True</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>he
veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(forsooth) <hi>he sayth in the same place, that the Church may appoynt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of order:</hi> as if there were any among us that ever denied
this: <hi>therefore he condemneth not the institution of accidentall parts of
Gods worship.</hi> Let any man of sence give judgement here: <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
sayth, <hi>it is lawfull to appoint circumstances of order, but unlawfull to
appoint any worship.</hi> The Def. thus: <hi>P. Martyr alloweth men to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt
circumstances of order, therefore he alloweth them to appoynt some
worship.</hi> If this be not as plain a contradiction as any can bee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
then (according to the proverb) let him that taught me lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,

In the last place (as those which make a feast use to do) D. <hi>Morton</hi>
setteth down himselfe. But he may be accused though for sitting
down too soon: for in the Abridgm. I find <hi>Melancthon, Bullinger,
Bucanus, Perkins</hi> and others invited to this meeting, vvho now by
this hastinesse of the Def. can find no place. Yet let us heare what
he sayth for himselfe. <hi>I do not</hi> (sayth he) <hi>condemne all the ceremonies
of Rome, but the multitude and burthen of them.</hi> To vvhich I answer,
1. the question is not here how many or how few you condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of the Romish ceremonies: but by vvhat reason you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them. He that condemneth one ceremonie because it is
a vvorship of mans devising, condemneth all vvorship that man
deviseth: and he that condemneth a multitude in that name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
one that is such, though it bee alone. 2. Because I haue
heard men often speak in this maner of the fault that is in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
I would willingly know, vvhat certaine limits and
bounds are set by Gods law, for the number of humane ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
such as now are in controversie. If there may be three, vvhy
not foure, fiue, sixe, and so forth, as many as it shall please the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
house, or him that can vvhen he vvill turne the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
upside downe? surely, if once vve depart from Gods insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
there vvill be no place to rest our foot in, but vve must ever
follow wind and tide, vvhich in religion is basenesse it selfe.</p>

In the next place he produceth or rather as the fellow sayd

could not but lift up my heart unto God, and say, O Lord, how
can such conceited confidence fasten on a man that regardeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

grounds as these, obtrude the conception of their braines upon
thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Churches? <hi>Vrsine</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>hath catechised them wel.</hi> True:

with <hi>What is your name?</hi> and though I doe not account
this Def. in that number, yet I may safely say, that hee never vvell
considered vvhom or vvhat he cited out of <hi>Vrsine.</hi> All that he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
is out of the commentary on q. 96. ob. 3. &amp; 5. as it is set
downe by <hi>Pareus.</hi> Now before obiections be brought, it is fit and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:216:17"/>
usuall that the <hi>Thesis</hi> or sentence be set down against vvhich those
objections fight; and no vvise man will take up an answer made to
an obiection, before hee considereth the assertion against vvhich
that objection is made. See then vvhat the assertion of <hi>Vrsine</hi> is:
<hi>Ipsae ceremoniae (Ecclesiasticae sc. quae ab hominibus praecipiuntur) non
modo cultus Dei non sunt: sedetiam conscientias non obligant, &amp;c.</hi> the
very same thing vvhich we here maintaine, viz. that no lawfull
ceremonies appointed by man, are the worship of God. Except
therefore Ecclesiasticall ceremonies be therefore the vvorship of
God, because they be not the worship of God, the Def. had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to alledge this place of <hi>Vrsin</hi> in this question: and so iust it is in
the vvords here alledged out of the answer to the third objection,
<hi>those things which serve accidentally to the glory of God, are not the
worship of God.</hi> And to the 4. obj. <hi>By these examples wil-worship is not
established.</hi> And to the 5. obj. <hi>Indifferent things (being done of faith)
please God otherwise then the worship of God properly so called.</hi> Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any thing should be concluded from hence for vvill-wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship?
Surely no: and therfore the Def. himselfe maketh his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
out of these premises, that <hi>Divine worship properly so called
is that which is ordained of God.</hi> Was there any of us that ever doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of this? is it not the proposition vvhich this Def. undertook to
confute. <hi>But in a large sence</hi> (sayth he) <hi>humane ceremonies may bee
held to he a part of divine worship.</hi> This is that which we haue heard
averred before in this section. I had thought we should haue seene
it proved. But alas it could be no more then affirmed, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the shadow of a sentence whereby it is flatly condemned. <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>distinguisheth the substance of worship from those things
which are annexed to worship.</hi> Why so doe all the Non-conformists.
What then? are ceremonies worship in a large sence, because they
are annexed to worship? then the signe of the crosse is a sacrament
because it is annexed to a sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I wonder</hi> (sayth the Def.) <hi>how such poynts should seeme to be so raw

which <hi>Vrsine</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> expresse? they seeme to all of us well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested

                     <hi>TO proue that our ceremonies are imposed and used as vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

that they want nothing but a right author to make them true w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

those are in their imposition and use worship, and for want of a right au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ip: but our ceremonies are such. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Def. his answer is, that this learning never saw print, as he
thinketh, <hi>that the institution of God doth not alter the common nature
of worship.</hi> 1. It may be that hee never saw it in print: but I can
witnesse, that Mr. <hi>William Bradshaw,</hi> a man that knew how to
frame an argument in logicall manner, as well as any Bishop in
England, set this reason down in Print some 14 yeares since, in one
edition (as I remember) of his treatise concerning indifferent
things. But an answer to that treatise, or to this argument, was
never yet seene in print, though that begging of the question
be the chiefe ground of those invectiues vvhich are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
used in Sermons and vvritings about these questions, viz. that
they are things indifferent. This argument is also found in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of the same authors, concerning <hi>Divine worship,</hi> printed 1604.
2. Though it had never seen the print before now, yet that doth
not hinder, but it may be sound. For all sound reasons are not
found in print. 3. There is none of our Divines that treateth of
vvorship in generall and particular, but hath for substance this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
viz. that religious worship is that which is done to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God: and if it bee according to Gods commandement,
then it is true; if not, then it is false. The Def. cannot name one
of all that ever handled the common place of <hi>worship,</hi> that hath
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot so taught, which if it be true, then the institution of God doth
not alter the common nature of vvorship: 1. it doth not make that
vvorship which otherwise being used to some end, and in the same
manner, without Gods institution, vvere no worship at all.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gods institution</hi> (sayth the Def.) <hi>doth distinguish necessary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
from indifferent, and essentiall from accidentall.</hi> Grant all this:
what can be made of it? Doth it therefore alter the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of worship, making that worship, vvhich without it being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the same manner, and to the same end, is no worship? here is
no consequence at all. Beside, neither scripture, nor interpreters
of Scripture, nor any good reason will allow, that there is any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
worship of God. Neither is it the institution of God
(common to all worship) which maketh one more, and another
lesse principall: but the nature of the thing instituted by him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>the offering of any coloured sheep was indifferent before the
Leviticall law: afterward, the offering of an unspotted lamb, was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and essentiall in the worship of God.</hi> To which objection I answer,
1. This his opposition of offering any coloured sheep before the
Leviticall law, to the offering of an unspotted lamb afterward, is
vain and without ground from the law of God; seeing it doth no
where appeare in the Scriptures, but that it was as lawfull to offer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:216:18"/>
any coloured sheep after the law given as well as before. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
by <hi>Moses,</hi> that the offerings of his people should be <hi>perfect,
Levit.</hi> 1. 3. 10 &amp;c. And this might well be notwithstanding diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of colour. The party-coloured sheepe of <hi>Iaakob</hi> were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
but of the perfectest sort, and that by the speciall direction
and blessing of God, <hi>Gen. 30. 41. 42. with</hi> 31. 11. 12. God complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of those that offered corrupt sacrifices, torne, lame, and sicke,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. 14. But for difference of colour, there is little colour or
shew of reason, that God gaue any such charge in his law. And it
is the Doctors ignorance of the story, or want of due consideration
that moved him thus to write. Secondly, suppose a lambe without
spot to be forbidden, then I answer, That if any man before the
commandement had offered an unspotted Lamb with the same
mind that after it was to be offered with, as thinking that his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
should in that respect haue been the more acceptable unto
God, because it was of a lamb unspotted, then the offering of such
a lambe had been as essential worship before, as it was after, though
it could not be so true and lawfull.</p>
                  <p>Did the Def. never read nor heare, that matter and forme doe
usually make up the essence of things? and that in institutions
which are means to an end, the respect of that end is also required
to the being, but a right efficient not so? let him consider a litle
of the grounds of logick, or read our most logicall Divines, such
as <hi>Sadeel</hi> is, and he shall soone perceive the truth. or else without
that labour, let him or any other of common sence tell me, if the
Temple of Ierusalem should haue been built with all the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and sacrifices with other observances there used, without
any commandement of God, according as they vvere by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment,
had there not been essentiall false worship erected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God? haue the Papists and Heathens no essential false worship,
but onely accidental? It is a shame to confute such unlearned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>

                  <p>HEre are many proofes conjoyned under the name of M. <hi>Hy.</hi>
and others: the answers to which are just such as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
be, meerly formall, without essence or substance of
truth.</p>
                  <p>The first is, ceremonies are imposed to breed an opinion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
as M. <hi>Hooker</hi> affirmeth, p. 61. and therefore are parts of
Gods worship. The consequence is not denied by the Def. not
yet the antecedent directly: so that the vvhole argument seemeth
to be granted, onely the Def. sayth, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> did not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<hi>operative</hi> holinesse either <hi>by infusion or inhesion</hi> (which two
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:216:18"/>
tearms are vnreasonably by him dis-ioyned) <hi>but onely significatiue, as
his words import.</hi> To which I answer, 1. that as the nice distinctions
vvhich are now used in the schooles of Iesuits, do not help, but that
Popish superstition is as grosse as ever it was in practise: so this
distinction of <hi>operatiue, infusion, inhaesion, significatiue,</hi> doth nothing
helpe, but the common people in many places inclined to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doe attribute as much holinesse to some of these ceremonies,
as they doe to some holy ordinances of God. 2. The Patrones of
our ceremonies, such as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> vvas, doe attribute that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the ceremonies vvhich the Fathers did. Now that they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
operatiue holinesse unto some of them, Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> hath
made, plaine in his booke of the Crosse, <hi>Part. 1. p.</hi> 77. 90 92. &amp;c.
3. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth not here speake of reverence signified by the
ceremonies, but of reverence to be signified towards them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things holy and vvorthy reverence. 4 What Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto the crosse, is to be seen in M. <hi>Parker,</hi> p. 91.</p>
                  <p>The second reason is, <hi>because the ceremonies are the constitutions
of a sacred Synod.</hi> The force of vvhich argument lyeth in this,
that a holy Assembly of spirituall Lords and their assistants, if
they bee truely holy and spirituall in their authoritie, and in the
exercise of it, will appoynt no ceremonies but holy: and by the
the observance of the said ceremonies, haue some spirituall honour
redounding unto themselues, because the vertue vvhich is found
in any effect, doth redound alwayes unto the praise of the cause.
To this the Defendant giveth no reall answer: onely he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
(contrary to the truth) <hi>that our Convocations may bee called
sacred, as well as the Churches of Christ Saints by calling.</hi> Whereas
beside other differences, Churches are of God: our convocations
are of man. Churches are gathered for the holy Worship of God:
convocations (as experience sheweth) for nothing lesse.</p>
                  <p>The third reason is, because <hi>the ceremonies are appropriated to the
acts of Religion in Gods service.</hi> To this the Defendant answereth
by denying the consequence, because <hi>the Pulpit cloth, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
cup, and the place of meeting are so appropriated, and yet not essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
holy.</hi> But herein he sheweth, that he doth not understand well
vvhat it is that he opposeth. For these things wherof he speaketh,
are onely civill, being drawn from the ordinary civill customes of
men, and are of the same use out of the service of God, that they
are in it: and therefore howsoever some speciall individuals of
this kinde may be appropriated unto religious acts, yet the kinde
is not: neither haue those specialls any other signification in the
service of God, then they haue in the service of men. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not such ceremonies as now are in question, nor so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:216:19"/>
The fourth confirmation is from Math. 15. vvhere such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are blamed of Christ by this reason. To this the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
answereth, that <hi>the act of washing is not there reproved, but
the invention and opinion of an operatiue sanctitie and holinesse attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto it.</hi> But first, to vvhat purpose doth he deny, that the
act of washing simply considered in it selfe, vvas unlawfull? was
there ever any so durtie, that hee would affirme such a foule
fancie? Secondly, the intention and opinion of holinesse is that
vvhich now our ceremonies are charged with. Therfore in that
there is no difference. Thirdly, that the Pharisies attributed any
more operatiue holinesse unto their washing then many amongst
us doe to the crosse, cannot bee shewed out of the Text. There is
not one circumstance there vvhich may not fitly bee applied to
our ceremonies. Fourthly, not onely <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place,
sayth that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is an able godly minister, if he will not use these ceremonies,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:216:19"/>
may not be suffered to haue place in the Ministerie: but he that
will use these ceremonies, though he may neither comparatiuely
to the other, nor any thing competently by himselfe, be either able
or godly, shall hold his place in the Ministerie. Therefore these
ceremonies are preferred before the maine things of the Law and
Gospell. 2 I take it thus: though there cannot be found able &amp;
discreet conformable Ministers enough to supply all the Parishes
of England, yet many able and godly men are shut out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
because they vvill not conforme to these ceremonies: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conformity to these ceremonies is preferred before the maine
duties of Gods vvorship. If all the Defendants sharpnesse of wit
can answere the bluntnesse of this Argument, vvhich every Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that is a good Christian doth usually make against the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
proceedings, then I for my part will be contented to be called
dull, for from my childhood hitherto I ever took it to be unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</p>
                  <p>The comparison of the Lord Chancellor vvill doe him no help
in this case. For that Chancellor were unworthy of his own place,
vvho would for his own pleasure, or for the circumstance of a
place, which may easily be changed, put out of commission a graue
wise man, when another like unto him could not be found. Beside
the case is nothing like: for in the circumstance of a place for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to meet in, there can be no conscience pretended. But
here offer hath been made by the Ministers thus wronged, solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to confirme by oath, that nothing but conscience doth keepe
them from conforming.</p>
                  <p>Now for the sweet termes vvhich it pleaseth the Def. heere to
use, I vvill desire no more, then that he would bring them back
againe to his owne conscience, and aske that before God, 1 whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
old M. <hi>Midsly</hi> of Ratsdel, vvho after he had laboured neere
50 yeare in the Ministerie to the conversion of thousands, vvas
inhumanely silenced by the Bishop of Chester, vvere a factious
and exorbitant man? and that vvhich I say of him because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to Chester, I understand of many hundreds vvhich haue
in like manner been oppressed. No doubt the evill servant which
is spoken of, Mat. 24 49, vvhen he began to beat his fellow servants
better then himselfe, called them factious and exorbitant fellows:
but he vvith all that are like him, know better, and one day shall
be constreyned to giue other witnesse. 2 I vvould know of the
Def. also whether all or the most of them vvhich are in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
be <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>discreet</hi> men in that religious meaning which
belongeth to Ministers? This I am sure of, the voyce of all the
Country goeth cleane otherwise. When M. <hi>Midsly,</hi> and his sonne
after him vvere silenced at Ratsdel, all that country knoweth what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:216:20"/>
an orderly discreet Preacher came into the place. When vvorthy
M. <hi>Baines</hi> vvas silenced at Cambridge, as a factious exorbitant
man, there vvas, beside many other unworthy Ministers, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>the Vicar of hell,</hi> vvho vvas kept in, as an orderly
discreet Preacher. 3 If faction and exorbitancie may be charged
on them that neglect a ceremonious canon upon conscience, what
name shall be found fit for the Prelates, vvho vvilfully, vvithout
and against conscience continually liue in and by the breach of
many substantiall, ancient and wholesome Canons? for this see

                  <p>HEre is alleaged the opinion vvhich many people in all parts
of the land haue concerning our ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Sacraments are not rightly &amp; sufficiently administred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. To this the Def. answereth three things, 1 <hi>That most
people hold the contrarie: 2 That the opinion of people in observing doth
not proue the judgement of governours in imposing: 3 that it is most
likely that those people which thinke so are brought into that conceite by
the opposition which it made against the ceremonies.</hi> But first, I would
faine know of the Defendant vvhy he passeth by in silence, not
onely the testimony of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> cited by the Abridgement for
confirmation of this part of the assumption, but also the passages
of Gods vvord, and many of the best Divines, vvhich are also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
there in the proposition, and applyed unto this part of the
assumption by the Authors of the Abridgement? surely this is not
plaine dealing. Secondly, I answer that the opinion of a few may
make that an action unlawfull, vvhich the opinion of many other
cannot make lawfull, as is to be seen 1 Cor. 10 28, <hi>if any man say
unto thee.</hi> Thirdly, it doth not appeare the most are otherwise
minded. For the most being used unto the ceremonies, and not
unto good teaching, may well be thought to haue the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of humane ceremonies vvhich they haue of divine. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Def. forgetteth vvhat vvas to be proved in this place: for
the question is not onely vvhether ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ceremonies be so imposed,
but also vvhether they be so esteemed and observed, as appeareth
in the Abridgement. Novv the opinion of the people proveth I
hope in vvhat manner they are esteemed and observed. And vvhile
they are so observed, they that still impose them in those places
vvhere they are so observed, may truely be interpreted so to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them. <hi>In actions of this kinde</hi> (saith Hooker l. 5 p. 165) <hi>wee
are more to respect what the greatest part of men is commonly prone to
conceiue, then what some few mens wits may devize in construction of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:216:20"/>
their particular meaning.</hi> Fiftly, the last conceit is ridiculous, that
the opposing and condemning of ceremonies should make men
thinke that the Sacraments are not sufficiently administred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them. <hi>The popish people</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue no great conceit of our
ceremonies.</hi> Why is it then that <hi>Gretser,</hi> and some other Iesuits call
our Prelats <hi>Calvino-papistae,</hi> Popish Calvinists? How is it that by
these ceremonies vve are borne in hand that the Papists are likely
to be drawn unto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vvith our Church? Whence is it that

                  <p>THe omission of ceremonies is here alledged to be more sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punished, then many great sinnes against the law of God,
though it be vvithout so and all and contempt. To this the
Def. answereth, first by denying the consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that if this
be so, then these ceremonies are preferred before the precepts of
God, and unlawfull. But 1 vvhy saith he nothing to <hi>the Churches
of Germanie, to Melancton, Martyr, Chemnitius, Bez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, Iunius, Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,
Polanus, Bucanus, Pilkinton, Perkins, and the whole Clergie of
England,</hi> brought in as allowing of this consequence, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement?
Are not all these worth one answer of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants?
2 The reason that he giveth for punishing more severely
the omission of a ceremony, then hainous sins, is frivolous. For
the true peace of the Church doth more depend on the keeping of
Gods lawes, then of observing mans inventions: especially of such
things vvhich never brought peace vvith them to any Church, but
as fire from hell haue alwaies bred a combustion. Neither yet can
the Defendant justifie that vvhich he saith of civill governments,
that they lawfully at any time more severely punish that offence
which is every way lesse, then another vvhich is greater. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he that hath but halfe an eye may see that it is but a sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
evasion, common to our Prelates with the Papists. I will not
therfore insist in this: if you please, you may see more of this matter
in M. <hi>Parker</hi> of the Crosse, <hi>part. 2 c. 1 s.</hi> 16 17. He answereth in

omission hath been often punished with suspension. 2 The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
house by their Canons haue provided and appointed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for meere omissions. If those canons be not in all
such points rigorously executed, it is either some personall good
vvhich is found in some Officers, or else meere shame. For though
canons doe not blush, yet the executioners haue some forhead left.
3 There may be continued omission, upon other causes beside con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
as ignorance, conscience &amp;c. so that vvhile the Def. so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
chargeth others for slandering the Church of God, he
manifestly slandereth them, which for any thing I know are as
much the Church of God as the Prelates. Concerning this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
see more in M. <hi>Parker p. 2c. 1 s.</hi> 14. As for the Lawyers
gowne, it is not long enough to cover the nakednesse of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
no though it be stretched to the length of one of our great
Prelates long traines vvhich are carryed up after them. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Counsellour would swear that he refused on conscience,
and that he could shew the judgement of the best Lawyers for his
opinion, condemning such a robe as unlawfull, the case is not like:

                  <p>IN the next place, the same thing is confirmed by the particular
indignities, vvhich peaceable, learned, godly minded men doe
suffer, for but declaring of their contrary judgement: as that

                        </gap>. 6 &amp;</hi> 98. In the repeating of
this Argument, I adde that out of the Abridgement, vvhich the
Def. for I know not vvhat reason, omitted. Now in his answer
he neither denyeth antecedent, nor consequence, so that the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader may safely take all to be granted. Yet that he might
seeme to say somevvhat, 1 he granteth that <hi>wee haue reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to wish, that some penalties were released.</hi> And haue we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
then to think the Convocation vvhich set these penalties was
nothing lesse then led by the spirit of God? And if the Def. can
thus shew his differing judgment from that Convocation in the
penalties, what disorder or exorbitancy is it for another to shevv
his differing judgment from them and him in ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, closly sliding by the chiefest accusation of <hi>Puritanism,</hi>
vvhich yet is most ordinary, and most impure, he saith for <hi>schisme,</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:216:21"/>
that those vvhich vvill not conforme unto our ceremonies doe
teach the principles of <hi>Separation.</hi> To vvhich I answer 1 That
there vvas never yet any Prelate that confuted the opinion of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists
any otherwise then by ralling vvords: vvhereas on the
side, diverse most averse from conformity haue foundly confuted
them. 2 Our principles doe no more tend to Separation,
then Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> rule doth, vvho vvhen <hi>Diotrephes</hi> played the
Dioecesan in the Church, did vvrite unto the faithfull people that
they should not follow the evill vvhich vvas among them, but
the good, 3 <hi>loh.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he talketh of diverse distractions in the Church, while
some vvill heare onely a conformable Minister, and some onely
an unconformable. But what is this to the purpose? For by this
reason Conformers may as well be accused of schisme as Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformers.
Againe, if all did conforme, there would be still the
like distractions for some would onely heare preaching Ministers,
and some would never bee present but at reading. Some vvould
onely heare godly Preachers: and some vvould onely tast
Lettice fit for their lippes. Who should then be the authours of
schisme?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he telleth us that all Churches challenge a subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their orders. But 1 all Churches cannot possibly doe this
lawfully: because some Churches doe directly contradict other in
their decrees. 2 Few Churches require such a forme of Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as ours is, though they haue not the tenth part of doubts and
difficulties in their formes, which we haue in ours. 3 I aske again
that vvhich M <hi>Parker</hi> hath asked vvithout an answer, that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospell should be deprived for disusing Popish ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,

                  <p>AFter full satisfaction given to our Arguments about the point
of the worship (as the Def. vvould haue the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue)
he commeth to confute our Assumption. <hi>viz.</hi> the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
are not esteemed, imposed, and observed as parts of Gods

much every where of <hi>their own Witnesses their own Witnesses,</hi> doth
here first of all giue no answer to our Witnesses, as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

If they be not his Witnesses, they are at least the ceremonies
Witnesses: he should therefore haue given some respect. But we
shall haue another Champion come after this Def. as it is likely,
vvho vvill as little regard him. For <hi>justum est quod Spartae prodest,</hi>
all is good that makes for the times.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas he hath nothing to bring for confutation of
our arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment, but onely the judgement of the greater part of the
imposers, I say, this is no vvay sufficient: For the question here
is not onely of <hi>imposing,</hi> but also of <hi>esteeming</hi> and <hi>observing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I answer to the places alledged, that it cannot be Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
concluded either from any one, or from all of them, that
they are not imposed as parts of Gods vvorship. <hi>We doe not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any holinesse or speciall worthiness</hi> (saith the canon) <hi>unto the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
No more (say I) is any speciall holinesse or worthinesse to
be attributed unto water: yet in baptisme it hath a holy relation
to holinesse. <hi>The crosse is not of the substance of the Sacrament.</hi> What
then? it may notwithstanding be vvorship: except the Def. will
acknowledge no vvorship but in the Sacrament. <hi>These ceremonies
may be altered and changed:</hi> by vvhom? By those that appointed
them. Shew me any Papist that dares affirme that the Church of
Rome hath not authority to alter &amp; change the ceremonies which
her selfe hath appointed. But <hi>the opposites doe acknowledge this.

                     <hi>THE third Argument is, because</hi> all humane ceremonies,

                     </gap> vvhat vvas the reason that this Confuter of the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

confirmation there alledged, and snatch at one place of Scripture,

                     </gap> his but a parcell of those confirmations vvherewith the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reason is backed? The first confirmation in the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, that <hi>the second commandement forbids us to make to our selues
the likenesse of any thing whatsoever for religious use: as it is understood
by Bucer, Virel, Fulk, Andrewes and others.</hi> The second confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that <hi>Christ is the onely Teacher of his Church, and appointer of
all meanes whereby we should be taught and admonished of any tholy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
For illustration of this second reason, among twenty other
allegations, something is brought out of Math. 7. Now the Def.
passeth by the maine reasons, and all other allegations that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to them, and maketh a stand at this place of Mat. 7, vvhich
yet for substance hath once been handled before in the former
Chapter. Is not this proper confuting?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in this very text, he toucheth not that wherein one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

it was taught and used as a doctrine by way of signification, to teach

this the Def. answereth nothing, but that with a simple denyall,
he sheweth that there were other causes vvhy our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
those vvashings: which is the very same thing vvhich
the Abridgement affirmeth, vvhen they say, <hi>by this Argument

depart so farre from the <hi>Pharisies:</hi> Which accusation, if it doth
not touch our blessed Saviour himselfe, I leaue to be considered
by the Defendant himselfe. Howsoever, the mentioning of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseisme</hi>

<hi>Augustine</hi> vvhich vvas miscited or misprinted in the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leaveth out the other out of Epist. 5 rightly quoted in
the Abridgement: Secondly, he maketh this place to conclude
the maine argument, whereas in the Abridgement it illustrateth
onely the third confirmation of that Argument. Concerning
<hi>Augustine</hi> he answereth, 1 that in the first place cited there is no
such thing, vvhich I grant to be true, but if in stead of <hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 35
be set <hi>lib. 2 cap.</hi> 1 then something vvill be found. 2 That else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
(not mentioning the fift Epist. which the Abridgement
quoted) <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, that <hi>all holy signes are called Sacraments:</hi>
but yet it doth not follow from hence that in his opinion all such
signes are Sacraments, but onely in vvord or phrase of speech.
Neither vvas it brought in (as he might haue marked) to proue
any such thing, but onely to shew that such signes participate
part of the nature of Sacraments: and this as that use of the
vvord Sacrament doth confirme, so that vvhich was derived
from thence, and hath been in perpetuall use, <hi>viz.</hi> that such
ceremonies are called <hi>Sacramentalia,</hi> Sacramentals. But <hi>neither
Augustine, nor other fathers doe disallow such ceremonies</hi> (saith
the Defendant) and this we doe not deny: if by disallowing be
meant constant rejecting of such things. Yet something is to be
found in their generall doctrine, from vvhich we may soundly
conclude against these inventions of man.</p>

produceth onely foure, as if there were no more to be found:
vvheras in the same place of the Abridgement, viz. p. 33. there
be many more ioyned to these, as before I shewed by name: and
to them divers others are added p. 35. But let us heare what he can
say to these foure vvhich himselfe hath chosen to answer. To <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
he sayth, that <hi>he speaketh onely of those mysticall ceremonies which
are properly sacramentall.</hi> And this, say I, was the very poynt for
vvhich this place vvas alledged, viz. that such significant signes are
properly sacramentall. Is not this then good answering? Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Mysticall-morall,</hi> I vvill speake something in the next section.
<hi>Zepperus</hi> sayth hee) <hi>hath not a word of mysticall signification.</hi> The
place is <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 10. vvhere among divers rules, he giveth this for
one, that sacramentall signes must signifie holy things to be sealed
up in the heart: from vvhence hee concludeth as against <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
traditions, because God will not by them stirre up any grace in
the heart of man:</hi> so in speciall by this vvith some other rules, hee
concludeth against the signe of the Crosse, and other such ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies

The sacraments (sayth he) doe signifie grace conferred: and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
signes doe signifie a dutie of man in some morall vertue. But
the Scripture teacheth us that the Sacraments doe also signifie the
dutie of man towards God. For by the sacraments the whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is signed and sealed betwixt God and man: so that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gods conferring of grace, but mans dutie through grace is there
professed and represented. This the name <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

in the Lords Supper, notifying that thankfulnesse we owe unto
God. This the words of institution doe plainly testifie in the
Lords Supper, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> And I think the Def.
vvhen he considereth the matter well, will not dare to deny, but
that <hi>sanctitie</hi> (which he sayth is signified by the Surplice) is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in Baptisme: and <hi>constancie</hi> also which hee ascribeth to the
crosse. If he doe, he may be easily confuted, by those places where
the scripture speaketh of it, especially Rom. 6. throughout the
chapter.</p>
                  <p>2 Against that morall signification attributed unto humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:216:24"/>
I propound this argument, in the words of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>overend

                        </gap>
but no signe of mans devising hath any such vertue in it, or with it: for
then it must come from that word put forth in the creation, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
things naturall should haue a force communicated to them of teaching
supernaturall: or else by Gods after-institution: such we read not any
but of Baptisme and the Lords supper onely: or by the Churches impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this cannot be: for prayer obtaineth those effects of things, to
which they serue by Gods creation and institution: but not any creating
or new conception of things to supernaturall uses. For then the Church
might ask that this or that creature might be made a sacrament unto her:
in which case she should pray without all warrant from Gods will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 If humane inventions be such morall admonishers in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
duties, the consciences of men without doubt are bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves unto their admonitions; and then unto them from
whom they doe admonish, or by whom they are made admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers:
i. to mortal men, such as our convocation consists on. Is not
this good divinitie?</p>
                  <p>4 Whatsoever is ordained in the Church as a teaching signe, that
ought often to bee interpreted unto the people in Sermons: for
that is the teaching which must cleare and perfect all teaching of
signes: and should not they preach fairly in the name and words
of Christ, that should expound unto the people the signification of
a surplice and a crosse? Would not this also be much for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the people, that sometime they must heare of the morall
good vvhich the ceremonies teach: and sometime be admonished
of the right meaning of our convocation house in the appointing
of these ceremonies, left they turne them to morall evill in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:
and at other times they must be instructed, how to defend
these ceremonies against the opposers of them, lest otherwise they
use them without faith? Surely all the Sermons which many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
heare, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>caree be sufficient for this doctrine of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p>5 I dare appeale to the eonfciences of the best conforming
Christians, whether ever they found themselves truely stirred up
to <hi>holinesse,</hi> by the Surplice, or to <hi>constancie</hi> by the Crosse? one
thing I am sure of, that in some one congregation where these ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
haue not appeared for 20 or 30 yeares together, there
hath been more holinesse and constancie of faith, then in many
Cathedrall Churches where they were never omitted.</p>
                  <p>This poynt being cleared, there need no great answer be given
to the cavill, of making <hi>signification the chiefe poynt of a sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:216:25"/>
For if the Def. meant to deale plainly, vvhy doth he change the
vvords, that he may find some colour for his accusation? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement
sayth onely, that it is a <hi>chiefe part:</hi> he accuseth them
for saying it is <hi>the chiefe part:</hi> betwixt vvhich two phrases, he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
how great roome there is for a wedge. 2. To proue that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
is one chiefe part, the Abridgement alleageth <hi>Gen. 17. 11.
Exod. 12. 13. Luk.</hi> 22. 19. why is no answer given to these places, if
the assertion bee false? 3 The Def. himselfe in his distinction
which he bringeth here concerning a sacrament, doth allow one
chiefe part of a sacraments nature to be <hi>signification ad modum sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.

worship, should be properly deemed sacraments.</hi> Why so? <hi>because
things take their denomination from the principall parts.</hi> True: but 1.
as hath been observed, there is difference betwixt <hi>a principall</hi> and
<hi>the principall.</hi> 2. Every thing that hath denomination from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
part, hath not properly the same name vvith it. A man may
in some sense be called spirituall, because his principall part is a
spirit: yet he may not be properly deemed a spirit. 3. all those ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
which had signification in the Leviticall law, haue this
denomination from sacraments, that they are properly called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall:</hi>

by then morall signification, may not now be used: much lesse may
any of those which man hath devised.</hi> But vvhy doth the Def. passe
by all the allegations vvhich belong to this reason in the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
p. 33. 34. they cite to this purpose first the Councel of Nice,
<hi>Austine, Martyr, Bullinger, Lavater, Hospinian, Piscator, Cooper, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Chemnitius, Danaeus, Hospinian, Arcularius,</hi> our book of Homilies,
<hi>Humphrey, Reynolds, Willet, &amp;c.</hi> Are all these worth no answer? at
least they shew, that this is no new reason divised by the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists:
but the common tenent of Protestants, and the
ground whereby they confute the superstition of Papists.</p>
                  <p>Yet let us heare his answer to the reason as it is nakedly in it selfe
considered: remembring alwayes, that he can say nothing, but that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:216:25"/>
which the Papists may as well say for many, of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
against this argument pressed vpon them by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
                  <p>His first answer is, that <hi>the use of some Iewish rite, without any Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish
opinion, is not damnable; instancing in circumcision and Easter.</hi>
Where 1. he should haue told us, how a Iewish rite can bee used,
without some part of a Iewish opinion? For he himselfe after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth,
that our ceremonies are not the same with the Papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee haue not the same opinion of them which the Papists
haue. 2. What doth he mean by this new tearme <hi>domnable?</hi> I hope
he doth not symbolize with the Papists in their difference of <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
sinne and <hi>veniall?</hi> of which fault he so vainly accused us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If he meane by <hi>not damnable,</hi> not <hi>unlawfull:</hi> then hee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
circumcision, as it is used vnder <hi>Prester Iohn,</hi> to be lawfull.
If hee meaneth any thing else, as, that it doth not utterly destroy
the being of a Church, then he speaketh some truth, but nothing at
all to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>His second answer is, that <hi>it is farre more safe to invent new cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
then to use those which God once appoynted, and now hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
because they might ingender an opinion of necessitie: and so might
bring in all the Leviticall law.</hi> Where 1. it is well he confesseth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that all the Iewish ceremonies are abolished: for therein hee
contradicteth that which hee sayd in his former answer. 2. from
hence our divines use thus to argue, <hi>Num vero veteres figurae subla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THe third and last reason vvhich the Def. could find brought
against significant ceremonies, is, that <hi>this will open a gappe to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:216:26"/>
images, oyle, spittle, and all Popish, ceremonies: all which Bellar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
commendeth, as fit to put men in remembrance of good things, &amp;c.</hi> To
this hee answereth divers things. 1. <hi>This consequence</hi> (sayth hee)
<hi>from some to all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is too lavish.</hi> But this consequence is of his owne
framing: for the consequent vvhich the Abridgement maketh,
is from the common nature of significant ceremonies, to every
speciall, being equally considered in regard of other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Neither is there any occasion at all in the Abridgement
for that ridiculous consequence which the Def. maketh from
<hi>may</hi> to <hi>must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in his example of the Kings Councell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is as unreasonable</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>as if a Patient that hath
some drugges prescribed him, should thence conclude hee may taste of
all.</hi> But it is as reasonable, say I, as if a Patient having some
druggs prescribed unto him, should thence conclude, he may taste
of any which are of the same nature, especially if the same Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
should prescribe them unto him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is unconscionable</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>because there are many
abuses mixed with Popish ceremonies.</hi> Which answer seemeth meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unconscionable; because it is plainly expressed in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement,
that this inference doth consider the Popish cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
onely, in regard of that signification vvhich they haue of
good things.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he disproveth the use of oyle and spittle, <hi>because they
were once vsed miraculously.</hi> As if the mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culous using of any thing
did forbid, that it should at any time after bee used for significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Surely then the many miracles vvhich histories do record to
haue been done by the Crosse, must needs banish that also out of
the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, for Images, hee sayth, <hi>They are not to be called Popish, but
onely in regard of superstitious adoration.</hi> As if <hi>Cassanders</hi> image were
not Popish: which is an assertion, 1. directly against all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
vvho not onely confute the Papists for adoration of their
images, but also for having them in any religious use, especially in
Churches; for this is the controversie betwixt <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
de Imag. lib. 2. c.</hi> 9. wherein this Defendant taketh <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
part. Secondly, it is directly against the Homily concerning ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
unto which we are bound to subscribe. Thirdly, it confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the soule words of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who saith that the Apologie of
the Church of England lieth, in saying that the Councel of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
decreed that Images should be abolished, <hi>De Concil. Auth. lib.
2. c.</hi> 8. for the onely answer is that which <hi>lunius</hi> giveth in his
notes upon that chapter, <hi>an. 56. He that forbiddeth Images to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
doth forbid the having of Images worshipable, especially in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi>
Which answer this Defendant doth flatly deny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:216:26"/>
Sixtly, for holy water, he sayth, <hi>that may bee accounted Christian,
were it not for the operatiue power which is ascribed unto it in Poperi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
But good Protestants, I thinke, will rather beleeve <hi>Calvin,</hi> who
calleth it <hi>a kind of repetition of baptisme. Instit. l. 4. c. 10. sect.</hi> 20. and
<hi>Iunius,</hi> who peremptorily affirmeth, that <hi>no humane ordination, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or superstition, can make it good and profitable. in Bel. de Cul. sanct.
l. 3. c.</hi> 7. At the least let it be called <hi>Iewish,</hi> not <hi>Christian:</hi> for Christ
will not haue his name called upon such superstitious devices: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it, without taking in vaine.</p>
                  <p>7 <hi>Lastly,</hi> he sayth, <hi>there is no reason to deprive the Church of power
of ordeining significant ceremonies, because she may abuse it:</hi> wherein he
saith true. But to argue from manifest abuses, against that which is
called use, and yet is as like those abuses as one egge is like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this I hope is reason.</p>
                  <p>That which by the way is brought out of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> is not of
any great force. For he there persuadeth that unto <hi>Hooper</hi> out of
a good aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction, which out of conscience he durst not doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
though his place at Oxford did tie him unto it, as hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in an Epistle, p. 1127. Where also hee sheweth, that the
chiefe end that moved him so to persuade <hi>Hooper,</hi> was because he
hoped, that by his and such mens yeelding, the ceremonies might
in time be abolished: which we find to be an erronious conjecture.
But that hath much lesse reason in it which he addeth, viz. <hi>that the
open gap of many ceremonies is now quite shut up, because our church is
contented to admit of so few, and no more.</hi> For 1. we haue not so much
as the word of our Prelats for this <hi>nil-ultra.</hi> 2. The gap is every day
made wider and wider by such defenses as this is, which allow of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
themselues for some religious use. For by this meanes any
crucifix may come in, that is not greater then the Church doore.
3 They that shut up a gap upon their pleasure onely, can when
they please open it againe.</p>
                  <p>Now I haue maintained the testimonies and reasons which this
Def. could find in the Abridg, against significant ceremonies, I wil
add one, lest it should be forgotten, or lost: which I know not how
the Def. leaped over, seeing in the Abridg, it hath deservedly the
first place among all the proofes, which are brought in to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The argument stands thus in the Abridg. p. 31. <hi>The second
commandement forbids us to make to our selves the likenesse of anything
whatsoever, for religious use: and so is this commandement understood by
Bucer, Virel, Fulk, and D. Andrewes now Bishop of Winchester.</hi> And p.
32. 33. D. <hi>Andrewes</hi> is brought in alledging this for the root of all
superstition and idolatry, <hi>that men thought they could never haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
and helps enough to stirre them up to wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ship God. Yet God</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>had given foure meanes, viz. the word written, the word
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:216:27"/>
preached, the sacraments, and the book of the creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now lest the Def. may seeme to have passed over this proofe as
unworthy any answer, I will briefly add the grounds of it.</p>
                  <p>1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>likenesse</hi> used in the second commandement
is generall, and comprehendeth under it all religious similitudes,
because they are homogeneal to Images there expresly forbidden.</p>
                  <p>2. Significant ceremonies are external acts of religious worship,
even as they are used to further devotion. <hi>Suarez in Thom. p. 3.

at which God is vvorshipped. The Def. distinction of <hi>essentiall</hi> &amp;
<hi>accidentall</hi> worship, vvill help no more here, then the Papists <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Gods law is not mocked with vain distinctions.</p>
                  <p>3. The affirmatiue part inioyneth obedience to all the worship
appoynted by God: all which was significative, <hi>Heb. 8. 5. &amp;</hi> 10. 1.

man be brought into religious actions. The nature of the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

                  <p>HEre the <hi>Defendant</hi> undertaketh and beginneth a confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Scriptures of that assertion, vvhich denieth signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
ceremonies of mans institution to bee lawfull in Gods
worship. Now a man would haue exspected by the title, some rule
of Scripture: but seeing none can bee found, vvee must bee
content vvith examples: vvhich notwithstanding are nothing
so firme and certaine as rules. Yet let us heare what examples
he can bring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:216:27"/>
The first example is <hi>Abrahams</hi> directing of his servant to put
his hand under his thigh vvhen he did swear. It is mervaile he
did not beginne before. <hi>Abraham.</hi> For <hi>Suarez</hi> the Iesuit to proue
the same point for substance, bringeth <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifice, <hi>Noahs</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
&amp;c. in <hi>Thom. 3. qu. 65 a</hi> 4, which serue also as much to the
purpose as this example. But to the point in hand. 1 It is in all
probabilty false, that <hi>Abraham</hi> appointed this ceremony. So
<hi>Calvin, Iunius</hi> and others upon the same place, doe judge,
because it vvas a signe of subjection usuall in those easterne
parts.</p>
                  <p>2 It is false also (vvhich he faith in the second place) that
swearing is the most divine seruice of God of all other. For the
proper end of swearing is not to vvorship God, but to confirme
a truth: though in the appealing unto a supreme Witnesse and
Iudge worship is implyed, and so an oath appropriated unto God
as a part of his vvorship, not in the principall end of it, but in
manner of seeking that end. This is plaine by the nature of an
oath.</p>
                  <p>3 It cannot be proved, that this ceremony did teach any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
dutie. It is most probable, that it was a common signe of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
used in solemnities of that kinde, as well out of an oath as
in it, vvithout any respect unto Christ, as vvith it. If the Def.
never read any such thing (as he saith he did not) I cannot helpe
that. I assent unto <hi>Calvin</hi> herein the rather, because that as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands in those parts did alwaies signifie some superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
so this under position of hands vvas by proportion fit to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
subjection of inferiours.</p>
                  <p>4 Lastly, if all this vvere granted, that this signe vvas appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it vvas appointed in solemne vvorship, and that it
did signifie a holy thing: yet tho Defendant should remember
that <hi>Abraham</hi> vvas a Prophet, and of more authority by farre in
the Church of God, then our Convocation-house. So that this
instance is nothing to the purpose, as, I am perswaded, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
servant vvould sweare, if he vvere heere present,
and it vvere needfull, even in the same manner that then hee
did to his Master.</p>

is, that <hi>no outward worship of God is lawfull, but onely that

to restraine the whole day.</hi> Where 1 M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> is vvronged
by the Def. for he confesseth (in the places quoted) expresly, that
upon some extraordinary cases the Church may restraine a whole
day, as at a solemne fast. 2 He should let us see vvhat mysticall
signification is in the times appointed, as he striveth to doe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

out of Ester is no sufficient warrant for our Holy daies: 1 because
our estate ought not to be so ceremonious as theirs, 2 That was done by
a speciall direction of the spirit of God. <hi>To this the Def. answereth

much more now. <hi>Which consequence vvere good,</hi> cae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>if all other things did agree: but this is that very thing vvhich
M.</hi> Cartwright <hi>denyed. He answereth in the second place, that</hi> it is

presumption to imagine a speciall direction where none can be proved.
<hi>But how shall vve trust this man in relating the Arguments and
Answers of the Ministers in private conference, vvhen now the

M.</hi> Cartwright <hi>as giving no reason for that he saith, vvhose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

appeare by another place, where the Iewes changed their fasts into feasts,
onely by the mouth of the Lord, through the ministerie of the Prophet.
For further proofe whereof I take the 28 ver. where it appeareth that
this was an order to endure alwayes, even as long as other feast daies,
which were instituted by the Lord himselfe: so that what abuses soever
were of that feast, yet as a perpetuall decree of God it ought to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained:
whereas our Churches can make no such decree, which may not
upon change of time and other circumstances be altered. For the other

decree of profane Kings, but addeth precisely, that as soone as ever the
decree was made, it was registred in this booke of <hi>Ester,</hi> which is one
of the bookes of Canonicall Scripture: declaring therby in what esteem
they had it. If it had been of no further authority then our decrees, or
then a canon of one of the Councels, it had been presumption to haue
brought it into the Library of the Holy Ghost.</p>

proveth the setting up of this Altar to haue beene humane, which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:216:29"/>
no man that I know ever doubted of.</p>
                  <p>2 He would proue that it vvas appointed to Gods service. But

picture, vvhich resembleth any thing belonging to the
Scripture &amp; holy uses, is also holy. 3 If any of the Tyrians which
vvrought under <hi>Salomon</hi> about the vvork of the Temple, should
haue procured a modell of the Temple to be drawne, and carried
it vvith him into his Country for to haue shewed it them for
newes, had that model been religious or holy? the Def. thought
he had to doe with such as vvould beleeue whatsoever he said.</p>
                  <p>3 He goeth about to proue, that it vvas mysticall signification
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaching a spirituall dutie: because that one end of it vvas, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the present Gileadites, to teach that the Lord was God:</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>in respect of their posterity, to testifie their consent in the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
But in all this faire shew, there is scarce one word true. For
1 it doth not appeare out of the text, that there vvas intended any
use of it for the present age that then lived. The contrary appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
plainly, vers. 27, 28 &amp;c. The last verse cited to this purpose
by the Defendant, must be interpreted as <hi>Iun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us</hi> noteth out of
the 30 verse. So that even by this it is manifest that a direct helpe
unto devotion vvas not sought for in the erecting of this altar. For
then not onely the two Tribes then living should haue had use of
it, but most of the other Tribes should haue had reason to haue
imitated their example, in setting up Altars of devotion even at
every three-way-leet, as crosses are wont to stand. 2 in regard of
posterity, the immediate end was to testifie, that though they were
separated from the other Tribes by the river Iordan, yet they
belonged to the same people, and had right to come unto the
same place of vvorship. Now vvhat is this to a ceremonie which
hath state and immediate use in the speciall solemne worship of
God? the use of this testifying vvas to procure a consent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
in future times among the other Tribes, that these two
Tribes might be suffered to come to the Temple for to worship
God there. So that neither the two Tribes, nor the other ten were
stirred up by this Altar as by an instituted mystical ceremonie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vvorship or devotion: for as for the two Tribes, they vvere
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:216:30"/>
onely to shew this monument unto those vvhich called their right
into qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

right. What is this to a garment of religion, or solemne religious
vvorship?</p>

                  <p>THE second instance is <hi>Salomons</hi> altar, 1 King. 8 64, wherein
1 I cannot but marvell at the addition vvhich the Def. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
unto the Text, vvhen he telleth us out of the Scripture
of an <hi>altar,</hi> and of a <hi>brazen Altar,</hi> built by <hi>Salomon,</hi> vvithout spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
warrant: whereas in the text there is neither mention made
of brasse, nor of Altar, but onely of sanctifying the inner part of
the Court: he did not surely attend much unto that vvhich hee
wisheth to another, sect. 20 in these vvords, <hi>I would you had leasure
to looke more directly upon the text alledged.</hi> But for the matter it selfe,
it is vvorth the marking, to obserue by this example vvhat autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is given unto men in the vvorship of God by our Masters of
ceremonies, not onely to appoint accidentall vvorship, but even
that vvhich is principall and most essentiall: that which maketh

they say man may of his own head appoint an Altar? If they say
man may appoint an Altar, but not the offering upon the Altar,

c.</hi> 6. But from M. <hi>Nic.</hi> this answer vvill not be received. The
Def. saith it can never be proved. But suppose an altar to haue been
built as the Def. vvill haue it, and then I hope the nature of the
thing doth sufficiently proue it, as before I shewed: Beside <hi>Salomon</hi>
had not yet declined from the right vvaies of his father <hi>David,</hi>
vvho did attempt nothing about the Temple but according to the
vvriting which he received from God, as he told <hi>Salomon</hi> 1 Chron.
28 19, Neither is it to be omitted, that <hi>Salomon</hi> at that very time
vvhen he did this thing in question, was acted and lifted up extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
in communion vvith God: as appeareth by that divine
prayer vvhich he then made for the Dedication of the Temple,
vvhich cannot be judged but to proceed from the extraordinary
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:216:30"/>
direction of Gods holy Spirit. Lastly, if that had not been so, yet
the high Priest was at hand vvith <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> by which
vvhen it was so easie to haue speciall direction, vvho can thinke
that <hi>Salomon</hi> would venture on such a matter as this upon his own
head? <hi>But the contrary is proved</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>because a reason is
rendred in the Text which moved Salomon to doe that he did.</hi> As if these
two could not stand together, to doe a thing upon some reason: and
yet to doe it upon speciall direction from God! see <hi>Num.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>A second answer is given by some of our Divines, that <hi>Salomon did
this out of the equity of Moses law:</hi> so <hi>Iunius cont. 3. l. 4. c.</hi> 19. To this
the Def. replyes, <hi>that this answer overthwarts the former.</hi> Which is
nothing so. For <hi>Salomon</hi> might be, and no doubt vvas in speciall
manner directed to see the equity of the Law, and specially dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and authorised also to follow it. The Def. therfore is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that advantage which he maketh of this answer.</p>
                  <p>A third answer is brought in by the Def. under the name of
M. <hi>Nic. viz.</hi> that <hi>God by his visible descending approved of the worke
of the Temple, and did authorize Salomon to doe that he did.</hi> To whom
the Def. vvisheth more leasure, that he may look better upon the
Text, <hi>vvhere he should not finde that God approved the Temple of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
by any visible appearance, untill the sacrifice was ended.</hi> But if the
Def. had had both leasure and pleasure to looke better upon the
text, before he had censured another, then 1 he would haue seene
that God appeared in the Temple before the sacrifice was either
ended or begun: 1 <hi>King. 8 10 11 2 Chron.</hi> 5 13 14. 2 He should
haue seene also that <hi>Salomon</hi> built the brazen Altar, not of his own
head, nor upon a suddain which vvas impossible, but by the same
direction that he did all the other holy things, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 1. 3. He
would not haue talked so loosely as he doth heere s. 20, vvhere
no man can gather by his vvords, that he knoweth of any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
appointed particularly of God, beside the Altar of incense.</p>
                  <p>A fourth answer is, that vvhich <hi>Daneus</hi> giveth unto <hi>Bellarmine,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on. 3 lib. 4 c. 19, viz.</hi> that <hi>this was not a new additament for kinde,
but for some circumstance onely; because this Court was sanctified by
God, Exod. 27 &amp; 40, and Salomon is said to sanctifie because he put it
to that use which was not ordinarie.</hi> To this the Def. replyeth nothing
vvorth the answering: but onely that he accuseth M. <hi>Nic.</hi> and so
in deed the Divines formerly alledged, of unconstancie &amp; uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancie:
whereas the answeres that haue been given may very
vvell concurre all of them in one action, and one answer. The rest
of his talke doth hang upon the hornes of his new found brazen
Altar: and there I leaue it.</p>

                  <p>THe first example brought out of the New Testament, are the
the feasts of charitie, ordained (as the Def. sayth) by
the Apostles. To which our answer is ready, that if
they were ordained by the Apostles, then they vvere not humane,
but divine, and therefore nothing pertaining to our question. To
this the Defendants reply is, <hi>that if divine be opposed unto constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not commanded of God, then we could not haue uttered a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
position: because all Divines distinguish betwixt divine, Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,
and Ecclesiasticall traditions.</hi> All Popish Divines indeed doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of this distinction, because it maketh for their purpose: and
some of our English vvhen they vvrite in defence of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
or of the ceremonies: but so deeply to accuse those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it, for vvant of learning, this is too magisteriall For 1. that
vvhich came from the Apostles as they vvere Apostles, that came
from the spirit of God, Act. 15. 28. 1. Cor. 7. 40. and to call that
divine which hath the divine spirit of God: 1. God himselfe for
authour, vvhat vvant of learning is in this? 2 <hi>Iunius</hi> vvas a Divine,
and learned, yet he sayth, that this distinction betwixt Divine and
Apostolicall traditions, is almost <hi>imaginarie</hi> and <hi>superfluous in Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont.
1. lib. 4. c. 2. an. 6. Danaeus</hi> calleth it <hi>a childish distribution, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und.
loc.</hi> more learned divines, might easily be named, that doe so
allow of this distinction. And indeed, to examine it by that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by vvhich distinctions are chiefly to be tried, it hath no Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
at all in it. For 1. the distinction pretended betwixt things
appoynted for perpetuall use, and those that may be altered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion: This distinction or difference (I say) is no way
contained, in the tearmes <hi>Divine, Apostolicall</hi> 2. Some things
vvere immediatly by Christ appointed, vvhich vvere not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:216:31"/>
as many things proper to the Apostles and their times. And
some things appoynted by the Apostles which were to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
as the essentialls of Ecclesiasticall government.</p>
                  <p>A second answer is brought in, <hi>that these feasts were abrogated by the
Apostles. Then</hi> (sayth the Def.) 1. <hi>they were not of divine institution.</hi>
Not in that sence indeed, which meaneth by divine perpetuall: but
yet they might be divine, as gifts of tongues, healing, prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. vvere. <hi>Then</hi> 2. (sayth he) <hi>the Church may institute and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate
as the Apostles did.</hi> The consequence is but faint: yet the
consequent or thing inferred, may be granted, so that the Church
keep within her bounds. Our finall answer is, <hi>That these feasts of
charitie were not of mysticall signification, nor yet meerly Ecclesiasticall.</hi>
And indeed it is plaine, that these feasts did carry no ordained sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
but that which nature her selfe had imprinted in their
foreheads. For who knoweth not that familiar feasting of poore
and rich together, is a demonstration and preservation of loue,
vvithout institution? and yet this is all that the Def. can say for
their signification. Neither were these feasts merely Ecclesiasticall
or religious, because they were used in the assemblies: for they
were also used in the same manner, and to the same end, out of the
assemblies. Their proper end was reliefe of the poore, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of brotherly loue.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, for the ordination of these feasts, it cannot be
shewed to haue been Apostolicall. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in 1. Cor. 11. 22.
judgeth otherwise. So that in this example, the Def. can neither
shew mysticall signification, religious ceremonie, nor Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ordination: and yet except all these be proved, the instance
maketh nothing at all unto his purpose. But that which hee lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in weight of arguments, he strives to make up in number.</p>

                  <p>THE next instance (like the former) is <hi>the kisse of peace.</hi> To
vvhich our answer is, that <hi>it was a naturall indicant signe of peace
and reconciliation.</hi> But the Def. borrowing light from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoriall
phrases of the Fathers, will proue the contrarie: though
it be as manifest as any thing can be, both by Scripture, and also
by other histories, that it was a civill naturall fashion used in those
parts upon ciuill occasions as well as holy. Now what doth hee
proue? <hi>First the institution, so farre as it was not commanded by Christ,
was humane.</hi> This he affirmeth, but proveth not: and in his affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
wavereth like a reed shaken with some winde. <hi>So farre it
was from Christ; and so farre it was from man:</hi> and yet we heare not
how farre from either. The plain truth is, it was of no institution
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:216:32"/>
at all: but of naturall inclination and civill custome, vsed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the comming of Christ, as is to be seen every where in the old
Testament, Gen. 29. 13. 1. Sam. 20. 41. &amp;c. yet by direction or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
it received constant application unto some speciall acts. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
he sayth, <hi>it was significant,</hi> that is, it had a naturall fitnesse to
declare the inward affection of loue. What is this to a significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imposed by man? it vvas so significant as shaking of hands:
vvhich gesture also used to be joyned with it: <hi>Tunc ambo nexi ad
invicem dextras damus in osculo pacis sacrae, &amp;c.</hi> It did so signifie loue
as the turning away of the face doth signifie alienation of minde.
<hi>But</hi> (sayth he) <hi>it signified Christian loue.</hi> As if Christian loue had not
in it the common nature of loue, and therefore cannot be signified
partly by naturall signes common to loue. Cleanlinesse in the
celebration of the sacraments, is the same that it is at another
feast; though in regard of that application, it may be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
or holy cleanlinesse or decencie. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he sayth, <hi>it was used
in time of holy worship.</hi> So no doubt was giving of the upper place
unto the Elders, &amp;c. in token of reverence: and yet it was no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
instituted signe of mysticall signification: such reasons as
these bewray more confidence then good consideration.</p>

                  <p>THe third and last example vvhich is brought out of Scripture,
is, the covering and uncovering of the head at divine service,
1. Cor. 11. to vvhich I answer as before, that it was a civill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of decencie, used as well out of Gods worship, as in it. But
here the Def. taketh paines to make many collections, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the same by divers witnesses. <hi>Because</hi> (as he sayth) <hi>this poynt
is of some moment;</hi> though the other were of none: let us therfore
briefly consider what they be.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>I would first learne</hi> (sayth he) <hi>whether this ceremonie of covering
and vncovering were not significant of some good thing?</hi> I answer, that
this fashion which he abusiuely calleth a ceremonie, was significant
in a generall sence: that is, it did declare or argue a good thing.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>I would ask what thing it is that is hereby signified?</hi> I answer, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and superiour power. <hi>But there is a relation also to God,</hi> sayth
the Def. I answer, there is in mans superioritie, a kind of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Gods soveraignite: and so there is also, as <hi>Calvin</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<hi>in omni principatu</hi> in all superiour power: so that this maketh
covering and uncovering, no more a religious significant ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
then the upper seat of a heathen Magistrate sitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for by that seat is signified a superioritie, in which there is
some image of Gods sovoraigntie. There is nothing alledged out
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:216:32"/>
of our Divines by the Defendant, which may not as well bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Iudges bench, as to this covering and uncovering. And
the Apostle doth shew plainly, that the vaile he speaketh of, vvas
of the same nature vvith long haire. So that, by the Def. reason,
mens short, and vvomens long haire, must be accounted religious
mysticall ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Our third demand</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is, whether these ceremonies of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and uncovering, were not instituted to bee observed in Gods publicke
worship?</hi> I answer, it was required that they should be observed in
holy Assemblies. But 1. it was not onely required in Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
vvorship, but also as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place granteth, <hi>In quovis
graviore coetu aut matronarum aut virorum,</hi> in any graue meeting of
men and women. And instit. lib. 4. cap. 10. sect. 29. <hi>ne mulieres in
publicum nisi velatae procedant: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Whensoever they goe into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
places. 2. It was not instituted primarily and principally for
Gods worship. If it were, I aske, vvhen and by whom? <hi>Paul</hi>
surely did not institute a new ceremony in this place: for v. 14. he
groundeth his admonition upon <hi>nature,</hi> i. as <hi>Calvin</hi> well expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it, vpon a received vse and ancient custome in those parts:
which some through lightnesse began unseemly to transgresse.
There is nothing alledged out of <hi>Martyr</hi> or <hi>Chrysostome</hi> against
this answer.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly</hi> (sayth he) <hi>wee desire to know, whether this matter were
not a thing indifferent?</hi> I answer, it is indifferent in the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it; yet at that time, and in that place, they sinned that did
otherwise, even before <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of their overseers, gaue them
charge about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> (sayth he) <hi>it is worthy our inquirie to learne how farre other
Churches may be directed by this example?</hi> I answer, so farre just as the
Apostles rule stretcheth, 1. Cor. 14. 40. <hi>Let all things be done comely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Defendant hath a direct answer to all and every one
of his demands, let him cast up his summe, and he shall finde, that
he hath proved just nothing. Hee could find but three examples
in all the New Testament, vvhich had any colour, so as they
might bee alledged for mysticall ceremonies, appropriated to
Gods vvorship, by mans institution. The <hi>Loue-feasts, the kisse
of peace, and the vaile of women.</hi> And yet there is not one of
these three, (as any indifferent man, if he hath common sense
may see by that vvhich hath been said) that can be shewed either
to be of mysticall signification, other then nature giveth it, nor
appropriated unto Gods worship more then to civill occasions, nor
yet ever instituted by any man in the Church of God. Is it not
a marvellous thing that men should presume so as they doe to
domineere in words and deeds over poore men, in such things as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:216:33"/>
they can shew neither precept nor patterne for in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We will descend lower,</hi> saith the Def. And that, I assure him, is his
best course: for so long as he wadeth in the pure waters of holy
Scripture, he doth but striue against the streame: descending
lower to humane vvritings, he may finde the vvaters troubled, and
so bring some fish to his net. Yet having the Scriptures on our
side, vvee need not feare to follow him vvhether soever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to leade us.</p>

                  <p>HEere is alledged the universal custome of the ancient Church,
even from the Apostles times for confirmation of humane
mysticall ceremonies in Gods vvorship. To vvhich I answer,
1 of the first and purest times, next after the Apostles, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved: nor is likely, because it is not to be thought that
all Churches vvould immediately admit of any thing vvhich they
had not received from the Apostles. 2 For the next ages it may
easily be shewed, that the best Writers taught many generall rules
concerning the perfection of Scripture, and the purity of Gods
worship, vvhich cannot stand vvith these humane inventions:
howsoever in their practise they vvere carried away unto other
customes. 3 The infinite troubles of those times against Infidels
and Heretickes, about the chiefe grounds and maine foundations
of faith, vvould not suffer them to examine these points of lesse
moment as they should. And in deed, they vvere so taken up with
those conflicts, that they neglected many usuall truths. So that if
all should be received vvhich the Fathers practised, neither any
thing understood but by their interpretations, vve should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of much truth, and overcharged vvith the burthen of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
presumptions, as <hi>Augustine</hi> complained in his time, <hi>ep.</hi> 119,
4 the Lord in justice vvould haue Antichrist to prevail: which my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
could never haue grown to any ripenesse, had the worship
of God been preserved sincere. That corruption begot him, and
the reformation thereof must be his utter ruine. It is sufficient
that the lamentable experience of fifteen hundred yeres hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
unto us, vvhat fruit of significant ceremonies brought by
man into Gods worship are wont to affoord unto those that affect
them. To fetch authority in this case, from their practise, by which
hath insued such inestimable hurt to the Church of God, is not
the vvisedome of the burnt child, vvho dreadeth the fire.</p>

                  <p>OF our own Writers the Def. heere opposeth unto us, <hi>Calvin
Iunius, Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Zepperus.</hi> Now for these, it hath been
plainely manifested before, that they all vvith one consent
condemne humane symbolicall ceremonies in Gods worship: and
that upon good grounds out of Gods word. Now therefore if any
thing elswhere hath fallen from any of them by occasion, sounding
to the contrary, then we may well think that either their meaning
is mistaken therin, or else they shewed themselues to be men: and
indeed (to say the truth) there is a little varietie to bee found in
some of our divines concerning the poynt of ceremonies. But the
cause thereof being marked, will make it lesse offensiue. All our
Divines, when they look into the clear chrystall of the scripture,
condemne plainly all devices of man in Gods worship, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
but againe, some of them when they fixe their eyes on the
false glosse of ancient times, and consider withall how hardly men
are drawen from their accustomed vanities, and what good some
men may doe by applying themselves somewhat to the times,
then receiving another kind of impression, they seeme sometime
to vvaver in their words. This observation I thought fit to set
down in generall, because it may haue good use in some particular
places which this Def. threat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth hereafter to object. But as for
the places here quoted, the answer is easie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> in the first place, disputing against the grosse corruptions
of the Papists, sayth, he doth not contend therein about ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
vvhich hee might truely say not onely comparatiuely, but
even absolutely in regard of contention with others, who did not
obtrude them upon him. And so I am assured few or none would
contend much about ceremonies, if they would not force them
vpon others.</p>
                  <p>In the other place, he understandeth by ceremonies, such as are
given us of God: as the following words shew: <hi>Paucae igitur nobis
divinitus datae sunt ceremoniae.</hi> What indeed he thought was to bee
given to the rude people in this kinde, he shewed sufficiently, not
onely by his words formerly cited, but also by his practise, in that
he banished such ceremonies utterly not onely out of Geneva,
but also out of all Churches, vvhich hearkned vnto his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in regard that some ceremonies were in use where he
lived, handleth them so gently as he can: and speaketh too favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
of Images: yet in other places, the truth wresteth from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:216:34"/>
him and <hi>Brentius</hi> also, a right confession, as hath been alledged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zepperus</hi> meaneth onely that the simple having of Images in
Churches is not such impietie as doth unchurch a people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in the last place, doe but give a difference
betwixt the Fathers and Papists use of some things. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
directly against our assertion. But if all these witnesses did
speak as the Defendant would haue them in these places mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what were that to the cloud of testimonies which are brought
forth in the Abridgment, and unanswered as yet by the Defender.
His own mouth will testifie that our Divines are generally on out
side. For in that regard (if he speaketh with good reason) he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them still <hi>our owne witnesses.</hi> Our owne they are not, because
we alledge them onely: for so both Fathers, and Papists, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
also are alledged by us: but because they speake plainly
for us. Which appeareth also the more by his silence at the most
part of their speeches.</p>

                     <hi>AFter much sayling in the maine sea,</hi> the Defendant <hi>directeth his
course</hi> (as he sayth) <hi>homeward to the narrow seas, by instancing,
in the practise of Non-conformists themselues.</hi> His compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is good: for as the scriptures were too deepe for him to fasten
any anchor of a conforming argument in: so the practises of vveak
men are so full of sands and shelves, that here hee can haue no
sure riding. The sea of Rome turned, by one of our Prelates, <hi>mare
Romanum,</hi> is the best harbour of all the world for the ceremonies
to arriue and rest in.</p>
                  <p>The first example brought is the forme of an oath, vvhich is
taken on a booke. To which I answer, 1. That if this forme of
swearing can be proved to bee of the same nature with the crosse
in baptisme, &amp;c. we will rather abandon this forme to avoyd the
Crosse, then admit of the crosse for loue of this. 2 I affirme, that it
vvere much better that this forme (invented by Papists, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not onely by them, but also by many among our selues) were
abolished, as it is in other Countries not Popish,<note place="margin">Mr. Fox.</note> then reteined.
Mr. W. <hi>Thorpe</hi> a Martyr, or Confessor, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth
his dayes, refused to sweare upon a booke, alledging <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
for the same opinion. 3. This forme if it bee vvorship, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be essentiall and necessarie vvorship, not accidentall: for
no man is esteemed to haue taken his corporall oath (as <hi>Lindwood</hi>
affirmeth) but hee that sweareth upon a booke. 4. It is not our
practise to make any more of touching the book, then of lifting up,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:216:34"/>
of the hand, vvhich is used in other Countries: i. to make it a
signe of assent unto that which is required of us. So that I for my
part vvould not finde fault vvith those vvhich sometime hold out
a service-booke, or any other to touch and kisse: for it is all one
vvhether we shew our assent one way or another, so it be shewen
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a decent manner. 5. This forme is not used in the speciall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
worship of God: but in a civill assembly, where occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God is called upon for confirmation of the truth. And indeed,
as the Def. speaketh well, an oath is rather a cognifance or note of
supreame worship, then proper and direct vvorship.</p>

                  <p>THe next instance is, <hi>The observation of the Lords day:</hi> vvhich
the Defendant would never haue brought in as an example
of a humane ceremonie, if he had not either been sea-sicke or
else sleepie with his long sayling which he spake of in the former
section. For he taketh it for granted, that we hold the Lords day
to be an institution of man, vvhich we utterly deny: We hold, as

                  <p>By the vvay here he bringeth in a testimony of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> calling
our Temples <hi>types and shadowes of the celestiall Temple.</hi> But <hi>Zanchier</hi>
meaning was not to make them destinated instituted types: but
onely such things as by accommodation may serve fitly to put us
in minde of such a matter: even as any arbitrarie similitude that
is fit, may be called a tyde and shadow. I would the Defendant
would read the very next Thesis of <hi>Zanchie</hi> to that hee quoteth:

                  <p>IN this last section, some reason is promised for a finall confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Non-conformists in this poynt; but I for my part

But vvhy hath hee gone about to deceiue us so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before, by confounding circumstances of order and decencie

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:216:35"/>
that they cannot be properly called ceremonies? surely there is no

                     <hi>THis argument in the Abridgement,</hi> p. 17. <hi>standeth thus:</hi> It is
contrary to Gods word to use (much more to command the use of)
such ceremonies in the worship of God, as man hath devised, if they
be notoriously knowen to have been of old, and still to be abused unto ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
or superstition by the Papists, specially if the same be now of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
use in the Church. But our ceremonies are such: Ergo.</p>
                  <p>The Defendants answer is very briefe: he dares not absolutely
deny either part of the argument. Hee could not finde a fit distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
whereupon to ground a conditionall deniall with reason: he
contents himselfe therefore to make a shew of distinguishing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an unreasonable manner. For he doth not distinguish of any
one tearme found in the argument: nor maketh the parts of his
supposed distinction such as will beare any Logicall sence. <hi>If</hi>
(sayth hee) <hi>you require such ceremonies to bee abolished, then wee deny
your Major: but if you understand indifferent things, or meane an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
not a convenient necessitie, wee deny your Assumption. If this</hi>
and <hi>but if that,</hi> this forme of speech, as indeed, every distinction,
implieth some dissention and segregation in the parts distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
But here is no shew of any such thing, betwixt <hi>abolishing</hi> and
<hi>indifferencie,</hi> or <hi>absolute necssitie.</hi> I know not what to make of such
a confused distinction. It is as if one should say, <hi>If you require an
establishing of the ceremonies, I deny one thing; but if you vnderstand
convevient ceremonies, I deny another thing.</hi> Such kind of speaking
is nothing else but <hi>non sence,</hi> or as some use to call it, <hi>a very bull.</hi>

in the 2 and 3 proofe, vvhere about forty places of Scripture are
cited for confirmation of them, he doth not attempt to answer
aboue 8 or 9. But let us examine his answer to these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lev. 18 &amp;c. three kinde of things are forbidden, 1 incest, 2 round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their heads and cutting their flesh for the dead, 3 sowing with diverse
seeds, and letting diverse beasts to ingender together. The first was a sin
against nature: the second was a wicked custome of infidelity; the third
did signifie adulterie: in all which our ceremonies are innocent.</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
heere onely unto the places taken out of the 18 and 19
of <hi>Lev.</hi> concerning vvhich I reply 1 that in the first place the
vvords are generall, v. 3 4: howsoever therefore in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verses they be applyed unto foule sinnes, yet seeing in other
places of Scripture the like application is made unto ceremonies,
they vvere therfore mentioned as the generall ground, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
both kindes in it, and joyned unto other places condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
conformity vvith idolaters even in matters of ceremonie.
2 The second and third vvere no more vvicked, nor yet so much
in any respect among the Heathen, as our ceremonies haue been
among the Papists: And therefore in these, M. <hi>Calvins</hi> collection
in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19 27, is sound, <hi>God would haue his people to know, that they
could not haue his favour, except they would in all points be unlike to
such, and goe as farre as they could from their fashions and examples,
especially in those rites wherein there was any shew of Religion.</hi> 3 I
vvould demand whether, if the high Preist, vvith the vvhole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion
of the Iewes lawfully assembled, had vvith one consent
decreed, that vvheras the Lord enjoyneth, <hi>Lev. 19 Yee shall not sow
with diverse seeds, nor cut round your heads, nor marre the tusts of your
beards:</hi> this vvas onely in regard of infidelity, and in respect of
an evill signification: but seeing the things are in their nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and that it might be convenient for them to use them,
they vvould therefore all from thenceforth use the same, provided
that none should use them upon infidelity as the heathen did, not
make any evill interpretation of them: I vvould demand (I say)

whether such a decree should ever haue been lawfully made, or
vvarrantably obeyed? I thinke the Def. vvill say no. But why?
Perhaps because of the expresse commandement to the contrary;
but doth not this commandement then respect some other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
beside those vvhich by this decree should be now taken away?
and may we not collect a further matter from them?</p>

                  <p>BEcause one usuall evasion, much esteemed by the patrones of
our ceremonies, is, that they had a good beginning: therfore
the Authors of the Abridgement to stop that muse, adde
that <hi>even such things are to be cast away, which had a good originall and
use (if they be not still necessarie and commanded of God) when once
they are knowne to haue been defiled by idolatry, or abused unto it.</hi> For
proofe vvherof they alledge <hi>Lev.</hi> 26 1, and other places more. But
the Def. heere singleth out this one, and denyeth that the titula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pillars of the heathen (which vvere set up at limits of their
grounds) had a good beginning. Suppose that this be true, and
that the Authors of the Abridgment were mistaken in this place:
is not the same thing sufficiently proved our of 2 <hi>King. 18 4, Dan. 1
8, Hos.</hi> 2 16 17. But yet it is more then probable, that those titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
pillars, vvere at the first onely set up for civill use: because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
statues vvhich afterward served onely for vvorship, vvere at the
first onely for civill respects, and these had still a civill use for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of bounds. <hi>But Calvin collecteth, that no statue was heere
condemned, but that which was erected to represent God. Calvin</hi> indeed
hath those words: but vvhat kinde of representation he meaneth,
he sheweth sufficiently before, <hi>omnes picturas quibus corrumpitur

                     <hi>THE third proofe in the Abridgement standeth thus:</hi> the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of these commandements is thus set down in Scripture: 1 the
detestation which the Lord our God being a jealous God beareth
unto idolatry, and all the instruments and tokens thereof, as unto spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
whoredome, Exod. 20 5 6, Deut. 7 25 26. 2 that we cannot be said
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:216:36"/>
sincerely to haue repented of the idolatry or superstition whereby wee or
our forefathers haue provoked the Lord unlesse we be ashamed of and
cast away with detestation all the instruments and monuments of it,
2 Chron. 33 15, Es. 1 29 &amp; 2 20 &amp; 30 22 2 Cor. 7 11, Cal. in Deut.
serm. 52 ep. 86 p. 166 167. 3 that we shall be in danger to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Ex. 34 12 15, Deut. 7 4. 25. 26, Iud. 2 13, Gal. 2 5. 4. Wee shall
harden Idolaters, Ezech. 16 54 1 Cor. 6 10. 5. There is more danger in
Popish ceremonies, because the Pope is Antichrist, and we converse more
with Papists then with other Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>Now of all these reasons and allegations the Def. answereth
directly to nothing, but onely to those words <hi>see Calvin:</hi> and yet
not to them neither as they are cited in the Abridgement. For
there it is, see <hi>Calvin</hi> in his 52 <hi>serm.</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> and ep. 87. Now on
these places the Defendants eyes vvould not serue to looke: or at
least, his heart would not suffer him to giue answer, they are so
pregnant. <hi>If we haue any drop of good zeale in us, it must needs vexe
and grieue us to see the markes and signes of idolatry: and that we must
to the uttermost of our power deface them, &amp;c. nothing upon pretence
must be tolerated in the Church, which came either from Satan or from
Antichrist.</hi> Yet the Def. saith, he hath seen <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Exod. 23
&amp;</hi> 24, and <hi>Numb.</hi> 23 and <hi>Deut.</hi> 7 12, and findeth that <hi>Calvin</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
these precepts of destroying Altars and Groues, to binde the
Iewes onely, not Christians: and he biddeth us see <hi>Calvin</hi> on these
places. Surely I haue looked and could finde no such thing. If
there had been any thing vvorth the knowing, for maintenance
of the ceremonies, we should haue heard of the words of <hi>Calvin;</hi>
whereas now <hi>Calvin</hi> is brought in expresly affirming that we may
use temples which haue been defiled vvith idoles: which is nothing
at all to the question of unnecessary ceremon. But if the Def. would
discusse this poynt out of Authors, vvhether the lawes alledged out
of the old. Testament against the monuments of Idolatry, doe not
bind Christians, why doth he not answer to the testimonies of
<hi>Calvin, Martyr, Grineus, Wolphius, Visinus, Machabeus, Zanchius, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus,
Zepperus, Fulk,</hi> &amp; our book of homilies alledged to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the Abridg. p. 24.</p>

                  <head>SECT. V.</head>
                  <p>IN one place of Scripture yet, <hi>viz. Dan.</hi> 1 8, the Def. thinketh
he hath some advantage; because <hi>Calvin</hi> interpreteth it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then of ceremoniall pollution. But therein the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
followed that interpretation which is most generally, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
for which see <hi>Iunius</hi> in his Commentary upon the place.
And suppose that pollution vvas not ceremoniall or idolatrous,
yet I hope the Def. vvill not say but if the meat had been so
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:216:37"/>
polluted <hi>Daniel</hi> vvould haue absteyned from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take therefore some other testimonies to proue your assertion,</hi> saith
the Def. So confidently as if he knew of no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>estimonies vvhich
he had not answered. What can one say to him that vvill not take
that which is thrust into his hands, and yet calleth for more, as
if he could finde none?</p>

                  <p>THE last thing vvhich the Def. vvill take knowledge of, as
alledged out of the Scriptures, in this point, is the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> 2 King. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in breaking down the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
This example is so famous, that he could not omit it: yet
he knoweth not vvell what to say unto it.</p>
                  <p>First, he giveth fiue reasons for the abolishing of the brazen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
As if any of us doubted, but that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had reason enough
for that he did: Or, as if there could not be reasons enough alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and those almost the very same, for abolishing of our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
Let them be abolished by publick authority, and I vvill
undertake reasons to justifie, the action done, vvill easily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
even of those that now can see none to perswade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he propoundeth, as very observable, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
did not abolish the idols vvhich <hi>Salomon</hi> suffered to be set up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were neglected. But 1 it may vvell be thought that
those idols vvere destroyed by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and set up againe before
the time of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> as many other superstitions were. 2 It cannot
be doubted but they should haue been destroyed, even though they
were for the time neglected: because either <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had as good
cause to destroy them as <hi>Iosiah:</hi> or else he might haue prevented
that cause which <hi>Iosiah</hi> had: and to prevent evill, we are as well
bound, as to correct it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he citeth <hi>Zanchius</hi> to proue, that this is not an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
remedy for all abuses of ceremonies. The place in <hi>Zanchie</hi> I
cannot finde: neither skilleth it much. I grant the conclusion, it
is not a remedy for all abuses of ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi> for such as Gods
appointment hath made necessary to be retayned. Besides the
words of <hi>Zanchie</hi> heere cited by the Def. doe onely therfore seem
to make for him, because they are not full enough against him.
But in other places of the same book <hi>Zanchius</hi> judgement is plain
enough, as <hi>p.</hi> 649 vvhere from this example he reproveth those
that keep the reliques of superstition in some holy places; though
they haue removed them out of Churches. And if about this
matter the Def. doth ascribe any thing to the judgement of our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:216:37"/>
divines, vvhy doth he not answer the testimonies of <hi>Augustine,
Calvin, Martyr, Wolphius, Lavater, Zanchius, Sadeel, Iewel, Bilson,
Fulk, Rainolds, Andrews, Perkins,</hi> alledged to this purpose in the
Abridgement, p. 24?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly (vvhich onely in deed is to the purpose)
the Def. vvould shew us a disparity betwixt the idolatry of the
Iewes, and that of the Papists. The first is, that <hi>that idolatry of the
Iewes was done publickely, and generally, and in the bowels of the
same Church: but the Papists is not so.</hi> To which I answer 1 these
circumstances are not rendred as reasons of the abolishing in the
text, but invented by the Def. 2 private particular idolatry is to
be removed as well as publick and generall: 3 all these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did more then agree to our ceremonies in the beginning of our
reformation. And sure they are not grown better since, by any
good that they haue done.</p>
                  <p>The second difference vvhich the Def. imagineth, is that there
was no other meanes to cure the idolatry of those times: but now
there is. I answ. 1 this is the very question whether there be any
other sufficient meanes to cure the disease of humane ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
idolatrously abused beside abolishing. 2 It is a vaine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
vvhereby this difference is confirmed, and no reason at
all. <hi>In the Dominions of our Ezekias</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>this disease
would be found curable without any such extremity.</hi> But the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of 50 or 60 yeares shew, that hitherto it is not cured nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Ireland, nor Wales, to say nothing of England. Surely our
Prelates are miserable Phisitions, that in a disease so easie to be
cured, suffer the patients to languish under their hands, unto death.
<hi>Especially</hi> (saith he) <hi>in this our most truely reformed Church, which
doth most liuely expresse the face and full body of her primitiue mother
Church.</hi> This he hath now 3 or 4 times repeated: as if he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make a question of it: and here propounds it vvith a
doubt, <hi>if you will allow.</hi> It is not sit heere to make a long digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about this matter. In short therefore thus, vve allow with all
thankefulnes, that our Church is to be called a reformed Church
in regard of the main points of faith, which are purely and freely
taught among us vvith publick approbation: and also in regard
that the grossest superstitions are by publick authority cast out
of our Assembles. But if our Ecclesiasticall government be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and some ceremonious superstions, wee deny utterly,
that vve haue such a reformation therin, as may represent the
face of the primitiue Church. Let the Defendant tell us, if ever
the primitiue Church had such chanting idol service as is every
day to be seen in our Cathedrall Churches? If there were in the
primitiue Church Chancellors, Commissaries, Officials under the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:216:38"/>
Bishops, which executed the censures of that Church? If he can
shew any primitiue pompous Bishops that had sole authoritie of
ordination &amp; excommunication? If any Minister was called in the
primitiue Ch. without expresse consent of the congreg. over which
he vvas set? if Ministers vvere then vvont to goe to law for their
places? if the Primitiue Church ever heard of Pluralists, Non-residents
or dumb ministers? If either in primitue or else in Popish
Church almost simony was ever so ordinary as it is with us? If ever
so many prophane men, openly known to be contemners of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
vvere members of any primitiue Church, as are of ours?
If ever he read of such carnall proceedings about Ecclesiasticall
affaires in primitiue times, as are every day practised in our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall-courts?
who tooke money for ordination, citation, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
or change of pennance?</p>
                  <p>I will not insist on these things, because they are beside our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
question; but onely desire the Def. to behold this face which
I haue described in a right glasse, and see if it be the face of the
pure primitiue Church.</p>

                  <p>THE testimonies of Councels and Fathers, alledged in the

Def. into 14 Sections, as if the maine burden of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie

they are briefly mentioned as illustrations. I vvill therefore
according to the intent of those vvhich alledged them, consider
all together.</p>
                  <p>7. In the fift Councell of Carhage it is true, that he saith, those
Altars vvere onely expresly appointed to be abolished, vvhich
were set up vvithout reliques of Martyrs. But let the Def. shew
any reason, why those also were not to haue the same measure
vvhich had reliques of martyrs in them? Surely the Councell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
seemeth to aime at a perfect reformation: but stayed at this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the superstition vvhich then prevailed among the peoples
as they shew in that parenthesis <hi>(si fieri potest) if it may be:</hi> and
in the next Canon.</p>
                  <p>8 <hi>In the next canon</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>they would onely haue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
instruments of Idolatry then brought into publicke use abolished.</hi>
But how doth he gather this glosse out of the Text? Or wherein
doth this glosse excuse our ceremonies, especially as they were in
the beginning of our reformation? and since they haue mended as

9 To the decree of the Councell of Bracara, forbidding men
to decke their houses &amp;c. in such manner and at such time as ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
did, the Def. answereth nothing that hath any shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in it. For our ceremonies differ nothing from the Papists in
place, persons, time, but onely in some opinion: Now the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
there doth not forbid the opinion, but the ceremony, even to
them vvhich were of a better opinion.</p>
                  <p>10 The Councell of Affrick doth giue a reason why they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
certaine feasts, because, <hi>they were drawn from the errours
of the Gentiles.</hi> Heerein I am sure it maketh against our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p>11 To <hi>Tertullian de Coron.</hi> the Def. saith lesse then nothing. For
he doth not speake of the same individuall habite which was used
to idolatry, as the Def. vainely pretendeth: nor of that kind which
was onely used in idolatrous worship. For in the same book c. 13,
he saith this habit of a garland vvas used in most base places, as
playes, stewes, jakes &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>12 The like answer is given unto <hi>Tertullian de Orat.</hi> 1 in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
it is said, that <hi>Tertullian doth not condemne these ceremonies meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for resemblance with idolaters: but for opinion of efficacie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:</hi>
wheras the contrary is plaine in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for he saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<hi>Propterea in nobis reprehendi meretur, quod apud idola celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
Therefore it is to be blamed in us, because it is used before Idols:
And B. <hi>Iewel Def. Apol.</hi> vvith many other of our best Writers
against the Papists doe urge these testimonies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of resemblance. 2 <hi>In washing</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>some did
then hold an opinion of efficacie and necessitie.</hi> If they did, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpose; for they might be condemned in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
and yet meerely also for resemblance vvith idolaters. But
no such thing appeareth in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> he telleth us plainely, that
the vvashing before prayer vvas a significant sign in remembrance
of Christs delivering unto the Iewes by <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he had wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

of an absolute necessitie. Doe not our Prelates now say, <hi>sic

opinion of necessity? <hi>Tertullian</hi> onely condemneth, <hi>Vacua obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio,

as well as to that. 4 <hi>For sitting upon beds after prayer, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of necessity is onely condemned by Tertullian</hi> (saith the Def.)
<hi>because he inferreth, otherwaies we ought not to pray but sitting.</hi> But
that inference is onely upon an allegation out of <hi>Hermas</hi> vvhich
<hi>Tertullian</hi> opposeth to himselfe about the matter. Concerning the
ceremony it selfe, the grounds of his condemnation are, <hi>perinde
faciunt nationes: apud idola celebratur.</hi> So that the Defendant hath
given no colourable answer unto <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Yet one thing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceale, though it be nothing to the purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
in that place condemneth sitting at prayer, which we bring up
our Schollers unto.</hi> He might surely haue concealed this, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a shamelesse slander in regard of us, as all that know us can
vvitnesse: and a shamefull practise of our Prelats, generally in
all prayers before and after Sermons, except it be vvhen the
Lords prayer is repeated: for it is vvell known how little respect
they giue unto any prayers, but onely to the Lords prayer, and
those that are in the Service-book.</p>

was an act of sacrificing performed by women, vvho are forbidden to
sacrifice, as well as to preach: devised by private persons: of an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
invention.</hi> The first of which answeres is <hi>Bellarmines de sanct.
beat. l. 1. c.</hi> 14, but evidently false. For the Papists themselues are
not so grosse as to confesse that they offer any proper sacrifice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any creature whatsoever, <hi>Bellat. de sanct. beat. lib. 1 cap. 12:</hi> and
shall I we thinke the mother of <hi>Augustine,</hi> with other religious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in those purer times to haue been guilty of so great impiety?
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> may call it a sacrifice in a rhetoricall phrase, because
it was an offering: but in disputations we must speake properly,
yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth call it onely an offering. 2 the person or sexe
of a woman, maketh no difference. For <hi>Monica</hi> was not the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

3. It doth not appear that this was the invention of private persons:
there haue been Bishops vvhich haue fathered as good children as

ceremony may not be lawfully used upon privat devotion, if it bee
lawfull for men to impose it. 4. If that vvhich <hi>Monica</hi> did vvas I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous,
it is the very thing for vvhich our ceremonies are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
5. Lastly, neither <hi>Ambrose, Augustine,</hi> or <hi>Monica</hi> regarded these
things in condemning of that act: for the reasons are onely two

                  <p>16 The Councel of Nice decreed that Christians might not keep
the feast of Easter at the time, or in the manner as the Iewes did.

1. <hi>for hatred of the Iewes. 2. because of the Iewes insultation. 3. for vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie.</hi>
The last of these causes doth not agree: for vniformitie
might as well haue followed, if all Christians could have been dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to the same time with the Iewes. The other two agree vvel to
our ceremonies. For we are to hate the idolatrous superstitions of
the Papists vvith a perfect hatred. And the Papists do insult ouer
us for this, that <hi>we haue borrowed our ceremonies from them;</hi> as is to be
seen in the Abridg. p. 25. where much is sayd to this purpose, &amp; by
the D. unanswered. And I vvould fain know for what causes other
ceremonies of the Papists are abolished, if not these, or for such at
the least as would sweep away our ceremonies in controversie, as
vvell as them, if it pleased them that haue such bezomes in their

might shew themselves to differ from Priscillianists, the Def.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:216:40"/>
answer is, that the Papists do not consort with us in the same ceremoniall
acts as the Priscillianists did with the Catholicks, at the same ordinaries &amp;
<hi>banquets.</hi> But there is no such reason rendred, or limitation set in
the councell, of the same ordinaries and banquets: the same cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
onely is condemned.</p>
                  <p>19 Thrice-dipping in Baptisme was condemned by a Councel of
Toledo, approved by <hi>Leo,</hi> because it was the custome of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.
<hi>This was</hi> (sayth the Def.) <hi>because an hereticall construction was
made of it.</hi> Even so (say we) a superstitious construction is made
of our crosse, not onely by the Papists, but by our owne canons
and Canonicall imposers of it.</p>
                  <p>20 <hi>Leo</hi> forbidding men to have any thing to do with hereticks,
<hi>meaneth it onely of doctrinal conference,</hi> sayth the Def. But conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with them in their ceremonies is a greater fault (for the nature
of it) then doctrinall disputing with them. Therefore the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
holdeth, from the lesse to the greater.</p>
                  <p>Thus in briefe I haue examined his particular answers unto our
testimonies out of Councells and Fathers. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t one answer might
haue served for all, viz. that they were not brought in by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Abridgement for to make an immediat conclusion by
against our ceremonies, as the Def. in his answers evermore taketh
them: but to illustrate the proposition vvhich condemneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
with Idolaters in their ceremonies. And herein wee haue
not onely the Fathers, but even the Papists themselues in words
many times consenting with us. <hi>Suarez. in Thom. p. 3. q.</hi> 65. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it one rule which the Church is to follow in appointing of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
                  <p>Now the Def. passeth from the proposition of this argument, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the assumption. But he should haue done vvell to haue made a
little stand at the armie of Protestants vvhich are brought in as
giving witnesse to this truth. Abridg. p. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. &amp; 25. why
had we not heare one head of <hi>Protestant Divines,</hi> as vvell as in the
former arguments, seeing more are cited here then in them? Surely
the Def. could not tel how to giue a colorable answer to so many
pregnant testimonies, and therfore thought good to passe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in silence, and make his reader beleeve, that none were obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
because none are answered.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XXI.</head>
                  <p>THe Def. here meaning to say something against the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
setteth it down by halves, or rather by quarters. For the
assumption is, Abridg. 26. 27. <hi>our ceremonies in question are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
inventions, of no necessary use, and abused to idolatry.</hi> He setteth it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:216:40"/>
thus downe, <hi>our ceremonies haue been idolatrously abused by Papists.</hi>
There is great difference, as by and by we shal see. His answer is by
a distinction: <hi>These ceremonies are either generally or individually and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merally
the same that haue beene abused to idolatry: If generally, then it
hindereth not, but they may still lawfully bee vsed, though they haue been
so abused. If individually, then it is not true, which is affirmed: neither
doth it follow from thence, that they must be abolished, because they haue
been so abused, except they be the same formally: i. in intention and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those that impose and practise them:</hi> What miserable shifts is
the Def. put to? he told us before, his distinctions were wedges:
but this is a very pick-lock, made for to open the doores of Gods<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Church into those ceremonies against vvhich by the keyes of
Gods kingdome they are streightly shut up. For by this meanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kind of Popish, Iewish, Heathenish ceremonie may come in, so
there be new particulars of the same kinde, and a new intention u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The first assertion is most grosse, viz. <hi>that in ceremonies abused
to Idolatry, those are not forbidden which are generally the same, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same individualls.</hi> For by the like reason, of ceremonies insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Christ, those onely are commanded which Christ indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
and numerally did sanctifie: not all of the same kinde. So
also Papists are iustified against all the charges of our divines, who
accuse them for using of Iewish and Heathenish ceremonies: for
they are not the same individually and numerally, but onely in
kinde with those vvhich Iewes and heathens used. So the meaning
of the scripture, forbidding conformitie with the heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
should onely be of using the same particular rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
with them: as if when the cutting of their heads, &amp; roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of their haire like the heathen, vvas forbidden to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;
<hi>Lev. 18. &amp;</hi> 19. there had been danger lest the people of Israel
should either get heathen mens heads, and set them upon their
shoulders, or heathen mens beards, and set them upon their faces,
and then put them into the forbidden fashion. It is but folly to
confute largely such a beggarly assertion.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>if</hi> (sayth the Def.) <hi>the same generally be forbidden, then you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie any one of your owne ceremonies of order and decencie.</hi> Why
so? <hi>because there is no gesture or circumstance of worship which hath not
been abused to Idolatry.</hi> Now he sheweth plainly wherefore hee set
downe onely a peece of the assumption: for if the reader marke,
that our assumption is onely of <hi>ceremonies devised by man, and of no
necessarie use,</hi> then he shall see that this poore obiection concerning
circumstances of order and decencie, can haue no place here: for
they are of necessarie use in their kinde, neither are they meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of man, as the ceremonies are, by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<hi>de effect. sacr. lib. 2. c.</hi> 29. For the second, <hi>that our ceremonies
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:216:41"/>
are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the same which the Papists haue solemnly abused to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi>
if this be granted, it is no marvel: for it is altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to carry the same particular signe of the crosse so far as, from
the font to the Church doore: or to keep it in being, so long as it
is in making. Hath not the Def. then found out a great subtil my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
in this distinction? yet it seemeth more true, that the Papists
doe give divine honor unto the same individual ceremonies which
are used in England: especially to the signe of the crosse as it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
among us. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ascribeth divine honour and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto the signe of the crosse as it was used by heathens, by
Iewes, by <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, <hi>Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de eff. sacr. l. 2. c.</hi> 31. Though the
Papists count us hereticks, and I know not what, yet they esteeme
us not vvorse then Pagans, unbeleeving Iewes, &amp; cursed Apostates.
Seeing therefore they yeeld such honor to this signe as it was used
by them, they cannot deny it unto our individuall crosses.</p>
                  <p>The last conceit, <hi>that our ceremonies are not formally the same with the
Papists, because we haue another intention and opinion of them then they,
and therfore need not be abolished,</hi> is as vain as the former. For (not to
dispute here of materiall and formall identitie) 1. a very shew of
Idolatry must be abstained from and abolished. 2. It cannot bee
sayd simply and truely, that our intention and opinion concerning
the ceremonies, is not the same with the Papists. For we haue no
intention or opinion in the use of the crosse, or other ceremonies,
but the Papists haue the same; onely they haue some other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
about these things vvhich wee haue not. And if this doth
make a ceremonie not the same, that men haue not altogether the
same opinion of it, then among the Papists there are also as many
kinde of ceremonies, crosses, Surplices, &amp;c. as there is diversitie of
opinion about their nature and use, vvhich no man wil say. 3. the
Altar erected by <hi>Vria, 2. King.</hi> 16. vvas an idolatrous Altar, like that
of Damascus, though it vvas for another intention. 4. the Papists
doe ascribe divine honour to the ceremonies used vvith our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as formerly vvas shewed out of Bellarmine. 5. This is the
Papists answer vvhen they are accused for symbolizing with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
and Iewes in their ceremonies: <hi>Licet in externo symbolo sit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua
similitudo, absolute tamen maximum est discrimen: nam à sine &amp;

taken away (as this profession telleth us) because no one ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

therefore onely I would haue here marked, how this profession
doth confute this Defender. For he would make us beleeve, that
none of the old ceremonies used in Poperie, are reteined, because
they are not formally the same in respect of intention and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

that it vvas by speciall commandment from God: and that it is
not every vvay imitable. And of <hi>Ioshuas,</hi> beside that it was also the
expresse commandement of God; and that there is no mention
made of things appropriated unto Idolatry, but onely of goods
which had been the possession of Idolaters: so that he may fetch
as good an argument and better, from the Spanish Crusadoes, for
the crosse in baptisme, then from the riches of Iericho. It doth no
way appeare in the text, but that the vessells were first molten, and
then the gold onely, and the silver, brasse or yron of them, brought
into the tabernacle. So that by this wretched penurie of Scripture
proofes, it is manifest, that the vvarrant for reteining of humane I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous

as before: for he bringeth nothing at all vvorth the answering. The
feast of Easter (which now the fourth time is brought upon the
stage by the Def. in vain) was never generally observed at the same
time with the Iewes, nor ever so appointed by any decree or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of Councel: if it had, yet that had been but an agreement in a
circumstance of time, and the translation of it to another time, did
shew, they liked of no conformitie of Iewes. <hi>There were feasts also
appoynted at times differing from hereticks.</hi> What Cart-rope will draw

be rightly used; vvhich vve vvillingly grant: nay, it
may be granted of some human ceremonies also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if the Surplices

True, but in the same place hee answereth the consequence
vvhich you would make from hence, viz. that therefore vvee need
not flie so farre from Popish superstition, as from heathen: and in

purpose was not to condeme any thing but that which is evill in it selfe.</hi>
True, in that discourse vvherein he dealeth against those vvhich
could swallow downe the masse it selfe: it had been no vvisedome
to dispute vvith them about Crosse and Surplice. <hi>Hee alloweth of
Temples which haue been abused to Idolatry.</hi> So doe we, because they
are not religious ceremonies, of mysticall signification, vvithout
necessarie use. And is this all that can bee brought out of <hi>Calvin?</hi>

he thought by a little yeelding of <hi>Hooper</hi> and such men, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions
themselues might quickly be removed: yet in another

curaremus extirpanda: 1. If wee hated superstition from the heart, wee
would abolish all the reliques of it.</hi> To the same purpose he speaketh
p. 1127. vvhere he sheweth that his conscience would never suffer
him to weare the Surplice, when he vvas Canon of Christ church
in Oxford. If this vvere not his reason, hee had some other very

                  <p>2 If his own heart do not tell him, that there is a civill use of
such things, which cannot be imagined of the crosse?</p>
                  <p>3 What superstition there was in the meere significations given
by <hi>Durandus</hi> unto Bells, and Bell-ropes, vvhich is not to be found
in the Crosse and Surplice?</p>
                  <p>4 Whether the Pagan use of Bay-leaues vvhich was aboue a

use of bay-leaues, as the Popish superstition doth upon our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies?</p>
                  <p>5 What sence he had to find fault with us for not altering the

as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, Act. 28. 11. and to use a religious ceremonie in Gods

                  <p>7 If it be one thing to change copes into cushions, and to use a

                  <p>THE Authours of the Abridgement framed a strong
Argument against our ceremonies from the rules of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
prescribed in the Word, p. 43 &amp;c. with this
Argument vvhen the Defendant vvas not able to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
as it stood in the parts combined, he thought good to sever
some parcels of it, and try vvhat he could say to them apart.
Thus out of this one Argument he hath taken that which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
our first: and out of the same he hath made up this
fift: and yet hee hath quite left out a great part of the sinewes
wherewith that one reason is knit together in the Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The argument is taken from the scandall or offence vvhich the
imposing and using of these ceremonies do bring unto divers sort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of men.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant heere maketh great flourishing in nine whole
Sections, defining, dividing, and subdividing a scandall, as if he
would make all cleare before him: but at the end of all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
he maketh no application of these Rules unto the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand at all: but onely, telleth his Reader, p. 154, <hi>That these
divisions and subdivisions will expedite all difficulties, so that out
of them he may collect the true and false sense of Scriptures alledged.</hi>
It vvere sufficient therefore either to deny this power to be in
his divisions: or else to set down as many other subdivisions of
scandall (vvhich vvere easie to doe) and then tell him that
these vvill expedite the controversie, and that from them
hee may collect the errours of his answer. But I will notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
briefly shew my opinion concerning some of these
dictates.</p>
                  <p>The definition vvhich he onely alloweth of as accurate is, that
<hi>a scandall is a wilfull offence against Christians, in provoking of them
unto any damnable errour or sinne, by any sensible externall meanes:</hi>
Sect. 1. Wherein notwithstanding many faults may be found.
For 1 every scandall is not <hi>wilfull,</hi> except the word be taken more
largely then use of speech will allow. 2 Every scandall is not
against Christians. 3 A scandall is not onely by provoking to
sinne, but also in hindring from good. 4 what doth he meane
to put in the word <hi>damnable?</hi> the occasioning of any sin, sufficeth
to make up a scandall.</p>
                  <p>Among his subdivisions, the first thing I except against is,
section 5, vvhere he distinguisheth so betwixt <hi>persons and causes,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:216:44"/>
either determined or undetermined, that in matters determined by the
Church</hi> (as he teacheth) <hi>obedience is to be given without respect of
scandall: and onely in matters undetermined there is a charitable consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to be had of other mens consciences.</hi> This is a new and a tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
point of Divinity touching the tenderest part of our spirits,
even our consciences, and other mens also. It ought therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to haue been propounded, or else to be well confirmed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with testimonies, or vvith reasons drawn out of Scripture.
But alas the Def. thrusteth it upon us without any such vvarrant.
<hi>The peace of the Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>is to be preferred before the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
i. e. scandall <hi>of any sort of men.</hi> As if the peace of the Church
did not more consist in avoyding of scandals, then in observing
of humane ceremonies! it is not the peace of God which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a charitable care of avoyding offences, but by rushing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
                  <p>A scandall in the nature of it is spirituall murder. Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Superiour should command a thing in it selfe indifferent,
whereupon murder vvere like to follow, as to runne a horse, or a
cart, in a certain way, at a certaine time, when it may be unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the commander, little children were playing in the way,
vvould any mans conscience serue him to doe it?</p>
                  <p>Avoyding of scandall is a maine duty of charity. May Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
at their pleasure appoint how farre I shall shew my charity
towards my brothers soule? Then surely an inferiour earthly
court may crosse the determinations of the high Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>The superiours haue no power given them for destruction, but
onely for edification. If therefore they command scandalls, they
goe beyond their commission: neither are we tyed therein to doe
as they bid, but as they should bid.</p>
                  <p>If determination by superiours vvere sufficient to take away
the sin of a scandall. Then they doe very ill that they doe not (so
farre as is possible) determine all things indifferent, that so no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
may be left in giving of offence by the use of them. Then the
Church of Rome is to be praysed in that she hath determined of
so many indifferents; then <hi>Paul</hi> with the other Apostles might
haue spared a great deale of labour in admonishing the Churches
how they should avoyd offences about some indifferent things. A
farre shorter way had bene either to determine the matter finally,
or else to haue given order that the Churches should among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
determine it at home.</p>
                  <p>But say that the Archbishop of Corinth (for now I suppose
such a one) had called his Convocation, and vvith consent of
his Clergie had determined that men might, and for testifying of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:216:44"/>
liberty should at a certaine time eat of such and such meats
which men formerly doubted of: would not yet the Apostle haue
given the same direction he did? would not good Christians still
haue had care of their brothers consciences? Can the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a superiour be a sufficient plea at the barre of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seat, for a man that by vertue or force thereof alone, hath
done any action that his conscience telleth him will scandalize his
brother?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I vvould faine know whether those superiours doe not
giue a great scandall, vvhich take upon them determinately to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unnecessary rites vvhich they know many good men will be
scandalized by?</p>
                  <p>The second notorious flaw vvhich I finde in the Defendant his
subdivisions is sect 9, where he granteth that <hi>much indulgence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is to be used in things indifferent towards weake persons, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
proceedeth onely from simple ignorance: but that onely till such
time as the doctrine concerning such things haue been sufficiently declared:
because a scandall doth alwaies presuppose a meer weakenesse for want of
due meanes of knowledge.</hi> For 1 <hi>Paul</hi> had sufficiently declared that
it vvas lawfull for him to take wages, yet he would not, 1 Cor. 9,
he had given sufficient reasons for the lawfulnesse of eating all
kind of meats, yet he abstayned, and so counselled others, for
feare of scandall, <hi>Rom. 14 1 Cor</hi> 9. 2 There can be no certaine
set time for all sorts of men vvhen they are sufficiently taught.
3 Who is this Def. that he dare judge so many of his fellow ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that in such indifferencies as our ceremonies are held to be,
they take offence not upon weakenesse, but upon presumption?
4 What authority haue our Prelats to obtrude unnecessary cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
upon the Church, vvhich must be declared before they
can be used? Is it fit that the people should be troubled with the
declararion of mens inventions, vvhen they are hardly brought
to heare willingly the maine things of the Gospell? 5 Is it not
more agreeable to the wisedome of God, <hi>Ex.</hi> 21. 33, to fill up the
pit, then to set one by for to warne the passengers they fall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it? 6 There vvas never yet sufficient declaration of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of ceremonies throughout England. In many places there
is no preaching at all. Many preach so, that they declare nothing
almost to the people but their own folly. Many are ashamed, or
at least unwilling to declare unto the people mens devices. Many
declare them so corruptly that the scandall thereby is not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
but increased. And among those that goe about vvith some
good mind to declare this kind of doctrine, there is almost as great
variety of declarations as there is of declarers: while some will
haue them significant some not: some say they are good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:216:45"/>
to edification, and others condemning them as altogether
unfit, declare them to be tollerable for avoiding of a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe:
Some will haue them onely civill, and others Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall:
some excuse all but the crosse, and some extoll the crosse
aboue all. Are not such declarations (thinke you) likely to informe
well the consciences of poore men who doubt more whom they
should take for a good Declarer, then they did at the first of the
things themselues?</p>

                  <p>AMong the instances of scandall arising from the ceremonies,
that vvhich in the Abridgement hath the third place is set
first by the Def. viz, that <hi>the superstitions Papist will be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the liking of his abominable Religion, from which he seeth wee
borrow our ceremonies, and increase in his hope of the full restoring of
it againe.</hi> To this the Def. answereth, that <hi>our rites are not the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Papists, because they are purged from superstition.</hi> But 1 that
they are not purged from all superstition hath sufficiently
been declared before. 2 This plea of transubstantiating of
ceremonies by the breath of our Convocation is a meere shift,
contrary not onely to the language of all our Divines, and
to that vvhich every mans senses doe tell him, but also to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
profession of the Church of England, in the preface to our
service-book, as it is cited by him p. 127. For there we are told
1 that <hi>an abatement is made of the excesse of Popish ceremonies:</hi> All
therefore are not abolished, but some remaine. And vvhich be
they, if these in question be not? 2 That <hi>some of the old ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
doe remaine.</hi> What sense can be given of these words, if our
ceremonies be not the same with those vvhich were of old among
the Papists? if it were meant of old ceremonies not used among
the Papists, then they doe not <hi>remaine,</hi> nor are <hi>retained,</hi> but resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
3 That <hi>none are devised anew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> therefore they must needs be
taken from the Papists, or from the Fathers: but of the Fathers
surplice or kneeling at the communion, no instance can be given:
and as for the crosse, the Def. himselfe will not defend, I thinke,
all that use vvhich the Fathers put it to. 3. The Papists own
words doe sufficiently manifest how they are hardened by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and use of our ceremonies. For as it is shewed in the
Abridgement p. 25, they seek to justifie their superstition by this,
that <hi>we haue borrowed our ceremonies from them.</hi> And some of them
thence conclude (as there is shewed) that our Governours like
vvell of their superstition. Beside <hi>Gretser,</hi> a principall Iesuit saith,
that in these ceremonies our Ministers are as <hi>Apes of Popish Priests,

vvere retained by our first Reformers. See more of this in

arguments hence to blesse himselfe in his contempt of all Religion.</hi>
The Def. asketh, <hi>from whence?</hi> I answer, from hence: 1 that
Religious rites are invented by men, and appointed to be used
in Gods worship, euen after the same manner that Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are, or at least vvere of old: 2 That trifles are urged, to the
increasing of contention: 3 that many place such holines in these
things vvhich they know to be mens devises: 4 that other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are cryed down, as if they vvere against Religion, vvhich
yet are every vvay as good as these: 4 that religious men are more

                  <p>THE third instance of scandall is in vveak brethren, <hi>who will
be drawn to yeeld unto the ceremonies against their consciences, or
else doubtingly: and some also will grow to dislike some Ministers
for these things, and so be hindred from profiting by their ministery.</hi> To
this the Def. answereth in many words: but the summe of all he
saith is, that <hi>these are not weake brethren, because they haue been diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
catechised by Non-conformists.</hi> But 1 the Corinthians no doubt
vvere diligently catechised: and yet there were many weak among
them. 2 The Def. I hope taketh order (or else he may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
that all his Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffe be diligently catechised; yet I thinke
he will not say but there are many vveak soules in that circuit:
3 The Catechisers he speaketh of haue had enough to doe, to
teach the people the maine points of Religion: as for instructing
them concerning the lawfulnesse of humane ceremonies, they left
that to those that impose th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, or to their servants: 4 After long
teaching and sufficient knowledge, there may be still a weaknesse
in regard of some things, through many circumstances required
unto strength, beside bare knowledge. Lastly, we confesse, that (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposition that the Def. his doctrine be sound in these points)
we are yet weak in these points, as we are also in some other,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:216:46"/>
wherein our adversaries are so strong, that they can beare many
Churches and such like things, upon their shoulders, without
feeling any burthen of them, which we cannot. See M. <hi>Park. ca. 6

                  <p>To all this the Def. giveth no answer: but onely taketh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

particular Congregations, and the vvhole Convocation house.
Which because it neither pertaineth to the present purpose, nor
containeth any thing of moment, I leaue as I found: though it
may be easily proved, that many particular Congregations can tell
better vvhat is fitting for their edification in some things, then all

                     <hi>A Fift instance, or rather an inlargement of the former is,</hi> in
respect of the Ministers who haue formerly refused the ceremonies,
for whereas the Minister is bound to lead his people forward unto
perfection; and to provide by all good meanes, that his ministery be not
despised: by this meanes be shall draw them back again unto the liking of
superstition; or at least not to dislike it so much as they haue done: and
giue them evident occasion to blame his Ministery, and to call in question
the truth of all his doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Here the Def. commeth upon them vvith open mouth, avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
peremptorily, that <hi>this is a false, presumptuous, irreligious, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and pernicious pretense: and all this he will proue.</hi> If he can, vve
shall the easilyer beare these great words. But why is it <hi>False?</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
<hi>because most of the Non-conformists haue once subscribed: the
contradicting of which subscription is no lesse a matter of discredit then
returning unto conformitie.</hi> What kind of proofe is this? because
they were subject to another discredite, therefore this is no discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
Beside it doth not appeare, nor is likely that most of these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:216:46"/>
did ever absolutely subscribe: neither is it likely: because
it is well known how easie and how ordinary it vvas in Qu <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
dayes, to enter into the Ministry without passing under that
gallowes. If the most had, yet how would this proue it a falle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in the rest? If all had done so, yet this vvas no act of their
Ministerie, nor known it may be to their people, and therfore the
crossing of it did not so directly tend to the discrediting of their
Ministery, as the crossing of their publick doctrine. Lastly, that
which is done before a man be setled in the Ministery at one time,
without any great deliberation, is not of such note as that which
a man hath long professed &amp; perswaded by reasons taken from the
word of God. By all this it appeareth, that this first accusation of
<hi>falsehood</hi> vvas rather an <hi>adventure</hi> as the Def. himselfe calleth it,

                     </gap> a grounded assertion.</p>
                  <p>He did but <hi>adventure</hi> neither to call the same plea <hi>presumptuous.</hi>
For he can finde no other reason to beare up this charge withall
then, <hi>that they seeme to arrogate to themselues a prerogatiue proper to
the Apostles.</hi> How can this be I wonder, seeing they follow herein
the direction of the Apostle himselfe, Tit. 2 15. <hi>Let no man despise
thee.</hi> What this prerogatiue is, he doth not plainly tels us: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth
it in two places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor 15, Gal.</hi> 2 18, the first
vvherof is nothing at all to the purpose. For the Apostle doth not
say as the Def. maketh him, <hi>If we be found false witnesses, then is
your faith in vaine:</hi> but <hi>if Christ be not risen; then are we false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and your faith is vaine:</hi> Which also any preacher of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
may say vvithout falshood or presumption to his people. The
second place, <hi>If I build againe that which I haue destroyed, I make my
selfe a prevaricator,</hi> is applyable to any Minister that hath taught
the truth against Popish superstition. This very doctrine M. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
gathereth out of the words. <hi>Proculcavimus superstitionem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticam
&amp;c.</hi> I hope the Def. doth not thinke he may build up
any superstition, and not be accounted therefore a <hi>prevaricator:</hi>
if he doe; or though he doe not, let him consider vvhere the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
lyeth.</p>
                  <p>But vvhy <hi>irreligious?</hi> because <hi>it is persisting in an errour, for the
preservation of their own credit.</hi> But 1 vvho taught the Def. to make
that vvhich is in question the ground of an accusation in dispute.
First, let him proue that it is an <hi>errour,</hi> before he take it so for
granted, that upon that ground he vvill challenge mens reasons
as irreligious. 2 It is not their credit, but the credit of
their Ministery vvhich they speake of. 3 Is it such an irreligious
thing, to desire that certaine ceremonies may not bee impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon them, lest their Ministery be by that meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:216:47"/>
Why <hi>partiall?</hi> because <hi>men should rather yeeld to Conformitie for the
credit of the Church:</hi> i. e. for the credit of the Convocation house.
Alas, the credit which a great part of that generation doth seek
for, is that they may rejoyce in our flesh. But suppose they meant
sincerely: vvould the Def. haue men discredit and prejudice their
Ministery, to bring some credit unto other mens decrees? Or
doth the forbearing of some ceremonies bring such discredit to
the Authorizers of them? surely then they are more for the honor
of mortall men, then for the honour of God. For Gods honour
and worship is no vvaies prejudiced by their absence.</p>

                     <hi>The last charge is</hi> pernitious. <hi>And heere many words are used to
giue countenance unto that one. The maine ground is,</hi> Woe to me
if I preach not the Gospell; <hi>and</hi> Simon lovest thou mee? then feed my
sheep. <hi>Wherupon he gathereth, that</hi> it is a pernicious thing for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to put himselfe unto silence. <hi>But 1 vvhat is this to the question
of discrediting ones Ministrie? 2 Although we were most vvorthy

of this Convocation, as they alwayes meditate on the law of God,
and every part of it, both day and night; so especially doe they lay to
heart those passages of holy Writ which properly concerne their office: as
woe unto me if I preach not the Gospell: and Simon lovest thou mee?
feed my sheep. Out of these considerations, being carryed with a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
zeale both of preaching themselues in their severall pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also of procuring more faithfull Preachers, and more fruitfull preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
throughout the land, they haue over and aboue the institutions of
Christ, appointed certaine ceremonies strictly to be observed of every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister:
so that whosoever shall heereafter upon any pretense refuse to
obserue the same, they shall be esteemed factious, schismaticall, disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
exorbitant men, and for that cause by their Ordinary suspended and
deprived. oNw for the preventing of such a mischiefe your tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

thrust out of the Ministery for not yeelding to these constitutions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they may seeme unto him such as the Church cannot lawfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
nor hee obserue, yet he is author of his own silencing: and
therefore you must all be exhorted to consider well of those parcels of
Scripture which haue so much prevailed with your carefull mother.
Woe is me if I preach not the Gospell; Simon lovest thou mee? feed my

he might well giue answer in these words,</hi> I heare the words
of a deceitfull tongue. Behold thou art called a Bishop, and gloriest
in that title: thou perswadest thy selfe, thou art a chiefe guide and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Church, thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou
not thy selfe? Thou that sayest it is a woefull thing not to preach
the Gospell, doest thou neither preach Christ faithfully, nor suffer those
that would? Darest thou by thine owne authoritie, and for thine owne
pleasure, hinder so many able men from preaching? thou that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
the flocke must bee fed, doest thou thrust out feeders, and keep
in starvers? Therefore thou art inexcusable, ô Prelat, whosoever thou
art, that condemnest another for that whereof thou art both beginning

                  <p>Thirdly, the Apostles woe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. belongeth to negligent, sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

                  <p>Fourthly, the Apostle doth not pronounce any vvoe for not
preaching, vvhere imprisonment doth hinder. Now hee vvhose
conscience is against the ceremonies, or doubteth of them, is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
imprisoned, so that he cannot by vsing of them, make his

                  <p>Fiftly, it is a meere jest, though a bitter one, to say, that we leaue
our ministeries: when we doe all that our consciences vvill suffer
us to doe, for the holding of our places: and vvhen we haue done

are the first cause. The second vertue is in the Bishops
and their officers, which are executioners of those unconscionable
canons: they therefore are the secondarie cause. Non-conformitie
hath no vertue in it of it own nature, nor by Gods ordinance, to

I know well what I say: and will make it good against the
Defendants vain pretences.</hi> The case standeth thus <hi>(sayth he)</hi> Titus
<hi>(It had been more proper to say Diotrephes)</hi> the Bishop doth depriue
Titius a factious &amp; schismatical minister, that he may place Sempronius,
a peaceable and discreet man, in his stead. In this proceeding, the intendment
of Titus is not absolutely to deprive Titius, as he is a Minister, but as he
was factious: yet so onely respectiuely, that Titius being deprived, he may
constitute Sempronius: for the charge of a Bishop is not determinate to
appoynt precisely this minister: but indefinite, to ordaine a minister: so
that the course of Gods plow is still preserved and continued. But as for
Titius, who will rather be silenced then conforme, it is evident, that the
cause of his silencing being his own refractarinesse, which is onely perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and proper to himselfe, and yet hath no facultie in himselfe to appoynt
or admit of a successor: he may be sayd to haue properly caused his owne
suspension and deprivation.</p>
                  <p>This case needeth no long demurring on: for there is not one
sentence in all the length of it, which doth not smell, without any
uncasing. 1. are all those factious and schismaticall men, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to conforme? vvas <hi>Hooper</hi> such a kind of man? vvas <hi>Peter
Martyr</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> such, vvhen one at Oxford, and the other
at Cambridge, refused to vveare the Surplice? was Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Deering,</hi> Mr. <hi>More,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> and such like heavenly men,
the lights and glory of our Churches, vvere all these factious and
schismaticall? In the presence of God it is well known they were
were not. But our prelats haue this prerogatiue, they may dubbe
whom they please factious aud schismaticall, and after that, there is
no redemption, they must be such, be they otherwise never so full
of all grace.</p>
                  <p>2 Are all peaceable discreet men, which are placed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
ministers stead? For the best of them, they are still as great

a great deale of Episcopall darknesse, by their practises. For the
rest, the congregations over whom they are set, cannot finde it, the
voyce of all the countrey is otherwise for many of them; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Prelats measure, who meat (as it seemeth) the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and vices of a minister by certaine ceremonies of their owne
imposing, it cannot bee denied, but the most of them are very
peaceable &amp; discreet: Even so as many of the Bishops themselves
were known to be afore they were Bishops, and shew themselves
to be still: for <hi>Episcopatus plures accepit quam fecit bonos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 What sence can this haue, <hi>The Bishop depriveth Titius respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he may constitute Sempronius?</hi> Doth hee know before-hand
vvhom he shall constitute? then there is grosse legerdemaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

seeke and the other assigne the place of him that is in possession?
This is but some time in those benefices vvhich are fatter, and
whose patrons are more foolish. Ordinarily, the vilest minister
that is to be found, may succeed in the place of him that is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for ought the Bishop knoweth, or for ought he can doe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he will endure a <hi>quare impedit,</hi> which in case of morall unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
hath scarce been ever heard of.</p>
                  <p>4 The charge which he sayth our Bishops haue of appoynting
Ministers, I vvonder from whence they haue it, or by vvhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.
They say that they themselues are the proper pastors of
all the parishes in their Diocesse. It is well, if they haue an ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitary
facultie, and vvill, to performe the office of pastors to so
great a people: but vvho made them such? Christ and his Apostles
never knew of ordinary pastors, having charge of so many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
But suppose they did, by vvhom doth Christ call one of our
Bishops? by the Kings congedelier, the Chapiters nominall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or by the Arch-bishops consecration? There is none of these
that can beare the triall of scripture, nor of the Primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
example?</p>
                  <p>6 Is the Bishops power of appointing a minister no wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
to this or that minister? then it seemeth his meere will
determineth of the particular person, without any iust reason. For
if there be certain causes or reasons which the Bishop is bound to
follow in designing of this or that minister, rather then another,
then is the Bishop determinate. The Councel of Nice it selfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the authoritie even of Patriarches in this case: viz. that
the Elders should first nominate fit men <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
secondly that the people should elect or choose out of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>per</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and thirdly, that the Bishop should confirme
the elected <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Socrat. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What exorbitant power is this then vvhich our Bishops doe now-a-dayes
chalenge unto themselues? All Classicall Divines do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to that which <hi>Iunius</hi> setteth downe, Conc. 5. l. 2. c. 6. n. 73. that
no Bishop can send or appoynt a minister <hi>sine certa ac justa ecclesiae
postulatione,</hi> vvithout the certain fore-choyce of the Church: <hi>Id e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
esset obtrudere non mittere.</hi> For that were to obtrude him, not to
send him.</p>
                  <p>6 How is the course of Gods plow preserved, when for the most
part the succeeding minister is thrust vpon the people against their
wills, and so pernitious contentions arise, of vvhich the Bishop is
cause procreant and conservant, by depriving the people of their
minister, and obtruding his own minister upon them, and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him in al those courses vvherby he grieveth the poor people.</p>

7 As the Minister hath no facultie in himselfe to appoint a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,

                  <p>Thus much for the defendant his case. Whereas he addeth, that

they did: but the letter of the nineteene miscarried, and that of the

altered the case of the unlawfulness, and so that they were all
against him; whereupon he mistrusting his owne judgement, and being
much perplexed thereabout, suffered himselfe to be swated unto what is

surely those that differ from us, may as vvell be accused therefore,
as we that differ from them, especially vvhen we urge nothing of
ours upon them, but they impose their owne devices upon us, and
so are causes of the differences. 4. the amazement vvhich some
haue, vvondring vvhat vvill be the event of differences, is no <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
error,</hi> which by the Def. is required to a scandall, sect. 1. And
if they grow remisse in religion upon it, that is their sinne. I am
sure zeale against superstition, and for pure and undefiled worship,
hath no fitnesse in it to vvork remissenesse in religion: but urging
of humane devices in Gods vvorship, tendeth directly thither.</p>

                  <p>THe second charge of scandall, is in respect of the <hi>Separatists.</hi>
Where 1. I aske, if <hi>Gaius</hi> had made a separation from the
Church wherein <hi>Diotrephes</hi> lived, vvhether the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi>
had been cause of that scandal, because he condemned his abuse of
excommunication. 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 10. 2. If any separate from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
where Images are retained, who is the cause, they that dislike
of Images, or they that retaine them? 3. The dislike of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
is not the cheife cause for vvhich separation is made: but the
intollerable abuses vvhich are in Ecclesiasticall Courts: by which
it commeth to passe, that many poore men being troubled at the
first for a small thing, afterward are driven to flye the countrey:
and flying with a hatred of such courses, are ready to receiue that
impression which is most opposite unto them. The thing it selfe is
plaine enough to all indifferent men, that Ecclesiasticall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
urged and obtruded, are the proper occasion of separation.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place the Papists are alledged as persons offended by
Non-conformitie, because <hi>they are utterly unperswadeable to enter
into a Church where all ancient rites are professedly rejected.</hi> But 1.
the refusing of conformitie by the Ministers, doe not, I hope,
make these ancient rites (much lesse all) to be professedly reiected
by our Church. For then we may plead the profession of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as well as the Defendant: which he I am sure will not grant.
2. This assertion which is given as a reason, is evidently false. For
in Scotland, France, the Low-countries, and such like Churches,
vvhere none of these ceremonies are retained, the power of Gods
word (vvhich doth not depend on human ceremonies) is as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the conversion of Papists, as in England. 3. How doth this

                     </gap> vvith that vvhich the Defendant hath so often told us, that
<hi>our ceremonies are not the same with the Papists ceremonies:</hi> and that
<hi>the Papists haue no great conceit of our ceremonies,</hi> cap. 2. sect. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.
4. If our contentions about these things bee a scandall to the
Papist, let them looke to it that cast these apples of contention
into the Church, under the pretense of peace and uniformitie.
5. One minister without conformitie, as old Mr. <hi>Midsly</hi> of
Ratsdell, vvho vvas after silenced for his labour, hath conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more Papists then any (I might say then all) of the Bishops
in England, vvith all his ceremoniall observations. 6. It is
vvell knowne that there are farre more Papists and Popishly
affected in those places vvhere ceremonies are most observed,
then where they haue been disused. 7. It is answered in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement,
pag. 47. 48. that ceremonies are not for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Papists, but for the hardening of them. And that
Papists are not so much to be respected as brethren. To the latter
of vvhich words, the Defendant replieth vvith a descant upon the
tearme Brethren, sect. 20. but sayth nothing at all to the purpose.
8. What manner of converts they are usually who are addicted
to humane ceremonies, vve may see in the Archbishop of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato,
and such others.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>SECT. XXI.</head>
                  <p>THe greatest scandall of all (sayth the Defend.) is against the
Church. Now this Non-conformists are made guiltie of two
vvayes: 1. comparatiuely in this section, and then absolutely
in the next. The comparatiue accusation is, <hi>that we for avoyding of
offence towards our brethren, grievously offend our mother, in that wherin
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:216:51"/>
wee owe obedience unto her.</hi> Where 1. the question is taken for
granted, for we deny that we owe obedience in the ceremonies
to any man or societie of men. 2. If our mother be somewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
that is not presently a scandall by his definition, sect. 1. but
vvhen shee is provoked to a mortall errour. Now what <hi>mortall
errour</hi> doe vve provoke the Church to? Our desire and scope is,
that the ceremonies should be either wholly removed, or else left
free to use or disuse: this is no mortall errour, I hope. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
by accident is the silencing, depriving, excluding, and
molesting of us for Non-conformitie: This indeed is a great
errour and sinne of the Prelates; but as vvas formerly shewed,
the beginning of it is in their irregular Canons, and the ending of
it, in their cruell executions. 3. by applying our selues to the
will of the Prelates in these ceremonies, vvee should, though not
anger, yet greatly scandalize them, by confirming them in a
sinne of making their owne will a rule to the Churches, even in
mysticall ceremonies of superstitious worship, contrary to their
and our daily prayer, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> 4. The convocation doth
not carry herselfe like a mother toward us: neither doe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any such honour to belong unto it. As for the faithfull
congregatious of England, the greattest part of them would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be rid of these burthens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The rest of this Section is nothing pertinent: yet two things
may bee noted in it.</hi> 1. An errour that the number of the lewish
Proselites was great, and the converted Gentiles few, Acts 15. 2 A
grosse assertion, that after the doctrine of Indifferencie in eating of
meats, was made publicke by the Church, then to haue sought by abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to avoyd the offence of some, had been to the preiudice of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
and to the scandall of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The other accusation of <hi>contempt</hi> is onely objected sect. 22.
and varnished over with a few glosing words sect. 23. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may well bee answered vvith contempt. But hee that will
see a full refutation of this, let him read Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> chap. 5. sect.
11. 12. I am wearie of wrastling with the winde: yet one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
and unchristian taunt I cannot passe by, that hee upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Ministers with, liuing upon voluntary contribution, and
feare of offending their maintainers. For 1. when as he confesseth,
he hath no windowes to look into mens consciences by, what rule
of religion will permit him to cast upon his brethren such a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
contrary to their profession, of practising and speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their consciences for gaining of a poore contribution? Is
there not farre more cause to thinke, that great livings, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honors (one of the choicest darts that satan hath in his quiver, &amp;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:216:51"/>

4. 8 9)</hi> is it not more likely I say that these promotions beare more
sway in the mindes of our great Prelates, then a poore supply of
necessaries vvith others? 2 Neither all, nor the most part of them
against whom he writeth did liue upon contributions. Though
they need not haue been ashamed thereof if they had: seeing not
onely the primitiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Preachers should be maintained? Doe not our Pluralists and
Non-residents cary away the fat of the greatest livings, and leaue
scarce a Serving-mans wages to their Curats; so that either they
must be supplyed by contribution, or else by begging? Nay, doe
not the people in divers places take it for a great courtesie at the
Non-residents hands, if he vvill take his Tithes, and suffer them
to procure and maintaine to themselues an honest Minister in his
place? haue not our Honourable Parliament offered to provide
some competent maintenance for the Ministers, if the Clergie
would forbeare their sinfull excesses? 4. Why should the Ministers
depend so much upon contribution, if they had such accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datiue
consciences, as this Def. surmiseth of them? Some of
them with serving the time, and the addition of Simony, might
come to be Bishops: &amp; the rest might be preferred by their meanes
to some certaine in-comings.</p>

unto Christian liberty.</hi> Here the Def. observeth first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
that <hi>the state of this question is about liberty from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
observation of such things as are in their own nature indifferent.
This</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Objector implyeth.</hi> But I answer, the Objector
doth not imply it: he speaketh of ceremonies lawfully appointed
by man, that these are to be used as things indifferent. Neither if one
private Obj. had granted it, ought it therefore to be set down as
the received state of the question, seeing the Abridgment, which in
this defence is chiefly opposed, doth every where deny the cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be doctrinall necessitie, in all those humane constitutions, which
haue properties attributed unto them essentiall unto divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
then our ceremonies in controversie not onely haue such
a mysticall signification attributed unto them as is proper unto
divine Ordinances; but also that they are imposed as parts of

they are such as Papists in imposing of their ceremonies
(vvhich yet by the judgement of all our Divines depriue men of

summe of the Def. his answer is, <hi>that to impose a necessity where God
hath left a liberty, is indeed a snare: but this necessitie is not taught in
our Church.</hi> I answer, it is taught in our Church (now a daies)
that Ecclesiasticall canons doe binde mens consciences. It is taught
in our Church that mans will is a sufficient reason for these canons
about ceremonies. It is taught in our Church, that Sacraments
may not be administred, or God publickly served vvithout these
ceremonies: that Ministers called and allowed of God for these
ceremonies must be silenced; that they are to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

It is not onely therfore a freedome from Iewish ceremonies, but

ceremonies that binde or presse our consciences, <hi>Whit. de rom. pont.
q. 7 c. 3 ad</hi> 5. But it is in vaine for me to alledge our Divines in
this question: the Abridgement alledgeth diverse, whom the Def.
would not vouchsafe an answer.</p>
                  <p>One thing heere the Def. noteth, that in the Abridgement
<hi>mysticall</hi> and <hi>carnall</hi> are unsoundly confounded. But I say this is
unsoundly collected: for these two are joyned together there only
in respect of Iewish worship, and that vvhich imitateth it: And
therefore it is to no end to instance in the Sacraments instituted
by Christ, of cleere signification, and accompanied with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and liuely vvorking of the Spirit. The same poore instance
hath <hi>Bellarmine de cult. l. 3 c.</hi> 7 for significant ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>it savoureth of the flesh</hi> (saith the Def.) <hi>to call our ceremonies
carnall.</hi> Why so I pray? <hi>the Iewish ceremonies deserved that name,</hi> you
your selfe say, even vvhen they were in force: and surely ours
devised by man, abused by idolaters, without necessary use, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all promise and spirit, are farre more vvorthy to be called
carnall, then Gods own Ordinances. Those vvere onely carnall
because in comparison they vvere externall, heavie, dull things:
but ours are more heavie and dull, and beside they are sinfully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
as hath been proved.</p>
                  <p>But vvhat soundnesse doth this savour of, that the Def. saith

                  <p>HEere an objection is fained out of the Abridgement p. 34, I
say fained, because there is none such found in the place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
That vvhich is there spoken concerning other Popish
ceremonies, is a sixt proofe of the second Argument, distinct from
the fift, vvherto that of Christian liberty doth belong. That also is
handled by the Def. c. 3 l. 7, and there maintained against him.
So that this might well be omitted. Yet because there is some
force in the consequence, let us heare his Defence. The objection
which he frameth is this: <hi>If these ceremonies do not take away our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
liberty, and insnare the consciences of men, by their imposition; how
shall not the Popish ceremonies be excusable, and free from accusation in
this behalfe?</hi> His answer is, that <hi>Popish ceremonies doe infringe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:216:53"/>
liberty both in regard of their nature, and also in regard of their
number. And of both these M. Calvin giveth witnesse.</hi> I answer 1 for
the <hi>nature,</hi> it hath been shewed before, that a multitude of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
ceremonies haue no other nature and necessity allowed unto
them by the learned Papists, then ours haue by the Defendant
himselfe. See for this <hi>Bellarmine de effect. sacr. c.</hi> 30. That which
M. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith of this point is true notwithstanding in regard of
the conceit which is commonly among the simple Papists, foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by unlearned Monkes, Friers, and other Priests, for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
sake. 2 The comparisons which M. <hi>Calvin</hi> use, viz. <hi>That it is
held among the Papists a greater wickednesse to omit auricular Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then to liue impiously; eat flesh on fasting daies, then to liue in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
to worke on Saints holy-dayes, then to act mischiefe, &amp;c.</hi>
These he gathereth principally from that practise of the Papists,
whereby they punish more severely the breach of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
then of Gods law. Now this is not onely practised by our
Prelates, but also maintained by this Defendant, chap. 2 sect. 12,
vvith such faire pretence, as the Papists may well use for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of their practise. 3 As for the multitude of ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Papists, that maketh their bondage greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ours; but
doth it make ours none at all? Besides, when a few mysticall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ceremonies are admitted, the gate is let open for a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
even untill the Convocation will say there be too many.
For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe will grant that ceremonies are not to be
multiplyed over much. <hi>Fatemur ceremonias non esse nimis multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candas
de eff. sacr. c.</hi> 30, but what is too much, that must be left
to the judgement of the Church or Convocation, saith he, and
the Defendant both.</p>

alledged by M. <hi>Nic.</hi> that by the same reason that
Non-conformitie is contempt; bowling, disusing of capps,

the obligation by the intent of the Law-makers, vvhich
vvas against Popish Recusancie of our Communion-booke, and

But I would haue the Defendant remember, that all freedome is
not in the minde and conscience. For vvhere the minde is free,
the body may be bound; else Christians should not taste so
much of this vvorlds misery as they doe. Now Christ hath left
unto us not onely an inward liberty of minde and conscience, but

such bodily rites in his worship as haue not his stampe upon them,

                  <p>As for superstition, vvhich the Defendant doth now the second

of this Confutation. Now onely I note: 1 how loosely he
describeth that superstition vvhich he calleth <hi>affirmative:</hi> as if no
man could use any thing superstitiously, except he did hold that
<hi>without it the faith of Christianity, or the true worship of God could
not possible consist.</hi> Never was there such a description given

rhetorically, as he useth to doe, and not intending any definition
or distribution of that vice.</p>
                  <p>6 How he corrupteth <hi>P. Martyrs</hi> words, to haue some colour

For without doubt that is Satans intent, by casting a seed of dissentions
amongst the Bishops. And that hee aimed at in the infancie of the
Church by stirring vp discord between the East and West Churches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Passover and other ceremonies of that kind. Therfore Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Bishop of Lions, had just cause in his Epistle sent out of France to
Rome, sharply to reproue Victor the Pope of Rome, because he out of a
kind of zeale, but not according to knowledge, was minded to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all the churches of Asia, because they celebrated not the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
just at the same time, as they at Rome did. For this was nothing
but by an unseasonable desire to retaine the same ceremonies in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to rent and teare a peeces the vnitie of the Churches. I therefore
so soone as I heard that so great a ruine hanged over the Church of
Christ in that kingdome, presently, in respect of that dutie which I owe
to the Church of Christ, to your gracious Maiestie, and to that whole
kingdom, intended to write thither, and to try by my uttermost endevor
whether so great a mischiefe might possibly be withstood: some that fear
Christ, and wish wel to your Maiestie, exhorting me to the performance
of this dutie. But when I had scarcely begun to think of this course,
behold our most illustrious. Prince commanded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:216:56"/>
alreadie running, but laid a necessitie of writing upon me. Wherefore
this my boldnesse will seeme the lesse strange unto your gracious Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
seeing my writing proceedeth not so much from mine owne will
and counsell of friends, as from the commandement of my most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prince, who is one of your gracious Maiesties speciall friends.
Now I thought I should doe a matter verie worth the paines taking,
if first I should humbly admonish your most famous Maiestie what
your dutie is in this cause: and secondlie, if as your humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant
I should beseech you for our Lord Iesus Christs sake, to
performe the same. I beseech your gracious Maiestie to take this my
writing in good part, for it proceedeth from a Christian loue toward the
Church, and from an especiall reverend respect that I beare to your
most gracious Maiestie. The Lord knoweth all things. Now to the
matter in hand.</p>
                        <p>Whereas the Apostle writing to Timothie, commandeth that
praiers be made for Kings, and all other that be in authoritie, and
saith, that the end wherefore they bee ordained, is, that wee may
lead a peaceable and quiet life in all (that is, perfect) godlinesse and
honestie, he teacheth plainlie enough what is the dutie of godlie Kings
and Princes, namelie, that they take care, and bring to passe, that
first and aboue all things, true religion, and the true worship of
God, where it is banished, bee restored, and being restored, bee
kept pure: all things which smell of impietie being farre remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Secondlie, that men may liue honestlie and holilie, all kinds
of vncleannesses beeing abandoned. Lastlie, that publicke peace
and holie friendship bee maintained among the subiects, all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of contentious being, as much as possiblie may be, taken out of
the way.</p>
                        <p>As the Apostle teacheth manifestlie, as we haue seene, so all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men who bee of sound judgement concerning the Magistrates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
doe with one consent affirme, that these bee the three chiefe parts
of the office of the Prince, and of everie godlie Magistrate. Which
thing being so, I see not how your gracious Maiestie can, with good
conscience, propound againe the garments in question, and other
things of that kinde, smelling as yet of Popish superstition, and once
banished out of the Churches, to the consciences of the Bishops<note place="margin">Pauls Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by your commandement to receiue them againe. For first, this is
quite contrarie to the first and chiefe part of the Princes office. For if
the Magistrate ought to haue a chiefe care, that the worship of God
be kept pure and without mixture; and if for this cause all things are to
bee abandoned which may anie way either by themselues, or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
defile this worship: and therefore all things are to bee called
backe as much as may be, to the rule of God, and to the former and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall,
and so the more pure and simple forme of religion: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie,
if as the Apostle commandeth, we bee to abstaine, not onelie
from all evill, but also from all appearance of evill; to what end, I
beseech you most renowned and most godlie Queen, should those things
bee brought againe into the Church of God, by the Princes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
which be contrarie to the puritie of the Apostolicall worship,
which smell of Popish superstition, which bee neither availeable to
the edification of the godlie, nor to order, nor for ornament, except
that which is whoorish: which lastlie, can bring no profit, but on the
contrarie, manie evills to the Church? It is out of all doubt, that by
this law concerning apparrell, all godlie men will be offended, but the
wicked will laugh in their sleeve, and hereby be put in hope to get ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
moe things: as for those of the middle sort, that is, such as bee
newlie converted and turned from ungodlines to godlines, and be not
as yet well grounded, they will be in great danger, and if we speake
according to mans judgement, they will rather looke back to the
old superstition, to which by nature wee are inclined, then fixe
and fasten their eyes upon true religion. And therefore this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

a decree which will bring no advancement at all to godlines, but
may much further vngodlinesse. For though these garments bee
not evill and vncleane of and by themselves, that is, of their
owne nature, yet because of the former and late abuse, they are
not altogether free from uncleannesse. Certainlie it cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,

and verie grievous superstitions. Now the verie occasions
also of evills are to bee shunned. To what end then should these
bee thrust upon the Church, from whom no profit can bee hoped,
verie much evill may come? for this is to tempt God. Your
famous Maiestie may well remember, that not without cause
it was written, <hi>Hee that toucheth pitch, shall bee defiled with it:</hi>
                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:216:57"/>
that the Apostle had reason to command, that we should purge out the
old leaven, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe. And that
Hosea did not foolishly reprove the Iewes, because they translated and
brought a yong graffe (of superstitions) out of Israel into their owne
garden, that is, the true Church. We ought, most religious Queene, to
haue nothing at all to doe with the Papists in matter of religion, saue
in those things which they haue common with the Apostles. Why, I
beseech you, were some kings, otherwise godly, reproved and blamed in
the Scriptures, that they had not taken away Churches or Temples for
divine service in the mountaines, which were built by holy Fathers ere
the building of the Temple, in which the Lord was wont to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped?
Surely, because the Temple being now builded and ordained
for divine service, God would not haue any footsteps of any other chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
at all to bee extant. Therfore also when once the kingdome of
Christ was manifested, the ceremonies and garments of Aaron ought
not any more to take place. For this cause the Apostles were upon
good ground carefull, that after Christs ascention, they should so be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, that no relickes of them remained. And if they tooke them
away holily, unholily haue the Papists called them back againe. Now
whether it be better to follow the godly simplicitie of the Apostles, or
the ungodly pompe of the Papists, who is ignorant? This recalling of
such Popish garments, your gracious maiestie may beleeue me, will bee
a greater evill, then peradventure it may bee seene, even to very wise
men at the first blush: For me thinkes I see and heare the Monks cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out with very loud voyces in the Pulpits, both confirming their
followers in their ungodlie religion, by the example of your gracious
Maiestie, and also saying, What? doth not even the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
also, a most learned and a most prudent Princess, beginne by little
and little to come back to the religion of the holy Church of Rome, the
most holy and sacred vestments of the Clergie men being taken on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
we are to be in good hope that the day will come, wherein she
will a length, though now they be thought to be dead, recall also all the
other rites and sacraments of the holy Church of Rome. These and
such like words, no doubt, most prudent Queene, the Monkes and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
will use in the Pulpits. For they take all occasions to confirme
their superstitions. Therfore to recall these stinking garments, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rubbish of the Popish Church into the Church of Christ at this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:216:57"/>
time, what is it but to giue the Papists an occasion, and the best that
may bee, to confirme and harden themselves and thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> in their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
and also to helpe them in this businesse? But let us heare
what the Prophet sayd to Iehosaphat King of Iuda, when he helped
Ahab; <hi>Darest thou helpe the wicked, and loue those vvho hate
the Lord? For this thing the vvrath of the Lord is vpon thee.</hi>
And what other thing will this bee, then even to call backe the
weake from the studie of pure Religion, and to giue them a privie
warning to looke backe, and returne into Aegipt? It is an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for us weake men, who of our owne nature are prone to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to slide backe to impietie. Therefore occasions of sliding backe
to vngodlinesse, ought to be taken away, and at no hand to bee given.
And what else, I pray you, meant God in forbidding to plow with
an Oxe and an Asse, to sow the same field with diverse kinds of seeds,
and to weare a garment woven of linnen and wollen together? It
is an odious and detestable thing with God, that the same field of
the Lord should bee tilled by ungodlie and godlie Bishops together;
If in the same Church Popish Doctrine be taught with the Doctrine
of the Gospell; Finallie, if sacraments, ceremonies, and rites, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Apostolicke, and partlie Popish, be used, and the Church bee
cloathed with them as with a garment of linsey-wossey. For what
agreement hath light with darknesse? And therfore those things
which bee not of God, but from them who haue defiled Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
are utterlie to be cast away, which the Lord himselfe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to bee done, when hee charged utterlie to destroy all things
which appertained to those who should giue vs counsell to follow
strange Gods, and to burne their garments, and all their stuffe
with fire in the middest of the street, to shew our detestation of
such Seducers, and that they might bee an execrable thing to the
Lord. And who knoweth not that these garments are a part of the
houshould stuffe of that Romish Seducer? <hi>There shall cleave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the execrable thing, sayth hee, to thy hand, that the Lord
may turne from the fiercenesse of his wrath, and multiplie thee,
as he hath sworne to thy Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore to bring these
garments, seeing they bee the houshold stuffe of Antichrist, into the
Church of Christ, what is it else then to provoke God to anger, and to
kindle his furie against us? Certaine it is, that he who is a true friend
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:216:58"/>
of Christ, will never seeke to haue the ornaments of Antichrist in
his owne house, and much lesse will hee suffer them in the Temple of
Christ. For who can indure the armes of his enemie in his owne house,
and specially in the chiefest roome of the same? And if God will
haue a thing destroyed and abolished, who are we that we dare build it
up againe. But it is Gods will that after the death of Christ all gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Aaron and Levi should be abolished: and hee hath plainlie
enough manifested everie where, that in these our dayes he would haue
all vngodlie and vaine ceremonies, pompes, deceits, and paintings of
the Papists driven away by the shining brightnesse of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
because these things haue no power in them to kindle and increase
godlines, but greatlie availe to the quenching of the same. Neither
verilie can I see to what other end these garments tend, then in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deed (that I may now come vnto the second head) to defile
and disgrace the faire face; nay, the whole bodie of the Church
of England reformed according to the<note n="†" place="margin">Vntrue, or misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> Gospell; as if the chaste and
honest daughter of a King should bee attired with those verie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherewith some famous and notable whoore used to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned,
and when shee were so clothed, were commanded to goe
abroad in the streets. Now who can allow or judge this to bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable?
Wherefore though for no other, yet for this very cause,
such garments ought not to bee thrust upon the Church of Christ,
because that harlot of Rome hath abused, and doth still at this
day abuse them (though in their owne nature they bee not evill)
to evill, and to cover her fornications, or rather to entice men
to commit fornication. For all these pompes, and Popish ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are nothing else but whoorish paintings invented and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for this end, that men might thereby bee allured to spirituall
fornication. Is it not therefore a filthie and dishonest thing, to
haue these in the Church of Christ? If the brasen serpent, which
had beene ordained of God, and that for the wholesome vse of
the Israelites, was taken away by godly King Ezekias, because
the Israelites had abused it contrarie to the word of God: and if
Ezekias bee highlie commended for this so doing, because hee had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

into the running water, that there might never bee any print or

signe of it extant any more; how much more then are these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
garments to bee banished out of the Church of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Apostles never vsed them, but the whoore of Rome hath
used them in her Idolatrous worship, and to seduce men? For
it is a verie dishonest thing, that such things as are of themselues
indifferent, and haue been long used to the dispight and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, should bee retained in the Church of God, to the
hazard of the salvation of godlie men. And much lesse that kinde
of garments, which is nothing but an invention of men, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Divell himselfe, devised to seduce the simple ones.
Wee all know what praise those common-wealthes deserue, which
make good lawes that the subiects shall not weare out-landish and
strange apparrell, nor bring it into the Common-wealthes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a corruption of good and honest manners, and of the
Common-wealthes themselves. How then can that counsell which
is given to your Maiestie, bee commended, to wit, that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unknowne to the Christian world in tht time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and Apostolicall men, should bee brought into the Church

and heathenish garments to bee borne with in the Church, where
God is to be worshipped in spirit and truth, and where hee would
haue few and verie simple ceremonies? Also if God established by
his Law, that a woman may not put on a mans apparrell, not a
man a womans, the one beeing so well of it selfe dishonest, and
contrarie to nature as the other: Why then should godlie Bishops,<note n="†" place="margin">still mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed.</note>
and the servants of Christ bee clothed, or rather shamed and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the garments of godlesse Priests, and slaues of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ?
Why should wee not rather, as wee bee of a divers religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from them, so also be discerned from them, at least in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of such duties as belong unto Gods worship, by outward
signes, such as garments be? Verilie this was Gods will, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of his people, that it should bee discerned from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Gentiles, as by other things, so also by a divers sort of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
and so should professe by this publicke signe, that it would
haue nothing to doe with the Gentiles.</p>

                           <pb n="106" facs="tcp:216:59"/>
And why should not wee doe the same? Are wee not the people of
God? abides not the equitie of the same commandemet? And if the
word honest bee derived of honour, what honour will it bee for the
Church of Christ to haue Bishops attired and disguised with Popish vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in the administration of the Gospell and Sacraments, so as they
shall rather be derided then be reverenced any whit by the people?
And what commendation shall it be for your gracious Maiestie in true
Churches, and among true beleevers, that you permit such trifles to bee
called back into your Church? Therfore it standeth not with honesty,
that holy Bishops<note n="†" place="margin">still mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed.</note> be compelled to receiue such visors, neither is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a matter worthy of honour and praise, neither deserveth it the
name of vertue. For if your Majestie should command that all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
men, leaving that ancient and very graue and comely attire, should
weare Turkie coats, or a souldiers weed, as it is called: who would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
approue this decree as honest? And it is much lesse praise-worthy,
if godly Bishops be enioyned, laying aside, or at least changing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and ancient apparrell, which the Apostles wore, to wit, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and graue habit, to put on the ridiculous and execrable or accursed
garments of godlesse Mass-priests.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the third part of the Princes duties, there is nothing
fitter to trouble the publicke peace of the Church then this counsell.
For everie noveltie, especially in religion, either by it selfe, if it bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
disturbs and troubles a good peace, or if it bee good,
gives occasion of trouble by accident, by causing contention betweene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and good men. But as in things which be good of themselves, of
which nature the reformation of the Churches according to the will of
God is, we are not to care for the troubling of that vngodlie peace, that
is of the world (for Christ came not by his Gospell to keep such a peace,
but rather to take it away, and to send a sword) so assuredly, by the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of things indifferent, to trouble the peace of Churches, and to
cause strife between good men and bad, yea between godlie men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
is so wicked, that it can by no meanes bee defended,
so that Ireneus had just cause to reproue Victor Bishop of Rome, for
this cause, as hath been sayd afore. For it must needes bee, that at such
times the Churches be rent in peeces, then which thing, what is more
hurtfull? Many examples in the histories of the Church proue this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:216:59"/>
which I say. How many and how great troubles arose in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, between those who beside the Gospell urged also circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and the law, and between those who upon good ground reiected
them? And how great evills would this dissention haue brought to the
Church of Christ, had not the Apostles betime withstood them by that
councell gathered together at Ierusalem, by a lawfull examination and
discussing of the cause by manifest testimonis of the Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, and by
sound reasons? If your gracious Maiestie (as you ought) desire both to
be and to seeme Apostolicke, then imitate the Apostles in this matter.
Neither lay and impose this yoke upon the neckes of Christs Disciples
your selfe, nor suffer it to be imposed by others. But if you see that the
Bishops disagree about this matter among themselves, assemble a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and cause this controversie to be examined by the Scriptures. And
then looke what shall be proved by plaine testimonies, and strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
propound that to be observed by all, and command by your decree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
that that be observed, and so take disagreement out of the Church. For
your gracious Maiestie ought to be verie carefull, that there be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
in religion, but according to the word of God. By this means
shall a true peace, concord and unitie of the Churches bee preserved.
But if the proceeding be otherwise, what other thing will it be, then to
take away vnitie, and to trouble the Christian peace? And this I
may not passe over with silence, that by this noveltie of the busines, not
onely the publick peace shall be troubled in that kingdome, but also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
else-where out of that kingdome will haue occasion given them to
raise new contentions in Churches, and that to the great hinderance of
godlines, and the more slow proceeding of the Gospell. For all men
know, that the most part of all the Churches, who haue fallen from the
Bishop of Rome, for the Gospels sake, doe not onely want, but also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
those garments, and that there be some Churches, though few in
comparison of the former, which doe as yet retaine those garments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in Poperie, as they verie stifly retaine some other things also,
because the reformers of those Churches, otherwise worthy men, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
faithfull servants of Christ, durst not at the first (neither iudged
they it expedient) vtterly abolish all Popish things. But as the common
manner is, every man likes his owne best. Now I call those things a
mans owne, not so much which everie man hath invented, as those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:216:60"/>
which every man chooseth to himselfe, receiveth, retaineth, and
pursueth, though they be invented to his hand by others. But if there
be also annexed the examples of other men, they bee more and more
hardened in them, and are not onely hardened, but also doe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
endevour by word and writing, to draw all the rest to be of their
minde? Therfore wee easilie see what the issue wil bee, if your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Maiestie admit of that counsell which some doe giue you, to take on
apparrell, and other more Popish things besides. For some men, who be
not well occupied, being stirred up by the example of your Maiestie,
will write bookes and disperse them throughout all Germanie, of these
things which they call indifferent, to wit, that it is lawfull to admit of
them, nay that they be altogether to be retained, that Papists may bee
the lesse estranged and alienated from us, and so we may come the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to concord and agreement. As if forsooth the Papists, though we
for peace sake admitted of all those things, would ever amend their
Doctrine, and banish out of their Churches, or at any hand lay
downe their false and godless decrees, manifest and abhominable
superstitions and idolatries: and there will bee some who will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
such bookes once dispersed. So of this English fire there will
rise a new burning flame in Germanie and France, on which hot
coles the Papists as so many Smiths a forging, will sprinkle cold
water to make the flame the more vehement. And is not this a
goodly benefite? Who therefore doth not see that this counsell tends
to the troubling of all Churches.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, that golden saying of a certaine learned man is verie
true and certaine, and approved by long experience, that indifferent
things, that is, the question about indifferent things, is that golden apple
of contention. So much shall suffice to haue spoken of the troubling of
publick peace; what should I say of the consciences of privat belevers? It
is manifest, that they are greatly troubled with this commandement, to
put on these linnen garments. For they do so greatly complain, that their
lamenting voyces &amp; grones doe reach vnto, and are heard in Germany.
Now how grievous and distastfull an offence it is to trouble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of the godly, the holy Scripture sheweth: partly when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
that we make not the holy Spirit sad, neither offend the weak
ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly when it threatneth grivous punishments against those who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:216:60"/>
feare not to doe these things: partly also when it propoundeth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Saints, and specially of Paul, who speakes thus; <hi>If meat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
my brother, Ile eat no flesh while the world standeth, that I
may not offend my brother.</hi> For in those words hee giveth a generall
rule, by his example, taken out of the doctrine of Christ, to wit, that no
indifferent thing is to be admitted and yeelded unto, much less to bee ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon others, and least of all to be commended by decree: if in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
urging &amp; commanding of it, the minds of good men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of the faithfull be offended, for a tender conscience, which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God, is a thing most pretious and acceptable to God. How therefore
can that counsell be approved, which would haue a law established and
proclaimed by the Princes command for the use of garments to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Ministers in the ministerie. For (to speak many things in few
words) if such garments be to be propounded to the faithfull, they are
to be propounded either as indifferent, or as necessary: If the later, wee
doe vngodlily, because we make those things necessarie, which Christ
would haue to be free: If the former, then are they to be left free to the
Churches. But by commanding and compelling, we make things that bee
free and indifferent, to be necessarie, and so fall into the same trespasse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.
Moreover, either they be ordained of God by Moses, or they be delivered
by Christ God manifested in the flesh, or they be ordained by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost working and speaking in the Apostles, or they are of men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godly or wicked. Those ceremonies and Levitical garments, which
were ordained of God by Moses, ought all of them to haue an end after
the death of Christ, as the scriptures shew plainly, especially the Epistles
of Paul to the Coloss. and Hebr. therefore they cannot be revoked &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
back without the transgression of Gods will. It cannot be sayd that
Christ taught them, because ther is no word extant to that end, but rather
he taught plainly oftentimes, that all Moses his ceremonies were ended.
And the same I affirme concerning the Apostles. It remaines therefore
that they be sayd to be of men. If they be from godly men, then were they
ordained of them, either to edefication, or for order and comelines. But
they avail not to edification, that is, to further comelines, but rather tend
to the overthrow of it, as we saw before; neither for any good order, but
rather they tend to disorder, for there is a confusion of godly and wicked
Bishops, whereas it is meet and equall, that one of them bee discerned
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:216:61"/>
from anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, even by their garments also. Neither doe they make
Christs spouse comelie, as we shewed a little before. Therfore we ought
not to yeeld unto them. And such things as haue been invented by men,
voyd of Gods spirit, doe nothing appertaine to us. Lastly, the Apostles
vsed not these garments. For we haue no authenticke testimonie. Now
the Church is to be fashioned after the rule of that Apostelicall Church
in ceremonies and garments, as well as in Doctrine. What doe wee
then with these garments in the Church? By whose authoritie can they
be approved? What profit or wholsome use can the Christian people
haue by them? But on the contrarie we haue shewed that godliness is
weakned by them, the pure worship of God is violated, Popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
is by little and little called back, the godlie be offended, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
be confirmed and hardened in their ungodlinesses; the weak in faith
are brought into hazard of their salvation; there are occasions of many
evills given; Monkes and other Popish preachers are hereby helped to
confirme their followers in their superstition; the wrath of God
is provoked against us; those things which God would haue to bee
destroyed, are hereby builded againe by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

is defiled and disgraced: there is a foule sinne committed against ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and good lawes forbidding the putting on of strange and outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
garments: and so the whole Church is dishonored, Besides, the
publick peace of the Church, yea of many Churches is troubled: one
Bishop is set against another, the consciences of the godly are troubled,
and the minds of goood men are offended, Gods spirit is made sad in

everie man to lead a life beseeming a Christian. The Elders also and

their immoderate care for their own private businesses, neglect the poore
people of the Church, and omit such other things as belong to their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
For these three sorts of men bee the verie sinewes of the Church,
upon whom the salvation or destruction of the Church doth chieflie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Furthermore, your gracious Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ought to vse great care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that the Vniversities, and in them good and godlie teachers, bee
well looked to, cherished, liberally maintained and preserved, for these
are as the mothers, and nurses of the Churches, in which and by which
those are to be fashioned, borne, brought up and adorned, who being fit,
may be called from time to time to rule and governe the Churches.
Last of all such things as cannot be corrected &amp; amended by the word
and discipline of the Church, as it is necessarie, that according to Gods
word they be cut off and taken away by the sword of the Magistrate,
so your gracious Maiestie is to take care of them: as adulteries, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
and other capitall crimes of that sort. For God hath given the
Magistrate the sword for this end, that ungodly seducers, filthy knaues,
and unquiet men being restrayned, the rest may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life in all godlines and honesty. This is the matter (most gracious
Queen) whereon you are to spend your thoughts, hereabout are your
counsells to be occupied, here is all your strength to be shewed, namely,
that (to end in a word) we all denying vngodlines and worldly lusts,
may liue soberly, justly, and godlily in this present world. For this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:216:62"/>
is the true and fairest garment of all other. For which everie
man ought to take care, to wit, that having put off the old man
with his workes, we put on the new man, that is, our Lord Iesus Christ,
neither are there any other true ornaments which become Christian
Bishops, besides those which the Apostle hath laid downe in his
writings to <hi>Tim. and Tit. A Bishop must bee unreproveable, the
husband of one vvife, vvatching, sober, modest, harborous, apt to
teach, not given to vvine, no stryker, nor given to filthy luere, but
gentle, no fighter, not covetous, one that can rule his house honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
having children under obedience in all honestie, not forward,
not angrie, righteous, holy &amp;c.</hi> For garments and ornaments of
Aarons high Priest, were types of these true ornaments; those were
the shadowes, these be the bodie. Wherefore let those bee gone, and let
these abide still. And then at length shall we haue the whole Church,
and so the Bishops rightlie and trulie apparrelled.</p>
                        <p>Once againe I humblie beseech your gracious Maiestie, that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more of those outward garments, you will mind and consider
how these true and spirituall ornaments may be retained, put upon, and
kept in the Churches. And as I said in the beginning, that according
to your gracious Maiesties clemencie you will be pleased to pardon my
boldnes in writing. Our Lord Iesus Christ long preserue your gracious
Maiestie safe and sound to vs, and to the whole Church. From Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg.

               <p>WHEN you finde, good Reader, any straggling
testimonies of some few forraine Divines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the formalists, which seeme to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of toleration, consider first that some did
write in the dawning of the day of reformation, and therefore
could not so soone see distinctly and clearly every corruption
which was in the Church, 2. That notvvithstanding of greater
light shining in the Church, after the rising of the Sun aboue our
Horizon, the Divines treating upon many poynts, could not bee
exact in everie one, or intending principally to beat downe such
corruptions as did most assault their owne Churches, no vvonder
that there fell from their pens some sentences not ripely digested
concerning other poynts. 3. That howbeit these had purposely set
themselues to consider the controversies of our Churches, yet not
being throughly acquainted with the particular state of the same,
might giue their iudgment in the generall case, but could not so
vvell in the particular, as many worthy Divines in England haue
done. 4. They vvere but men, and might erre in judgement, and
so appeareth by the vveak reasons subjoyned somtimes to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
And living in Churches vvhere some corruptions doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
they might the more readily stumble at the like in others.
6. It hath been the practise of the English Prelates from time to
time, and is at this present houre, not onely to offer preferment to
Divines at home, but also to send gifts to forraine Divines, to blunt
at least the edge of their zeale, if they could not make them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
their own, as they haue done some. For proofe of this their
old practise I haue here subjoyned a few lines taken out of the

or saying if there Deanes, Canons, and Prebendaries will pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

is to be understood to speak onely of the English Church, where
they haue kept possession ever since the Reformation, and as a man
almost despairing of any cure after these fifty yeares contestation
against them, rather then resolving. But all Writers condemn the
reducing of corruptions into a Church, specially after exile of
