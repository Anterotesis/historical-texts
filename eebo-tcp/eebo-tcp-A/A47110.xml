            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TWo Objections have been offered againſt the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this ſmall Treatiſe in this form (which hath occaſion'd this</hi> Preface:) <hi>The one,</hi> That as a <hi>Genealogiſt</hi> I have been too <hi>Prolix,</hi> as an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> too ſhort in this my Diſcourſe. <hi>The other,</hi> That my intention being to deduce the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees of theſe Illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the <hi>Male-line</hi> only; I have inverted that order, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up an Aſcent for at leaſt ſix Generations in the firſt; and in the ſecond, by deſcending Ten: The one beginning, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terminating, in a <hi>Female.</hi>

               <hi>To the firſt of theſe I Anſwer; I do not think a</hi> Genealogiſt <hi>(even in the ſtricteſt ſenſe) ought ſo to be confined, as to be oblig'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter nothing but the</hi> Nativities, Days of Marriage, Iſſue, Times of Death, Funerals, and Place of Sepulchre, <hi>of thoſe he intends to ſpeak of: (as ſome have taught) But that he may, by a Pertinent Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, here and there ſet down ſome one, or more Memorable Action or Acquiſition of Honour, or by a ſhort</hi> Encomium, <hi>or pithy Character, Illuſtrate any Deſerving Perſon in his Deſcent; provided that he do not confuſe and break the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his</hi> Genealogical <hi>Diſcourſe by over-long and tedious</hi> Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues: <hi>For then he is rather to be eſteem'd a</hi> Genealogical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,

               <hi>than a</hi> Genealogiſt <hi>in its ſtrict acceptance, (ſuch is the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Elaborate Sir</hi> William Dugdale <hi>in his three</hi> Tomes <hi>of the</hi> Barronage <hi>of</hi> England; <hi>And Mr.</hi> Sandford, (Lancaſter-Herald) <hi>hath Judiciouſly and Truly ſtil'd his Book of the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>a</hi> Genealogical Hiſtory. <hi>So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you have</hi> Monſieur Roſieres <hi>(in his</hi> Stemmat: Lotharingiae &amp; Bari ducum.) <hi>And the Famous</hi> Antiquary And: du Cheſne, <hi>(in his</hi> Hiſtoire Genealogique des duces de Bourgongne, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) <hi>for the</hi> French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Scipio Amiratus <hi>(in his</hi> Famiglie Nobile Napolitane) <hi>for the</hi> Italians. <hi>And</hi> Johannes Orlerius <hi>(in his</hi> Genealog.

               <pb facs="tcp:61749:7"/>
ſhall ſo far inlarge it ſelf, that it exceed the rules obſerv'd by the afore-cited Authorities, the Title of <hi>Genealogiſt</hi> becomes wholly ſwallowed up, and is loſt in that of the <hi>Hiſtorian:</hi> And the Work to be eſteem'd no longer a <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> or <hi>Genealogical Hiſtory;</hi> but an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> it ſelf of ſuch and ſuch particular Perſons and Things: And therefore I have on purpoſe avoided both theſe, that this little <hi>Treatiſe</hi> might anſwer its Apella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by being no more than a <hi>Genealogy,</hi> and that properly ſo called; although I have made ſome ſlight excurſions correſponding to the Principles before laid down; and herein I am not without Preſident (even of thoſe who have had the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of excellent <hi>Genealogiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61749:7"/>
For <hi>Hieronimus Henninges,</hi> in his <hi>Theatro Genealogico,</hi> (Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Magdenburg</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred ninety and eight, and ſet out in four large <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes)</hi> takes this courſe; as he hath occaſion to Record the <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of the Chiefeſt Princes and Potentates in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> The Learned <hi>Reuſnerus</hi> treading the ſame ſteps, though with much more diligence and exactneſs (in his <hi>Baſilicon Genealogici,</hi> publiſhed in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twelve) all along adornes his Principal Branch with ſome <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Memorial:</hi> And that Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Noble Florentine <hi>Antonius Albicius</hi> eſteem'd his Curious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven Tables <hi>de Stemmat.

            <p>To the ſecond, what I have to ſay will be this: Firſt, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the preſent Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> are vulgarly reported to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Deſcent of the Houſe of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi> from the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; I have beſtowed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of running up the <hi>Pedegree</hi> to the Original of that Honour; as likewiſe ſhewn by what means it came United and Deſcendable to the preſent Kings, which could not ſo coveniently be done by an other method; and which I did to gratify the Curioſity of ſome who had
<pb facs="tcp:61749:8"/>
a deſire to be ſatisfied therein. And laſtly, it was my choice to continue the <hi>Genealogie</hi> of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> in the firſt Line, 'till it Terminated in <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and that for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſo Noble a Branch of His Majeſties Predeceſſors ſhould not lye dormant from the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the ſecond of that Name, High Steward of <hi>Scotland, viz.</hi> from the year one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, until the year one thouſand five hundred fifty and nine, 'till the uniting thereof in the Lord <hi>Henry Darnley</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> Secondly, That the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs or Sections might in ſome proportion anſwer thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Oldenburgh;</hi> which the
<pb facs="tcp:61749:9"/>
Houſe of <hi>Lenox</hi> alone could not ſupply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thirdly, that at the Union of the Families a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient opportunity might be found to trace the <hi>Pedegree</hi> of this younger Branch to its Fountain, without much interruption or diſorder. And laſtly, to inform thoſe who have been miſled, or are ignorant upon what warrantable grounds this Royal Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> came firſt to be Kings of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and how the Succeſſion hath continued from <hi>Robert</hi> the Third in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Line till this day; And I Pray God may ſo continue 'till time ſhall be no more, againſt all Factious Oppoſers whatſoever, which ought to be the repeated Prayers of every Loyal, Honeſt, Good and Faithful, Chriſtian-Subject.</p>

it might not be juſtly known to either party until after the Battle; whoſe fall might encourage the one, and diſhearten the other; and that the perſon ſo taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was one of thoſe mock-Kings, <hi>viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecond reaſon they give (why the Body found by the</hi> Engliſh <hi>was not their King's) is,</hi> For that he had been accuſtomed to wear next to his skin an Iron Girdle of a conſiderable weight, (a ſeverity impoſed upon himſelf ever ſince his being in arms againſt his Father when he was killed at <hi>Bannocksbourn)</hi> and that no ſuch Girdle or Chain of Iron (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he uſually every three years ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Blacktour, <hi>(and other occurrences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening) who had been ſent before to prepare his way, took this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to accompliſh it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much like the ſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundy; who having loſt the Battle at Nancy, was never heard of more; and therefore his Subjects for many years would not believe but that he was alive, and at Ieruſalem. Be it which way it will, we are certain of this, that neither the one nor the other ever afterwards appeared on the Stage of the World, to act either as Princes or private perſons.</p>
