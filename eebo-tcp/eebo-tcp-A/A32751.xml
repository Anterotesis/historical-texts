            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>From</hi> Paris, <hi>Febr.</hi> 19. 1666.</head>
               <p>The rumour concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> continues here daily, and that they are gathering together under one Man, who ſaith not, that he is the Meſſias, as it is reported; but only, That by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation he is raiſed, and ſent to gather up the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> from all parts of the World, and to teach them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107280:3"/>
to know the Meſſiah to come, which hitherto they have not known: It's ſaid, That ſomething of God appears in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham Perena,</hi> a rich <hi>Jew</hi> of this Town, parted on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt with his Family for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after he had taken his leave of our Magiſtrate, and acknowledged his thankfulneſs for the favour he and his Nation in their diſperſion had received here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's ſaid he offered to ſell a Countrey-houſe of his worth Three thouſand pounds <hi>ſterling,</hi> at much loſs, and that on this Condition, That the Buyer ſhould not pay one farthing till he be convinced in his own Conſcience, That the <hi>Jews</hi> have a King.</p>
               <p>On the tenth of <hi>March</hi> came divers Letters from <hi>Gaza, Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Livorn</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> bringing our <hi>Jews</hi> ſuch comfortable News, that yeſterday they teſtified ſuch joy, as never was ſeen here before: The matter was this, That now the four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which the King <hi>Sabbathi</hi> expected from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were come; and that on the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the King, who a while had kept in at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> went forth in publick; which the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving, went to the <hi>Cadi</hi> of the Town, ſaying, There was one that profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be King of the <hi>Jews:</hi> The <hi>Cadi</hi> or Sherif of the Town judging that matter pertained to the Baſſa, ſent to him about it. He at firſt grew angry, reſolving to Maſſacre all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to that purpoſe gave order to his Captains to be ready for the next morning: But that very night appeared to them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elias</hi> in a fiery Colomn, ſaying to him, <hi>Take heed of doing any harm to the Jews.</hi> This ſo terrified and ſtruck down his mind, that he craved pardon; and conſequently, inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his Cruel Deſign, he g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve forth order, not to do any harm to any <hi>Jew.</hi> And from thenceforth the King marched up and down the City without any moleſtation. On a night as the King went to bathe himſelf in a River, (that is, as is the manner of Penitents, to waſh themſelves with cold water, yea, in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107280:3"/>
midſt of Winter) the Conſtable of the Watch met him, and asked if he was a <hi>Jew;</hi> and becauſe the King did not anſwer, he lift up his Staff to ſtrike him; but feeling his arm grow ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff, and not able to move it more; he cryed out, <hi>I now acknowledge thou art the King, pray pardon me:</hi> He ſaid, Stay till it be morning; and then he reſtored him in the Name of the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> On the <hi>5th</hi> or <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the King with his four Prophets took Ship to go to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> without any Mariner, (as ſome ſay) or Pilate. He being aboard the Ship, was taken up in a fiery Colomn, and went ſo ſwift, that the King commanded to take ſome Port, becauſe he was to arrive at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> not before the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>Schebet</hi> (or <hi>January</hi> 21.) Note, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prophets doth encreaſe daily, amongſt Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as amongſt Men; and that <hi>Elias</hi> had ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Conſtantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo,</hi> and divers other places, and that publickly, ſpeaking unto the people openly. There are Prophets likewiſe at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And by reaſon of <hi>Elias</hi> his appearing and ſpeaking to them, there was celebrated great joy in their Synagogues. This the Great <hi>Turk</hi> having heard, ſent for ſome of the chiefeſt of the Jewiſh Synagogue, and askt them about their King: They said, They knew none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: He commanded them to deliver him into his hands within ſeven days, if not, that they all ſhould be put to death.</p>
               <p>This made a great ſtir at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> amongſt both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks:</hi> The Mother of the Great <hi>Turk</hi> being warned by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> himſelf, came to her Son, beſeeching him to Revoke his Sentence; but to no effect. The next day aroſe a great Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Town, which laſted two dayes and two nights, ſo that one could not ſee another; and afterward there fell a ſhowr of Hail ſtones as big as Hens Eggs, able to kill a man; whence the common people were ſo affrighted, that they cryed out, That all this was occaſioned by the Sentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and prayed the Great Lord to revoke his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107280:4"/>
But all this was in vain, had not God ſent to him the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> warning him not to do any harm unto the Jews, and inſtructing him how he ſhould deal with the King. This then being hapned, and the Great Turk being quite changed, he ſent again for the chief Rabbies, and told them, he would ſend an Ambaſſadour for their King and receive him honourably, as he did indeed. But it came not to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> till after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the King. So much for a Compendium of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Letters.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the arrival of the King, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it's affirmed from <hi>Venice</hi> Jan. the 6. that the Great Lord receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with much reſpect; ſetting him on Horſeback, and on his right hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to be ſure in theſe particulars, we muſt expect yet one ſeven-night longer. As for the two Tribes and half, they are ſaid by theſe Letters not to be in, but near <hi>Gaza.</hi>

               <p>Much beloved, and Brother in the hope of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of <hi>North-Holland,</hi> I found your moſt acceptable Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. wherein I ſee how to you, to <hi>M. I,</hi> &amp; <hi>M. K,</hi> my News concerning the progreſs of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> affairs, have been moſt welcome. Now that I may add this to your joy, I would have you take it for certain, our Jews yeſterday received from <hi>Alcaire, Livorn,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo many letters, and of ſo great credit, that all of them publickly in their Synagogues do now believe, that the Tribes of <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and the half of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> are come to <hi>Gaza,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> foretold. And that at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> King <hi>Sabbathai Levi,</hi> doth now publickly ſhew himſelf abroad, and profeſſeth himſelf to be <hi>King of the Jews.</hi> For hitherto, for a time he lay incognito, untill by ſigns and many wonders; he had demonſtrated he did act in the name of God, and not in his own. Among which ſigns whereby he proved himſelf to be ſent of God; is, That he foretold the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death of ſome men, and the very day thereof. And that he premoniſhed men of an obſcure darkneſs, with a marvelous ſhowre of Hail. And eſpecially he commanded a Fire to be made in a publick place, in the preſence of many be holders; as well of Chriſtians, as of Turks, and Jews; and entered into the fire twice or thrice, without any hurt to his Garments, or to an hair of his head: With theſe, and the like prodigious ſigns he hath now gained ſo great authority to himſelf; that he is not afraid to go in the ſtreets of the City in kingly manner, with a great Retinue of Attendants. Yea, moreover the King ſaid; he is ſuddenly to go to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> And that in the month of <hi>June</hi> next, <hi>The Redemption of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will be publiſhed throughout the whole World.</hi> And which is more, now came ſome Letters from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107280:5"/>
                  <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> which affirm the King is arrived at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and is there Reverently received: which thing, if true, this day or the next, tidings from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> will tell us. The cauſe wherefore our Merchants at <hi>Smyrna</hi> have hitherto written nothing concerning this King, is, that by reaſon of the Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he kept himſelf ſo long in private. Now by the paſſages and votes of all, he is come forth from his private withdrawing, and will go ſtraight on to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that in the company of 400. Prophes, ſent to him from <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and with a great multitude of <hi>Jews:</hi> ſo that the doubting touching the fact will ceaſe, when the Great Turk ſhall ſpontaneouſly yield the King his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: but there will remain a diſpute touching the equity.</p>
