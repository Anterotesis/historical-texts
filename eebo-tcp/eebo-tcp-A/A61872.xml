         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter that the contest betwixt Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> and our <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician</hi>
had alarmed the world, I was requested by a
Gentleman of the <hi>Middle Temple</hi> to send up the answer
to those <hi>Six Lessons</hi> assoon as it should come out here: I did
so, and found my self obliged to give him some account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which I intended should be brief, but after the descant upon
his childish <hi>Prosopopaeia,</hi> the <hi>Examen</hi> of his <hi>Criticall</hi> remarques
drew from me some sheets of paper, of which (I dispatched
them, amidst other employments, in three dayes, and never
transcribed them) I can give no further account then that the
import of my <hi>thoughts</hi> is contained in that <hi>extract of a Letter</hi>
published by M. <hi>Hobbes</hi> since, without my being privy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
or acquainted therewith untill it was too late to recall
it with <hi>civility.</hi> Upon a <hi>review,</hi> I was well satisfied therewith,
and with the entertainment it found amongst the <hi>Learned</hi> and
<hi>Ingenuous;</hi> but I was a little moved, to see my self linked in
the same cause with Mr. <hi>Hobbes.</hi> I know his Adversary (it is
a sufficient <hi>Character</hi> to <hi>name</hi> him) to be JOHN WALLIS

how <hi>Calepine's</hi> Authority should not <hi>out-weigh</hi> mine, if his <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>

               </gap>eady sensible of what you have done, and
what trouble you have now drawn upon me by communicating my
letter to Mr. <hi>Hobbes.</hi> Though I have an entire respect for his <hi>person,</hi>
a great esteem of his <hi>learning,</hi> and honourable resentments for his
<hi>civility</hi> at that <hi>one</hi> visit I gave him, which as vulgar reports had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>unexpected,</hi> so it begat in me an opinion that he was one of the
most <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> Gentlemen in the <hi>world:</hi> yet I durst not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
a <hi>line</hi> to him by way of censuring his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> lest it might <hi>distaste</hi> those, who
would not stick to <hi>entitle</hi> me to all his <hi>Heterodoxyes,</hi> (to which I am so great a <hi>stranger,</hi>
that I know no more of them then <hi>common talk</hi> hath <hi>acquainted</hi> me with, having never
had <hi>leisure</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> his books,) because I <hi>agree</hi> with him in some <hi>few</hi> inconsiderable
points of <hi>Critical learning,</hi> and make me <hi>guilty</hi> of his <hi>sentiments,</hi> because I <hi>excuse</hi> his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
With such as think <hi>all manner of correspondence</hi> (which cannot be denyed without
<hi>incivility)</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> to be <hi>scandalous;</hi> all <hi>agreement</hi> even in <hi>Philology</hi> transcendently
<hi>heretical;</hi> what can I hope for, but that <hi>they</hi> repute it <hi>Apostasy</hi> to <hi>appear</hi> for <hi>him</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick?
But Sir, for this <hi>you</hi> are <hi>accountable:</hi> I wrote a letter to <hi>you,</hi> you by publishing
our <hi>privacies</hi> made it a <hi>reply</hi> to Dr. <hi>Wallis:</hi> I defended the <hi>Truth, you</hi> made it a <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

had been no <hi>priviledged place</hi> against the assaults and <hi>arrests</hi> of our <hi>high-</hi> Priest, you will
say there needed no <hi>rejoynder,</hi> since he hath invalidated nothing I said; but how <hi>many</hi>
will think so besides your <hi>self?</hi> If <hi>La Taupiniere</hi> doth not <hi>overcome,</hi> yet he <hi>triumphs,</hi>

after he had <hi>corrected</hi> him: <hi>duly!</hi> (but what will not these <hi>humble witted</hi> souls do to
compass a <hi>jeast?)</hi> Lest you should question my <hi>integrity,</hi> and <hi>suspect</hi> hence-forth that
I go about to impose upon you those things which are not <hi>veritable,</hi> I have penned a
further discourse upon that <hi>subject;</hi> which you may suppress from going any further, if
you finde that my <hi>early</hi> repute <hi>abroad</hi> doth not call for the <hi>publication,</hi> nor the <hi>applouse</hi>

not <hi>deserve</hi> it, then you may let it fall, and suffer me (in the opinion of the illiterate)
to seem <hi>foyled</hi> in my first <hi>essay.</hi> I have enlarged upon particulars, that so I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

And is this no more then to tell him <hi>Alvarez</hi> did write a Grammmar? I believe indeed
that was all the Doctor knew of him, but no man could think that was all I meant;
though writing in haste, I did not cite his words. Who that <hi>Orlandus Pescetius</hi> is, I
do not know, but had he in his writings produced any thing that might avail the Doctor

<hi>se</hi> it was not good,) but that <hi>se</hi> was omitted in the impression (twice for fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.)
Your Advocates defence is, that <hi>praetendo</hi> is a good Latin word (as though
any had questioned it) why did he not bring the same for <hi>Cum</hi> in the former place?
For doubtless that is a good Latin word too. The easiest defence had been, in both
places, as well as one, to put it upon the Printer; (in the one place he put in <hi>cum,</hi>
which were better out; in the other he left out <hi>se,</hi> which should have been in:) or
else, that it was but the <hi>stumbling of an hastypen,</hi> which had been excuse enough, and
would have passed without any more ado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the Doctor said in his <hi>Elen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>us</hi> I have not the book to see; yet I fear he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
the terms no <hi>great elegancy,</hi> and an <hi>Anglicisme!</hi> An <hi>Anglicisme</hi> may be a <hi>very great
elegancy:</hi> and I think the Doctor did not do well in a Philosophical discourse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>phrases</hi> for not being <hi>great elegancies:</hi> but surely he took it for a <hi>Barbarisme;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the former account he must seem impertinent, and on the latter score, <hi>ignorant.</hi>
In the construction of these two words, I imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ned that his quarrel lay against the verb
<hi>praetendo,</hi> to <hi>pretend,</hi> (and he I think must confess it, for the infinitive mood without
an Accusative case before it, as here <hi>Se</hi> was omitted, is frequent in Latin Authors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in <hi>Tully</hi>) hereupon I said <hi>praetendo</hi> was a good word in that sense, and proved it.
But that I said <hi>simply</hi> that <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> was a good Latin word, without any relation to its
English signification, is a thing imposed upon me by the Doctor, that so he might
seem to <hi>reply</hi> something, though he said nothing. What the printer might leave out,
the Doctor will tell us anon in his own case; if he expect any <hi>favour,</hi> he must learn
to <hi>allow</hi> more. You have had enough concerning <hi>Cum,</hi> and it is as easie for a printer

how the Doctor varies his phrase, he said before <hi>tanquaem</hi> without <hi>si,</hi> signified
<hi>as,</hi> and not <hi>as if,</hi> now he saith, that it was an <hi>Elliptical</hi> expression. The difference is
this, an <hi>Elliptical expression</hi> may be good (such are all ablatives of <hi>cause, instrument,</hi> or
<hi>manner,</hi> as <hi>Vossius</hi> proves, and others,) but the use of a word for what it signifies not,
cannot be. <hi>Of the signification of words use must be the judge.</hi> All that I say of <hi>Stephen,</hi>
is that I did not remember any example in him: the Doctor findeth <hi>three, a least three
examples;</hi> which if he knew before, every body can judge, what a petulant <hi>caevil</hi> it was
for him to engage in, and how much he hath amended this matter. <hi>Stephen's</hi> having
examples was but accidental, and if the Doctor do prove he have, he <hi>overthrowes his
cause,</hi> and only puts me in minde of what I professed I did not <hi>remember.</hi> If I said <hi>it
was not possible for the</hi> Dr. <hi>to know more then Rob. Stephen would tell him;</hi> I had not only

Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> retorted, that <hi>add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>co</hi> was not used in that sense. The Doctor vindicates

may be used in that sense: which is a most ridiculous kinde of arguing, where
we are but to take up our language from others, and not to coyn new phrases. It is
not the <hi>Grammer</hi> that shall secure the Doctor, nor <hi>wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>est. To justifie his expression he must have shewed it <hi>usu tritum,</hi> or
alledged the Authority of some Author of great note for it. I have not the leasure to
examine his impertinent citations about those other compounds, nor yet of the
simple verb <hi>duco;</hi> nay, to justifie his saying he hath not brought one parallel exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He talks indeed very high, that <hi>duco</hi> (with its compounds) is a word of a large

or a very stranger to the Latin tongue that doth not know it, or can have the face to
deny it. I read what will be my doom for not allowing his Latin; yet I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I dare secure the Doctor for having read <hi>all Authors,</hi> notwithstanding his <hi>asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and I hope he will do the like for me. And for those which he hath read, had
he brought no better proofes then these, he had, I am sure, been whipped soundly
in <hi>Westminster</hi> School for his impudence, as well as ignorance by the learned master
thereof at present. But I dare further affirm, that the Doctor hath not read in this
point any, but only consulted with <hi>Robert Stephen's thesa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>us linguae Latinae,</hi> whence
he hath borrowed his allegations in <hi>adduco;</hi> and for the other I had not so much <hi>idle</hi>
time, as to compare them. And left the fact might be discovered he hath sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
those Authors whence <hi>Stephen</hi> cites the expressions, and imposed upon them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
If it be not so, or that the Doctor could not write it right when the copy was
right before him; let him tell me where he did ever read in <hi>Plautus, adducta res in

this may suffice to justifie Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s exception, who proceeded no further then this

<hi>this signification is true, but so may the other be also.</hi> I answer, if it never have been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so, it cannot be so, for we cannot coyn new Latin words, no more then French,
or Spanish, that are forreigners. A man may lawfully adde some words to a language
that is in vogue, because use may in time naturalize them: but we must leave a dead
language such as we finde it in the monuments of antiquity, and it is sacriledge to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with it. Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was upon the Negative, and not to disprove the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
If the Doctor would be believed, he must prove it by some example (which
is all the proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not to have cause. But Doctor <hi>Wallis, why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I answer yes, equally for either, and yet for neither: did ever any body go about to
mock his Readers thus solemnly? I do not finde (to my best remembrance) any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of it in <hi>Stephen,</hi> and the Doctor is not wiser then his book; if there be, it is
strange the Doctor should omit the only pertinent example, and trouble us with such

the best you can, you will not be able to finde better words then <hi>adducere malleum</hi>

meaning, I shall justifie his Latin, but must leave it to him to prove it sense. If he
intended no more, why did he go about to defend the other meaning, and never
meddle with this? Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>The Doctor deals very intricately in his reply, and seems therefore to have been
more confused, that so he might make the better flourish, and that might pass for a
sufficient answer, which was not in the least manner applicable to the case in hand.
Once for all I shall acquaint the reader with a piece of the Doctors Rhetorick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein
he doth much please himself: It is a bad imitation of what was excellently used by <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him the Doctor seems not to have we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>(divine</hi> like) takes all the frame into pieces, and then examines each parcel and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if it were a sentence <hi>integrate, absolute,</hi> independent of what precedes or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
As for example, the <hi>Pantomine</hi> thus flourisheth it. <q>Enter Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
what sayes he? He sayes it is <hi>ridiculous.</hi> That is easie said: but saying so
doth not make it so. This is his reflexion upon that passage of mine: Now follows
his ridiculous Apology for <hi>adducis malleum.</hi>
                  </q> It is true I wrote an Epistle, not a
<hi>treatise,</hi> to a person of <hi>ingenuity,</hi> not to the Doctor, and therefore I did rather <hi>hint</hi>
then <hi>urge</hi> the proofes of my assertion: But any body now may see the vanity of his
exception, that shall but read these <hi>prelimma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w addition,</hi> but by way of <hi>explanation</hi> of what was evidently contained in the <hi>text</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I did as little dream the Doctor should have ever been a judge of that letter, as
he <hi>prophesie</hi> by his <hi>argumentum ad h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

friend, <hi>good service,</hi> but I cannot commend the <hi>means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such another reflexion is that of his p. 21. <q>To say there is a vast <hi>difference,</hi> and not

this open ward: but that I shall consider in its peculiar place.</p>
               <p>I must now invert the order of what the Doctor hath delivered, and so applie them
to the parts of the letter: his first exception is.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>W.</hi> repl. He observes further that in some of the allegations we have not the
word <hi>add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but the simple verb <hi>duco,</hi> or some other compound: <q>And <hi>therefore
that all these are impertinent:</hi> because (forsooth) it is <hi>not Granmar, or Analogy that
will secure us.</hi> But we are still besides the business. The original charge is against
<hi>duco;</hi> and against <hi>adduco</hi> but as one of the train, not as a stragler from the rest of
his company. And therefore the allegations are all pertinent: and that Analogy is
ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d argument in the case, we shall hear from his own witness by and by.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this there needs no further reply, then that the reader consider my <hi>preliminary
positions</hi> only that the Doctor may learn hereafter to read with more attention I shall
here give him so much light out of the text of the letter as may be requisite for to <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
him, though it may be <hi>impertinent</hi> as to others. The question is concerning <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance;
proof</hi> of <hi>elegance</hi> is to be deduced from the <hi>use</hi> in such ages as Latin eloquence
did most flourish in: since that <hi>age</hi> cannot be <hi>recalled,</hi> our recourse must be to such
<hi>authors</hi> as wrote then: <hi>many</hi> of those are <hi>lost,</hi> others <hi>corrupted,</hi> if therefore we would
determine any thing of <hi>Elegancy</hi> we must apply our selves to those whom the general
vogue of all ages hath represented unto us as the most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>eloquent</hi> writers; and
such are only <hi>Cesar</hi> and <hi>Tully:</hi> whose expressions we may <hi>acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sce</hi> in and safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it <hi>good,</hi> because <hi>found in their wooks.</hi> If we finde ought in any other author,
(whose authority is suspected) we can only say <hi>possibly</hi> it may have been used, but
neither their using it, nor any conformity with Grammar can <hi>secure</hi> us, so that I did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
say that where we are but to take up our language from others, <q>the Doctors argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was ridiculous: neither could Grammar, or Analogies <hi>secure</hi> him, where ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
comes in contest.</q> That the <hi>original</hi> charge lies against <hi>Duco</hi> is false; for the
ground of contest was <hi>adduco:</hi> and that the case of the <hi>simple &amp; compound</hi> verb may be
different, is a <hi>preliminary hypothesis:</hi> so that his allegations are not pertinent, if they
were <hi>significative:</hi> my witnesses lay not that <hi>Analogy in any case is a good</hi> argument: and
how any argument can be good in <hi>one case</hi> and not in another <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not.</p>
               <p>His second exception runs thus.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>W.</hi> He takes notice (for so he was told in the Catalogue of <hi>Errata</hi>) that page
19. l. 23. <q>
                     <hi>Horace</hi> is put for <hi>Pliny,</hi> (that you may see how quick sighted he is, to spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a fault when it is shewed him) and that <hi>line</hi> 7. there is <hi>Plau.</hi> for <hi>Plin.</hi> (which had
I discovered it in time, had been put amongst the <hi>Errata</hi> with the rest) which was the
printer's mistake, &amp;c. Then he observes, that these allegations are to be found in
<hi>Robert Stephen's Thesaurus linguae Latinae:</hi> that is, <hi>some of them,</hi> (or else 'twere a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
but I hope he will not undertake so all. If he finde those of <hi>page</hi> 20. 21. (and
those are a competent number) in <hi>Robert Stephen,</hi> he hath good luck. And 'tis
more then I know if all the rest be there. But he supposeth that <hi>I consulted with Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen.</hi>
It is very like so, if I had had him at hand, (hee'd have thought me a fool
if I had not) and did not he consult with him also for <hi>cum,</hi> and <hi>tanquam,</hi> (yes and
with <hi>Charles Stephen</hi> too) and with <hi>Henry Stephen</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:35292:17"/>

man, you see. He <hi>dares affirm,</hi> what I durst not, who have best reason to
know. Perhaps he means, I did not read over all those Authors to make that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
(No truly: I would not have him think I was such a fool.) Or that for
what places I sound in <hi>Stephen,</hi> I did not consult the original authors. (For some,
<hi>I</hi> did; for some I did not: for I did not think it worth the while, the controversie

               </p>
               <p>I answer, that in the Catalogue of <hi>Errata Plin.</hi> is substituted for <hi>Hor.</hi> But that I was
any more told that, then that <hi>Plau.</hi> was put for <hi>Plin.</hi> I hope the reader will believe me:
I neither read his <hi>thoughts,</hi> nor his table of <hi>Errata:</hi> I thought he could not <hi>commit</hi> any,
who will not <hi>allow</hi> any in another: it was but a lesson of his own teaching, that <hi>I</hi> did
then <hi>read</hi> him: it will require some grains of allowance, for him to verifie that ever <hi>I</hi>
was shewed that <hi>catalogue:</hi> and if it were not <hi>shewed me, I</hi> am as <hi>quick-sighted</hi> as another,
notwithstanding that I <hi>might have seen it,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> had looked in the <hi>latter end.</hi> But hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<hi>I</hi> shall look for <hi>Synod</hi>-man's <hi>Errata,</hi> and if <hi>I</hi> do not finde all at the end of their

took <hi>Stephen</hi> for a <hi>weeder</hi> of the Latin tongue.</q> No indeed, not I neither; he
gives a good account of words and phrases <hi>poetical, oratorical, historical,</hi> &amp;c. so that the
book is a good book, and of good use, when the reader doth not so far mistake as to
seek for the defence of <hi>oratory</hi> amongst his <hi>Poeticks:</hi> so that I allow <hi>Stephen,</hi> as I would

may be remembred how in the conduct of the letter, I had two things in hand, one
thing to consider the controversie as stated betwixt the two combatants, Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Wallis:</hi> and another to consider it in it self, and according to the truth. You

(I might have cited others, but that I thought them the most fit counterpose to the
Doctor) who say <hi>as much as he:</hi> and if that they be <hi>impertinent,</hi> you see Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath
company: though for my part I doubt not but that they intended to restrain <hi>adduco
to persons,</hi> and <hi>affero</hi> to <hi>things:</hi> Neither would they have been put off by the opposition
he makes: no more then <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> whose elegancies have still a great esteem,
though <hi>Mancinellus</hi> hath endeavoured to disgrace them by better quotations then our
Doctor brings: against all which it is a sufficient defence, that <hi>Valla</hi> did make only
<hi>Quintilian</hi> (for he he made <hi>Tully</hi> truckle under him) for his <hi>rule,</hi> and by that <hi>rule</hi> he
did condemn those <hi>barbarismes,</hi> which others had made use of. But I shall tell you
more! Amongst those <hi>Authors</hi> that say <hi>duco</hi> is used of <hi>animals,</hi> and <hi>affero</hi> of <hi>inanimates,</hi>

to call those <hi>vice-pastores, vice-domini, vicars</hi> of Christ which he speaks of in his <hi>thesis.</hi>
As for my substituting of <hi>persons</hi> instead of both, I think <hi>I</hi> do not do it, but do truly
cite <hi>Loosaeus.</hi> I suppose that the dispute is not to be ended in <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> I take <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona</hi>
in this <hi>vulgar</hi> sense, <hi>id est persona, quantum ad ipsam actionem, quod in se habet quod
possit agere, vel non agere.</hi> And so there will not be any great difference: whether you
call them <hi>bodies animate, animals,</hi> or <hi>persons.</hi> In the place, <hi>Loosaeus</hi> doth not say, that
Analogy is a <hi>good argument,</hi> which the Doctor said <hi>he did.</hi> His example is of <hi>adduce,</hi>
and what he infers, <hi>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

quae de persona; et Ferre, Adferre, &amp;c. quae de re dicuntur.</hi> Are as full proofe
as was required for Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and as much as needed to be inferred: and I was not
to maintain my own opinion there, as is expresly said in the Letter: which if it did
not <hi>reach</hi> the controversie as <hi>now</hi> stated, yet it was full proofe as to what was <hi>intended.</hi>
And for my <hi>judgement</hi> it stands <hi>irrefragably</hi> ballanced upon those preliminary suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But the Doctor saith how he doth argue by way of <hi>Analogy</hi> from one particular
compound (which is <hi>adduco</hi>) to the rest: but he doth not say, that the arguing is <hi>good,</hi>
as my <hi>preliminaries</hi> evince it not to be: and therefore the Doctor was out, in arguing
from the <hi>fact</hi> to the <hi>equitableness</hi> or <hi>validity</hi> of the thing. I am not to defend him, I did
not alledge him to that purpose: and the Doctors <hi>Hortensian</hi> discourse about <hi>adsere,</hi>
is nothing to the matter, but that he would be silent. I say my observation reaches
no further then that <hi>adduco</hi> is used of <hi>persons,</hi> or of <hi>things</hi> considered as <hi>persons;</hi> and
<hi>affero</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> and even of <hi>persons</hi> if they be not considered <hi>

adferri, referri,</hi> is sometimes good of <hi>men:</hi> but then, they are not considered as any
way contributing to their <hi>local transportation.</hi> And thus may be solved all the Doctors
allegations out of <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Loosaeus</hi> be never concerned in it; who meant <hi>I</hi> doubt not
the same that <hi>I</hi> do now say: of <hi>figurative motions I</hi> give no rule, but regulate my self by
<hi>use. Loosaeus, Crocius,</hi> &amp;c. will be no more moved at his quotations of <hi>Virgil,</hi> (for <hi>horses</hi>
and such animals are considered as <hi>persons</hi>) then <hi>I,</hi> unless it had been to <hi>laughter.</hi> And
that <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of his, <hi>Now would any think that Virgils elegant expression should suffer so

not see that: yet that it may be observable how secure the Doctor is in his quotations;

<hi rend="margQuotes">(for <hi>Rhodiginus</hi> was an understanding and well-read man) doth mean <hi>Eustathius</hi> upon
<hi>Homer,</hi> for that is the book of most repute, his other pieces being no way conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
either for bulk or esteem. But it is not that book, nor yet his History of <hi>Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi>
but his notes upon the 725. verse of <hi>Dionysius</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Upon which <hi>Eustathius</hi> thus remarks: <q>

                     </gap> (forte <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This testimony
doth not prove any thing of <hi>hopping,</hi> and as to the derivation, I cannot but say that
<hi>Eustathius</hi> had too much of the <hi>Grammarian</hi> in him, and this is not the first time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this book, nor elsewhere, wherein he hath trifled. It is observable out of the
place that there were more <hi>Empusa</hi>'s then one, as indeed the name is applyed by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men to any kinde of frightful phantasme, and so it is used by several Authors;
and for so much as phantasmes are various, according as the persons affrighted have
been severally educated, &amp;c. every man did impose this name upon his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
and so <hi>Empusa</hi> came to be so diversified in the phantasies of men, as they were
fearful of different apparitions, for who will believe that she was not apprehended as
having <hi>four legs</hi> when she appeared in the form of a <hi>Cow, dog,</hi> &amp;c. in which shapes she
was at that time phansied by <hi>Bacchus</hi> and his man, as well as that of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? I do
not finde that she appeared in any shape but such as made use of <hi>legs</hi> in going, whence
I imagine that <hi>Empusa</hi> might be opposite to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which appellation was
antiently fixed upon the Gods <hi>(propitious)</hi> upon a twofold account. First, for that
they were usually affigiated as <hi>having no feet:</hi> which leads me on to a discourse, which
however digressive, is neither <hi>impertinent</hi> now, nor will be otherwise <hi>disuseful.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The antients, being sensible how the deity was not to be comprehended, and so not
to be effigiated; and yet withall finding how prone men were to entertain themselves
with corporeal thoughts of God, they did at first erect not <hi>statues</hi> to him, but <hi>Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

bring no Author for their allegation, all that may be allowed them is, that by way of
allusion our modern play may be called <hi>Ludus Empusae:</hi> but that it is so called, we
must expect till some Author do give it that name. These are so good Authors, that
I have not either of them in my library; but I have taken the pains to seek out and
consult, first <hi>Rider;</hi> I looked in him, who was only Author of the English dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and I could finde no such thing. 'Tis true, in the <hi>Latin</hi> dictionary which is
joyned with <hi>Rider,</hi> but made by <hi>Holyoke;</hi> (O that the Doctor would but mark!)
In the appendix of <hi>obsolete words,</hi> there is <hi>Empusae ludus, vid. Ascoliasmus:</hi> and there
I finde <hi>Ascoliasmus, Ludus Empusae, fox to thy hole.</hi> The same is in <hi>Thomasius,</hi> who
refers to <hi>Iunius</hi> in like manner. But could the Doctor think the word obsolete, when
the play is still in fashion? Or doth he think this play so antient, as to have had a
name that thorough length of time should grow obsolete? As for <hi>Iunius's</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Empusa,</hi> it is this, <hi>Empusa, spectrum quod se infalicibus ingerit, uno pede ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</hi>
Had the Doctor ever read him, he would have quoted him for his derivation of
<hi>Empusa,</hi> I suppose. In <hi>Ascholiasmus</hi> he saith, <hi>Ascoliasmus, Ludus Empusae, fit ubi al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero

he hath wronged <hi>Iunius,</hi> and grosly imposed upon his Readers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">But to clear up this controversie further, I cannot be perswaded the Doctor ever
looked upon <hi>Iunius,</hi> for if he had, I am confident according to his wonted accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he would have cited <hi>Pollux</hi>'s <hi>onomasticon</hi> into the bargain, for <hi>Iunius</hi> refers to
him, and I shall set down his words, that so the reader may see what <hi>Ascoliasmus</hi> was,
and all the Doctors <hi>Authors</hi> say <hi>Ludus Empusae</hi> and <hi>Ascoliasmus</hi> were one and the same

who could <hi>hop furthest,</hi> or whether only one <hi>did pursue</hi> the rest <hi>hopping,</hi> and they
fled before him on both legs, which game he was to continue till he had caught
one of his fellows; or whether it did consist in the boyes striving who could <hi>hop long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;</hi>
or lastly whether it did consist in <hi>hopping upon a certain bladder,</hi> which being
blown up and well oyled over, was placed upon the ground for them to hop upon,
that so the unctuous bladder might slip from under them, and give them a fall. And
this is all that <hi>Pollux</hi> holds forth. Now of all these wayes there is none that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of them notwithstanding might be called <hi>Ludus Empusae,</hi> but not in any sort <hi>fox to

Truly all I shall say, and to conclude this business, is, that he had read over an

addition, which my haste caused me either to quit, or express otherwise then I
should have done upon meditation: they are such passages to which the Doctor hath
excepted nothing; I come now to examine what he hath said against my discourse. It
is confessed on both sides that <hi>there were more Empusa's then one: that the name <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his lessons could not but take notice of this passage, and reflect upon it
to this purpose. <q>When a stranger shall read this, and hoping to finde therein some
witty conceit, shall with much ado have gotten it interpreted and explained to him,
what will he think of our Doctors of Divinity at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that will take so much pains,
as to go out of the language they set forth in, for so ridiculous a purpose? You will
say it is a pretty <hi>Paronom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>nisi uno incedebat,</hi> that is, she <hi>bepped</hi> upon one: for he wonders in his last

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thirdly, <hi>Inde liquet,</hi> it is therefore (<hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>she hopped</hi>) clear
that <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

His last reply furnisheth me with some other additional observations. As that,
<q>of any affinity betwixt <hi>Hob-goblin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> he spake not a word: and therefore
is not responsible for any jest, or clinch.</q> Very good! Doth any man that maketh
<hi>clinches,</hi> write in the margin, <hi>this is a clinch: I allude to this, or that?</hi> Doth he not
suppose his reader so intelligent as to know the other name, <hi>(viz. Hobs)</hi> upon which
ariseth a jingle? If it be not <hi>certain,</hi> it is very <hi>suspicious</hi> that he intended that way; for
otherwise I do not see how pertinent that discourse is to the matter, if it be not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of the <hi>person</hi> against whom he writ. Another thing is, <q>that he doth nor say
that <hi>Hobs,</hi> or <hi>Hob goblin</hi> came from <hi>Hop.</hi>)</q> This is such another <hi>equiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cation</hi> as the
former. <hi>He doth not say it!</hi> But it seems to be <hi>implyed.</hi> Yet who said he did? Who
charged him with being out in his <hi>English deduction?</hi> Not Mr. <hi>Hobs!</hi> Not the Epistoler!
They quarrelled with him for making <hi>Empusa</hi> to come from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not for deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Hob-goblin</hi> from <hi>hop.</hi> But this would give occasion for a <hi>digression</hi> that might

That is, he did neglect the <hi>true God,</hi> and would not attribute effects to him, that is, <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie</hi>
him in his actings, but ascribed them to <hi>Obs,</hi> and found out such persons as did
not only attest from <hi>hearsay,</hi> but pretend a <hi>knowledge</hi> and familiarity with those <hi>Obs:</hi>
this may be intimated in the <hi>Greek</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though perhaps the Hebrew be not so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant.
Yea, the Doctor might have argued out of Scripture, that it was not lawful
to converse with Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> since <hi>Obs</hi> were prohibited of old: such reasonings are
found in his <hi>thesis.</hi> There may also have been some allusion to that <hi>incessus deorum</hi> of
which I spake afore: and our Country-men may have attributed to their <hi>Gods</hi> one <hi>gate,</hi>
and to their <hi>Goblins</hi> another made up of <hi>going</hi> and <hi>hopping,</hi> which is to <hi>Hoble</hi> along,
and thence might have come <hi>Hob-goblins,</hi> i. e. <hi>Hoble-goblins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second place, the Doctor observes that though <hi>Empusa</hi> had many shapes, yes
Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in that excellent Epistle to the Earl of <hi>Devon-shire</hi> prefixed to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
philosophy) confines himself to one, which had <hi>indeed</hi> two legs, <hi>the one of brass,
the other of an Asse,</hi> (as not only Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> but <hi>Aristophanes</hi> informs us) Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
had no reason to mention any more at the present, and I do not see why he should
have been impertinent, to instruct the Doctor the better.</p>
               <p>But the Doctor saith, <q>Empusa went but upon one leg, as appears by the places
(though I should have cited more:) from whence, as most agree, it took the
name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is very considerable that the Doctor is never so far exhausted, but that there are
more allegations <hi>(equally pertinent!)</hi> which he could have cited. So he told us in
<hi>tanquam;</hi> so in <hi>adduco:</hi> though the same motives that made him blot his copy, so much
as he did before it was printed, might have induced him to omit a number of passages
which he suffered to remain. <hi rend="margQuotes">Again I would fain know, what those <hi>places are, from
whence most agree, it took the name.</hi>  I</hi> told him in the letter, that all depended upon
that one place of <hi>Aristophanes. I</hi> would he had been so <hi>willing,</hi> as I presume he is <hi>able</hi>
(for he <hi>knew of more</hi>) to inform me: for all the Authors he named refer to this <hi>one;</hi>
but as I must condole the loss <hi>Philology</hi> received when the Doctor silenced his pen as
to those additional quotations, (<hi>viz.</hi> out of Doctor <hi>Davis, Thomas, Iunius</hi> and <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke,
from whence,</hi> that is, <hi>from the passages in whom</hi> Empusa took her name) so I fear
the reader will question my <hi>candour,</hi> that will not trust the Doctor in those places which
<hi rend="margQuotes">he had particularly consulted, and sound them to express or imply the same derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The first place he here insists on is at large set down in the letter: but that the
Doctor may learn how it is not enough to <hi>consult</hi> a place, unless he <hi>understand</hi> it, I shall
put my self and the reader to the trouble of a review—<gap reason="foreign">

the Doctor sees more in the text then I do; but his notes infer more. <hi>What?</hi> That

                  </gap>, and if the <hi>Geometry professour</hi> will not grant me this, I believe

I would the Doctor had Englished this passage, I profess <hi>I</hi> do not finde the Doctors as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
couched in these words: It had been but fairly done, if after my excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Scholiastical inference in the letter, he had informed me in his <hi>rejoynder,</hi> of
somewhat more then I had expressed therein, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, what is the English of that?
<hi>Some say,</hi> but what is that to the Scholiast of <hi>Aristophanes?</hi> Doth he <hi>say it?</hi> Doth he
<hi>allow</hi> of it? He neither <hi>approvers,</hi> nor <hi>disallows,</hi> but <hi>relates</hi> it. If then his allegation
amount to any proofe of what the Doctor sayes, he must lay down this maxime, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
any man reports as from another man,</hi> (without the least interposition of his own
judgement) <hi>that he allows of,</hi> and <hi>asserts.</hi> But so doth this Scholiast in the derivation
of <hi>Empusa: Ergo.</hi> Doctor <hi>Wallis</hi> was scribe to the <hi>Assembly.</hi> But further I am of the

unserviceable in war, or active employments in peace. I could almost <hi>divine,</hi> that
he <hi>(the Scholiast)</hi> seems to expose the <hi>Etymologists</hi> for their <hi>whimsies</hi> in derivations,
that should offer to deduce <hi>Empusa</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because she went once upon <hi>one leg,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whereas there are as many <hi>inducements</hi> for my Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
as there are <hi>shapes</hi> she appeared in, (which is fair <hi>odds</hi> against the Doctor) and
one more which is the analogy with the antient statues of the Gods, and the solving of
the Authors sense, which cannot be justified if the Doctors minde hold; for to what
use should that <hi>other</hi> leg seem? It is further dubitable, whether that same <hi>brasen leg</hi>
were continuous with the body of <hi>Empusa,</hi> or no? If not, then she had but one leg,
and so was (when in that shape) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet went upon <hi>two, viz.</hi> the <hi>additional</hi> one
of <hi>brass</hi> also. Now that it was, or could be continuous, is a question to be disputed in
another place: there being <hi>natural philosophers</hi> that assert, that when a <hi>bough</hi> withers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tree, it ceaseth to be a part, and to be continuous therewith. But take it either
way, it is but <hi>aequivocè membrum,</hi> and thefore t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ough I should grant that she were called
Empusa from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet it would not follow that she <hi>went upon one</hi> only, or <hi>hopped.</hi>
As for his additional of what he could have cited, I shall tell him of better; that is of
<hi>Favorinus,</hi> who transcribed the Scholiast, and <hi>Hesychius:</hi> (besides <hi>Suides</hi> and <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus,</hi>
whom I advised him of in the letter) <hi>Hesychius</hi> sayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which makes as much for him as doth the Scholiast
of <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> who bringing neither reason to confirm the others saying, nor avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it himself, ought not to be any way entitled to the <hi>owning</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Then follows a digression about <hi>Riders</hi> dictionary: it was a matter of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at first, but now I shall consider what our <hi>Divine</hi> sayes about it. <q>I might have
added another book, which <hi>I</hi> do not know how to call; should <hi>I</hi> call it <hi>Rider's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionary?</hi> you would tell me <hi>Holyoke</hi> made part of it; should <hi>I</hi> call it <hi>Holyoke's,</hi> others
would say Doctor <hi>Gray,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> mistake not, and some others with him, have added al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as much to <hi>Holyoke,</hi> as he had done to <hi>Rider,</hi> and digested the whole anew,
and the book so digested is that <hi>I</hi> mean: whether what I cited out of it were in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyoke's</hi>
edition or not, I do not know, otherwise then that <hi>I</hi> am now told, it is in an
appendix of <hi>obsolete</hi> words; the book that <hi>I</hi> intended to cite, hath it in the body of the
<hi>dictionarium Etymologicum:</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> was loath to call it Dr. <hi>Grays dictionary,</hi> for fear it
should not be understood what book <hi>I</hi> meant. <hi>I</hi> cited it then by the name of <hi>Rider,</hi>
because the first title-page intitles the book to him, and the rest as an appendix.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He knows not how to call it! Why does not he? Is not the name prefixed <hi>HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYOKES
dictionary?</hi> Will he not allow it the benefit that other books have, to be
called by the names they bear? Did <hi>any,</hi> at least did ever the <hi>vogue</hi> of the people ascribe
that piece to Dr. <hi>Gray?</hi> Was it ever printed under his, or any other name? Because I
censured you for calling it by a <hi>wrong</hi> name, should I therefore have quarrelled with
you if you had named it <hi>aright?</hi> I did not charge you for citing <hi>Scapule,</hi> where the work
was <hi>Stephens?</hi> I did not. I let <hi>Calepine</hi> pass, though his be all stollen, and hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
now as great an accessional, as ever <hi>Holyokes</hi> did. <hi>Doletus ex Marii Nizolii, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomei

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35292:25"/>
he did the other, I should not have found fault with him. And so in the citing of any
book I allow it what title the frontispice gives it: for then I know and so may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
know where to look, and not blunder as I did betwixt <hi>Rider</hi> and <hi>Holyoke:</hi> and
at last I met with a different edition from what the Doctor used. Mine had the <hi>obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete</hi>

of editions; as also, how I let <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Holyoke</hi> (though it to be confessed, that
where they both agree, the latter did but transcribe the former) pass for <hi>two,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a censure, so that the Doctor needed not have been so fearful; but that he was
sensible of his being out, yet would seem to say <hi>something.</hi> In the last edition: <hi>Rider</hi> is
but an appendix to <hi>Holyoks,</hi> so saith the title page of <hi>A. Greeks</hi> edition: but the
<hi>binders</hi> do often <hi>transpose</hi> the books, which gave <hi>occasion</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to the Doctor
to say the <hi>greater</hi> was <hi>added</hi> to the <hi>lesser,</hi> and that <hi>Holyoke</hi> should perfect <hi>Rider,</hi> and so
make his own work an <hi>accessional</hi> only, whereas he <hi>assumed</hi> the other meerly to <hi>compleat</hi>
his own.</p>
               <p>Of his <hi>many</hi> Authorities he instances in on more, though he might have transcribed
them out of my letter: only talks idlely.</p>
               <p>But all these Authorities are nothing worth with this epistoler. <q>
                     <hi>Calepine is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,

               </p>
               <p>I am very sorry to hear the Doctor relinquish <hi>reason</hi> for <hi>bare Authority;</hi> I confess <hi>I</hi>
do not know the validity of <hi>man</hi> above <hi>man</hi> further then he must derive from his <hi>reason:</hi>
doth the Doctor think there is <hi>Magick</hi> in <hi>names,</hi> so as the <hi>most letters</hi> or <hi>syllables</hi> should
prevail against the <hi>fewer?</hi> Or doth he ballance men in the scales, and so take them not
for intrinsique <hi>value,</hi> but <hi>weight?</hi> If so, I believe he that shall weigh Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> by the
<hi>stone,</hi> will not give him that respect which his own <hi>opinitivity</hi> will assume. I know not
why <hi>Authority</hi> should sway more in <hi>Philology,</hi> then <hi>Divinity:</hi> I cannot believe the whole
Assembly of <hi>Divines,</hi> nay all the <hi>Divines</hi> in Europe can outsway by their <hi>authority</hi> my

conversed in languages:) and questionless the <hi>strangeness</hi> and <hi>uncouthness</hi> of the word or
<hi>name,</hi> was thought to contribute much to the procuring a <hi>reverence</hi> and upholding the
<hi>majesty</hi> of the <hi>deity.</hi> I do but therefore applaud my own sentiments, when I commend
that observation of that <hi>eminent Antiquary,</hi>

                  </q> Which single remark were a sufficient confutation of all the
Doctor hath brought against me in this case: against whose derivation I should not
have brought Grammatical objections, had he produced such grounds as I have for
mine. I objected (having <hi>refuted</hi> his authors, or <hi>nullified</hi> them) <q>It is <hi>strange</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</q> If the Doctor had read this confiderately, he could not but have
observed how <hi>timorously</hi> I spake: and had I not sufficiently evinced my own deduction,
and shewed the invalidity of his grounds, I should never have cast this into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
which I would have looked upon as <hi>over-weight,</hi> and not as put into the Scales
to <hi>counterpoise</hi> ought of moment on the other side. I said <hi>it was strange:</hi> I said <hi>I</hi> could
<hi>hardly believe</hi> it <hi>admittable:</hi> neither the one, nor the other saying implied a <hi>positive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal.</hi>
I have been alwayes of that opinion, which afterwards I found to be confirmed
by <hi>Selden,</hi> and the judgement of others not inferiour to him in <hi>philology.</hi> The Doctor
replies, <q>The former of the two (which he slighteth in comparison of the other) I
confess hath some appearance of weight; yet not so much as to carry the cause: for
the <hi>Etymologicus,</hi> you see, who takes notice of it, can yet pass it over, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
and the rest could not be ignorant of it,
yet none of them do upon that account reject it: and you know well that the Greek
doth in some derivations, compositions, and otherwise change the spirit: as in <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>I see it is not possible for the Doctor and me to agree, I confess I did slight that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the <hi>change of the aspiration,</hi> not upon those trifling cases alledged by our <hi>Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Caninius,</hi> which have nothing of parallel, and the last whereof I do not understand;
it is very likely his printer can mistake too, and that may be in the book, which <hi>was</hi>

tedious to reckon up. But another thing which was most urgent with me, was, that
I knew those <hi>aspirations</hi> were of late addition, and of a much newer standing then the
<hi>common dialect,</hi> being the invention of <hi>Grammarians</hi> (I mean as to the <hi>writing</hi> of them)
upon the declining of the Grecian learning: as for the pronunciation, it was different
in several territories, that which <hi>aspirated</hi> in one place was <hi>tenuated</hi> in another: <hi>et vice
versâ,</hi> so that the exception against the <hi>non-aspiration</hi> could be of no validity, unless it
could be proved that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was alwayes <hi>aspirated,</hi> and (which is more) that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>ramed in place where that <hi>aspiration</hi> was so used: which that it was not, nor could
be universal in Greece, both <hi>natural</hi> reasons, and <hi>records</hi> make <hi>impossible,</hi> the common
dialect was an extract out of all those scattered dialects of Greece, and had so much of
<hi>Greek</hi> in it as to be (for the most part) understood every where: as our ordinary Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
phrase is apprehended all over England, though the same be differently <hi>pronounced</hi>
not only as to the <hi>aspiration</hi> and <hi>levigation,</hi> but <hi>sound of letters,</hi> and more differently

to <hi>universality,</hi> regulates it by his own <hi>ear, use,</hi> and custome of such as he approves of,
(which is not to approve of them, but himself) and hath been conversant with. Thus
I have given an account of the causes why I put no greater <hi>stress</hi> upon that objection,
which the Doctor thought to be of some importance. I come now to his <hi>examen</hi> of
what I secondly objected not as <hi>impossible,</hi> but <hi>dubious</hi> and <hi>suspicious,</hi> and <hi>hardly</hi> (when

of the Greek tongue will bear it? A very little skill in Greek would have been
able to rectifie such a <hi>gross</hi> mistake. And he can never with any face <hi>pretend</hi> to be a
Critick, who doth not know it. Me thinks that either Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> or that <hi>third person</hi>

suffer such a <hi>childish</hi> business as this to pass both their hands uncorrected. And

helps it very little, for such a conclusion is much more allowable in Greek, then that

copy of <hi>Tully,</hi> he cites <hi>im memoriam,</hi> &amp;c. for in <hi>memoriam,</hi> &amp;c. from all which I think I
may infer that though the Greeks had 16, or 24. letters (that matters not at present)
they had more sounds, then letters: and [in <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Delos</hi>] in particular, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had a different sound according as the letter following (whether in the same, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
word, so it were contained within the same <hi>clause,</hi> and to be pronounced in the
same breath) was different.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that where the words were not pronounced in the same breath, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by an <hi>imaginary</hi> comma, or the like, (for <hi>real</hi> stops and pauses they had
none) that then the <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>letter</hi> were not varied, as appears every where in the
<hi>marmora Arundeliana,</hi> and especially in the two last examples rehearsed, where you
have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> follows,

                  </gap>, and if that change be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
observed, I suppose it may have happened, because that since neither <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thirdly, I infer, that the reason did not concern only <hi>composition,</hi> but extended to

it could not be written or pronounced before <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the
same clause coming before <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> did not sound <hi>full,</hi> as it did before <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but had a

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and therefore if the Doctor meant that it was <hi>impossible</hi>
for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to come before <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and retain its <hi>full</hi> English sound, I do grant it: but so it could
not come before <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as well as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Fourthly I infer, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> might be written before <gap reason="foreign">

being the same reason, if they were within the same <hi>clause</hi>) though not altogether so

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (because the sound was more like that of <gap reason="foreign">

which reason will be <hi>well,</hi> if the terms <hi>uno pede incedere</hi> be <hi>equivocal.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> then
did him no wrong in <hi>Englishing</hi> it so; no more then I, who cannot understand that <gap reason="foreign">

refer to <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and if he hath <hi>ill translated</hi> him, am I accountable for his <hi>errours?</hi>
but the mistake was on the Doctors side, for <hi>Rhodiginus</hi> used a term that might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the <hi>gate</hi> of the Gods, as well as the <hi>footing</hi> of men. <hi>Et vera incessu patuit

               <p>Dr. <hi>W.</hi> 
                  <q>But how I should wrong <hi>Iunius,</hi> in taking these words of his, <hi>altero pede in

nor am likely to do till he can finde out a possible meaning of those words. And
when he hath so done, I will see <hi>what I can pick out of the Dutch.</hi> For though I do not
profess my self a Dutch man, yet so much Dutch I have as to understand that <hi>Hincken</hi>
in high-Dutch, and <hi>Op cen been springen,</hi> in low-Dutch signifie the same as <hi>to hop</hi> in

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35292:31"/>
Thus the Doctor changeth the controversie: <q>I said he had grosly wronged <hi>Iunius,</hi>
and imposed upon his readers, if he did not finde in the <hi>Dutch</hi> (for the Latin hath no
such thing) that <hi>Ludus Empusae</hi> was the boyes play of <hi>fox to thy hole.</hi>
                  </q> I gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Iunius's</hi> words, which I desire may be read over again: that both the <hi>Latin</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> did signifie <hi>to hop</hi> I know; but whether they signified the play of <hi>fox to thy
hole,</hi> that I knew not, and desired a better expositour then the <hi>German</hi> I asked. That
which <hi>Iunius</hi> saith will agree to <hi>Ascoliasmus,</hi> or any play that consists in <hi>hopping:</hi> and
consequently what <hi>Iunius</hi> said doth no more make for <hi>fox to thy hole,</hi> then <hi>Scotch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hop.</hi>
I would say more to this paragraph, but that I do not understand well what it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
requires of me, when he expects that <hi>I finde out a possible meaning for those words of
Iunius.</hi> Either he or the printer are in a fault here; or <hi>did not the printer print it thus,
because he had so written it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Parenthesis</hi> ought not here to be left out: <q>He doth not know well how a man can
go upon one leg without hopping.</q> The question is concerning the <hi>gate</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and he talks how <hi>men</hi> go: just as if I should argue, (as I do not, but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)
<hi>I do not know well how men can see without eyes, Ergo God sees with eyes.</hi> I do not

But all this doth not give him cause to say that <gap reason="foreign">

they were <hi>simply</hi> all one: but that in the <hi>places cited</hi> they were so: which is but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

brought by way of exception against the proofe Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and I brought for such
acceptation of the word.</p>
               <p>My argument was this, <q>that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was descended from <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which signified <hi>to
marks</hi> with an hot iron, or the like: therefore such <hi>originally</hi> must be the signification
of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and though we had
no examples of such use of the word, yet the reason was not thereupon to be denyed,
but by him who could thinke that no word hath lost it's right signification, and is
used onely (by the Authours we have, although neither the Doctor nor I have read
all them) in it's Analogicall signification.</q> This I shall not now doubt to call (as
