            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Paper delivered and diſperſed by Sir <hi>William Killigrew.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y reaſon of the many greater Affairs in Parliament, the Bill for perfecting the Earl of <hi>Lindſeys</hi> Fens, hath not yet found a time to be read: by which unhappy delay the ſeaſon of this yeer is neer ſpent for works of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if the work begin not till next Summer, the profit of that yeer muſt be alſo loſt. By this unhappy delay alſo new Obſtructions are now raiſed againſt this publick work; For I am credibly informed by ſeveral perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the people have been lately invited and incouraged at <hi>Boſton</hi> to come up in great numbers to make new clamors, by telling them that they have a good cauſe, and but few friends in Parliament; that three or four onely ſpoke for them; that when the Vote paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but thirteen were for the Country, and twenty ſeven againſt them; that their Fens would be loſt unleſs they did come generally up to petition; and if that failed, then they ſhould bring up their wives and children to the Parliament door, and there leave them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I do conceive, by theſe invitations and incouragements, many poore ignorant people are perſwaded to ſigne Petitions they underſtand not, and may be did never ſee. And to make the noiſe and clamour greater, many rich men of <hi>Boſton,</hi> with others bordering on the eight hundred Fens, are now come up (who would have no draining, that ſo themſelves with their great ſtocks may ſtill continue to eat out the poor Commoners, and do therefore well to declare in their laſt Friday books, that the poore Commoners have no intereſt in the Fens, but by their Landlords right: which is a pretty preamble to rob the poor people of their Commons, in caſe their deſigne ſhould follow of incloſing all the Commons.) Theſe men alſo are now come up to petition againſt the Drainers, in hope to ſtay the Act from paſſing, thereby to keep the ſaid eight hundred Fens from being drained, and thereby to defraud the State of eight thouſand Acres in that Fens belonging to the late King, as Lord of the Soyle, and Drainer of the ſaid Fen.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to anſwer their railing books given abroad on Friday laſt, becauſe the ſubſtance of the ſame books hath by them been publiſhed long ſince, and long ſince fully anſwered by books of mine: nor much value what their Petition or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can ſay after ſo many yeers hearing, and ſuch full debates at ſo great a Committee, where all the Houſe had Voices; and after a Bill ordered by this honourable Houſe to be brought in to perfect the ſaid draining: for I do humbly conceive, there being no new act done by the Drainers, theſe mens repetition of old clamours fully anſwered, can ſignifie nothing but ſome few mens endeavours to delay the Act, in hope to ſtarve the Drainers while the cauſe depends; filling mens ears with terrours of the peoples diſcontent, as if two or three hundred Riotters, with their Abettors, ſigning a Petition, or as many rich mens coming up with a Petition were the voice of the whole people of <hi>Lincolnſhire!</hi> and as if all <hi>England</hi> did deſire the Fens ſhould not be drained! when as moſt of this Nation do wonder that any ſhould oppoſe ſo generall a good.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I do glory in my part of the merit of this work, becauſe I may ſafely ſay that no work of this nature was ever carried on with a more generall conſent, and applauſe of the moſt eminent Lords, Owners, and Commoners of the Country; or with more equity pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, or leſſe prejudice to any man, or hath produced a greater improvement (I mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to its quantity) nor hath any ſuch work been brought to a greater perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In conſideration whereof, I cannot apprehend that the whole Land ſhall be taken from us; but my fears are, leſt ſome artificiall delayes, or prejudiciall accommodation be found to bring us to ruine, to wit, by recompencing our charge, hazard, and loſſes, which the whole twenty foure thouſand Acres will not now do, nor can the Countrey ever perform it by a ſum of money, though they and we ſhould agree to it. My onely hope is, that the Parliament will think it juſt and honorable to ſettle us by the ſame like Act with <hi>Bedford-Levell,</hi> having the ſame title and merit. In which Act there are proviſoes to meet with, and prevent all miſchiefs and inconveniences which have, or may happen to any perſon concerned in this work of draining. It is therefore a vain thing by Petitions to anticipate the intentions of the Parliament, who intend ſo much their good, if <hi>Lindſey-Levell</hi> be eſtabliſhed by the like Act with <hi>Bedford-Levell;</hi> the profit of theſe works being done, will encourage the draining of all the Fens in <hi>England,</hi> as a high improvement to the publick good of this Nation, and therefore worthy of the Parliaments protection; for which there are arguments enough to convince any opinions to the contrary.</p>
