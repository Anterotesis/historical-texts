            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Drunkard can ſay that he is a good fellow, and ſuche are to be well thought on. The laſciuious Dauncer hath all thoſe colours which in this Dialogue are recited, and many more then theſe, to paynt his dauncing withall, that it may ſeeme to be golde, whereas it is but copper, that it may ſeeme good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is euill, and that it may ſeeme an honeſt recreation, whereas it is inhoneſt, &amp; of all thoſe which will ſeeme to be honeſt, vtterly to be abhorred. And now (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull) as it hath been the cuſtome of all thoſe holy men (which liued in thoſe dayes when thoſe former ſinnes were committed) to pul away thoſe copwebs where with they couered their ſinns, that they might appeare as they were in deede: ſo it behooueth thoſe which liue in theſe daies, to pluck away the viſurs from the faces of their vices whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che raigne in theſe dayes. Which thing I
<pb facs="tcp:12865:4"/>
haue gone about to do (with what diligence I cold) in the laſt vice which I repeated whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was laſciuious dauncing, ſithens it hath pleaſed God here to fore, and euen nowe of late, to ſtirre vp thoſe which haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted whatſoeuer could haue been ſaide in defence of theſe other vices. And though I may ſeem to ſome to haue enterpriced this thing more raſhly then wiſely, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently then prudently, fithens there are a great many which might better haue taken this ſame in hand: yet the cauſes which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me here unto were ſuch, that I thought I had better take this thing vpon me (though I ſhould doe it but ſimplie), then to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, leaſt when all men do ſtraine curteſie, it ſhoulde be left vndone. It is not onely the common ſort of people which doeth render theſe reaſons for dauncing: but it is euen ſome of thoſe which carry ſome credite, and are of great countenaunce, which vſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect as followeth. So that it is to be feared, leaſt laſciuious dauncing in time bee taken for a vertue, where as in deede it is but a vice, as it is nowe a dayes vſed. And nowe (right worſhipfull) the eſpecial cauſes which moued mee to dedicate this my ſimple Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb facs="tcp:12865:5"/>
vnto your worſhip, are two in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The firſt was this, becauſe I ment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (not in any caſe reaching you your duty) to certifie you (in whoſe hande it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this and ſuche like vices in theſe our dioces) howe commonly this lewde paſtime is vſed vpon the Sabboath day, and againe, howe the miniſters of Gods worde are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, becauſe they woulde debarre the youth from dauncing, ſo that it is to bee doubted, that vnleſſe ſpeedie reformation be had, they ſhall vtterly be ſet at nought. To whom ſhall the ſeruant, who hath eſpied weedes in the fieldes complayne, if not to the maiſter whoſe the fielde is? And whom ſhold I rather certify of this thing then you, who hath authoritie to plucke vp ſuche weeds by the rootes. The laſt cauſe, but not the leaſt, which enforced mee to offer vnto you the firſt fruites of my labours, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are he at whoſe handes I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as much as I haue deſired, but more then I haue deſerued. So that I thought my ſelfe bound by duetie not onely to doe this, but alſo to praye vnto God vnceſſantlye for your worſhip, whom I beſeech long to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue you in life and health, and alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew you

               <p>The firſt then of all theſe is this. When as I doe conſider with my ſelfe, with what great good giftes the Lorde God almightie, hath endued man, and eſpecially, howe he hath giuen vnto him a Pilote moſt prudent, to gouerne him vppon the ſurging ſeas of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, which is euen reaſon, howe hee hath giuen vnto him all thinges whiche are neceſſarie for this preſent life, how he hath made him lower then the Angels to crown him with maieſtie and honour, how he hath giuen his only ſonne Chriſt Ieſus to die for man, that man might bee deliuered from eternal death &amp; deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; howe he hath ſuffered him to be ſet at naught, to the ende man myght bee
<pb facs="tcp:12865:10"/>
bought, howe hee hath ſuffered him to be payned that man might bee gayned, how he hath ſuffered him to be ſcourged, that by his ſtripes man might bee healed, howe he hath ſuffered him to be accurſed, that man might bee deliuered from the curſe: ſo often doeth it make mee ſobbe and ſigh, to ſee howe vngratefully man doeth behaue him ſelfe towardes ſo kinde a father. Agayne, when as I come nigher home, and looke rounde about me in this our Countrey of <hi>Ailgna,</hi> and doe well waigh with my ſelfe with what bleſſings the Lorde hath endewed vs aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, and howe wee by our lewde and wicked liues doe more diſhonor him, almoſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any nation vnder the ſunne:</p>
               <p>It maketh me to burſt out into bitter teares, and to bewayle our great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe. What nation vnder the heauens hath taſted of thoſe bleſſinges whereof wee haue had great abundance, or vnto what countrey in all the world hath the Lorde been ſo fauourable, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this of ours:</p>
               <p>The heauens are not made vnto vs as braſſe, nor the earth is not vnto vs as Iron: but the cloudes droppe fatneſſe and

               <p>Our oxen are ſtrong to labour, and our ſheepe bring foorth thouſandes, and tenne thouſandes, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. There is no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into captiuitie, neyther any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning in our ſtreetes, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. Wee haue a prudent Princes, a gracious Queene, a godly Iudith, a chaſt Suſanna, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Heſter, a diſcreete Debora, which theſe foure and twentie yeeres hath iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Iſrael with equitie and right, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. We haue ſage Senatours which take counſell at the worde of the Lorde in all their interpriſes, and do nothing without the warrantize thereof, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. The Lorde himſelfe is our defence, and the God of Iacob is our protectour, and yet beholde more bleſſings then theſe. We are but an handefull in reſpecte of all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet all other nations ſtande in awe of vs, becauſe we are in ſafety vnder the ſhadowe of the winges of the Lorde,

               <p>The ſecond thing which turneth my melodie into mourning is this: becauſe I ſee ſuch negligence in a great many of Magiſtrates (I had almoſt ſayde in all Magiſtrates) that ſinne is left vnpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:12865:11"/>

The adulterer braggeth amongſt his companyons, that although he haue watched all night, yet in the morning came he to his purpoſe: and ſo maketh hee no conſcience of ſinne, but is rockt on ſleep in the cradle of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. The Papiſtes lie hiſſing like a ſnake vnder the greene herbes of curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous countenaunces, and there is no man to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flight, ſo that the godly may ſtyll looke when they ſhall bee ſtunge. The extorcioner wreſteth and wringeth, to the ende he may augment his gaines. The rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtretcheth himſelf vpon his bed of euorie, hee eateth the fatteſt of the flocke, and the calfe out of the ſtall, hee drynketh wyne in bowles, and

And are theſe all the abhominations whiche are to bee founde in <hi>Ailgna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> no, no: there bee thouſandes more then theſe. Our Sabbothes are prophaned, the worde of God is obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed, the preachers thereof are ſhamefully abuſed, and yet beholde more abhominations then theſe. The name of God is blaſphemed, Maieſtrates are diſobeyed, good lawes are violated, and yet beholde more abhominations then theſe. Ahab will haue Naboths vineyard, becauſe it is good to make a Garden of herbes thereof. The rich man will haue the poore mans poſſeſſion, becauſe it lieth in his way, and the couetous man will not ſuffer the needie to dwell nigh him,
<pb facs="tcp:12865:12"/>
becauſe he can not abide the ſmell of his ſmoke, and yet behold more abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then theſe. Our faſting is tourned into feaſting, our mourning into mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, our praying into playing, our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes deedes into all miſdeedes. High and lowe, rich and poore, one with another are lulled on ſleepe in the bedde of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and no man thinketh on the day to come. But it fareth with vs as it did with the men of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> for as they did not thinke vppon the time of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, vntill they were ſwallowed vp of their enemies: no more do we thinke vpon the iudgementes of God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſinners, god grant we may not taſte thereof as they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>In this you bewraye your groſeneſſe and ignorance, that you will ſay you cannot tell what: You will ſaye that dauncing is a good recreation when as you knowe not what recreation mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. But it appeareth that this bolt whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you haue already ſhotte, came neuer out of your owne quiuer, Recreation is a ſeconde making, or a making agayne of that thing which was once made, and by a metaphore we call it a refreſhing of that thing which is wearied with muche labour, (if it be applyed vnto the body): but if it be applied vnto the mynde, wee ſay it is a renewing of the minde beeyng worne with much labour &amp; ſtudie, greate cares, and vnmeaſurable ſorrowe. This definition being thus ſet downe, I come to that which you haue ſaide before, and I will firſt proue (if God ſhall aſſiſt mee) that dauncing is no recreation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſecondely that it is no recreation of
<pb facs="tcp:12865:16"/>
the minde. If dauncing were a recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the bodie, then ſhoulde it refreſhe the ſame beeing wearie, it ſhoulde make nimble the ioyntes, ſtrengthen the legs, make ſoft the feete, and finally, it ſhoulde bring the bodie beeing out of temper, into good temperature: but it doth none of all theſe things, therefore dauncing is no recreation for the bodie. My maior propoſition is certayne and ſure, for it is grounded vpon the definition of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for the minor it is no harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for mee to proue it, ſithence common experience doeth tell vs that it is true.</p>
               <p>For dauncing is ſo farre from refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body being weary, that it maketh the ſame more wearie. For I haue hearde tell of thoſe whiche haue daunced one halfe day for pleaſure, and haue laide in bedde two whole dayes for payne. Cal you this a recreation? if this be your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation much good eate you with it, I will none. I doe omitte to ſpeake howe many haue beene lamed with dauncing, which in their youth haue bin ſuch daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that they were able to leape ouer logges, but in their age haue ſcante been
<pb facs="tcp:12865:17"/>
able to ſteppe ouer ſtrawes. I will not ſay what incurable diſeaſes haue riſen in many mens bodies, through the extreame heat wherinto they haue caſt themſelues in time of dauncing. I neede not to tell what agues &amp; ſhakings men haue caught by dauncing, ſo that they haue almoſt hin vndone by it: and yet for ſooth dauncing is a good recreation for the bodie. What leauines, ſleepines, and ſiuggiſhnes doth dauncing procure: Howe many mens ſeruauntes being ſet to woorke, do after their dauncinge dayes lie ſnorting in hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe they are ſo weary that they cannot worke: Whereby their maiſters doe reape but ſmall gaynes. If mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (eſpecially thoſe which haue daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to their ſeruauntes) did well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with them ſelues what great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities doe ariſe vnto them by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes dauncing, they woulde giue the miniſtrels money to hold their peace faſter, then the dauncers woulde giue them money to pipe, and yet they ſhoulde be no leeſers by it at the yeeres ende.</p>
               <p>But nowe will I prooue in a woorde or two that dauncing is no recreation for
<pb facs="tcp:12865:17"/>
the mynde. All Philoſophers do graunt this in generall, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>temperatura animiſe, quitur temperaturam corporis: <hi>that the temperature of the minde, doeth folow the temperature of the body.</hi>
                  </hi> Whiche wordes doe ſerue very much to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of your poſition. For if ſo bee it the bodie be made ſluggiſh, and ſleepie with dauncing, and altogether vnapt to doe any thing, (as I haue before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proued) then muſt the minde needes bee brought into like caſe. So that you ſee, that whereas you ſaide that dauncing was a recreation both for body &amp; minde, I haue proued it to be neyther a recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the bodie, nor yet for the minde.</p>

               <p>When a man hath kept the firſt part of the fourth commaundement, which is this, that hee muſt labour all the whole ſixe dayes, and doe all that he hath to doe, let him keepe the ſeuenth day whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the Sabboath day holy, vnto the Lorde. That is, `let him reſt from bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour, and let him attende vnto Gods heſtes, let him behaue him ſelfe as a true Chriſtian ought, and as it becommeth
<pb facs="tcp:12865:18"/>

               <p>Yes truely both of them, for firſt and foremoſt it is a great recreation to a wearie bodie to haue reſt, for as the olde prouerbe goeth: <hi>Feſſum quies pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum inuat, <hi>reſt is no ſmall helpe to a wearie man.</hi>
                  </hi> And truely this reſt he ſhall haue, if hee keepe the Sabboath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to gods holy will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Againe (if you doe well remember) I ſayde euen nowe, that that doeth recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, which maketh it more apt and able to do that which it ought: And truely reſt doeth this. For as we do vnbende our bowes when as they haue bin long bent, to the ende they may ſhoote more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when as wee doe bende them againe: ſo laboring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſome reſt to their bodies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go to worke againe, they may both bee ſtonger to labour, and alſo endure longer. As for the mind, who
<pb facs="tcp:12865:19"/>
ſeeth not that it taketh great recreation by keeping the Sabboth day aright.</p>
               <p>And to the ende I may better proue this to bee true: let vs briefly conſider what ought to bee the exerciſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vpon that day, wherein hee reſteth from bodily labour. He muſt repayre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, where all the faithfull are gathered together, to offer vp their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, euen that ſpirituall ſacrifice which is ſpoken of by the prophete Dauid in the 50. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> Which is prayſe, prayer, and thankeſgiuing. This done, he muſt ioyne with them in prayer vnto the Lorde, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp cleane handes towardes the holy heauens, where dwelleth God, euen the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Then muſt he giue eare vnto that whiche is red and taught by the miniſter, he muſt heare, marke, and learne, ſo much as he poſſiblie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If opportunitie ſhall ſerue, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacramentes of the bodye and blood of our Sauiour Chriſt, and that woorthilye, and thankefully.</p>
               <p>Hee muſte meditate vppon that which hee hath hearde, when hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <p>Who ſo doeth theſe thinges, ſhall no doubt haue his minde wel recreated. For when a man is wearied with ſinne, when hee ſeeth death &amp; deſtruction before his face, due vnto him for his ſins, (whereby it commeth to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he is euen ſwalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp of ſorrowe,) what greater ioy can chaunce vnto him then to heare out of the woorde of God, (whiche is redde euerye: Sabboath) theſe ſweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes,</p>

muſt be ſuche a maner of reioycing as is ſpoken of by the Prophete <hi>Ieremie</hi> in his ninth Chapter, where bee induceth the Lorde himſelfe, ſpeaking on this wiſe: <hi>Let not the ſtrong man reioyce in his ſtrength, nor the wiſe man in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor the riche man in his riches, but let euerie man reioyce in this, that he knoweth me to be the Lorde, which do equitie, iuſtice, and iudgement.</hi>

               <p>If you remember your ſelfe, you promiſed to lay ſuch groundworkes for dauncing, as ſhoulde bee ſufficient to vpholde the ſame: but you haue here ſet vp ſuch a couple of ſhoores to ſtay daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as I do thinke will make me ſweat before I ſhall ſhoue them away. Your firſt ſhoore or ſtay is the lewdenes of the multitude, the ſeconde, the negligence of
<pb facs="tcp:12865:25"/>
Church wardens and ſworne men. You haue nowe payde it home. Well, haue a lifte at your firſt ſhoore, which is this, dauncing is vſed euery where, therefore is it lawfull for you to vſe the ſame. It is written in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2. That wee muſt not followe a multitude to do euill. Which place maketh much againſt you, becauſe you ſee that it is no ſufficient excuſe for vs when we doe euill, to ſaye the multitude doeth ſo: and doubtles to daunce as wee doe daunce in theſe dayes is euill, therefore muſt we not daunce, becauſe the multitude daunceth.</p>
               <p>If your reaſon which you bring were ſufficient to defende dauncing, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God ſhoulde haue dealt very vniuſtly with the men of the old world in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their ſinnes which were moſt horrible, becauſe there was not one of them which coulde not haue alleadged for him ſelfe, that they ſinned euery where.</p>
               <p>If your defence were ſtrong inough, then ſurely the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> had great wrong, for they might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
<pb facs="tcp:12865:25"/>
one of them haue ſayde for him ſelfe that their ſinne was vniuerſall, and did reigne in euery corner and ſtreet of their citie. If your poſition might ſtande for a principle, then ſurely Moſes did the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites great wrong to breake the tables of the couenant, becauſe they committed Idolatrie, for all of them might haue ſaid that they did eate and drinke through the whole hoaſt, and when their panches were well ſtuffed, they ryſe vp to playe.</p>
               <p>They might haue ſaid generally, that they conſented to turne their glorye, into the ſimilitude of a Calfe that eateth hay. They might haue ſayde, that with one mynde and one mouth, they badde <hi>Aaron</hi> make them gods of ſiluer, and gods of golde, to goe before them, for as for that Moſes, which brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Egypt, they knewe not where he was become.</p>
               <p>If your reaſon were ſounde, why did the Lorde plague <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> for Idolatrie, for their ſuperſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition, for their abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for without doubte they coulde haue ſayde that it fared ſo euery where.</p>
               <p>But this was no ſufficiente ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for them, but the olde worlde
<pb facs="tcp:12865:26"/>
was deſtroyed with the diluge of water, the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were brent vp with fire from heauen, the Iſraelites were ſore plagued, &amp; <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> came to a ſhamful ende, this notwithſtanding that their ſinnes were committed euery where.</p>
               <p>No more can we alledge for our ſelues, that dauncing and laſciuiouſnes is lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe it is vſed euerye where, for it is contrary to the will and woorde of God as were all their ſinnes, wherefore that ſhoore beginneth to ſhake. It is not ſufficient for vs to doe that whiche other men doe, vnleſſe they doe that whiche ought to bee done. Wee muſt not doe that which is done, vnleſſe that bee done which God hath commanded to be done. Therefore away with that fooliſhe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which men doe vſe moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make when as they are reprehended for their faults, <hi>they doe ſo in all places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When as God had by a mightie hande and ſtretched out arme, deliuered his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (euen the ſonnes of Iacob &amp; Ioſeph) out of the lande of Egypt, hee ſtraytelie commaunded them, that they ſhoulde not doe as they had ſeene the Egyptians do,
<pb facs="tcp:12865:26"/>
neither ſhoulde they doe according to the<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 3</note> cuſtomes of the lande of Canaan, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went to poſſeſſe it: but they ſhoulde do according to his iudgements. Thou ſhalt not doe that whiche ſeemeth good in thine owne eyes, but do that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiche I commaunde thee. Uppon which wordes, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Iewes, ſayeth thus: Of a trueth, that whiche is done according to the will of God, although it ſeeme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant: yet is it altogether pleaſant and acceptable in the ſyght of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, whatſoeuer is done beſide the woorde of God, and otherwiſe then hee woulde haue it done, though it bee as a thing acceptable to God: yet it is of all other the worſt and moſt wicked. Out of all which places wee gather this, that though dauncing or any other exerciſe whatſoeuer, haue bin vſed neuer ſo long. or thogh it be vſed in neuer ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: yet if it be contrary to the worde and will of God, and forbidden by the ſame, it is deteſtable, and of all men to be eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p>My reaſon then is this. We are commaunded by the worde of God, to vſe ſobrietie, therefore we are forbidden by the woorde of God, to vſe laciuious dauncing. I proue it thus. Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any vertue is commaunded, all vices whiche are contrary to that vertue are forbidden: as for examples ſake, when men are commaunded to practiſe libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

they are forbidden to vſe couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or to embrace prodig al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tie, and when we are commaunded to loue trueth, we are commaunded to hate and deteſt theft, &amp;c. Therefore when as we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vſe ſobrietie, wee are forbidden to vſe laſciuious dauncing.</p>

And againe, in his 48. hom. he ſaith, thou ſeeſt mariages, but thou ſeeſt no dauncing, for at that time they were not ſo laſciuious as they be now a dayes.

As it is lawfull to ſing, and we doe vſe ſinging to giue thankes to God, and to celebrate his prayſes: ſo alſo by a moderate dauncing, wee may teſtifie the ioy and mirth of the minde. Such a kinde of dauncing was that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the maide us did vſe, when they did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate with ſonges and daunces the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of Dauid ouer <hi>Goliah.</hi> Suche a kinde of dauncing was that which Myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am the ſiſter of Moſes, and other women did daunce, when as they ſung a ſong of victorie after that Pharao and his hoaſte was drownued in the ſea.

For their daunces were ſage &amp; ſober, but yours are light &amp; laciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: their daunces were milde and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

               <p>Which thing is intollerable, becauſe that, that thing is an intiſer and prouoker unto wantounes and luſt. <hi>Myriam</hi> the ſiſer of Moſes; daunced not with young men, but a part by her ſelfe amongſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

And this is to be noted that your diuell doeth alwayes leade the daunce.</p>

Yet this I ſay, that they are altogether ſo vayne, that the godly may pray thus, and vſe theſe wordes of the Prophet Dauid, when ſoeuer they bee deſit ous not to ſee maygaimnes, <hi>Turne thou away mine eies (O Lorde) leaſt they beholde vanitie.</hi>

               <p>Good Lorde is the winde in that doore nowe? this is a marueilous ſodayne chaunge. I haue knowen the day when as you haue been as great a dauncer as the beſt of them, and when you woulde haue gone as farre to ſee a may game as another man, and are you become ſo ſober nowe? the Prieſt hath quite forgotten that euer he was clarke.</p>

               <p>This is your laſt refuge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you haue to flie vnto, you are almoſt vpon the ſuddes, you are now in a maner at a non plus. When as you are out of matter, you beginne to rayle, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to me the lewdnes of my former life. In deed it is acommon cuſtome amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:12865:41"/>
men, to obiect vnto thoſe which haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken vice, and be taken them ſelues to vertue, what thing ſoeuer hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in their life paſt, nothing regarding what they are nowe: but yet hereby men doe ſee howe greatly they bewray their fooliſhnes. Shoulde not hee haue beene accompted a dolte, which would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Paule</hi> the faythfull preacher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſometime been <hi>Saule</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere perſecutour? Shoulde not hee haue been worthily taken for a noddie, whiche ſhoulde haue reiected Matthewe the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Euangeliſt, becauſe hee had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time been an extorting Publicane.</p>
               <p>And ſhould not he haue beene thought a verye foole, who finding in thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable pſalmes of Dauid, ſinne repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and vices reprouid, ſhould haue alſo replied thus:</p>
               <p>Hee needeth not ſo much to finde fault with theſe vices, the time hath bin, when hee him ſelfe was both an adulterer, and a murderer?</p>
               <p>Was Peter neuer good afterwarde, becauſe hee denied his maiſter once?</p>
               <p>Was Marie Magdalene neuer honeſt,
<pb facs="tcp:12865:42"/>
becauſe ſhe had ſomtime plaid the whore? And now whereas you aſke me this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether dauncing be woorſe nowe then it was when I did vſe it, I anſwere, that it was as euill then as it is nowe, but yet it did not pleaſe God ſo to open mine eyes then, as he hath done nowe, that I, might ſee mine owne follie. Sinne doeth ſo blinde the eyes of men, that they cannot ſee when they doe euill. It is not my vſing or refuſing of dauncing which maketh it good or euill: but the ſeeing of the vanitie therof then, and the ignorauce of the ſame then, made mee thinke that it was then good, and maketh mee nowe thinke that it is euill. Take mee as I am, and not as I haue been. A tree whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath ſometime borne euill fruite, may beare good, if his head haue been cut off, and a newe grafted in his place. A man that hath bin ſome time a vicious perſon, may become a good man, if this heade of vice be cutte off, with the two edgged ſworde of Gods worde (which pearceth betweene the bones and marrowe) and the good graftes of vertue bee grafted in
<pb facs="tcp:12865:42"/>
his place. The leapar is ſounde after hee is cleuſed. And though Naaman the Aſſyrian his fleſhe was through lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie as white as ſnowe, yet hauing waſhed him ſelfe ſeuen times, it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine like to the fleſhe of a young childe: ſo, though the ſoule of man bee neuer ſo filthy and fowle through ſinne, yet if ſhee waſhe her ſelfe by earneſt repentauuce, and a ſtedfaſt faith in the blood of Chriſte Ieſus, ſhee ſhall bee cleane.</p>
               <p>And nowe <hi>(O Iuuenis)</hi> that I may turne my talke vnto thee, thine owne conſcience telleth thee howe lewde a life thou haſt hitherto led, howe frowardely thou haſt behaued thy ſelfe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God.</p>
               <p>What great delight haſt thou taken in blaſpheming the name of the moſte higheſt: ſo that thou haſt thought it the beſte qualitie, and greateſt ornamente that a young man coulde haue, to rappe out othes one in the necke of another, for then diddeſt thou thinke thy ſelfe halfe a gentleman, when as thou couldeſt ſwere ſo luſtilie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12865:43"/>Againe, thou haſt thought the Sabboath day neuer better ſpent, then when thou haſt riſe vp earely in the morning to toſſe the potte, to bibbe, to ſwill and daunce til night. Howe diſobedient a minde haſte thou alwayes borne towarde not onely thy naturall parentes, but euen all thoſe whiche haue authoritie ouer thee? With what filthie concupiſcence hath thine heart been fraughted, and howe deſirous haſt thou been, to haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which was none of thine owne: Theſe are no ſmall faults <hi>(O Iuuenis)</hi> but they are ſuch offences as doe prouoke the moſt higheſt vnto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Theſe are not <hi>parua pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia,</hi> but they be <hi>maxima peccata,</hi> they be not <hi>minor ſinnes,</hi> but they are euen ſuch tranſgreſſions as do pull downe the heauie wrath and vengeance of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads. Therefore (good <hi>Iuuenis</hi>) let it be ſufficient, that thou haſt behaued thy ſelfe wickedly heretofore. Redeeme the time which thou haſt lewdly let paſſe, amende that thing which heretofore hath been amiſſe. Flatter not thy ſelfe in thy ſelfe, and ſay not with thy ſelfe, I am but young, and I ſhall liue many
<pb facs="tcp:12865:43"/>
yeres, and I will repent when I am old, for why, thou art vncertayne howe long thou haſt to liue: Thou ſeeſt as well the young as the old go to graue like flockes of ſheepe. Againe, repentaunce is not in thine owne handes, but it is the good gift of God. Hell, death, and damnation are prepared for the impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after this life, &amp; in this life great plagues remayne for the vngodly, as ſaith the Pſalmiſt.</p>
               <p>Incourage not thy ſelfe to ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou ſeeſt that the Lorde doth ſpare thee: for as the Lord is mercifull, ſo there proceedeth wrath from him, and bee thou well aſſured, he will wounde the heirie ſcalpe of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtyll in his wickednes. Lay thy hande vpon thy heart, and caſt thy countes afreſhe. Awake out of ſleepe, and ſtande vp, and the Lorde ſhall giue thee light. Put off the olde man, and put vpon thee the new man. Caſt off the woorkes of darkenes, and put vpon thee the armour of light. Take heed, for there remayneth for impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners, a worme that gnaweth the conſcience: and there is prepared for the wicked, fire, whiche neuer goeth out:
<pb facs="tcp:12865:44"/>
where is horrour, terror, weeping, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wringing of handes, gnaſhing of teethe, continuall death, yet thoſe whiche are there doe neuer die.</p>

and God coulde not haue ſeene mee, If I had committed the ſame in the darke: but nowe I ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſeeth as clearely at midnight as at noone day.

Now do I perceiue that, that is true whiche you ſaide euen nowe, namely that the word of God is like a two edged ſword, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che pearceth betweene the marrowe &amp; the bones. Oh what ſhall I do? now may I run vp and down vpon the face of the earth, as did Cain, for often times haue I in heart murdred my brother at foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.
