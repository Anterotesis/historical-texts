         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Regulated Monarchy. <hi>page</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. If this Government be a mixture of all theſe, and a
Regulated Monarchy; then it is a fond thing with us to talk of an
Abſolute Monarchy, and what an Abſolute Monarch is, or may
doe. And it is only the language of Flattery that holds ſuch
Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>2 It need not be counted a Soleciſme (as ſome would perſwade
us) to ſpeak of Free Subjects in a Monarchy, ſuch a Monarchy as
ours is.</p>
            <p>3 If this Government be a mixture of all three, then the Houſe
of Commons, the Repreſentative Body of the People, muſt needs
be allowed a ſhare in Government (ſome at leaſt) which yet is
denyed, <hi>page</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>4 If this Government be a mixture, then is not the Government
according to theſe Lawes, Solely Truſted to the King, as ſeems
to be affirmed <hi>page</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>5 If the Government be Regulated, why do men tell us that the
King is above all Law? for it is by Lawes that he is Regulated.</p>
            <p>6 If the King bee Regulated by the Law, then is the King Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to the Law, and not to God only, as men would make
us beleeve.</p>
            <p>7 If the Monarchy or Regall Authority it ſelfe bee Regulated,
then whatſoever is done by the King, undeniably without and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the limits of that Regulation, is not <hi>Regall Authority.</hi> And
therefore.</p>
            <p>8 To reſiſt the Notorious Tranſgreſſions of that Regulation, is
no Reſiſting of <hi>Regall Authority.</hi> And</p>
            <p>9 It is ſo farre from being a Reſiſting of the Ordinance of God,
that it is not ſo much as Reſiſting the Ordinance of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> 5. By whom was this government framed in this ſort? or who
is to be accounted the Immediate Efficient of the Conſtitution thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Experience aud Wiſdom of your Anceſtors hath ſo
moulded this, <hi>page</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. If our Anceſtors were the moulders of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155928:3"/>
then the King hath not his power, Solely, or Immediately,
by Divine Right.</p>
            <p>2 Much leſſe hath he his Power or Authority by Right of
Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>3 But the Immediate Originall of it was from the People.
And if ſo, Then—</p>
            <p>4 In queſtioned caſes, the King is to Produce his Grant (for
he hath no more then what was granted) and not the People to
ſhew a Reſervation; For all is preſumed to be Reſerved, which
cannot be proved to be granted away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 6 Is this Regulated and mixt Monarchy, as good as an Abſolute
Monarchy, or better, or worſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Excellent Conſtitution of this Kingdom, (the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
Equall, Happy, Well-poyſed, and never enough Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Conſtitution of the Government of this Kingdom. <hi>page</hi>
17.) hath made this Nation ſo many years both Famous and
Happy, and to a great Degree of Envy. <hi>page</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 7 How comes it to paſſe that this Conſtitution is ſo Excellent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Experience and Wiſdom of your Anceſtors hath ſo
moulded this, out of a mixture of theſe, as to give to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(as farre as Humane Prudence can provide) the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of all three, without the Inconvenience of any one <hi>p.</hi> 18</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Then thoſe that would place in the King, an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and Abitrary Power to do what he Liſt, are Deſtructive to the
Nations Happineſſe, and Enemies to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>2. If this Mixture cauſe this happineſſe, then it is not the
Greatneſſe of the Kings Power over his People, but the Reſtraint
of that Power that hath made this Kingdom famous and Happy;
for other Kings have Power as large, but not ſo much reſtrained;
which Largeneſſe of their Power hath Raiſed thoſe Kings indeed,
(but not their Kingdoms) to a great degree of Envy.</p>
            <p>3. Hence we diſcern, that it is Poſſible for Kings to envy their
Peoples Happineſſe, becauſe the largeneſſe of the Peoples Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
depends much upon the Reſtraint of the Kings Exorbitant
Power.</p>

            <p>2. Therfore alſo it is ſafer to Reſtrain the King of ſome Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <hi>Q.</hi> 10 What is the Good or Conveniency of Ariſtocracy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The good of Ariſtocracy is the Coniunction of Councells

            <p>2. The King himſelf, when once his Subjects by having loſt
their Liberties ſhall loſe withall their Courages, will prove the

without the Inconveniences of any one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In this Kingdom the Lawes are Ioyntly made by a

what is meant by the Power and Priviledges of Parliament, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Proteſtation, which hath been ſo generally made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the Kingdom? There is no Reaſon to doubt but thoſe
things which the King grants afterward, to be the particular Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of each Houſe, and of both, are their certain Priviledges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Law, and the Conſtitution of the Kingdom; and to the
maintaining of them every one that hath made the Proteſtation is
moſt ſtrictly bound, without peradventure or ſhift.</p>
            <p>2. That the Priviledges which the King challenges to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
are to be yeelded to, onely ſo far forth as they are conſiſtent
with the Acknowledged Priviledges of the two Houſes; becauſe
the Monarchy being Acknowledged to be a Regulated Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,

               <hi>Q.</hi> 15 What Priviledges doth the King chalenge to himſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Government according to theſe Lawes is truſted
to the king: power of treaties of warre and peace, of making
Peeres, of chooſing Officers, and Councellors for State
Iudges for Law, Commanders for Forts and Caſtles; giving
Commiſſions for raiſing men to make Warre abroad, or to

but by what hath been noted before, and follows after, it is to
be underſtood only ſo, as not to prejudice the Priviledges of the
Houſes of Parliament, ſpecially in caſes of Neceſſitie, (of which
hereafter.) Alſo—</p>
            <p>2. It is acknowledged here, that the Government, Truſted, is
to be according to the Lawes, and ſo all theſe Things are not Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
in the King; as for inſtance, <hi>Pardons,</hi> the Law denies
Power of Pardoning wilfull Murther; And Benefit of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations
belongs to ſome Private Lords of Mannours.</p>
            <p>3. If Government onely according to Law be truſted to the
King then to Reſiſt Notorious Illegall Violences is not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the Kings Authority.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>2. Whoſoever counſels the King to any Thing againſt the

by Attempting to turn him from that which is the end of

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That the Prince may not make uſe of this High and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall

            <p>

and not upon the King (as we ſhall ſee by and by.)</p>
            <p>2. We need not wonder then why Private <hi>Favorites</hi> and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi>
are ſuch Enemies to Parliaments and their Priviledges,
which are on purpoſe to hinder their gains: Of which alſo more
anon.</p>
            <p>3. The two Houſes are by the Law it ſeems, to be <hi>Truſted,</hi>
when they Declare, that the Power is made uſe of for the Hurt of the
People; and the Name of <hi>Publike Neceſſitie</hi> made uſe of for the

            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> 18 What are the ſpeciall priviledges of the Houſe of Commons
towards this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Houſe of Comm<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

more carefull for the Subjects Liberties, then either the King, or
the Houſe of Peers.</p>
            <p>2. Then it muſt needs be ſtrange for any to conceive (as the
Kings Declarations would Perſwade) that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
would Fight againſt and Subvert the Libertie and Propriety
of the Subject, and the Kings Favorites and Followers Fight for
them, and Protect them.</p>
            <p>3. Then no Moneys may be Levyed, neither for Peace nor
Warre, no not under Pretence of <hi>Publike Neceſsity,</hi> (as Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money

it muſt Needs have ſome Power in ſome Caſes to Levie

Intruſted toward the Conſerving of Liberty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> With the Impeaching of thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who for their own Ends
though countenanced by any ſurreptitiouſly-gotten command
of the King, haue violated that Law, which he is bound (when

<hi>page</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Then it is no Excuſe to any that Violate the Laws, that
they <hi>ſerve the King</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>2. The Law counts all Commands from the King, which are
any way contrary to the Law, <hi>Surreptitiouſly-Gotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Then the Parliament ſpeaks according to the Law, when
they conſtantly lay the Blame of all violations upon the Kings
<hi>Favorites</hi> and <hi>Followers,</hi> and their getting Surreptitiouſly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
from him, and not upon the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>4. No Command of the King is to hinder the Commons
from Impreaching ſuch as have violated the Law.</p>
            <p>5. The King is bound not to Protect any of his Followers and
Favorites againſt the Commons Impeachment of them; becauſe
he Knows and Affirms, that he is bound to Protect the Laws, and
that this is the Law, that the Commons are to Impeach ſuch.</p>

the King and the People.</p>
            <p>

Execution, as well as to Impeach and Iudge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The power of puniſhment is already in your hands accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Law, <hi>page</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Then again it is no wonder that the Kings <hi>Favorites</hi> and
<hi>Followers</hi> hate Parliaments, (who not onely Hinder their Gain, but
have Power to puniſh them) when they have violated the Laws.</p>
            <p>2. Then the Lords (and much more the two Houſes together)
are ſupreme Judges of all matters in Difference between the King
and the People, and have Power to Prevent all the Kings En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
upon the People, as well as the Peoples upon him.</p>
            <p>3. Then the King is Bound not to Protect any whom the Lords
upon the Impeachment of the Commons, have Judged Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents;
For he hath granted that he is bound to Protect the Law,
and that according to Law the Power of Puniſhing (even of his
Favourites and Followers, 'fore ſpoken of) is in their hands, and
they cannot puniſh them, ſo long as he Protects them.</p>
            <p>4. Then the Law Allows them as the Supreme Judicatory (even

which is granted to all Inferiour Judges in their Circuits and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions.</p>
            <p>5. Then if thoſe Delinquents get the King to Protect them, or
ſurreptiouſly get Commands of him, to Raiſe Arms to Shelter

Houſes have Power by the Law to Raiſe not onely the <hi>Poſſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus</hi>

if need be; or elſe the Power of Puniſhment is not in their

ſcorning and oppoſing the higheſt Iudicatory, the Parliament,
then any Inferiour Court, a Judge of Aſſize, or the like: and they
that could get Commands to Violate the Law before,
would eaſily get Protection againſt the Parliament when they are
Queſtioned, if the Parliament had no Power to Raiſe Arms to

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 22. But if there be an Attempt or Danger, that the Kings Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Followers go about to change this Regulated Monarchy into an
Arbitrary Government, and ſo into a Tyrannie, is there Authoritie in the
Houſes ſufficient according to what was ſore mentioned to remedy this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Power Legally Placed in Both Houſes is more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Then at leaſt what ever Power is Neceſſary to Prevent
or Reſtrain the Power of Tyrannie is confeſſed to be Legally pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in both Houſes; for elſe there is not Power ſufficient, much
leſſe, more then ſufficient.</p>
            <p>2. Then it is Lawfull for the two Houſes to Raiſe Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves in caſe an Army be Raiſed againſt them, for elſe
they have not Power ſufficient to reſtrain the Power of Tyrannie:
There is no Greater Attempt of Tyrannie then to Raiſe Arms
againſt the Houſes of Parliament, and there is no way to Reſtrain
this Tyrannie, but by Raiſing Arms in their own Defence: Leſſe
then this cannot be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>3. If a Legall Power be placed in them, not onely to Reſtrain,
but <hi>prevent the power of tyrannie,</hi> then they are the Legall Iudges,
when there is danger of Tyrannie; and they have Legall Power to
Command their judgement to be obeyed, for Preventions as well
as Reſtraint of <hi>Tyrannie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Then it is Lawfull for them to provide for their own and the
Kingdoms ſafetie, and they have Legall Power to command the
People to this purpoſe; not onely when Arms are Actually Raiſed
againſt them, but when they Diſcern, and accordingly Declare
a Preparation made towards it: for if they let alone altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of their Power, till Arms are <hi>Actually</hi> Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

not onely to <hi>Prevent,</hi> but even to <hi>Reſtrain the Power of Tyrannie.</hi>

Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> as are Intended, or likely to be Intended, to
