         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not to be moderate, and to disswade from Vice by

               <p>THat as there have been men from
the beginning, so have some of
them affected prevalence and priority,
and thereby accumulated Power, Wealth,
and Fame to themselves and their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is not to be doubted: for that
not only the Holy Story, but even the
light of reason, carries us towards, and
confirms us in, the belief of it: And in
that <hi>Moses,</hi> who had so fair advantages,
and so much skill to manage them to his
own greatness, and his Families advance,
did not pursue and improve them to a
settlement of the Government of <hi>Israel</hi> in
his children &amp; their descendants, but yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and propagated it according to the
appointment of God; we are to admire a
self-denial &amp; integrity in him paramount
to them, whose worldly prudence it is,
first, as much as they can, to make, then
to take, advantages, and those subacted
to them, to apply to the Majo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is then no doubt but as domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and subjection are <hi>Aboriginal,</hi> so
the effects of it in familique as well as
personal distinctions is very ancient: for
as nature dictates perpetuation of ones
kind, by apt conjunctions of Male and
Female, so doth she also include therein
the beneficial consequences of it, and
accordingly composes herself to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of them. Thus she visiblizes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Circumactions of Providence,
in the hazzards of Courage, in the toyls
of Government, in the vicissitudes of
Commerce, in the abstrusities of Science,
that by the good voyages issuant from

and kindness of it.</hi> But this is a large
sense of Families, and would require a
vast force of Fancy and pains to man the
lines and outworks of its circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That only notion of Families which
is commonly understood to be branches
from one stock, is that which is the family
I treat of.</p>
               <p>And certainly there is nothing has
been more the care of wise and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
men to raise and confirm in honour
and reputation then their Name and
Family. That is, not onely their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and their off-spring, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
collateral, whom by lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and nations they accounted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
heirs; which appears not onely
in the qualities men of great minds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to attain, and by them to be
notable and requested, but from the
suitable improvements that they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102653:17"/>
the conspicuity of their parts about.
For as they do invigilate themselves
that their amorous or rash follys doe
not precipitate their after preferment:
so having well married do they caution
the wel-breeding of their children, that
fitted they may be for imployments and
favours of respect and augmentation.
Thus of old we read that the Patriarchs
as they chose for themselves Wives wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
their piety and love, so did they
to their sons present Wives, and them
married, placed in courses of life labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and supportive; upon which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
they laid all the superstructure
of their after happiness and thrift. This
after ages imitated them in, &amp; while they
saw themselves more then ordinarily
mortall in their issues, they either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
none, or such as concluded in
their sex the nominal perpetuity of
them, they made provision for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity
by assumption of Nephews and
Kinsmen, or by adoption of daughters
children,<note place="margin">Totius familiae interest ne quis ex ea vel in servitutem de. ducatur vel sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiose damno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que dignitatis vivat. Ferrerius ad legem 195.</note> which I best like, into their
name; and so investing them with what
fortune and honour they had in their
power: so great a zeal to the prosperity
of blood, name and relations is there in
a generous man, that as their glory is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102653:17"/>
his delight, so their dislustre is his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hence has it been ever the study
of brave men to promote their kindred,
and to resent their disobligements as
unkindnesses done to themselves. Nor
is there any more sure sign of a Noble
soul, then this of endeavouring to know
and improve the prosperity of his line
and kindred, yea, and of his friends too;

detriment the world in their loss. This

degree they take in this Liberal Science

good subjects, good Fathers, good Masters,
good Common-wealths-men: For Vice is

without diminution of credit, or fortune;
for wisdom being the understanding of

men by and beyond them; Frugality,
which is the wisdom of living without
excess, in any Inordinacy, must be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

self-mastery and practical wisdom.</p>

but to be admired for his diligence, and

and daily is seen, the unhappiness of some
Worthies whom God keeps low, that they

may by their indiversion hatch the eggs of
their discovery, and publish their excellent
endowments; but yet for all this, Callings
are to many, and the most, supportive:

though God is in the Generation of

When the children of wicked men, as the
generation of his wrath,</hi> Jer. 7. 29. <hi>shall be
cut off,</hi> Psal. 108. 13. Yet is this promise
of benediction and advance to good men,
to be expected fulfilled by those grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of providence by which God brings
the mighty things of the World to pass
above &amp; beyond the probability of second
assistances: and if God intend good to
men in worldly regards, he will excite in
them desires to comply with his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the predispositions to it, which
are personal, as well as concur with them
in purveying for their acceptance in, and
season of exhibition and reception: And
therefore I do highly commend parents,
if not first to provoke their children to
take all possible and attainable useful
breeding, yet, when they themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

not to deny it them: For I do not know

The violences of power, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses

Princes, the grindings of the poor, by
unreasonable gain, and unjust surprises;
the over-reaching of men in bargains;
the Cormorant enhansing of Markets and

their insinuation into secrets, and then
falsifying trusts by menace of disclosure,
and the bribes they obtain to be silent;
the exposures of themselves to serve the
pleasures of Greatness, and to merit of
them the protection of their power, to
oppress their inferiours. These and other
the like tenebrious designes of gain and
preferment, are the Idols they worship, the
Altar they bow down before, the Oracles

'Twas He, and he alone, that carried <hi>Moses</hi>
his obscurity, by the various forms and

Chair of their Estate and Majestique ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
'Twas not <hi>Iosephs</hi> innocence
that would have opposed and evicted
lust, malice, falsness, cruelty, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
them to their shame, and his glory
and vindication; but that God carried
them beyond their natural motion
to his mark, <hi>Iosephs</hi> exaltation. 'Twas
not <hi>Davids</hi> beauty and victory that would

the relation of Marriage, brings men
to, is the instance of God not willing the
contrary, but in spight of the storm of
second causes, obstetricating the calm of
his own work and glory. Hence come
the smooth gales in the sayls of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
the condescensions of hills to the
proportion of valleys, the reduction of
roughs to their plainness of correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
with the design of God. Thus
comes rude and bloody <hi>Esan</hi> to be civil
and unmurtherous; and the eager nature
of <hi>Saul</hi> to become tame to the yoak of

was wont to boast, that all his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
were pitiful obscure Priests, and had
no descent; nor was the See ever honoured
with a Gentleman Bishop before he came
into it; God met with the Atheism and
pride of his heart, for on a certain night
he dreamt he was officiating at the Altar,
and that he saw one resusing his service,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102653:65"/>

the consuming nature of Idleness,
and the dammage and defamation that
attends it. Which <hi>Petrus Blesensis</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
to an excellent Schollar, and once
his Pupil, who had a mind to be Priested,
but was loath to part with the pleasures

upon him the yoak of Christ. To study
self-ease, and to wallow in idleness, <hi>is to
chak vertue, nourish pride, and furnish the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102653:75"/>
soul for Hell.</hi> This the holy Ghost seconds, in
the severity he expresses against Idleness,
<hi>Ezek. 16. 49. Behold, this was the iniquity
of thy sister Sodom, Pride, Fulness of bread,
and abundance of Idleness was in her, and
in her daughters;</hi> and because she fed
high, and was at ease, therefore was she
filled with beastliness, which nothing but
a fire from the Lord could consume. Which
made St. <hi>Paul</hi> account it a deed of the flesh,
and caution young widdows to beware
it, lest they come within the lash of those
who learn to be idle, wandring about from
house to house, and thereby come to be
talkers, and busiebodies, speaking things
which they ought not, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12, 13.
Yea in that idle souls shall suffer hunger,

bread of Idleness, <hi>ch. 31. v.</hi> 27. And our
Lord laies it as a crime in the Parable,
<hi>Why stand ye here idle?</hi> Matth. 20. 6. It
may be concluded, that Idleness is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of all turpitude, and they that are
idle will be every thing that is mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous:
for the mind is a quick and spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
part of man, active on something,
which, if not good, will be bad, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between them no medium; for he
that is not imployed in good, will be soon
the tenant of sin, and the vassal of vice:

               <p>SIxthly, unfortunate Marriages are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
of Men and Families: For this is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102653:79"/>
the dismall inquisition, whereinto whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is brought, by his lustfull or impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

and too much leaning to their own selves,

sees the light of a happy day, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

overwhelmed in those cares and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that are parental of, and prefatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to, unrescuable bonds, and merciless
contempts. Now, because I have laid so
heavy a charge on unfortunate marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
it will be necessary for me to discover
what I understand by <hi>unfortunate.</hi> For,
though unfortunate is unfortunate in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
notation and accept, yet every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
marriage may not fall under
the pungency of the censure in the full
of what is thus expressed; though in some
considerations of time and persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to it, and in some degrees under
the capacity of it. Far be it then from
me to think every unequall marriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
because then I shall make more
unhappy marriages then I fear are happy;
the most marriages of young persons, or
those unknown in dispositions either to
other; or those unequal in years, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
complexion; or those the regen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

wherein are advantage: being the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102653:79"/>
of friends, the prevalences of interest,
not the fruit of choice, being in this sence
unfortunate. Nor doe I under the term
of unfortunate reduce those marriages
where every good vertue is present,
though not commended by a suitable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
which to some persons is useless,
they having enough before, and so happy
enough, that they have the opportunity
to oblige and eminentise a person whose
worth wants only their addition to make
it Honourable or Worshipful; No such
thought have I in this term unfortunate;
nor do I think religion, beauty, modesty,
wisdom, thrift, courage, constancy, less
then counterpoises to any money or land
fortune, with which they are not alwaies
presential; God not ever, if often lading
all his blessings in one vessell, but disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them, that every one might have some
largess of his love, and some Magnetique
to draw the exchange of love to it. Nor
is merit less then valuable, if it suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the greatest temporal diminution;
nor do brave spirits adheare to Crowns
less, because they are set upon rotten posts,
but stand most fixedly to them, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their homage to, and courage for
those divine endowments, are not so
much the hopes of preferment, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102653:80"/>
of love. Not in this sence then
is unfortunate to be alwaies, or by me
understood. But by unfortunate I mean,
unfit,<note place="margin">Matrimonia inter valde dispares infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissimos exetus habere solent. Sanches de ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimon Sacram. lib. 1. disp. 12. 11. p. 37.</note> improper and unsuitable marriage,
where men and women suit not each with
other, but are in their marriage like two
perfect contraries, pugnant with, opposite
to, displeased at, inharmonious in, their
conjugality. So true is that of <hi>H.</hi> 5. to his

                  <note place="margin">Holinshed, p. 726.</note>

though I think it not alwaies a sure rule
to build infallibility upon examples, God
not walking alwaies in the same path of

to all marriages of like nature; but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
various events of good and evil to
them. Nor are we concern'd in events,
which is his peculiar, and subject only to
his jurisdiction, our duties and credits
being responsible only to the prudence of
our actions, not the issues of them, which
are above us. Yet is it highly important
to use all discretion, that the truth and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102653:80"/>
vehemence of love, and a due dependence
on Gods ability to bless us above all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
advantages, will permit in our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
and that done (with as little
alloy to the freedom of our choice, as
possible can be) to refer our selves in that
estate, and the consequences of it to
God. Thus no doubt did that vertuous
Lady Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> wife to <hi>H.</hi> 5. and
mother to <hi>H.</hi> 6. who took to her husband
<hi>Owen Teuder,</hi> a gallant brave Gentleman,
whom she loved,<note place="margin">Holinshed, p. 615.</note> and under the blessing
and bond of that marriage produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other children the renowned <hi>H.</hi> 7.
the glorious Ancestor of our now graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soveraign, whom God has made the
second Uniter of all the Roses and flowers
of peace and plenty in this Nation.</p>
               <p>The state of marriage then being foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in a mutuality of corporal and soulary
complyance, containing in it the warrant
of all intimate knowledge, and natural
mixture of kindness, If the irritation to
such familiarity and honest sensuality be
not from the complacency of fancy &amp; the
imperation of kindness often obcaecating
judgment, wherby the body and soul each
of other are inseparably united in an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of indivision, all the content, vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and matrimonial confidence recedes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102653:81"/>
and becomes lax and disloyal; yea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, marriage is so far from a remedy
that it proves the meetest repository,
and safest colour of all imaginable lust.
Yea, and the nest of all brawles and
open dissociation. Thus was <hi>Iane Shore</hi>
disposed to the enamourings of E. 4. For she
was young, given to pleasure and pomp;
which her husbands calling not well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
not yet suiting with his godly
temper, whose delight was to be in his
calling, and intent upon that; she, I say,
disliking him for this, so opposite to her
way, and having no fixed affection to him,
forsook his counsell and advice first,<note place="margin">Holinshed p. 724.</note> then
his company, then her own conscience in
the checks of it, and at last wholy waved
him, as he unwillingly did her. And so
her excellent endowments heard ill while
she lived, and she ended miserably her
ill chosen life: And where the Honour is
preserved, the best effect of unequal
matches is discord and unpleasancy; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by occasion of accidents, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled

And those Parents and Friends
that decry the libery of treats and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity
of freedoms, between Men and
Women, had best consider, whether it be
not the consectary of their over-ruling
pleasure, upon their Children and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils:
for nothing is more the fosterer of
stollen love, then the anticipation of real
love to persons beyond just, valuable,
and religious exception. Nor is there
any thing that will sooner and with more
contentful efficacy restrain the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of women, who bring the Matron
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102653:82"/>

to do more then they otherwise would;</hi>) then
by the resolution that they see sober men
have to avoyd them, and to oblige La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of more self-denial and modesty.
Nor will men persist in such vanities, if
they see it is distasteful to women, from
whom no preferment is hereby like to
befall them. The permission then of
love to runne in its own channel, and the
non-obstruction of power in its free and
natural course, is that which I esteem
the best expedient to rectifie the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of marriages, and to render them
(with other moderate accommodations)
Fortunate. Nor will it be any hard task
to perswade a well-bred woman to stay
at home, look to her houshold-affaires,
and observe her husband,<note place="margin">In Menone, p. 409.</note> which <hi>Plato</hi>
makes a womans virtue, if such husband of
hers be beloved by her, keep at home
with her, and be obliging as a wise man
should be to her. For without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
<hi>sine qua non,</hi> love, which is
grounded upon likeness of humour and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102653:83"/>
proof of constancy, I conclude little
fortunateness in the promise of any Match:
For though to some persons who are not
touched with the vertue of love; nor
have any sense of it in marriage fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then negative, or in non-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
whose ayms are Wealth, Friends,
settlement, though they admit all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities
and discouragements of a more
generous nature, so their avarice or
popularity be gratified. Though, I say, to
these deliberate Lovers, whose love is not
onely not stronger then death, but wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
then water, and overcome by the
dirt and pelth of money, and money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
All Matches that are rich, and
accomplishable of design, are fortunate,
and as they think prove well; yet to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whatever marriage is not affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
religious, and symmeterious, can
never be accounted other then unhappy,
and often destructive to the body, soul,

Whereby not only is Gods purpose aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive

The best ingenuity and artisice of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

mens in the effects of his power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

causes flow freely, the winds and waves
of opposition become calm and still. Thus
good men in all ages have had their ends
upon the World; though it hath set it
self against them, and execised all cruelty
to them: Witness the Primitive Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
in which though the bodies of holy
men were trucidated, and their credits
and fortunes plundered from them by
the malice of the Gospels adversaries;
yet, maugre all their vehemence, whose
interest it was to make the credit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
creditless, and the professors of
persecuted Truth, vile; yet those dry

would see their childrens children, to

to accomplish these attainments, then to
comprecate Gods ayd and blessing. This
is to be wise with a witness, with the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

there in times, as byassed by men regents

Estates, (which were the Estates of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

and undiscovered, such as were old men,
widows, and Bachelours, and some other,)
in the great years of Trade, from 1630. to
1640. were in request, men desiring to
keep their Estates such, because they
made one third part more profit by them
then they did by land Estates of the same
value; (the Warrs coming on, and those
Estates being out at Intrest and in Trades,
trusted into several parts beyond the Seas,
and into this Nation, wherein the late
unhappy Wars made Garrisons of Towns,
and in the taking and re-taking of them,
Merchandise and Staple goods portable,
became plunder'd by those, and such like
courses, those Personal Estates of very
great value, became wholly lost, or in a
very great degree mutilated, and so the
Owners of them that way impoverished,
unable to be afterwards, either Traders
or Increasers, or to give great Portions

is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. Which

                  <hi>nor that it is the root of some, but of all evil;</hi>
and he confirms it from the Apostatique
<hi>Effect of it, which while some have coveted,
they have erred from the faith, and pierced
themselves thorow with many sorrows.</hi>
Which is Emphatique also, <hi>While some; not
while all.</hi> God has his Jewels amongst
rich men, who use the world, but abuse it
not; who have money, but love it not;
that is, commit no sinne to accomplish their
end, as Apostates and Seducers do, who
have been so besotted &amp; transported with
it, that they have, for the conveniency
and glory of it, <hi>erred from the Faith,</hi> made
a revolt and defection from the Church;
and not only wandered, as Gods people
too often do, but persisted desperately in
that errour, which Gods people do not.
This the inordinate love of money leads
into, and therefore is by all that love and

which is remarkable in them. Thus <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>

daughter, then his Generalship, and at

be further instanced in, because a truth
of every daies ratifying, is the reason that
the Wise man informs us, that <hi>he that seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good, procureth favour,</hi> Prov. 10. 27.
Which I take not so much to be meant
of Favour, as the consequent of goodness,
as the opportunity to seek good for a
mans self, and others also for whom he
that is favoured interposeth. Hence those
passages of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 14. 35. <hi>The Kings
favour is towards a wise servant.</hi> And <hi>ch.

as God shall permit their pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to method to themselves, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected

not crazy, but hayle and happy
in their Princes favour; then which there
is no speedier way to Rise, Riches, Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Prelacy, Splendour, and Endowments
of all kinds, possible to be imagined: for
though Riches, Industry, and Frugality,
give many rounds to the ascents of men;
yet the Master Caper, and the Noblest
Capreol to advance, is the Kings Favour:
which as it is too full a blessing for any
but a Magnanimous and Royall minded
person to disgest, and well manage; so to
such as already have, or hereafter may
have it, I beseech God it may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and enlarged; for it is an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to serve God, the King, the people,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102653:99"/>
and the havers, to all beneficially Noble
purposes: it being (under the King) the
spring that moves all; without which
nothing runnes currant, but has cheques
too many to pass by, as is evident in the
vivid representation of it in <hi>Haman,</hi> who
is said to have his seat (set by <hi>Abashuerus</hi>)

Ver. 2.<note place="margin">Esther 3.</note>

servants should bow before him; and his
word so prevail'd with the King, that he
gave him his Royal Signet, and said, The
Silver is given to thee; the people also, to
do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</hi>
Ver. 10, 11. and what <hi>Haman</hi> issues forth
is dispatched to the Kings Lieutenants, to
be accordingly executed, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, 13. In
that, I say these are the bounties of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to their Favourits, from whom they
seem to withhold nothing, but the Throne
it self, there is great cause to conclude,
That no way to advance Men and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
is more expedite and energical, then
Service to, and Favour from Princes. <hi>For

of death,</hi>

whose frown and word has killed the
heart of subjects of courage, who durst

joy and freedom is in the Kings favour?

               <p>And therefore, since it is not boldness,
but love to the prosperity of Good and
Great Favourites, that invites me to
write upon this head; the only Rock that
Favour hath to fear, is from Gods jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that any thing should rival with him

that promotion, as it is from him, so ought
it wholy to revert to him, in fruits suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

they leave him, by forgetfulness of him

and in this thus variated, confirms them.

is hardly to be drilled into the beliefs of
those boysterous spirits that are the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago's

Gods inclination of great mens wills to
favour them, and of his adaptation of them
to their favours, without which those
bounties would be unsavoury, and the
soul and spirit of them evaporate, and
become ineffectuall to their hoped for
ends, is to bespeak them to prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,

madness and bigottry. They are all for
gay cloaths, spruce looks, high rants, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetious

to, as to Gods permission so to have it,

and religion, it shall have my Godspeed

               <p>FOurthly, Callings of Imployment to
mind and body are now great Rises of
Men and Families, by the Honour and
Wealth that attends them: For, <hi>England</hi>
being an Island, and by Trade made a

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102653:106"/>
being brought into it, and the men of all
Countries coming unto it: by reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Learning, Law, and Tillage of the
Natives is wonderfully encouraged. For,
by such Entercourse and Exchange of the
mutual Endowments of Nations, which
God has purposely so modelled, that the
tide of Charity might be reciprocated,
and benefit Mankind in the variety of its
movency to them, there is no Ingenuity
practised abroad, but has a means of ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
to us, and no thrift or improvement
that we make, but has its vent abroad; by
both which, the Nation has its Profit in
the imployment of its Inhabitants, and in
the multiplication of its Shipping. This I
premise to make way to the rich and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</p>
               <p>effects that Learning and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
first introduced by Trade,
doe evidence now beyond what formerly
they did; for, whereas when Trade was
less, and People fewer, and those less vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
because less knowing in the vices of
other Nations, the transactions civil, and
the cures corporal, and so the Lawyers
and Physicians required to them were not
so numerous, so esteemed, or so thriving;
now, in the multiplication of Trade, and
luxury, by the traffique with, and travel
into them, room is made for more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102653:107"/>
and better Entertainments of Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Physicians; and the more they
get, the better they thrive, and the richer
all Callings that those vent themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Though therefore there are no arts,
callings, or wayes of life, but have, and do
yield Estates and Honours to those that
are industrious, and fortunated by God in
them: and more especially the noble, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
and copious Study of the Imperial
Laws, the practice of which by the learned

now as great Oracles of Learning, as I

beseeming the Noblest Men, is a way to
acquire Estate and Honour; yet because
the Rises of Persons in Callings are not so
great; nor so general, as those of Law and
Trade are: I shall single out those two,

For the Laws, I mean the Common and
municipal Laws of this Land, as they have
been the collections of the best Laws, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to, by the experience of Time, and
men famous for observation of what was
congenial to the people, and enacted to
rule them; so have they, and ever, I hope,
will be, the love, honour, and freedom of
the Prince and people, protected, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by them; and, as they are looked
upon as sacred, and not to be temerated
under grievous punishments, (being the
standing Arbiters of good and evil, and
the divine sentence of the King in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Majesty and circumvallation,)
so is there in the peoples minds and
mouths great honour and regard given to
the makers of it, and the professours and
students in it; to whom (because theirs is in
the study, pleading, conveyancing, and
Clerkly parts of their Profession, which
comprehends a vast number of men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Fortunes and Families) the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
yields a great part of their Estates
and respects; for they are the most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men in business, of any Profession, and
they contrive settlements of purchase and
marriage; these frame Wills of bequests
and disposition; these exhibit Bills and
Petitions in Courts of Equity; these draw
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102653:108"/>
Pleadings in Courts of Law; these are

Officers in Courts, Attendants on Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits,
Stewards in Mannor, Undersheriffs in
Shires, Judges in Corporations, which
shews their abilities, and their possibilities
to improve them to their enriching: For
by this they know the nature of Estates,
and the condition of their Owners, and can
thereby pleasure themselves more and
surer then other men can. And, if to these
their patebility to honors be added, when
the High Chancellourship, the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and other Justiceships, Mastership of
the Rolls, Presidencies of the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Attorney, Solicitor, Sergeantship to the
King, which àre, for the most part, all Trusts
and honours of Lawyers. If these so great
rich, trusty, noble places be theirs, &amp; theirs
they will be, while the Inns of Courts
yield royal Wits and noble Minds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and mannage them to the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the peoples content, and their own
renown, as thanks be to God and his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty, whom God long preserve
and keep, their and our Royal Master, they
now are. The conclusion, that they study
and practice of the Law is a rise to honour,
and riches, is very easie to be made. And,
how can it be otherwise, since the Students
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102653:108"/>
and Practicers of the Law, being know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
bred, well-descended, richly fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
amply allyed, assiduously versed, or
bred under such, as are these, or the most
of them, but that Riches and Honour
should fall in to them, and be conspicuous
upon them. For, as they they drive a trade
of gain with no Money-stock, nor hazard
their gain by no credit, nor exhaust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by no charge upon their Chambers,
(their Inns being their Sanctuaries, and
their Attendance on Courts their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege;)
so need they not, nor seldom do they
let their money lye dead any time by
them, but either they know where safely
to place it, and hedge it in by a legal and
undeceivable Security, or else they have
Attorneys and Negotiators that depend
upon them, who can serve them in that
Expedition. Hence come they to purchase
the best Seats, the noblest Royalties, the

former; and though some of them seated
near the Town, where they are subject to
vices of waste, have not kept their estates
so long, nor marryed so advisedly, as
those further-off Gentlemen do; yet is
not their impermanency to be attributed
to the ill-acquisition of those estates left

These I have known and seen living freely
and dying wealthy and creditable: and to
the honour of the Societies of <hi>London,</hi>
which consist solely of Freemen, it may be
with much truth averred, that they are the
truest and most unbyassed Trustees of any
in the Nation; their Works do praise them
in the Gates. For alas, sharking in Trade
is but of a late date, since luxury and high-living
came into general use. For when
Traders liv'd low, and rose by degrees,
suting their port to their estate, to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in word, and currant in payment, was
their ambition, and the life of their thrift;
but when they began, as in these late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
times they did, to be vain and
boundless, then they cared not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
their words, over-ask in their wares,
shirk for one anothers Customers, steal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and Custom, cavil and sue Neighbours,
contract vast Debts, and pay them with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102653:110"/>
becoming Prisoners. These are the flawes
that are disparaging to Tradesmen, and to
all others that practise the like, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they spend high and live pleasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
as if their Trades would maintain
their ryot, and be kept together without
their diligence. This loose attendance of
Trade, together with its diffusion into so
many hands, every of which must live and
thrive as they may out of it, causes Trade
to be visibly pregnant of great estates less
then of old; not because Trade is not as
much and as profitable as then, but because
many more are of it, and draw succulency
from it, and mind it less intently then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore;
and thence are the Estates less
great though more general: which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it is easie to divine whence the decay
of Estates in Tradesmen comes, not from
Trades infertility; for it is a Mine of gold
and golds-worth, which many have, and
yet find, who come to it poor younger
Brothers live in it plentifully, and leave it
honourably, while their Estates gotten by
it, subsist their Children in Knights and
Knights-fellows Degree. But that which
is the mall and marr of Tradesmen, is, Men
run into it without fear or wit, and know
not when to leave while they have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
for Trade is such a tender thing,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102653:111"/>
and so dangerous, that not to prosper in
it, is to decay; and not to venture, is to
forswear to thrive. And there is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods blessing stronger to me then
this, that men trade for great Summs, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with men they never see, nor from
whom they neither give nor take any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
nor can perhaps legally prove the
agreement of the price, quantity, delivery,
payment, or other terms of their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
or discharged; yet to one pound
thus ventured lost, there is a hundred, a
thousand currantly paid for; and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
these hazards, and infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Trade should be thus gainful, and
in twenty years (for more then that few
men have gainful times (their Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to seek and settle till they are thirty
years old, and their children breaking
their Stocks for breeding and Portions
when they are fifty) That, I say, in twenty
years, or some few more or less, there
should be 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, or a 100 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pound clear Estate and more raised,
besides expences and losses which may be
⅔, or at least half more necessary to be
gotten (the clear Estate being that which
survives expence and loss) is an instance
of a multiform blessing, and a signal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Gods love to mens industry and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102653:111"/>
honesty in Trade. And though, in Trade,
as in all other undertakings, the race is
not to the swift, nor success to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diligent; yet to one that miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that so does; there are ten thrive: For,
as in all learned and mechanique Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there are rules beyond which none
must goe that will be reputed worthy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
so in Trade, there are courses that
those which follow them not, forsaking the
path, will fall into the dirt and ditch of
miscarriage. When then I mention Trade
to be a way of Rise and Riches to men and
Families, I intend, Trade well-managed;
as Forein Trade, I suppose, thus trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
though I am like to err, which if I
do, I crave the Merchants pardon: Good
advice of a Staple or Market, proper and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
Commodities, those well-bought,
of a good sort and cheap, after, fitted for
their Port, then well-shipped, then safely
ventured, then assigned to a careful and
responsible factor, then put off to currant
men, or bartred for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alable Commodities,
then sent home, then sold, and the effects of
them well pursed: These Methods, blessed
by God, and not made null by the dreyn
of an expensive Waste, nor defeated by
neglect of Correspondence from abroad,
and of heeding the alteration of Markets
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102653:112"/>
at home, (which do sink or raise the price
and Profit of Merchandises) must needs
in the revolution of twenty years, make a
wealthy Merchant: So in Home-trade, to
buy wares well, and sell them warily, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
little Stock lye dead, nor debts lye
out, but keeping Shop, and looking over
Books and Servants diligently and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
and maintaining the credit by good
payment and honest dealing, is not onely
the way to get and keep, but to thrive by
a Trade; and a firm Estate once gotten,
which is done by diligence, forecast, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
and royalness, it will increase on
a man to yield him and his, Support, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

will yet, I hope, ever give Encouragement
to its Followers; and though it yield the
attainers, to the highth of its reward, but

or the Title of a Knight; yet if with it,

their Countrey residencies; their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Riches. For these that now-a-daies put
themselves upon, and are accepted into
Services and Trusts, are not of the temper
of those wonted attendants on Greatness,
who descended out of worshipful Families,
came into Noble Fetters, not so much to

their future subsistance, (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

Which motives to, and practices in,

no reward but what was the bare enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of their time and paines, and
was un-detrimental to their Principals,

               <p>SEventhly, Resolution of Hold-fast, is a
great Rise to Riches and Honour. This
humour of Frugality, which is the softest
and least blemished sence of Hold-fasting,
being a great advance to Estates: Nor
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102653:122"/>
do I think it is excelled by any way of
acquisition practicable. For it consists of
all those ingredients that in their simpls
are conducing to thrift; and therefore in
their conjunction must amount to it. It
implies knowledge of worldly casualty,
and of that vertigo and fluency which
swinges and tides to and fro worldly
things, and worldly men; and because
these conversions are oftner from better
to worse, then from worse to better, it
practises wisdom of preparation for, and
prevention of, the fatality of Humane
Contingencies, and provides in plenty
for Want, in health for Sickness, in Riches
for Poverty, in Peace for Distraction: and
this by a Mortification of appetite in those
exhaustions, that are too liberal to be
lasting, and too expensive to be sober:
Hence it spins its thred into as large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

little time that prosperity thus founded
lasteth; yet great Rise and Riches are for
a time procured by it. And therefore do
I account it now a way to advance, not
because the Age accounts it a vertue, but
because the general transport of pleasure

leave the severe judgment of these to the

who I am sure doe really discountenance

yet ought it here to be touched upon, as
a great blemish which gives Adversaries
too just occasion to reproach us: But the

the Civil and Lay-prophaneness, which is
monstrous and temptative of God, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

wasted by the squitter of these Vices, but
burthened with Penalties upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

               <p>SIxthly, disdain of Thrift as Pedantry,
is a great advance to Decay and Ruine
of Men and Families: for most men are
so raised in their ports and minds, that
they think nothing Genteel, and praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
but what is wastefull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frugal.
Hence comes it to pass, that all

judged Pedantry, and unfit for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

and in the Ceremonies omission, the
real signification of it, lost; we are all
so intumour'd and sick with self-conceit,
that as we are ashamed almost to own
God the giver &amp; contriver of our mercies;
so are we altogether regretters of owning
<hi>the rock from whence we were hewen, and the
breasts that gave us suck,</hi> &amp; the means of our
rise &amp; improvement in the world; I confess,
if this were the temper of Kings, &amp; Kings
Companions, it were to be less wondred
at; (it being usual for, and not uncomely

say, If great personages used this nicety

for pitiful underlings, and vulgar subjects
to affect heighth, and state of life, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.
For the Priest to disdain his
modest hair, and to be Perewigg'd; for
the Lawyer to scorn to carry his bag, and
the Citizen wear his Apron, and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

yet this is the leaven of all men,
and the Lethargy of our present Vertue;
though the way of wise men be to be at
the one end of their affairs, to permit as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

but since men are so dainty

not to think that service, Slavery, which

ungentile thing to blow the Nose, or vent
the Belly, when the excrements in them are
burthensome, nor to dress wounds when

which because too few have, the
ambition of Women is so little to excell
this way. For with the most of our now-a-day
Husbands, who have too few generous

cannot deny themselves exuberancies, and

Which wise <hi>King Iames</hi> of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
a Prince, in whose daies Peace, Riches,
and Religion, as much flourished as in any
times before him, considering in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Speech in the <hi>Star-Chamber, Anno</hi>
1616.<note place="margin">P. 567. Of His Works in Folio.</note> thus declares himself:</p>
               <p>Another thing to be cared for, is, the new
Buildings here about the City of <hi>London;</hi>
concerning which my Proclamations have
gone forth; and by the chief Iustice here, and
his Predecessor <hi>Popham,</hi> it hath been resolved
to have been a general nusans to the whole
Kingdom: And this is that, which is
like the Spleen in the Body, which in measure
as it overgrows, the body wasts. For is
it possible but the Countrey must diminish, if
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102653:160"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> do so increase, and all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do come to <hi>London?</hi> and where doth
this increase appear; not in the heart of the
City, but in the Suburbs, not giving wealth
or profit to the City, but bringing misery and
surcharge both to City and Court; causing
dearth and scarsity through the great provision
of victuals and fewel, that must be for such a
multitude of people: And these buildings serve
likewise to harbour the worst sort of people, as
Alehouses and Cottages do. I remember, that
before Christmas was Twelvemoneth I made
a Proclamation for this cause, That all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of quality should depart to their own
countries and houses, to maintain Hospitality
amongst their Neighbours, which was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally
taken by some, as that it was meant
only for that Christmas: But my will and
meaning was, and here I do declare that my
meaning was, that it should alwaies continue.</p>
               <p>One of the greatest causes of all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
desire, that have no calling or errand,
to dwel in <hi>London,</hi> is apparently the pride
of the Women: For if they be Wives, then
their Husbands &amp; if they be Maids, then their
Fathers must bring them up to <hi>London;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the new fashion is to be had no where
but in <hi>London:</hi> and heer if they be unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
they marr their marriages; and if they
be married they lose their reputations, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102653:161"/>
rob their Husbands purses. It is the fashion
of <hi>Italy,</hi> especially of <hi>Naples,</hi>) which is one of
the richest parts of it) that all the Gentry
dwell in the principal Towns, and so the whole
countrey is empty: Even so now in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
all the countrey is gotten into <hi>London;</hi>
so as with time, <hi>England</hi> will only be <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and the whole countrey be left waste:
For as we now do imitate the French fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in fashion of Clothes, and Lackeys to
follow every man; so have we got up the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
fashion, in living miserably in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and dwelling all in the City: but let us
in Gods name leave these idle forein toyes,
and keep the old fashion of <hi>England:</hi> For
it was wont to be the honour and reputation
of the English Nobility and Gentry, to live in
the countrey, and keep hospitality; for which
we were famous above all the countries in
the world; which we may the better do, having
a soile abundantly fertile to live in.</p>
               <p>And now out of my own mouth I declare
unto you, (which being in this place, is equal
to a Proclamation, which I intend likewise
shortly hereafter to have publiquely proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,)
that the Courtiers, Citizens and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
and those that belong unto them, and
others as have Pleas in Term time, are only
necessary persons to remain about this City;
others must get them into the countrey: For
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102653:161"/>
besides the having of the countrey desolate,
when the Gentry dwell thus in <hi>London,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other mischiefes arise upon it: First, if
insurrections should fall out (as was lately
seen by the Levellers gathering together) what
order can be taken with it, when the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is unfurnished of Gentlemen to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with it? Next, the poor want relief for
fault of the Gentlemens hospitality at home.
Thirdly, my service is neglected, and the good
government of the countrey for lack of the
principal Gentlemens presence, that should
perform it. And lastly, the Gentlemen los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their own thrift, for lack of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in seeing to their own business at home.
Therefore,<note place="margin">Proclamation Anno 16 27. 3 Caroli, dated Nov. 28. 1627. entituled, A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the repair of Noblemen, Knights and Gentlemen of quality unto their Mansion houses in the Countrey, there to attend their services, and keep hospitality.</note> as every fish lives in his own place,

Honour the King, Pray for the Church,
praise Vertue, and discredit vice. Which
because it too much now abounds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the mercy of God never to

<hi>I say, because in opposition to

and impiety abounds, to the scandal

I have endeavoured, and thus far
finished; so to address to the Nobility
and Gentry of</hi> England, <hi>some Christian,
cordial, and humble counsel, which though
it comes not from an Apostle that may
command, or a Prince that may conjure
them to the audience of it, yet comes from
the kind and generous heart of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whose person, as it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unknown, so his duty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to Antiquity of Families (wherein
he hopes he may without vanity say, he
is natively interessed) and the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Now, as true Nobility is likeness to the
King in such Proportions as he is pleased
to dispense Honour, which is fontally and
prerogatively his; so is Piety and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a partaking of God, and such an
effigiation of all his gracious Proportions
on the Table of the Heart, &amp; thence on the
figure of the Life, as Mortality is capable
to take of Immortality, and Imperfection
of Perfection: And though it serves to
the excellent purposes of this World in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilizing
and associating men and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
into a comeliness and use of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and correspondence, which without
this knot and bond would be unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishable
and indurable; yet are there
higher and nobler ends of it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the better part and state of man, to
which this bodily and worldly is but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and preparatory: And by reason of
this, Piety becomes not onely a Pearl of
great Price, to purchase which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Merchant, that regulates his affairs
by Gods advice, sells all he has, and is a
gainer by the bargain to, if he can obtain
it, but a Grace of great activity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
to Gods Glory; nothing man is
capable of, being more holily prodigal,

from his blessing flow into eternity, and

made a Port, but he that steered to it,
(unless by impulse of storm, he was above
and beyond his hopes miraculously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
by God, who reserved the glory
of his safety for his challenge of praise
from such a saved miscarriage, and gaining

to have his child or charge well bred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the notion of true breeding;
but where he greedily sucks in his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102653:176"/>
and retains it, with a resolution to
wind himself into the love, practice, and

occult in nature, depending upon
the endowment of God, and annexed to

Though God, I say did, at the

his Implantation of Faith and Holiness,
which was to subvert all antique settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

their Manhoods grave and gracious; and
if they break forth into the frivolous
choices of youth, which are skittish and
insolid, the reserve of hope must be in
Gods grace manifested in their clearer sky
of reason, the purity whereof, if it wholly

so eclipse and disparage it, that it shall

for if Study and Arts be for poor and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble

               <p>This is that which I make the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
felicity of Marriage: For though I
know that God can, and sometimes does,
by a special overflood of bounty correct
contrary dispositions, and make them
harmonize in some expedient, equivalent
to sameness, and prosequutive of the
same Noble issue, content: yet this is no
ground for men to relax their care upon
such a presumption, that God can do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his power and will, though they be
one and the same in him, yet are not ever
concurring in the declaration of them to
us. God may, and ever has power to do
that which perhaps he wills not; and so
in this case it may be, which denies pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to venter on the Seas of casualty in
a schiff of presumption; nor is God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in his gratifications of so bold and
presumptuous adventures, where there
are safe passages to the Port, to affect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
waies, is to provoke God to leave
men to wander and naufrage.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if any man of Honour
and Worship would be a wise chuser of a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102653:197"/>
Wife, and be a happy Husband in her, let
him look up to God, in an humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to have his counsel and conduct;
and then let him look to the Stock, the
Breeding, the Relations, the Company,
the Complexion, the Years, the Humour
of her he wives, and consider the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of them to his own condition,
according to the Sympathy or Antipathy
whereto he may conclude himself happy,
or otherwise: For Gold and Copper, Silver
and Tinn, Oyle and Water, Light and

the Rule of Right, then to make Prisons

and therby insecure the money they

have reason to tell them they ought, and
fortune to enable them, to answer their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
Indeed it is one of the things to
be deplored, that many men of Place and
Fortune, who in their places are examples

Thrift, and vertuous Frugality, the
best title to which, that most of the

Indeed it is a brave humour, to
be free and generous, and it well becomes
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:102653:202"/>
Royal minds to appear in Royal actions.
But then the actions that men Royally
do must have a rectitude of Justice in
the end, and in the means to it. If
<hi>Alexander</hi> give a Talent to a Cynick,
that desires only a mite, <hi>Alexander</hi> has
considered himself right in giving what
becomes him, whose the Talent was; but
if <hi>Alexander</hi> had had of his own but a
Mite, and gave a Talent which he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
and knew not how or when to pay,
the Magnificence of the gift is no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to its Donor, though a pleasure to
the receiver; men may be free of what is
their own, but to do great things by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
debts which are not possible or
probable to be paid, is to be Generous
and Noble in the sence that <hi>Solyman</hi> the

to the Nobles and Gentry of
<hi>England,</hi> That in all their Lives, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,

God, Death, and Judgment. Of God, the
Soveraign being, whom to know, is life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
whom to love, is to be holy; whom
to live with,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3. Ch. 14. v. 15.</note> is to be happy. Of Death,
the common and inevitable state of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
into which the greatest pride, and
gallantest pomp must be resolved, and
with which be veyled and vanquished. Of
Judgment, the Just Assise, wherein distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
shall be of rewards unutterable, of
Torments intolerable. These three well
and throughly debated, and then applied,
as incitations to Vertuous and Godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:102653:209"/>
and dehortating terrours to the
contrary, will be notable both Defensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Cordials.</p>
               <p>Concerning God, though the thoughts
of him are precious, yet there are some
that have a specifique tendency to the
whole latitude of godly life, and godly
action; being not only Therapeutique and
Medicinal, to heal the flaws and gashes
that the violence of depravation has made
in the soul, but Energical and Incentive
to exercise of spiritual faculties to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
purposes. And these I suppose may
be reduced to five heads, (in which the
whole of a Christians meditation of God,
in order to sins anticipation in its preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
over man, is most effectually visible,)
The purity of Gods nature, the power of
his Hand, the preception of his Eye, the
obligation of his Mercy, the severity of

Purity increate; as to the <hi>quantum</hi> it is
short, to the <hi>quale,</hi> it is incomparable to
it: God is pure Fontally, as Purity is his

though inutterability of its being. Thus
pure he centrally himself only is, <hi>who is

and no farther does the purity of God
