            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>To the Right Worshipful JOHN OFFLEY Of Madely Manor in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> My most honoured Friend.</salute>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I Have made so ill use of your former favors, as by them to be encouraged to intreat that they may be enlarged to the <hi>patronage</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> of this Book. and I have put on a modest confidence, <pb facs="tcp:114857:3"/>that I shall not be denyed, because 'tis a discourse of <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Fishing,</hi> which you both know so well, and love and practice so much.</p>
            <p>You are assur'd (though there be ignorant men of an other belief) that <hi>Angling</hi> is an Art; and you know that Art better then any that I know: and that this is truth, is demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strated by the fruits of that pleasant labor which you enjoy when you purpose to give rest to your mind, and devest your self of your <pb facs="tcp:114857:3"/>more serious business, and (which is often) dedicate a day or two to this <hi>Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which time, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Anglers should attend you, and be eye-witnesses of the success, not of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but your skill, it would doubtless beget in them an emulation to be like you, and that emulation might beget an industrious diligence to be so: but I know it is not atain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by common capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114857:4"/>Sir, this pleasant curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of Fish and Fishing (of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you are so great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) has been thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>pens</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of divers in other Nations, which have been reputed men of great <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdome;</hi> and amongst those of this Nation, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (a dear lover of this Art) has told me, that his intentions were to write a discourse of the Art, and in the praise of <hi>Angling,</hi> and <pb facs="tcp:114857:4"/>doubtless he had done so, if death had not prevented him; the remembrance of which hath often made me sorry; for, if he had lived to do it, then the unlearned <hi>Angler</hi> (of which I am one) had seen some Treatise of this Art worthy his perusal, which (though some have undertaken it) I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet see in English.</p>
            <p>But mine may be thought as <hi>weak</hi> and as <hi>unworthy</hi> of common view: and I do here freely confess, that I <pb facs="tcp:114857:5"/>
should rather excuse my self, then censure others, my own Discourse being liable to so many exceptions; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which, you (Sir) might make this one, <hi>That it can contribute nothing to your knowledge;</hi> and lest a longer Epistle may diminish your pleasure, I shal not adventure to make this Epistle longer then to add this following truth, <hi>That I am really, Sir,</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>Your most affectionate Friend, and most humble Servant,</closer>

            <pb facs="tcp:114857:5"/>
            <salute>TO THE Reader of this Discourse: But especially, To the <hi>honest ANGLER.</hi>
            </salute>
            <p>I Think fit to tell thee these following truths; that I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to write, or to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this discourse of <hi>fish</hi> and <hi>fishing,</hi> to please my self, and that I wish it may not displease others; for, I have contest there are many defects in it. And yet, I cannot doubt, but that by it, some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may receive so much <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>pleasure,</hi> as if they be not very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie men, may make it not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the time of their perusall; and this is all the confidence that I can <pb facs="tcp:114857:6"/>put on concerning the merit of this Book.</p>
            <p>And I wish the Reader also to take notice, that in writing of it, I have made a recreation, of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; and that it might prove so to thee in the reading, and not to read <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>tediously,</hi> I have in severall places mixt some inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Mirth; of which, if thou be a severe, sowr complexioned man, then I here disallow thee to be a competent Judg. For Divines say, <hi>there are offences given</hi>; and <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taken, but not given.</hi> And I am the willinger to justifie this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Mirth,</hi> because the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is a kind of picture of my owne disposition, at least of my disposition in such daies and times as I allow my self, when honest <hi>Nat.</hi> and <hi>R. R.</hi> and I go a fishing together; and let me adde this, that he that likes not the discourse, should like the pictures of the <hi>Trout</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:114857:6"/>and other fish, which I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, because they concern not my self.</p>
            <p>And I am also to tel the Reader, that in that which is the more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full part of this discourse; that is to say, the observations of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>breeding,</hi> and <hi>seasons,</hi> and <hi>catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fish,</hi> I am not so simple as not to think but that he may find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in some of these; and therefore I must intreat him to know, or rather note, that severall Countreys, and several Rivers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of fishes Breeding; and therefore if he bring not candor to the reading of this Discourse, he shall both injure me, and possibly himself too by too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Criticisms.</p>
            <p>Now for the Art of catching fish; that is to say, how to make a man that was none, an Angler by a book: he that undertakes it, shall undertake a harder task then <hi>Hales,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:114857:7"/>that in his printed Book<note n="*" place="margin">Called the private Schoo of defence.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took by it to teach the Art of Fencing, and was laught at for his labour. Not but that something usefull might be observed out of that Book; but that Art was not to be taught by words; nor is the Art of Angling. And yet, I think, that most that love that Game, may here learn something that may be worth their money, if they be not needy: and if they be, then my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, that they forbear; for, I write not to get money, but for pleasure; and this discourse boasts of no more: for I hate to promise much, and fail.</p>
            <p>But pleasure I have found both in the <hi>search</hi> and <hi>conference</hi> about what is here offered to thy view and censure; I wish thee as much in the perusal of it, and so might here take my leave; but I will stay thee a little longer by telling thee, that whereas it is said by many, that in <hi>Fly-fishing</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:114857:7"/>for a <hi>Trout,</hi> the Angler must observe his twelve Flyes for every Month, I say, if he observe that, he shall be as certain to catch fish, as they that make Hay by the fair dayes in Almanacks, and be no surer: for doubtless, three or four <hi>Flyes</hi> rightly made, do serve for a <hi>Tront</hi> all <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; and for <hi>Winter-flies,</hi> all <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> know, they are as useful as an <hi>Almanack</hi> out of date.</p>
            <p>Of these (because no man is born an <hi>Artist</hi> nor an <hi>Angler</hi>) I thought fit to give thee this notice. I might say more, but it is not fit for this place; but if this Discourse which follows shall come to a second im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which is possible, for slight books have been in this Age obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have that fortune; I shall then for thy sake be glad to correct what is faulty, or by a conference with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to explain or enlarge what is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive:but for this time I have neither <pb facs="tcp:114857:8"/>awillingness nor leasure to say more, then wish thee a <hi>rainy evening</hi> toread this book in, and <hi>that the east wind may never blow when thou goest a fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Farewel.</p>

               <p>You are wel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Sir; a good morning to you; I have stretch'd my legs up <hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Hil</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you, hoping <pb n="2" facs="tcp:114857:10"/>your businesse may occasion you towards <hi>Ware,</hi> this fine pleasant fresh <hi>May day</hi> in the Morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viator.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I shall almost answer your hopes: for my purpose is to be at <hi>Hodsdess</hi> (three miles short of that Town) I wil not say, before I drink; but before I break my fast: for I have appointed a friend or two to meet me there at the <hi>thatcht house,</hi> about nine of the clock this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that made me so early up, and indeed, to walk so fast.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I know the <hi>thatcht house</hi> very well: I often make it my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting place, and taste a cup of Ale there, for which liquor that place is very remarkable; and to that house I shall by your favour accompany you, and either abate of my pace, or mend it, to enjoy such a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as you seem to be, knowing that (as the Italians say) <hi>Good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany makes the way seem the shorter.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>It may do so Sir, with the <pb n="3" facs="tcp:114857:10"/>help of good discourse, which (me thinks) I may promise from you, that both look and speak so chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And to invite you to it, I do here promise you, that for my part, I will be as free and open-hearted, as discretion will warrant me to be with a stranger.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am right glad of your answer; and in confidence that you speak the truth, I shall (Sir) put on a boldnesse to ask, whether pleasure or businesse hath occasioned your Journey.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, Sir, a little busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and more pleasure: for my purpose is to bestow a day or two in hunting the <hi>Otter</hi> (which my friend that I go to meet, tells me is more pleasant then any hunting whatsoever:) and having dispatcht a little businesse this day, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to morrow to follow a pack of dogs of honest Mr. —, who hath appointed me and my friend to <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114857:11"/>meet him upon <hi>Amwel hill</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning by day break.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, my fortune hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered my desires; and my purpose is to bestow a day or two in helping to destroy some of those villanous vermin: for I hate them perfectly, because they love fish so well, or rather, because they destroy so much: indeed, so much, that in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all men that keep Otter dogs ought to have a Pension from the Commonwealth to incourage them to destroy the very breed of those base <hi>Otters,</hi> they do so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>But what say you to the <hi>Foxes</hi> of this Nation? would not you as willingly have them destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? for doubtlesse they do as much mischief as the <hi>Otters.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, if they do, it is not so much to me and my Fraternitie, as that base Vermin the <hi>Otters</hi> do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir, I pray, of what <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114857:11"/>Fraternity are you, that you are so angry with the poor <hi>Otter</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pis.</speaker>
               <p>I am a Brother of the <hi>Angle,</hi> and therefore an enemy to the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he does me and my friends so much mischief; for you are to know, that we <hi>Anglers</hi> all love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore do I hate the <hi>Otter</hi> perfectly, even for their sakes that are of my Brotherhood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, to be plain with you, I am sorry you are an <hi>Angler:</hi> for I have heard many grave, serious men pitie, and many pleasant men scoffe at <hi>Anglers.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, There are many men that are by others taken to be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grave men, which we contemn and pitic; men of sowre complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; mony-getting-men, that spend all their time first in getting, and next in anxious care to keep it: men that are condemn'd to be rich, and alwayes discontented, or busie. For these poor-rich-men, wee Anglers <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114857:12"/>pitie them; and stand in no need to borrow their thoughts to think our selves happie: For (trust me, Sir) we enjoy a contentednesse above the reach of such dispositions.</p>
               <p>And as for any scoffer, <hi>qui moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kat mockabitur.</hi> Let mee tell you, (that you may tell him) what the wittie French-man sayes in such a<note place="margin">The Lord Mountagne in his Apol. for Ra.Sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond.</note> Case. <hi>When my</hi> Cat <hi>and I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine each other with mutuall apish tricks (as playing with a garter,) who knows but that I make her more sport then she makes me? Shall I conclude her simple, that has her time to begin or refuse sportivenesse as freely as I my self have? Nay, who knows but that our agreeing no better, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of my not under standing her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? (for doubtlesse Cats talk and reason with one another) and that shee laughs at, and censures my folly, for making her sport, and pittes mee for understanding her no better?</hi> To this purpose speaks <hi>Mountagne</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114857:12"/>
                  <hi>Cats:</hi> And I hope I may take as great a libertie to blame any Scoffer, that has never heard what an Angler can say in the justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Art and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>But, if this satisfie not, I pray bid the Scoffer put this Epigram into his pocket, and read it every morning for his breakfast (for I wish him no better;) Hee shall finde it fix'd before the Dialogues of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (who may be justly accounted the father of the Family of all <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers:</hi>) And though I owe none of that Fraternitie so much as good will, yet I have taken a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant pains to make such a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it as may make it the fitter for all of that Fraternity.</p>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Lucian</hi> well skill'd in <hi>scoffing,</hi> this has writ,</l>
                  <l>Friend, that's your folly which you think your <hi>wit</hi>:</l>
                  <l>This you vent oft, void both of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Meaning an other, when your self you jeer,</l>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114857:13"/>But no more of the <hi>Scoffer</hi>; for since <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, he is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to men, he shall be so to me; and I think, to all that love <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Angling.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you have almost ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed me: for though I am no Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,<note place="margin">Pro. 24.9.</note> yet I have (I pray let me speak it without offence) alwayes look'd upon <hi>Anglers</hi> as more patient, and more simple men, then (I fear) I shall finde you to be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Piscat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I hope you will not judge my earnestnesse to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: and for my <hi>simplicitie,</hi> if by that you mean a <hi>harmlesnesse,</hi> or that <hi>simplicity</hi> that was usually found in the Primitive Christians, who were (as most <hi>Anglers</hi> are) quiet men, and followed peace; men that were too wise to sell their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to buy riches for vexation, and a fear to die. Men that lived in those times when there were fewer Lawyers, for then a Lordship might <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114857:13"/>have been safely conveyed in a piece of Parchment no bigger then your hand, though several skins are not sufficient to do it in this wiser Age. I say, Sir, if you take us An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers to be such simple men as I have spoken of, then both my self, and those of my profession will be glad to be so understood. But if by sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie you meant to expresse any general defect in the understanding of those that professe and practise <hi>Angling,</hi> I hope to make it appear to you, that there is so much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reason (if you have but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear it) as may remove all the anticipations that Time or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course may have possess'd you with, against that Ancient and laudable Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Why (Sir) is Angling of Antiquitie, and an Art, and an art not easily learn'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pis.</speaker>
               <p>Yes (Sir:) and I doubt not but that if you and I were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114857:14"/>together but til night, I should leave you possess'd with the same happie thoughts that now possesse me; not onely for the Antiquitie of it, but that it deserves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; and that 'tis an Art; and worthy the knowledge and practice of a wise, and a serious man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I pray speak of them what you shall think fit; for wee have yet five miles to walk before wee shall come to the <hi>Thatcht house.</hi> And, Sir, though my infirmities are many, yet I dare promise you, that both my patience and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will indure to hear what you will say till wee come thither: and if you please to begin in order with the antiquity, when that is done, you shall not want my attention to the commendations and accommodations of it: and lastly, if you shall convince me that 'tis an Art, and an Art worth learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114857:14"/>I shall beg I may become your Scholer, both to wait upon you, and to be instructed in the Art it self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, 'tis not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, but that it is an art, and an art worth your Learning: the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion wil rather be, whether you be capable of learning it? For he that learns it, must not onely bring an enquiring, searching, and discerning wit; but he must bring also that <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> you talk of, and a love and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to the art it felf: but having once got and practised it, then doubt not but the Art will (both for the pleasure and profit of it) prove like to <hi>Vertue, a reward to it self.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I am now become so ful of expectation, that I long much to have you proceed in your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: And first, I pray Sir, let me hear concerning the antiquity of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:114857:15"/>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I wil preface no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but proceed in order as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire me: And first for the Antiquity of <hi>Angling,</hi> I shall not say much; but onely this; Some say,<note place="margin">J. Da.</note> it is as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as <hi>Deucalions</hi> Floud: and others (which I like better) say,<note place="margin">Jer.Mar.</note> that <hi>Belus</hi> (who was the inventer of godly and vertuous Recreations) was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of it: and some others say, (for former times have had their Disquisitions about it) that <hi>Seth,</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> taught it to his sons, and that by them it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to Posterity. Others say, that he left it engraven on those Pillars which hee erected to preserve the knowledg of the <hi>Mathematicks, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> and the rest of those precious Arts, which by Gods appointment or allowance, and his noble industry were thereby preserved from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in <hi>Noah's</hi> Floud.</p>
               <p>These (my worthy Friend) have been the opinions of some men, that <pb n="13" facs="tcp:114857:15"/>possibly may have endeavoured to make it more ancient then may well be warranted. But for my part, I shall content my self in telling you, That <hi>Angling</hi> is much more ancient then the incarnation of our Saviour: For both in the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap.4.2.</note> and before him in <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap.41.</note> (which last Book is judged to be written by <hi>Moses</hi>) mention is made of <hi>fish-hooks,</hi> which must imply <hi>Anglers</hi> in those times.</p>
               <p>But (my worthy friend) as I would rather prove my self to be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by being <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>humble, valiant</hi> and <hi>inoffensive, vertuous</hi> and <hi>communicable,</hi> then by a fond osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>riches</hi>; or (wanting these Vertues my self) boast that these were in my Ancestors; [And yet I confesse, that where a noble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Descent and such Merits meet in any man, it is a double dignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that person:] and so, if this Antiquitie of Angling (which, for my part, I have not forc'd) shall, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114857:16"/>like an ancient Familie, be either an honour, or an ornament to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Art which I both love and practise, I shall be the gladder that I made an accidental mention of it; and shall proceed to the justification, or rather commendation of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>My worthy Friend, I am much pleased with your discourse, for that you seem to be so ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so modest, as not to stretch arguments into Hyperbolicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, but such as indeed they will reasonably bear; and I pray, proceed to the justification, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of Angling, which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so long to hear from you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I shall proceed; and my next discourse shall be rather a Commendation, then a Justification of Angling: for, in my judgment, if it deserves to be commended, it is more then justified; for some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices that may be justified, deserve no commendation: yet there are <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114857:16"/>none that deserve commendation but may be justified.</p>
               <p>And now having said thus much by way of preparation, I am next to tell you, that in ancient times a debate hath risen, (and it is not yet resolved) Whether <hi>Contemplation</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> be the chiefest thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the happiness of a man doth most consist in this world?</p>
               <p>Concerning which, some have maintained their opinion of the first, by saying, <q>[That the nearer we Mortals come to God by way of imitation, the more happy we are:]</q> And that God injoyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self only by <hi>Contemplation</hi> of his own <hi>Goodness, Eternity, Infiniteness</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and the like; and upon this ground many of them prefer <hi>Contemplation</hi> before <hi>Action</hi>: and indeed, many of the Fathers seem to approve this opinion, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their Comments upon the words of our Saviour to<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 10. 41,42.</note> 
                  <hi>Martha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114857:17"/>And contrary to these, others of equal Authority and credit, have preferred <hi>Action</hi> to be chief; as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in <hi>Physick,</hi> and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, both for the ease and prolongation of mans life, by which man is enabled to act, and to do good to others: And they say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, That <hi>Action</hi> is not only. Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but a maintainer of humane Society; and for these, and other reasons, to be preferr'd before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which two opinions, I shall forbear to add a third, by declaring my own, and rest my self contented in telling you (my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend) that both these meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and do most properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the most honest, ingenious, harmless Art of Angling.</p>
               <p>And first I shall tel you what some have observed, and I have sound in my self, That the very sitting by the Rivers side, is not only the fittest <pb n="17" facs="tcp:114857:17"/>place for, but will invite the Anglers to Contemplation: That it is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test place, seems to be witnessed by the children of <hi>Israel</hi>

               <p>And an ingenuous <hi>Spaniard</hi> sayes, <q>[That both Rivers, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the watery Element, were created for wise men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, and fools to pass by without consideration.</q> And though I am too wise to rank my self in the first number, yet give me leave to free my self from the last, by offering to thee a short contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, first of Rivers, and then of Fish: concerning which, I doubt not but to relate to you many <pb n="18" facs="tcp:114857:18"/>things very considerable.</p>

                  <l>Lord, who hath praise enough, nay, who hath any?</l>
                  <l>None can express thy works, but he that knows them;</l>
                  <l>And none can know thy works, they are so many,</l>
                  <l>And so complete, but only he that owes them.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>We all acknowledge both thy power and love</l>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 104.</note> seems even to exceed himself; how doth he there express himselfe in choice Metaphors, even to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of a contemplative Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, concerning the Sea, the Rivers, and the Fish therein contained. And the great Naturallist <hi>Pliny</hi> sayes, <q>[That Natures great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power is more demonstrated in the Sea, then on the Land.]</q> And this may appear by the numerous and various Creatures, inhabiting both in and about that Element: as to the Readers of <hi>Gesner, Randeliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Pliny, Aristotle,</hi> and others is demonstrated: But I will sweeten this discourse also out of a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation in Divine <hi>Dubartas,</hi> who<note place="margin">

               </lg>
               <p>These seem to be wonders, but have had so many confirmations from men of Learning and credit, that you need not doubt them; nor are the number, nor the various shapes of fishes, more strange or more fit for <hi>contemplation,</hi> then their different natures, inclinations and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: concerning which I shall beg your patient ear a little longer.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are also lustful and chaste fishes, of which I shall also give you examples.</p>
               <p>And first, what <hi>Dubartas</hi> sayes of a fish called the <hi>Sargus</hi>; which (because none can express it better then he does) I shall give you in his own words, supposing it shall not have the less credit for being Verse, for he hath gathered this, and other <pb n="23" facs="tcp:114857:20"/>observations out of Authors that have been great and industrious searchers into the secrets of nature.</p>

                  <l>Wives everyday in the deep streams, but (strange)</l>

               <p>Sir, but a little longer, andI have done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, take what liberty you think fit, for your discourse seems <pb n="24" facs="tcp:114857:21"/>to be Musick, and charms me into an attention.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Why then Sir, I will take a little libertie to tell, or rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you what is said of <hi>Turtle Doves:</hi> First, that they silently plight their troth and marry; and that then, the Survivor scorns (as the <hi>Thracian</hi> women are said to do) to out-live his or her Mate; and this is taken for such a truth, that if the Survivor shall ever couple with another, the he or she, not only the living, but the dead, is denyed the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> of a true <hi>Turtle Dove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to parallel this Land Variety, &amp; teach mankind moral faithfulness, &amp; to condemn those that talk of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet come short of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faith of fish and fowl; Men that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Law, affirm'd by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to be writ in their hearts, and which<note place="margin">Rom.2.14 15.</note> he sayes shal at the last day condemn and leave them without excuse. I <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114857:21"/>Pray hearken to what <hi>Dubartas</hi> sings,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dubartas</hi> 5. day.</note> (for the hearing of such conjugal faithfulness, will be Musick to all chaste ears) and therefore, I say, hearken to what <hi>Dubartas</hi> sings of the <hi>Mullet:</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>But for chaste love the <hi>Mullet</hi> hath no peer,</l>
                  <l>For, if the Fisher hath surprised her pheer,</l>
                  <l>As mad with wo, to shoare she followeth,</l>
                  <l>Prest to consort him both in life and death.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>On the contrary, what shall I say of the <hi>House-Cock,</hi> which treads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hen, and then (contrary to the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Partridg,</hi> and <hi>Pigeon</hi>) takes no care to hatch, to feed, or to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish his own Brood, but is sensless though they perish.</p>
               <p>And 'tis considerable, that the <hi>Hen</hi> (which because she also takes any <hi>Cock,</hi> expects it not) who is sure the Chickens be her own, hath by a moral impression her care, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her own Broode, more <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114857:22"/>then doubled, even to such a height, that our Saviour in expressing his love to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> quotes her for an example of tender affection, as his Father had done <hi>Job</hi> for a pattern of patience.<note place="margin">Mat.23 37</note>
               </p>
               <p>And to parallel this <hi>Cock,</hi> there be divers fishes that cast their spawne on flags or stones, and then leave it uncovered and exposed to become a prey, and be devoured by Vermine or other fishes: but other fishes (as namely the <hi>Barbel</hi>) take such care for the preservation of their seed, that (unlike to the <hi>Cock</hi> or the <hi>Cuckoe</hi>) they mutually labour (both the Spawner, and the Melter) to cover their spawne with sand, or watch it, or hide it in some secret place unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by Vermine, or by any fish but themselves.</p>
               <p>Sir, these examples may, to you and others, seem strange; but they are testified, some by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> some by <hi>Pliny,</hi> some by <hi>Gesner,</hi> and by <pb n="27" facs="tcp:114857:22"/>divers others of credit, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and known by divers, both of wisdom and experience, to be a truth; and are (as I said at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) fit for the contemplation of a most serious, and a most pious man.</p>
               <p>And that they be fit for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the most prudent and pious, and peaceable men, seems to be testified by the practice of so many devout and contemplative men; as the Patriarks or Prophets of old, and of the Apostles of our Saviour in these later times, of which twelve he chose four that were Fishermen: concerning which choice some have made these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>
               <p>First, That he never reproved these for their Imployment or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as he did the Scribes and the Mony-Changers. And secondly, That he found the hearts of such men, men that by nature were fitted <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114857:23"/>for contemplation and quietness; men of mild, and sweet, and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirits, (as indeed most Anglers are) these men our blessed Saviour (who is observed to love to plant grace in good natures) though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be too hard for him, yet these men he chose to call from their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable imployment, and gave them grace to be his Disciples and to follow him.</p>
               <p>And it is observable, that it was our Saviours will that his four Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen Apostles should have a prioritie of nomination in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his twelve Apostles, as namely first, S. <hi>Peter, Andrew, James</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat.10.</note> and <hi>John,</hi> and then the rest in their order.</p>
               <p>And it is yet more observable, that when our blessed Saviour went up into the Mount, at his Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, when he left the rest of his Disciples and chose onely three to bear him company, that these three <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114857:23"/>were all Fisher-men.</p>
               <p>And since I have your promise to hear me with patience, I will take a liberty to look back upon an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that hath been made by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and learned man, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that God hath been pleased to allow those whom he himselfe hath appointed, to write his holy will in holy Writ, yet to express his will in such Metaphors as their former affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or practise had inclined them to; and he brings <hi>Solomon</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who before his conversion was remarkably amorous, and after by Gods appointment, writ that<note place="margin">The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> Love-Song betwixt God and his Church.</p>
               <p>And if this hold in reason (as I see none to the contrary) then it may be probably concluded, that <hi>Moses</hi> (whom I told you before, writ the book of <hi>Job</hi>) and the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> were both Anglers, for you shal in all the old Testament, find fish-hooks <pb n="30" facs="tcp:114857:24"/>but twice mentioned; namely, by meek <hi>Moses,</hi> the friend of God; and by the humble Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which last, namely, the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> I shall make but this Observation, That he that shall read the humble, lowly, plain stile of that Prophet, and compare it with the high, glorious, eloquent stile of the prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> (though they be both equally true) may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily believe him to be a good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, plaine Fisher-man.</p>
               <p>Which I do the rather believe, by comparing the affectionate, lowly, humble Epistles of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> whom we know were Fishers, with the glorious language and high Metaphors of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom we know was not.</p>
               <p>Let me give you the example of two men more, that have lived near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to our own times: first of Doctor <hi>Nowel</hi> sometimes Dean of S. <hi>Paul's,</hi> 
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114857:24"/>(in which Church his Monument stands yet undefaced) a man that in the Reformation of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> (not that of <hi>Henry the VIII.</hi>) was so noted for his meek spirit, deep Learning, Prudence and Piety, that the then Parliament and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both chose, injoyned, and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be the man to make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism for publick use, such a one as should stand as a rule for faith and manners to their posteritie: And the good man (though he was very learned, yet knowing that God leads us not to heaven by hard questions) made that good, plain, unperplext Catechism, that is printed with the old Service Book. I say, this good man was as dear a lover, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practicer of Angling, as any Age can produce; and his custome was to spend (besides his fixt hours of prayer (those hours which by command of the Church were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the old Clergy, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114857:25"/>dedicated to devotion by many Primitive Christians:) besides those hours, this good man was observed to spend, or if you will, to bestow a tenth part of his time in Angling; and also (for I have conversed with those which have conversed with him) to bestow a tenth part of his Revenue, and all his fish, amongst the poor that inhabited near to those Rivers in which it was caught, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often, <hi>That Charity gave life to Religion</hi>: and at his return would praise God he had spent that day free from worldly trouble, both harmles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in a Recreation that became a Church-man.</p>
               <p>My next and last example shall be that undervaluer of money, the late Provost of <hi>Eaton Colledg,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> (a man with whom I have often fish'd and convers'd) a man whose forraign imployments in the service of this Nation, and whose experience, learning, wit and <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114857:25"/>cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of the delights of mankind; this man, whose very approbation of Angling were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince any modest Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of it, this man was also a most dear lover, and a frequent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Art of Angling, of which he would say, <q>['Twas an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his idle time, which was not idly spent;]</q> for Angling was after tedious study <q>[A rest to his mind, a cheerer of his spirits, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of sadness, a calmer of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoughts, a Moderator of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, a procurer of contentedness, and that it begot habits of peace and patience in those that profest and practic'd it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, This was the saying of that Learned man; and I do easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that peace, and patience, and a calm content did cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> because I know, that when he was <pb n="34" facs="tcp:114857:26"/>beyond seventy years of age he made this description of a part of the present pleasure that possest him, as he sate quietly in a Summers evening on a bank a fishing; it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Spring, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it glides as soft and sweetly from his pen, as that River does now by which it was then made, I shall repeat unto you.</p>

               <p>Marry (Sir) we found her a mile off this place a fishing; she has this morning eaten the greatest part of this <hi>Trout,</hi> she has only left thus much of it as you see, and was fishing for more; when we came we found her just at it: but we were here very early, we were here an hour before Sun-rise, and have given her no rest since we came: sure she'l hardly escape all these dogs and men.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>H.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, It is not in my power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve you; for the question has been debated among many great Clerks, and they seem to differ about it; but most agree, that his tail is fish: and if his body be fish too, then I may say, that a fish will walk upon land (for an <hi>Otter</hi> does so) sometimes five or six, or ten miles in a night. But (Sir) I can tell you certainly, that he devours much fish, and kils and spoils much more: And I can tell you, that he can smel a fish in the water one hundred yards from him (<hi>Gesner</hi> sayes, much farther) and that his stones are good against the Falling-sickness: and that there is an herb <hi>Benione,</hi> which being hung in a linen cloth near a Fish Pond, or any haunt that he uses, makes him to avoid the place, which proves he can smell both by water and land. <pb n="43" facs="tcp:114857:30"/>And thus much for my knowledg of the <hi>Otter,</hi> which you may now see above water at vent, and the dogs close with him; I now see he will not last long, follow therefore my Masters, follow, for <hi>Sweetlips</hi> was like to have him at this vent.</p>

               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, To speak truly, he is not to me; for most of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits were either Scripture-jests, or lascivious jests; for which I count no man witty: for the Divel will help a man that way inclin'd, to the first, and his own corrupt nature (which he alwayes carries with him) to the latter. But a companion that feasts the company with <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>mirth,</hi> and leaves out the <hi>sin</hi> (which is usually mixt with them) he is the man: and indeed, such a man should have his charges born: and to such company I hope to bring you this night; for at <hi>Trout-Hal,</hi> not far from this place, where I purpose to lodg to night, there is usually an Angler that proves good company.</p>
               <p>But for such discourse as we heard last night, it infects o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the very boyes will learn to talk and swear as they heard mine Host, and another of the company that shall be nameless; well, you <pb n="47" facs="tcp:114857:32"/>know what example is able to do, and I know what the Poet sayes in the like case:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>— <hi>Many a one</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Owes to his Country his Religion:</l>
                  <l>And in another would as strongly grow,</l>
                  <l>Had but his Nurse or Mother taught him so.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This is reason put into Verse, and worthy the consideration of a wise man. But of this no more, for though I love civility, yet I hate severe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: I'll to my own Art, and I doubt not but at yonder tree I shall catch a <hi>Chub,</hi> and then we'll turn to an honest cleanly Ale house that I know right well, rest our selves, and dress it for our dinner.</p>

               <p>Oh, Sir, a <hi>Chub</hi> is the worst fish that swims, I hoped for a <hi>Trout</hi> for my dinner.</p>

            <sp>

(but you must stand very close) there lye upon the top of the water twenty <hi>Chubs:</hi> I'll catch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, and that shall be the biggest of them all: and that I will do so, I'll hold you twenty to one.</p>

               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>I marry, Sir, now you talk like an Artist, and I'll say, you are one, when I shall see you perform what you say you can do; but I yet doubt it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>And that you shall see me do presently; look, the biggest of these <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114857:33"/>
                  <hi>Chubs</hi> has had some bruise upon his tail, and that looks like a white spot; that very <hi>Chub</hi> I mean to catch; sit you but down in the shade, and stay but a little while, and I'l warrant you I'l bring him to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>I'l sit down and hope well, because you seem to be so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Sir, there he is, that very <hi>Chub</hi> that I shewed you, with the white spot on his tail; and I'l be as certain to make him a good dish of meat, as I was to catch him. I'l now lead you to an honest Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, where we shall find a cleanly room, Lavender in the windowes, and twenty Ballads stuck about the wall; there my Hostis (which I may tel you, is both cleanly and conveniently handsome (has drest many a one for me, and shall now dress it after my fashion, and I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it good meat.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Come Sir, with all my heart, <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114857:34"/>for I begin to be hungry, and long to be at it, and indeed to rest my self too; for though I have walk'd but four miles this morning, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be weary; yester dayes hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hangs stil upon me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Wel Sir, and you shal quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be at rest, for yonder is the house I mean to bring you to.</p>
               <p>Come Hostis, how do you? wil you first give us a cup of your best Ale, and then dress this <hi>Chub,</hi> as you drest my last, when I and my friend were here about eight or ten daies ago? but you must do me one courtesie, it must be done instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Host.</speaker>
               <p>I wil do it, Mr. <hi>Piscator,</hi> and with all the speed I can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Now Sir, has not my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis made haste? and does not the fish look lovely?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Both, upon my word Sir, and therefore lets say Grace and fall to eating of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114857:34"/>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, how do you like it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Trust me,'tis as good meat as ever I tasted: now let me thank you for it, drink to you, and beg a courtesie of you; but it must not be deny'd me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>What is it, I pray Sir? you are so modest, that me thinks I may promise to grant it before it is asked.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir, it is that from henceforth you will allow me to call you Master, and that really I may be your Scholer, for you are such a companion, and have so quickly caught, and so excellently cook'd this fish, as makes me ambitious to be your scholer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Give me your hand: from this time forward I wil be your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and teach you as much of this Art as I am able; and will, as you desire me, tel you somewhat of the nature of some of the fish which we <pb n="52" facs="tcp:114857:35"/>are to Angle for; and I am sure I shal tel you more then every Angler yet knows.</p>
               <p>And first I will tel you how you shall catch such a <hi>Chub</hi> as this was;&amp; then how to cook him as this was: I could not have begun to teach you to catch any fish more easily then this fish is caught; but then it must be this particular way, and this you must do:</p>
               <p>Go to the same hole, where in most hot days you will finde floting neer the top of the water, at least a dozen or twenty <hi>Chubs</hi>; get a <hi>Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper</hi> or two as you goe, and get secretly behinde the tree, put it then upon your hook, and let your hook hang a quarter of a yard short of the top of the water, and'tis very likely that the shadow of your rod, which you must rest on the tree, will cause the <hi>Chubs</hi> to sink down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with fear; for they be a very fearful fish, and the shadow of a bird <pb n="53" facs="tcp:114857:35"/>flying over them will make them do so; but they will presently rise up to the top again, and there lie soaring till some shadow affrights them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: when they lie upon the top of the water, look out the best <hi>Chub,</hi> which you setting your self in a fit place, may very easily doe, and move your Rod as softly as a Snail moves, to that <hi>Chub</hi> you intend to catch; let your bait fall gently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water three or four inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and he will infallibly take the bait, and you will be as sure to catch him; for hee is one of the leather-mouth'd fishes, of which a hook does scarce ever lose his hold: and therefore give him play enough before you offer to take him out of the water. Go your way presently, take my rod, and doe as I bid you, and I will sit down and mend my tackling till you return back.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, my loving Master, you have offered mee as fair as I <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114857:36"/>could wish: Ile goe and observe your directions.</p>
               <p>Look you, Master, what I have done; that which joyes my heart; caught just such another <hi>Chub</hi> as yours was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Marry, and I am glad of it: I am like to have a towardly Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of you. I now see, that with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and practice you wil make an <hi>Angler</hi> in a short time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>But Master, What if I could not have found a <hi>Grashopper?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pis.</speaker>
               <p>Then I may tel you, that a <hi>black Snail,</hi> with his belly slit, to shew his white; or a piece of soft <hi>cheese</hi> wil usually do as wel; nay, sometimes a <hi>worm,</hi> or any kind of <hi>fly</hi>; as the <hi>Ant-fly,</hi> the <hi>Flesh-fly,</hi> or <hi>Wall-fly,</hi> or the <hi>Dor</hi> or <hi>Beetle,</hi> (which you may find under a Cow-turd) or a <hi>Bob,</hi> which you wil find in the same place, and in time wil be a <hi>Beetle</hi>; it is a short white worm, like to, and bigger then a Gentle; or a <hi>Cod-worm,</hi> 
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114857:36"/>or <hi>Case-worm</hi> any of these wil do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel to fish in such a manner. And after this manner you may catch a <hi>Trout</hi>: in a hot evening, when as you walk by a Brook, and shal see or hear him leap at Flies, then if you get a <hi>Grashopper,</hi> put it on your hook, with your line about two yards long, standing behind a bush or tree where his hole is, and make your bait stir up and down on the top of the water; you may, if you stand close, be sure of a bit, but not sure to catch him, for he is not a leather mouthed fish: and after this manner you may fish for him with almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of live Flie, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a <hi>Grashopper.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>But before you go further, I pray good Master, what mean you by a leather mouthed fish.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>By a leather mouthed fish, I mean such as have their teeth in their throat, as the <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Cheven,</hi> and so the <hi>Barbel,</hi> the <hi>Gudgion</hi> and <pb n="56" facs="tcp:114857:37"/>
                  <hi>Carp,</hi> and divers others have; and the hook being stuck into the leather or skin of such fish, does very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never lose its hold: But on the contrary, a <hi>Pike,</hi> a <hi>Pearch,</hi> or <hi>Trout,</hi> and so some other fish which have not their teeth in their throats, but in their mouthes, which you shal observe to be very full of bones, and the skin very thin, and little of it: I say, of these fish the hook nevertakes so sure hold, but you often lose the fish unless he have gorg'd it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you good Master for this observation; but now what shal be done with my <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> that I have caught.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Marry Sir, it shall be given away to some poor body, for Ile warrant you Ile give you a <hi>Trout</hi> for your supper; and it is a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your Art to offer your first fruits to the poor, who will both thank God and you for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:114857:37"/>And now lets walk towards the water again, and as I go Ile tel you when you catch your next <hi>Chub,</hi> how to dresse it as this was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>viat.</speaker>
               <p>Come (good Master) I long to be going and learn your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>You must dress it, or see it drest thus: When you have sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, wash him very cleane, cut off his tail and fins; and wash him not after you gut him, but chine or cut him through the middle as a salt fish is cut, then give him four or five scotches with your knife, broil him upon wood-cole or char-cole; but as he is broiling, baste him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with butter that shal be choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; and put good store of salt into your butter, or salt him gently as you broil or baste him; and bruise or cut very smal into your butter, a little Time, or some other sweet herb that is in the Garden where you eat him: thus used, it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114857:38"/>the watrish taste which the <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Chevin</hi> has, and makes him a choice dish of meat, as you your self know; for thus was that dress'd, which you did eat of to your din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Or you may (for variety) dress a <hi>Chub</hi> another way, and you wil find him very good, and his tongue and head almost as good as a Carps; but then you must be sure that no grasse or weeds be left in his mouth or throat.</p>
               <p>Thus you must dress him: Slit him through the middle, then cut him into four pieces; then put him into a pewter dish, and cover him with another, put into him as much White Wine as wil cover him, or Spring water and Vinegar, and store of Salt, with some branches of Time, and other sweet herbs; let him then be boiled gently over a Chafing-dish with wood coles, and when he is almost boiled enough, put <pb n="59" facs="tcp:114857:38"/>half of the liquor from him, not the top of it; put then into him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quantity of the best butter you can get, with a little Nutmeg grated into it, and sippets of white bread: thus ordered, you wil find the <hi>Chevin</hi> and the sauce too, a choice dish of meat: And I have been the more careful to give you a perfect direction how to dress him, because he is a fish undervalued by many, and I would gladly restore him to some of his credit which he has lost by ill Cookery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>But Master, have you no other way to catch a <hi>Cheven,</hi> or <hi>Chub?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Yes that I have, but I must take time to tel it you hereafter; or indeed, you must learn it by observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practice, though this way that I have taught you was the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to catch a <hi>Chub,</hi> at this time, and at this place. And now weare come again to the River; I wil (as <pb n="60" facs="tcp:114857:39"/>the Souldier sayes) prepare for skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish; that is, draw out my Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and try to catch a <hi>Trout</hi> for supper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>Trust me Master, I see now it is a harder matter to catch a <hi>Trout</hi> then a <hi>Chub</hi>; for I have put on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and followed you this two hours, and not seen a fish stir, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at your Minnow nor your Worm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Wel Scholer, you must indure worse luck sometime, or you will never make a good Angler. But what say you now? there is a <hi>Trout</hi> now, and a good one too, if I can but hold him; and two or three turns more will tire him: Now you see he lies still, and the sleight is to land him: Reach me that Landing net: So (Sir) now he is mine own, what say you? is not this worth all my labour?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>On my word Master, this is a gallant <hi>Trout</hi>; what shall <pb n="61" facs="tcp:114857:39"/>we do with him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Marry ee'n eat him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: We'l go to my Hostis, from whence we came; she told me, as I was going out of door, that my brothet <hi>Peter,</hi> a good Angler, and a cheerful companion, had sent word he would lodg there to night, and bring a friend with him. My Host<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is has two beds, and I know you and I may have the best: we'l re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with my brother <hi>Peter</hi> and his friend, tel tales, or sing Ballads, or make a Catch, or find some harmless sport to content us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>A match, good Master, lets go to that house, for the linnen looks white, and smels of Lavender, and I long to lye in a pair of sheets that smels so: lets be going, good Master, for I am hungry again with fishing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, stay a little good Scholer, I caught my last <hi>Trout</hi> with a worm, now I wil put on a Minow <pb n="62" facs="tcp:114857:40"/>and try a quarter of an hour about yonder trees for another, and so walk towards our lodging. Look you Scholer, thereabout we shall have a bit presently, or not at all: Have with you (Sir!) on my word I have him. Oh it is a great logger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Chub:</hi> Come, hang him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Willow twig, and let's be going. But turn out of the way a little, good Scholer, towards yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der high hedg: We'l sit whilst this showr falls so gently upon the teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earth, and gives a sweeter smel to the lovely slowers that adorn the verdant Meadows.</p>
               <p>Look, under that broad <hi>Beech tree</hi> I sate down when I was last this way a fishing, and the birds in the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Grove seemed to have a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contention with an Echo, whose dead voice seemed to live in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cave, near to the brow of that Primrose hil; there I sate viewing the Silver streams glide silently towards <pb n="63" facs="tcp:114857:40"/>their center, the tempestuous Sea, yet sometimes opposed by rugged roots, and pibble stones, which broke their waves, and turned them into some: and sometimes viewing the harmless Lambs, some leaping securely in the cool shade, whilst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sported themselvs in the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sun; and others were craving comfort from the swolne Udders of their bleating Dams. As I thus sate, these and other sighs had so fully possest my soul, that I thought as the Poet has happily expre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </lg>
               <p>As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second pleasure entertained me, 'twas a handsome Milk-m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>id, that had cast away all care, and sung like a <hi>Nightingale</hi>; her voice was good, and the Ditty fitted for it; 'twas that smooth Song <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114857:41"/>which was made by <hi>Kit Marlow,</hi> now at least fifty years ago; and the Milk maids mother sung an answer to it, which was made by Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> in his yonger dayes.</p>
               <p>They were old fashioned Poetry, but choicely good, I think much better then that now in fashion in this Critical age. Look yonder, on my word, yonder they be both a milking again: I wil give her the <hi>Chub,</hi> and perswade them to sing those two songs to us.</p>

               <p>O I know it now, I learn'd the first part in my golden age, when I was about the age of my daughter, and the later part, which indeed fits me best, but two or three years ago; you shal, God willing, hear them both.

               <p>And I wil tel him one thing for his encouragement, that his fortune hath made him happy to be a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to such a Master; a Master that knowes as much both of the nature and breeding of fish, as any man; and can also tell him as well how to catch and cook them, from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now</hi> to the <hi>Sammon,</hi> as any that I ever met withall.</p>

               <p>Well sung <hi>Coridon,</hi> this Song was sung with mettle, and it was choicely fitted to the occasion; I shall love you for it as long as I know you: I would you were a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Angle, for a companion that is cheerful and free from swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="89" facs="tcp:114857:48"/>and scurrilous discourse, is worth gold. I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning; nor men (that cannot wel bear it) to repent the money they spend when they be warmed with drink: and take this for a rule, you may pick out such times and such companies, that you may make your selves merrier for a little then a great deal of money; for <hi>'Tis the company and not the charge that makes the feast</hi>: and such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion you prove, I thank you for it.</p>
               <p>But I will not complement you out of the debt that I owe you, and therefore I will begin my Song, and wish it may be as well liked.</p>

               <p>My honest Scholer, I wil do <pb n="84" facs="tcp:114857:51"/>it freely: The <hi>Trout</hi> (for which I love to angle above any fish) may be justly said (as the ancient Poets say of Wine, and we English say of Venson) to be a generous fish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has his seasons, a fish that comes in, and goes out with the <hi>Stag</hi> or <hi>Buck</hi>: and you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that as there be some <hi>barren Does,</hi> that are good in Summer; so there be some <hi>barren Trouts,</hi> that are good in Winter; but there are not many that are so, for usually they be in their perfection in the month of <hi>May,</hi> and decline with the <hi>Buck</hi>: Now you are to take notice, that in several Countries, as in <hi>Germany</hi> and in other parts compar'd to ours, they differ much in their bigness, shape, and other wayes, and so do <hi>Trouts</hi>; 'tis wel known that in the Lake <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> there are <hi>Trouts</hi> taken, of three Cubits long, as is affirmed by <hi>Gesner,</hi> a Writer of good credit: and <hi>Mercator</hi> sayes, <pb n="85" facs="tcp:114857:51"/>the <hi>Trouts</hi> that are taken in the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> are a great part of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of that famous City. And you are further to know, that there be certaine waters that breed <hi>Trouts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, both for their number and smalness- I know a little Brook in <hi>Kent</hi> that breeds them to a number incredible, and you may take them twentie or fortie in an hour, but none greater then about the size of a <hi>Gudgion.</hi> There are also in divers Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, especially that relate to, or be near to the Sea,(as <hi>VVinchester,</hi> or the Thames about <hi>VVindsor</hi>) a little <hi>Trout</hi> called a <hi>Samlet</hi> or <hi>Skegger Trout</hi> (in both which places I have caught twentie or fortie at a standing) that will bite as fast and as freely as <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows</hi>; these be by some taken to be young <hi>Salmons,</hi> but in those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they never grow to bee bigger then a <hi>Herring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is also in <hi>Kent,</hi> neer to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a <hi>Trout</hi> (called there a <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114857:52"/>
                  <hi>Fordig Trout</hi>) a <hi>Trout</hi> (that bears the name of the Town where'tis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually caught) that is accounted rare meat, many of them near the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a <hi>Salmon,</hi> but knowne by their different colour, and in their best season cut very white; and none have been known to be caught with an Angle, unless it were one that was caught by honest Sir <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings,</hi> an excellent Angler (and now withGod) and he has told me, he thought that <hi>Trout</hi> bit not for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but wantonness; and 'tis the rather to be believed, because both he then, and many others before him have been curious to search into their bellies what the food was by which they lived; and have found out nothing by which they might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their curiositie.</p>
               <p>Concerning which you are to take notice, that it is reported, there is a fish that hath not any mouth, but lives by taking breath by the porinss <pb n="87" facs="tcp:114857:52"/>of her gils, and feeds and is nourish'd by no man knows what; and this may be believed of the <hi>Fordig Trout,</hi> which (as it is said of the <hi>Stork,</hi> that he knowes his season, so he) knows his times (I think almost his day) of coming into that River out of the Sea, where he lives (and it is like feeds) nine months of the year, and about three in the River of <hi>Fordig.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now for some confirmation of this; you are to know, that this <hi>Trout</hi> is thought to eat nothing in the fresh water; and it may be the better believed, because it is well known, that <hi>Swallowes,</hi> which are not seen to flye in <hi>England</hi> for six months in the year, but about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> leave us for a hotter cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; yet some of them, that have been left behind their fellows, have<note place="margin">View Sir <hi>Fra. Bacon</hi> exper.899</note> been found (many thousand at a time) in hollow trees, where they have been observed to live and sleep <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114857:53"/>out the whole winter without meat; and so <hi>Albertus</hi> observes<note place="margin">See <hi>Topsel</hi> of <hi>Frogs.</hi>
                  </note> that there is one kind of <hi>Frog</hi> that hath her mouth naturally shut up about the end of <hi>August,</hi> and that she lives so all the Winter, and though it be strange to some, yet it is known to too many amongst us to bee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And so much for these <hi>Fordidg Trouts,</hi> which never afford an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler</hi> sport, but either live their time of being in the fresh water by their meat formerly gotten in the Sea, (not unlike the <hi>Swallow</hi> or <hi>Frog</hi>) or by the vertue of the fresh water only, as the <hi>Camelion</hi> is said to live by the air.</p>
               <p>There is also in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> a <hi>Trout,</hi> called a <hi>Bull Trout,</hi> of a much greater length and bignesse then any in these Southern parts; and there is in many Rivers that relate to the Sea, <hi>Salmon Trouts</hi> as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from another, both in <pb n="89" facs="tcp:114857:53"/>shape and in their spots, as we see Sheep differ one from another in their shape and bigness, and in the finess of their wool: and certainly as some Pastures do breed larger Sheep, so do some Rivers, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the ground over which they run, breed larger <hi>Trouts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the next thing that I will commend to your consideration is, That the <hi>Trout</hi> is of a more sudden growth then other fish: concerning which you are also to take notice, that he lives not so long as the <hi>Pearch</hi> and divers other fishes do, as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> hath observed in his History of life and death.</p>
               <p>And next, you are to take notice, that after hee is come to his full growth, he declines in his bodie, but keeps his bigness or thrives in his head till his death. And you are to know that he wil about (especially before) the time of his Spawning, get almost miraculously through <hi>Weires</hi> 
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:114857:54"/>and <hi>Floud-Gates</hi> against the stream, even through such high and swift places as is almost incredible. Next, that the <hi>Trout</hi> usually Spawns about <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> but in some Rivers a little sooner or later; which is the more observable, because most other fish Spawne in the Spring or Summer, when the Sun hath warmed both the earth and water, and made it fit for generation.</p>
               <p>And next, you are to note, that till the Snn gets to such a height as to warm the earth and the water, the <hi>Trout</hi> is sick, and lean, and lowsie, and unwholsome: for you shall in winter find him to have a big head, and then to be lank, and thin, &amp; lean; at which time many of them have sticking on them Sugs, or <hi>Trout</hi> lice, which is a kind of a worm, in shape like a Clove or a Pin, with a big head, and sticks close to him and sucks his moisture; those I think the <hi>Trout</hi> breeds himselfe, and never <pb n="91" facs="tcp:114857:54"/>thrives til he free himself from them, which is till warm weather comes, and then as he growes stronger, he gets from the dead, still water, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sharp streames and the gravel, and there rubs off these worms or lice: and then as he grows stronger, so he gets him into swifter and swifter streams, and there lies at the watch for any flie or Minow that comes neer to him; and he especially loves the <hi>May</hi> flie, which is bred of the <hi>Cod-worm</hi> or <hi>Caddis</hi>; and these make the <hi>Trout</hi> bold and lustie, and he is usually fatter, and better meat at the end of that month, then at any time of the year.</p>
               <p>Now you are to know, that it is observed, that usually the best <hi>Trouts</hi> are either red or yellow, though some be white and yet good; but that is not usual; and it is a note ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable that the female <hi>Trout</hi> hath usually a less head and a deeper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then the male <hi>Trout</hi>; and a little <pb n="92" facs="tcp:114857:55"/>head to any fish, either <hi>Trout, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or other fish, is a sign that that fish is in season.</p>
               <p>But yet you are to note, that as you see some Willows or Palm trees bud and blossome sooner then others do, so some <hi>Trouts</hi> be in some Rivers sooner in season; and as the Holly or Oak are longer before they cast their Leaves, so are some <hi>Trouts</hi> in some Rivers longer before they go out of season.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <p>AND having told you these Observations concerning <hi>Trouts,</hi> I shall next tell you how to catch them: which is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a <hi>Worm,</hi> or a <hi>Minnow</hi> (which some call a <hi>Penke</hi>;) or with a <hi>Flie,</hi> either a <hi>natural</hi> or an <hi>artificial</hi> Flie: Concerning which three I wil give you some Observations and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>For Worms, there be very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorts; some bred onely in the earth, as the <hi>earth worm</hi>; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst or of plants, as the <hi>dug worm</hi>; and others in the bodies of living creatures; or some of dead flesh, as the <hi>Magot</hi> or <hi>Gentle,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Now these be most of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly good for particular fishes: but for the <hi>Trout</hi> the <hi>dew-worm,</hi> 
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:114857:56"/>(which some also cal the <hi>Lob-worm</hi>) and the <hi>Brandling</hi> are the chief; and especially the first for a great Trout, and the later for a lesse. There be also of <hi>lob-worms,</hi> some called <hi>squirel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnils</hi> (a worm which has a red head, a streak down the back, and a broad tail) which are noted to be the best, because they are the toughest, and and most lively, and live longest in the water: for you are to know, that a dead worm is but a dead bait, and like to catch nothing, compared to a lively, quick, stirring worm: And for a <hi>Brandling,</hi> hee is usually found in an old dunghil, or some very rotten place neer to it; but most usually in cow dung, or hogs dung, rather then horse dung, which is somewhat too hot and dry for that worm.</p>
            <p>There are also divers other kindes of worms, which for colour and shape alter even as the ground out of which they are got: as the <hi>marsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,</hi> 
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:114857:56"/>the <hi>tag-tail,</hi> the <hi>flag-worm,</hi> the <hi>dock-worm,</hi> the <hi>oake-worm,</hi> the <hi>gilt-tail,</hi> and too many to name, even as many sorts, as some think there be of severall kinds of birds in the air: of which I shall say no more, but tell you, that what worms soever you fish with, are the better for being long kept before they be used; and in case you have not been so provident, then the way to cleanse and scoure them quickly, is to put them all night in water, if they be Lob-worms, and then put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your bag with fennel: but you must not put your Brandling above an hour in water, and then put them into fennel for sudden use: but if you have time, and purpose to keep them long, then they be best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in an earthen pot with good store of <hi>mosse,</hi> which is to be fresh every week or eight dayes; or at least taken from them, and clean wash'd, and wrung betwixt your <pb n="96" facs="tcp:114857:57"/>hands till it be dry, and then put it to them again: And for Moss, you are to note, that there be divers kindes of it, which I could name to you, but wil onely tel you, that that which is likest a <hi>Bucks horn</hi> is the best; except it be <hi>white</hi> Moss, which grows on some heaths, and is hard to be found.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Minnow</hi> or <hi>Penke,</hi> he is easily found and caught in April, for then hee appears in the Rivers: but Nature hath taught him to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and hide himself in the Winter in ditches that be neer to the River, and there both to hide and keep himself warm in the weeds, which rot not so soon as in a running Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; in which place if hee were in Winter, the distempered Floods that are usually in that season, would suffer him to have no rest, but carry him headlong to Mils and Weires to his confusion. And of these <hi>Minnows,</hi> first you are to know, that <pb n="97" facs="tcp:114857:57"/>the biggest size is not the best; and next, that the middle size and the whitest are the best: and then you are to know, that I cannot well teach in words, but must shew you how to put it on your hook, that it may turn the better: And you are also to know, that it is impossible it should turn too quick: And you are yet to know, that in case you want a Minnow, then a small <hi>Loch,</hi> or a <hi>Sticklebag,</hi> or any other small Fish will serve as wel: And you are yet to know, that you may salt, and by that means keep them fit for use three or four dayes or longer; and that of salt, bay salt is the best.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Flies,</hi> which is the third bait wherewith <hi>Trouts</hi> are usually taken. You are to know, that there are as many sorts of Flies as there be of Fruits: I will name you but some of them: as the <hi>dun flie,</hi> the <hi>stone flie,</hi> the <hi>red flie,</hi> the <hi>moor flie,</hi> the <hi>tawny flie,</hi> the <hi>shel flie,</hi> the <hi>cloudy</hi> or <pb n="98" facs="tcp:114857:58"/>blackish <hi>flie:</hi> there be of Flies, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars,</hi> and <hi>Canker flies,</hi> and <hi>Bear flies</hi>; and indeed, too many either for mee to name, or for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: and their breeding is so various and wonderful, that I might easily amaze my self, and tire you in a relation of them.</p>
            <p>And yet I wil exercise your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised patience by saying a little of the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> or the <hi>Palmer flie</hi> or <hi>worm</hi>; that by them you may guess what a work it were in a Discourse but to run over those very many <hi>flies, worms,</hi> and little living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with which the Sun and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer adorn and beautifie the river banks and meadows, both for the recreation and contemplation of the Angler: and which (I think) I my self enjoy more then any other man that is not of my profession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> holds an opinion, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have their birth or being from a dew that in the Spring falls upon the <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114857:58"/>leaves of trees; and that some kinds of them are from a dew left upon herbs or flowers: and others from a dew left upon Colworts or Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages: All which kindes of dews being thickened and condensed, are by the Suns generative heat most of them hatch'd, and in three dayes made living creatures, and of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral shapes and colours; some being hard and tough, some smooth and soft; some are horned in their head, some in their tail, some have none; some have hair, some none; some have sixteen feet, some less, and some have none: but (as our <hi>Topsel</hi> hath with great diligence observed) those<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of</hi> Serpents.</note> which have none, move upon the earth, or upon broad leaves, their motion being not unlike to the waves of the sea. Some of them hee also observes to be bred of the eggs of other Caterpillers: and that those in their time turn to be <hi>Butter-flies</hi>; and again, that their eggs turn the <pb n="100" facs="tcp:114857:59"/>following yeer to be <hi>Caterpillers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis endlesse to tell you what the curious Searchers into Natures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, have observed of these Worms and Flies: But yet I shall tell you what our <hi>Topsel</hi> sayes of the <hi>Canker,</hi> or <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> or <hi>Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller</hi>; That whereas others content themselves to feed on particular herbs or leaves (for most think, those very leaves that gave them life and shape, gives them a particular feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and nourishment, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them they usually abide;) yet he observes, that this is called a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> or <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> for his very wandering life and various food; not contenting himself (as others do) with any certain place for his abode, nor any certain kinde of herb or flower for his feeding; but will boldly and disorderly wander up and down, and not endure to be kept to a diet, or fixt to a particular place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:114857:59"/>Nay, the very colours of <hi>Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> are, as one has observed, very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and beautiful:I shal (for a taste of the rest) describe one of them, which I will sometime the next month, shew you feeding on a Willow tree, and you shal find him punctually to answer this very description: <q>His lips and mouth somewhat yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, his eyes black as Jet, his fore-head purple, his feet and hinder parts green, his tail two forked and black, the whole body stain'd with a kind of red spots which run along the neck and shoulder-blades, not unlike the form of a Cross, or the letter X, made thus cross-wise, and a white line drawn down his back to his tail; all which add much beauty to his whole body.</q> And it is to me observable, that at a fix'd age this <hi>Caterpiller</hi> gives over to eat, a d towards winter comes to be cover d over with a strange shell or crust, and <pb n="102" facs="tcp:114857:60"/>so lives a kind of dead life, without eating all the winter, and (as others<note place="margin">View Sir <hi>Fra.

            <p>Come, come my Scholer, you fee the River stops our morning walk, and I wil also here stop my discourse, only as we sit down under this Honey-Suckle hedge, whilst I look a Line to fit the Rod that our brother <hi>Peter</hi> has lent you, I shall for a little confirmation of what I have said, repeat the observation of the Lord <hi>Bartas.</hi>

               <p>My honest Scholer, it is now past five of the Clock, we will fish til nine, and then go to Breakfast: Go you to yonder <hi>Sycamore tree,</hi> and hide your bottle of drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hollow root of it; for about that time, and in that place, we wil make a brave Breakfast with a piece of powdered Bief, and a Radish or two that I have in my Fish-bag; we shall, I warrant you, make a good honest, wholsome, hungry Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and I will give you direction for the making and using of your fly: and in the mean time, there is your Rod and line; and my advice is, that you fish as you see mee do, and lets try which can catch the first fish.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>Look you Scholer, you see I have hold of a good fish: I now see it is a <hi>Trout</hi>; I pray put that net <pb n="105" facs="tcp:114857:61"/>under him, and touch not my line, for if you do, then wee break all. Well done, Scholer, I thank you. Now for an other. Trust me, I have another bite: Come Scholer, come lay down your Rod, and help me to land this as you did the other. So, now we shall be sure to have a good dish of fish for supper.</p>

               <p>Look you, Scholer, I have yet another: and now having caught <pb n="106" facs="tcp:114857:62"/>three brace of <hi>Trouts,</hi> I will tel you a short Tale as we walk towards our Breakfast. A Scholer (a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I should say) that was to preach to procure the approbation of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, that he might be their Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, had got from a fellow Pupil of his the Copy of a Sermon that was first preached with a great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation by him that composed and precht it; and though the borrower of it preach't it word for word, as it was at first, yet it was utterly dislik'd as it was preach'd by the second; which the Sermon Borrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the Lender of it, and was thus answered; I lent you indeed my <hi>Fiddle,</hi> but not my <hi>Fiddlestick</hi>; and you are to know, that every one cannot make musick with my words which are fitted for my own mouth. And so my Scholer, you are to know, that as the ill pronunciation or ill accenting of a word in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon spoiles it, so the ill carriage of <pb n="107" facs="tcp:114857:62"/>your Line, or not fishing even to a foot in a right place, makes you lose your labour: and you are to know, that though you have my Fiddle, that is, my very Rod and Tacklings with which you see I catch fish, yet you have not my Fiddle stick, that is, skill to know how to carry your hand and line; and this must be taught you (for you are to remember I told you Angling is an Art) either by practice, or a long observation, or both.</p>
               <p>But now lets say Grace, and fall to Breakfast; what say you Scholer, to the providence of an old Angler? Does not this meat taste well? and was not this place well chosen to eat it? for this <hi>Sycamore</hi> tree will shade us from the Suns heat.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>All excellent good, Master, and my stomack excellent too; I have been at many costly Dinners that have not afforded me half this content: and now good Master, to <pb n="108" facs="tcp:114857:63"/>your promised direction for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ordering my Artificiall flye.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>My honest Scholer, I will do it, for it is a debt due unto you, by my promise: and because you shall not think your self more enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to me then indeed you really are, therefore I will tell you freely, I find Mr. <hi>Thomas Barker</hi> (a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that has spent much time and money in Angling) deal so judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely in a little book of his of Angling, and especially of making and Angling with a <hi>flye</hi> for a <hi>Trout,</hi> that I will give you his very directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without much variation, which shal follow.</p>
               <p>Let your rod be light, and very gentle, I think the best are of two pieces; the line should not exceed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for three or four links to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the hook) I say, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <pb n="109" facs="tcp:114857:63"/>three or four haires; but if you can attain to Angle with one haire, you will have more rises, and catch more fish. Now you must bee sure not to cumber your selfe with too long a Line, as most do: and before you begin to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, cast to have the wind on your back, and the Sun (if it shines) to be before you, and to fish down the streame) and carry the point or top of the Rod downeward; by which meanes the shadow of your selfe, and Rod too will be the least offensive to the Fish, for the sight of any shadow amazes the fish, and spoiles your sport, of which you must take a great care.</p>
               <p>In the middle of <hi>March</hi> (till which time a man should not in honestie catch a <hi>Trout</hi>) or in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> if the weather be dark, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle windy, or cloudie, the best fishing <pb n="110" facs="tcp:114857:64"/>is with the <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> of which I last spoke to you; but of these there be divers kinds, or at least of divers colours, these and the <hi>May-fly</hi> are the ground of all <hi>fly</hi>-Angling, which are to be thus made:</p>
               <p>First you must arm your hook, with the line in the inside of it; then take your Scissers and cut so much of a browne <hi>Malards</hi> feather as in your own reason wil make the wings of it, you having withall regard to the bigness or littleness of your hook, then lay the outmost part of your feather next to your hook, then the point of your feather next the shank of your hook; and having so done, whip it three or four times about the hook with the same Silk, with which your hook was armed, and having made the Silk fast, take the hackel of a <hi>Cock</hi> or <hi>Capons</hi> neck, or a <hi>Plovers</hi> top, which is usually bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; take off the one side of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then take the hackel, Silk <pb n="111" facs="tcp:114857:64"/>or Crewel, Gold or Silver thred, make these fast at the bent of the hook, that is to say, below your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) then you must take the hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, the silver or gold thred, and work it up to the wings, shifting or stil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving your fingers as you turn the Silk about the hook: and still look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at every stop or turne that your gold, or what materials soever you make your <hi>Fly</hi> of, do lye right and neatly; and if you find they do so, then when you have made the head, make all fast, and then work your hackel up to the head, and make that fast; and then with a needle or pin divide the wing into two, and then with the arming Silk whip it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout cross-wayes betwixt the wings, and then with your thumb you must turn the point of the feather towards the bent of the hook, and then work three or four times about the shank of the hook, and then view the proportion, and if all be neat, and <pb n="112" facs="tcp:114857:65"/>to your liking, fasten.</p>
               <p>I consess, no direction can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to make a man of a dull capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty able to make a flye well; and yet I know, this, with a little practice, wil help an ingenuous Angler in a good degree; but to see a fly made by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is the best teaching to make it, and then an ingenuous Angler may walk by the River and mark what fly falls on the water that day, and catch one of them, if he see the <hi>Trouts</hi> leap at a fly of that kind, and having alwaies hooks ready hung with him, and having a bag also, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with him with Bears hair, or the hair of a brown or sad coloured Heifer, hackels of a Cock or Capon, several coloured Silk and Crewel to make the body of the fly, the feathers of a Drakes head, black or brown sheeps wool, or Hogs wool, or hair, thred of Gold, and of silver; silk of several colours (especially sad coloured to make the head:) and <pb n="113" facs="tcp:114857:65"/>there be also other colour'd feathers both of birds and of peckled fowl. I say, having those with him in a bag, and trying to make a flie, though he miss at first, yet shal he at last hit it better, even to a perfection which none can well reach him; and if he hit to make his <hi>flie</hi> right, and have the luck to hit also where there is store of <hi>trouts,</hi> and a right wind, he shall catch such store of them, as will encourage him to grow more and more in love with the Art of <hi>flie-making.</hi>

               <p>Marry Scholer, but I would not be there, nor indeed from under this tree; for look how it begins to rain, and by the clouds (if I mistake not) we shall presently have a smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <pb n="114" facs="tcp:114857:66"/>showre, and therefore sit close, this <hi>Sycamore tree</hi> will shelter us, and I will tell you, as they shall come into my mind, more observations of flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishing for a <hi>Trout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first, for the Winde; you are to take notice that of the windes the <hi>South winde</hi> is said to be best. One observes, That</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>When the winde is south,</l>
                  <l>It blows you bait into a fishes mouth.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Next to that the <hi>west</hi> winde is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the best: and having told you that the <hi>East</hi> winde is the worst, I need not tell you which winde is best in the third degree. And yet (as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes, that <hi>Hee that considers the winde shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sow:</hi> so hee that busies his head too much about them, (if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be not made extreme cold by as East winde) shall be a little superstitious: for as it is observed by some, That there is no good horse <pb n="115" facs="tcp:114857:66"/>of a bad colour; so I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that if it be a clowdy day, and not extreme cold, let the winde fit in what corner it will, and do its worst. And yet that this for a Rule, that I would willingly fish on the Lee shore: and you are to take notice, that the Fish lies, or swimms neere the bottom in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in Summer, and also neerer the bottom in any cold day.</p>
               <p>But I promised to tell you more of the Flie-fishing for a <hi>Trout,</hi> (which I may haave time enough to do, for you see it rains <hi>May-butter.</hi>) First for a <hi>May-flie,</hi> you may make his body with greenish coloued crewel, or willow colour, darkning it in most places, with waxed silk, or rib'd with a black hare, or some of them rib'd with silver thred; and such wings for the colour as you see the flie to have at that season; nay at that very day on the water. Or you may make the <hi>Oak-flie,</hi> with an Orange- <pb n="116" facs="tcp:114857:67"/>tawny and black ground, and the brown of a Mallards feather for the wings; and you are to know, that these two are most excellent <hi>flies,</hi> that is, the <hi>May flie</hi> and the <hi>Oak flie</hi>: And let me again tell you, that you keep as far from the water as you can possibly, whether you fish with a flie or worm, and fish down the stream, and when you fish with a flie, if it be possible, let no part of your line touch the water, but your flie only; and be stil moving your fly upon the water, or casting it into the water; you your self, being also alwaies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving down the stream. Ms. <hi>Barker</hi> commends severall sorts of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flies, not only those rib'd with silver and gold, but others that have their bodies all made of black, or some with red, and a red hackel; you may also make the <hi>hawthorn-flie,</hi> whichis all black and not big, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smal, the smaller the better; or the <hi>oak-fly,</hi> the body of which is Orange <pb n="117" facs="tcp:114857:67"/>colour and black crewel, with a brown wing, or a <hi>fly</hi> made with a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks feather, is excellent in a bright day: you must be sure you want not in your <hi>Magazin</hi> bag, the Peacocks feather, and grounds of such wool, and crewel as will make the Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper: and note, that usually, the smallest flies are best; and note also, that, the light flie does usually make most sport in a dark day: and the darkest and least flie in a bright or cleare day; and lastly note, that you are to repaire upon any occasion to your <hi>Magazin bag,</hi> and upon any occasion vary and make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your fancy.</p>
               <p>And now I shall tell you, that the fishing with a naturall flie is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and affords much pleasure; they may be found thus, the <hi>May-fly</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually in and about that month neer to the River side, especially against rain; the <hi>Oak-fly</hi> on the Butt or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an <hi>Oak</hi> or <hi>Ash,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <pb n="118" facs="tcp:114857:68"/>of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>August</hi> it is a brownish fly, and easie to be so found, and stands usually with his head downward, that is to say, towards the root of the tree; the final black fly, or <hi>hawthorn</hi> fly is to be had on any Hawthorn bush, after the leaves be come forth; with these and a short Line (as I shewed to Angle for a <hi>Chub</hi>) you may dap or dop, and also with a <hi>Grashopper,</hi> behind a tree, or in any deep hole, still ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to move on the top of the water, as if it were alive, and still keeping yourself out of sight, you shall certainly have sport if there be <hi>Trouts</hi>; yea in a hot day, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in the evening of a hot day.</p>
               <p>And now, Scholer, my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for fly-fishing is ended with this showre, for it has done raining, and now look about you, and see how pleasantly that Meadow looks, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <p>VVEL, Scholer, now we are sate downe and are at ease, I shall tel you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of <hi>Trout</hi> fishing before I speak of the <hi>Salmon,</hi> (which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shall be next) and then of the <hi>Pike.</hi> or <hi>Luce</hi> You are to know, there is night as well as day-fishing for a <hi>Trout,</hi> and that then the best are out of their holds; and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of taking them is on the top of the water with a great <hi>Lob</hi> or <hi>Garden worm,</hi> or rather two; which you are to fish for in a place where the water runs somewhat quietly (for in a stream it wil not be so well discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.) I say, in a quiet or dead place neer to some swift, there draw your bait over the top of the water to <pb n="127" facs="tcp:114857:72"/>and fro, and if there be a good <hi>Trout</hi> in the hole, he wil take it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the night be dark; for then he lies boldly neer the top of the water, watching the motion of any <hi>Frog</hi> or <hi>Water-mouse,</hi> or <hi>Rat</hi> betwixt him and the skie, which he hunts for if he sees the water but wrinkle or move in one of these dead holes, wher the great <hi>Trouts</hi> usually lye neer to their hold.</p>
               <p>And you must fish for him with a strong line, and not a little hook, and let him have time to gorge your hook, for he does not usually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, as he oft will in the day-fishing: and if the night be not dark, then fish so with an <hi>Artificial fly</hi> of a light colour; nay he will somtimes rise at a dead Mouse or a piece of cloth; or any thing that seemes to swim cross the water, or to be in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this is a choice way, but I have not oft used it because it is void of the pleasures that such dayes as <pb n="128" facs="tcp:114857:73"/>these that we now injoy, afford an <hi>Angler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you are to know, that in <hi>Hamp-shire,</hi> (which I think exceeds all <hi>England</hi> for pleasant Brooks, and store of <hi>Trouts</hi>) they use to catch <hi>Trouts</hi> in the night by the light of a Torch or straw, which when they have discovered, they strike with a <hi>Trout</hi> spear; this kind of way they catch many, but I would not believe it till I was an eye-witness of it, nor like it now I have seen it.</p>

               <p>Yes, and hear, and smel too, both then and in the day time, for <hi>Gesner</hi> observes, the <hi>Otter</hi> smels a fish forty furlong off him in the water; and that it may be true, is affirmed by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (in the eighth Century of his Natural History) who there proves, that waters may be the <hi>Medium</hi> of sounds, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating it thus, <hi>That if you knock</hi>

                  <hi>two stones together very deep under the water, those that stand on a bank neer to that place may hear the noise without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diminution of it by the water.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so offers the like experiment concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the letting an <hi>Anchor</hi> fall by a very long Cable or rope on a Rock, or the sand within the Sea: and this being so well observed and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, as it is by that learned man, has made me to believe that Eeles unbed themselves, and stir at the noise of the Thunder, and not only as some think, by the motion or the stirring of the earth, which is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by that Thunder.</p>
               <p>And this reason of Sir <hi>Francis Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> has made me crave pardon of<note place="margin">Exper.792</note> one that I laught at, for affirming that he knew <hi>Carps</hi> come to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place in a Pond to be fed at the ringing of a Bel; and it shall be a rule for me to make as little noise, as I can when I am a fishing, until Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> be confuted, which I <pb n="130" facs="tcp:114857:74"/>shal give any man leave to do, and so leave off this Philosophical discourse for a discourse of fishing.</p>
               <p>Of which my next shall be to tell you, it is certain, that certain fields neer <hi>Lemster,</hi> a Town in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> are observed, that they make the Sheep that graze upon them more fat then the next, and also to bear finer Wool; that is to say, that that year in which they feed in such a particular pasture, they shall yeeld finer wool then the yeer before they came to feed in it, and courser again if they shall return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pasture, and again return to a finer wool being fed in the fine wool ground.

               <p>It is now time to tell you next, (according to promise) some obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the <hi>Salmon</hi>; But first, I wil tel you there is a fish, called by some an <hi>Umber,</hi> and by some a <hi>Greyling,</hi> a choice fish, esteemed by many to be equally good with the <hi>Trout</hi>: it is a fish that is usually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen inches long, he lives in such streams as the <hi>Trout</hi> does; and is indeed taken with the same bait as a <hi>Trout</hi> is, for he will bite both at the <hi>Minnow,</hi> the <hi>Worm,</hi> and the <hi>Fly,</hi> both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>: of this fish there be many in <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the River that runs by <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and in some other les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <pb n="132" facs="tcp:114857:75"/>Brooks; but he is not so general a fish as the <hi>Trout,</hi> nor to me either so good to eat, or so pleasant to fish for as the <hi>Trout</hi> is; of which two fishes I will now take my leave, and come to my promised Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Salmon,</hi> and a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the catching him.</p>

            <p>And the old <hi>Salmon,</hi> both the <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Spawner,</hi> strive also to get into the <hi>Sea</hi> before Winter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stopt that course, or lost; gro v sick in fresh waters, and by degrees unseasonable, and kipper, that is, <pb n="134" facs="tcp:114857:76"/>to have a bony gristle, to grow (not unlike a <hi>Hauks</hi> beak) on one of his chaps, which hinders him from feeding, and then he pines and dies.</p>
            <p>But if he gets to <hi>Sea,</hi> then that gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle wears away, or is cast off (as the <hi>Eagle</hi> is said to cast his bill) and he recovers his strength, and comes next Summer to the same River, (if it be possible) to enjoy the former pleasures that there possest him; for (as one has wittily observed) he has (like some persons of Honour and Riches, which have both their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer houses) the fresh Rivers for Summer, and the salt water for winter to spend his life in; which is not (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Life and Death.</note> hath observed) above ten years: And it is to be observed, that though they grow big in the <hi>Sea,</hi> yet they grow not fat but in fresh Rivers; and it is observed, that the farther they get from the <hi>Sea,</hi> the better they be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:114857:76"/>And it is observed, that, to the end they may get far from the <hi>Sea,</hi> either to Spawne or to possess the pleasure that they then and there find, they will force themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the tops of <hi>Weirs,</hi> or <hi>Hedges,</hi> or <hi>stops</hi> in the water, by taking their tails into their mouthes, and leaping over those places, even to a height beyond common belief: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by forcing themselves against the streame through Sluces and Floud-gates, beyond common cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. And 'tis observed by <hi>Gesner,</hi> that there is none bigger then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor none better then in Thames.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Salmons</hi> sudden growth, it has been observed by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ribon in the tail of some num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the young <hi>Salmons,</hi> which have been taken in <hi>Weires,</hi> as they swimm'd towards the salt water, and then by taking a part of them again with the same mark, at the same <pb n="136" facs="tcp:114857:77"/>place, at their returne from the Sea, which is usually about six months after; and the like experiment hath been tried upon young <hi>Swallows,</hi> who have after six months absence, been oserved to return to the same chimney, there to make their nests, and their habitations for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following; which hath inclined many to think, that every <hi>Salmon</hi> usually returns to the same River in which it was bred, as young <hi>Pigeons</hi> taken out of the same <hi>Dove-cote,</hi> have also been observed to do.</p>
            <p>And you are yet to observe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the He <hi>Salmon</hi> susually bigger then the Spawner, and that he is more kipper, &amp; less able to endure a winter in the fresh water, then the She is; yet she is at that time of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less kipper and better, as watry and as bad meat.</p>
            <p>And yet you are to observe, that as there is no general rule without an exception, so there is some few <pb n="137" facs="tcp:114857:77"/>Rivers in this Nation that have <hi>Trouts</hi> and <hi>Salmon</hi> in season in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But for the observations of that and many other things, I must in manners omit, because they wil prove too large for our narrow compass of time, and therefore I shall next fall upon my direction how to fish for the <hi>Salmon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that, first, you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that usually he staies not long in a place (as <hi>Trouts</hi> wil) but (as I said) covets still to go neerer the Spring head; and that he does not (as the <hi>Trout</hi> and many other fish) lie neer the water side or bank, or roots of trees, but swims usually in the middle, and neer the ground; and that there you are to fish for him, and that he is to be caught as the <hi>Trout</hi> is, with a <hi>Worm,</hi> a <hi>Minnow,</hi> (which some call a <hi>Penke</hi>) or with a <hi>Fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you are to observe, that he is very, very seldom observed to bite <pb n="138" facs="tcp:114857:78"/>at a <hi>Minnow</hi> (yet sometime he will) and not oft at a <hi>fly,</hi> but more usually at a <hi>Worm,</hi> and then most usually at a <hi>Lob</hi> or <hi>Garden worm,</hi> which should be wel scowred, that is to say, seven or eight dayes in Moss before you fish with them; and if you double your time of eight into sixteen, or more, into twenty or more days, it is still the better, for the worms will stil be clearer, tougher, and more lively, and continue so longer upon your hook.</p>
            <p>And now I shall tell you, that which may be called a secret: I have been a fishing with old <hi>Oliver Henly</hi> (now with God) a noted Fisher, both for <hi>Trout</hi> and <hi>Salmon,</hi> and have observed that he would usually take three or four worms out of his bag and put them into a little box in his pocket, where he would usually let them continue half an hour or more, before he would bait his hook with them; I have ask'd him his reason, <pb n="139" facs="tcp:114857:78"/>and he has replied, <hi>He did but pick the best out to be in a readiness against he baited his hook the next time</hi>: But he has been observed both by others, and my self, to catch more fish then I or any other body that has ever gone a fishing with him, could do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>s; and I have been told lately by one of his most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and secret friends, that the box in which he put those worms was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with a drop, or two, or three of the Oil of <hi>Ivy-berries,</hi> made by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or infusion, and that by the wormes remaining in that box an hour, or a like time, they had incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated a kind of smel that was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly attractive, enough to force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fish, within the smel of them, to bite. This I heard not long since from a friend, but have not tryed it; yet I grant it probable, and refer my Reader to Sir <hi>Francis Bacons</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral History, where he proves fishes may hear; and I am certain Gesner <pb n="140" facs="tcp:114857:79"/>sayes, the <hi>Otter</hi> can smell in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and know not but that fish may do so too: 'tis left for a lover of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, or any that desires to improve that Art, to try this conclusion.</p>
            <p>I shall also impart another expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment (but not tryed by my selfe) which I wil deliver in the same words as it was by a friend, given me in writing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take the stinking oil drawn out of</hi> Poly pody <hi>of the Oak, by a retort mixt with</hi> Turpentine, <hi>and Hive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honey, and annoint your hait therewith, and it will doubtlesse draw the fish to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in these things I have no great faith, yet grant it probable, and have had from some chimical men (namely, from Sir <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi> and others) an affirmation of them to be very advantageous: but no more of these, especially not in this place.</p>
            <p>I might here, before I take my <pb n="141" facs="tcp:114857:79"/>leave of the <hi>Salmon,</hi> tell you, that there is more then one sort of them, as namely, a <hi>Tecon,</hi> and another called in some places a <hi>Samlet,</hi> or by some, a <hi>Skegger:</hi> but these (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which I forbear to name) may be fish of another kind, and differ, as we know a <hi>Herring</hi> and a <hi>Pilcher</hi> do; but must by me be left to the disquisitions of men of more leisure and of greater abilities, then I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my self to have.</p>
            <p>And lastly, I am to borrow so much of your promised patience, as to tell you, that the <hi>Trout</hi> or <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> being in season, have at their first taking out of the water (which continues during life) their bodies adorned, the one with such red spots, and the other with black or blackish spots, which gives them such an addition of natural beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as I (that yet am no enemy to it) think was never given to any woman by the Artificial Paint or <pb n="142" facs="tcp:114857:80"/>Patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age. And so I shall leave them and proceed to some Observations of the <hi>Pike.</hi>

               <p>IT is not to be doubted but that the <hi>Luce,</hi> or <hi>Pikrell,</hi> or <hi>Pike</hi> breeds by Spaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and yet <hi>Gesner</hi> sayes, that some of them breed, where none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, out of a weed called <hi>Pik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell-weed,</hi> and other glutinous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which with the help of the Suns heat proves in some particular ponds (apted by nature for it) to become <hi>Pikes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> observes the <hi>Pike</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Life and Death.</note> to be the longest lived of any fresh water fish, and yet that his life is <pb n="143" facs="tcp:114857:80"/>not usually above fortie years; and yet <hi>Gesner</hi> mentions a <hi>Pike</hi> taken in <hi>Swedeland</hi> in the year 1449, with a Ring about his neck, declaring he was put into the Pond by <hi>Frederick</hi> the second, more then two hundred years before he was last taken, as the Inscription of that Ring, being Greek, was interpreted by the then Bishop of <hi>worms.</hi> But of this no more, but that it is observed that the old or very great <hi>Pikes</hi> have in them more of state then goodness; the smaller or middle siz'd <hi>Pikes</hi> being by the most and choicest palates ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be the best meat; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Eele is observed to be the better for age and bigness.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Pikes</hi> that live long prove chargeable to their keepers, because their life is maintained by the death of so many other fish, even those of his owne kind, which has made him by some Writers to bee called the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of the Rivers, or the <hi>Fresh</hi> 
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:114857:81"/>
                  <hi>water-wolf,</hi> by reason of his bold, greedy, devouring disposition; which is so keen, as <hi>Gesner</hi> relates, a man going to a Pond (where it seems a <hi>Pike</hi> had devoured all the fish) to water his Mule, had a <hi>Pike</hi> bit his Mule by the lips, to which the <hi>Pike</hi> hung so fast, that the <hi>Mule</hi> drew him out of the water, and by that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the owner of the <hi>Mule</hi> got the <hi>Pike</hi>; I tell you who relates it, and shall with it tel you what a wise man has observed, <hi>It is a hard thing to perswade the belly, because it hath no ears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this relation of <hi>Gesners</hi> bee dis-believed, it is too evident to bee doubted that a <hi>Pike</hi> will devoure a fish of his own kind, that shall be bigger then this belly or throat will receive; and swallow a part of him, and let the other part remaine in his mouth till the swallowed part be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and then swallow that other part that was in his mouth, and so <pb n="145" facs="tcp:114857:81"/>put it over by degrees. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the <hi>Pike</hi> will eat vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous things (as some kind of <hi>Frogs</hi> are) and yet live without being harmed by them: for, as some say, he has in him a natural Balsome or Antidote against all Poison: and others, that he never eats a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Frog</hi> till he hath first killed her, and then (as <hi>Ducks</hi> are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do to <hi>Frogs</hi> in Spawning time, at which time some <hi>Frogs</hi> are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be venemous) so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washt her, by tumbling her up and down in the water, that he may de vour her without danger. And <hi>Gesner</hi> affirms, that a <hi>Polonian</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did faithfully assure him, he had seen two young Geese at one time in the belly of a <hi>Pike</hi>: and hee observes, that in <hi>Spain</hi> there is no <hi>Pikes,</hi> and that the biggest are in the Lake <hi>Thracimane</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the next, if not equal to them, are the <hi>Pikes</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:114857:82"/>The <hi>Pike</hi> is also observed to be a melancholly, and a bold fish; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, because he alwaies swims or rests himselfe alone, and never swims in sholes, or with company, as <hi>Roach,</hi> and <hi>Dace,</hi> and most other fish do: And bold, because he fears not a shadow, or to see or be seen of any body, as the <hi>Trout</hi> and <hi>Chub,</hi> and all other fish do.</p>
               <p>And it is observed by <hi>Gesner,</hi> that the bones, and hearts, &amp; gals of <hi>Pikes</hi> are very medicinable for several Diseases, as to stop bloud, to abate Fevers, to cure Agues, to oppose or expel the infection of the Plague, and to be many wayes medicinable and useful for the good of mankind; but that the biting of a <hi>Pike</hi> is vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and hard to be cured.</p>
               <p>And it is observed; that the <hi>Pike</hi> is a fish that breeds but once a year, and that other fish (as namely <hi>Loaches</hi>) do breed oftner; as we are certaine. Pigeons do almost every month, and <pb n="147" facs="tcp:114857:82"/>yet the Hawk, a bird of prey (as the <hi>Pike</hi> is of fish) breeds but once in twelve months: and you are to note, that his time of breeding or Spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is usually about the end of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi>; or somewhat later, in <hi>March,</hi> as the weather proves colder or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: and to note, that his manner of breeding is thus, a He and a She <hi>Pike</hi> will usually go together out of a River into some ditch or creek, and that there the Spawner casts her eggs, and the Melter hovers over her all that time that she is casting her Spawn, but touches her not. I might say more of this, but it might be thought curiosity or worse, and shall therefore forbear it, and take up so much of your attention as to tell you, that the best of <hi>Pikes</hi> are noted to be in Rivers, then those in great Ponds or Meres, and the worst in smal Ponds.</p>
               <p>And now I shall proceed to <pb n="148" facs="tcp:114857:83"/>give you some directions how to catch this <hi>Pike</hi>
                  <figure/>
which you have with so much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence heard me talk of.</p>
               <p>His feeding is usually <hi>fish</hi> or <hi>frogs,</hi> and sometime a weed of his owne, called <hi>Pikrel-weed,</hi> of which I told you some think some <hi>Pikes</hi> are bred; for they have observed, that where no <hi>Pikes</hi> have been put into a Pond, yet that there they have been found, and that there has been plenty of <pb n="149" facs="tcp:114857:83"/>that weed in that Pond, and that that weed both breeds and feeds them; but whether those <hi>Pikes</hi> so bred will ever breed by generation as the others do, I shall leave to the disquisitions of men of more curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and leisure then I profess my self to have; and shall proceed to tell you, that you may fish for a <hi>Pike,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ledger, or a walking bait; and you are to note, that I call that a ledger which is fix'd, or made to rest in one certaine place when you shall be absent; and that I call that a walking bait, which you take with you, and have ever in motion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which two, I shall give you this direction, That your ledger bait is best to be a living bait, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a fish or a Frog; and that you may make them live the longer, you may, or indeed you must take this course:</p>
               <p>First, for your live bait of fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>h, a <hi>Roch</hi> or <hi>Dace</hi> is (I think) best and most <pb n="150" facs="tcp:114857:84"/>tempting and a <hi>Pearch</hi> the longest liv'd on a hook; you must take your knife, (which cannot be too sharp) and betwixt the head and the fin on his back, cut or make an insition, or such a scar as you may put the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wyer of your hook into it, with as little bruising or hurting the fish as Art and diligence will enable you to do, and so carrying your arming wyer along his back, unto, or neer the tail of your fish, betwixt the skin and the body of it, draw out that wyer or arming of your hook at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other scar neer to his tail; then tye him about it with thred; but no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then of necessitie you must to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent hurting the fish; and the better to avoid hurting the fish, some have a kind of probe to open the way; for the more easie entrance and passage of your wyer or arming: but as for these, time and a little experience will teach you better than I can by words; for of this I will for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <pb n="151" facs="tcp:114857:84"/>say no more, but come next to give you some directions how to bait your hook with a Frog.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Viat.</speaker>
               <p>But, good Master, did not you say even now, that some <hi>Frogs</hi> were venomous, and is it not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to touch them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but I wil give you some Rules or Cautions concerning them. And first, you are to note, there is two kinds of <hi>Frogs</hi>; that is to say, (if I may so express my self) a <hi>flesh</hi> and a <hi>fish-frog:</hi> by flesh <hi>Frogs,</hi> I mean, <hi>frogs</hi> that breed and live on the land; and of these there be several sorts and colours, some being peckled, some greenish, some blackish, or brown: the green <hi>Frog,</hi> which is a smal one, is by <hi>Topsell</hi> taken to be venomous; and so is the <hi>Padock,</hi> or <hi>Frog-Padock,</hi> which usually keeps or breeds on the land, and is very large and bony, and big, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the She <hi>frog</hi> of that kind; yet these will sometime come into the water, <pb n="152" facs="tcp:114857:85"/>but it is not often; and the land <hi>frogs</hi> are some of them observed by him, to breed by laying eggs, and others to breed of the slime and dust of the earth, and that in winter they turn to slime again, and that the next Summer that very slime returns to be a living creature; this is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Pliny</hi>: and <note n="*" place="margin">In his 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, <hi>De subtil. ex.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Cardanas</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to give reason for the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Frogs</hi>; but if it were in my power, it should rain none but water <hi>Frogs,</hi> for those I think are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, especially the right water <hi>Frog,</hi> which about <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> breeds in ditches by slime and blackish eggs in that slime, about which time of breeding the He and She <hi>frog</hi> are observed to use divers simber salts, and to croke and make a noise, which the land <hi>frog,</hi> or <hi>Padock frog</hi> never does. Now of these water <hi>Frogs,</hi> you are to chuse the yellowest that you can get, for that the <hi>Pike</hi> ever likes best, And thus use your <pb n="153" facs="tcp:114857:85"/>
                  <hi>Frog,</hi> that he may continue long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live:</p>
               <p>Put your hook into his mouth, which you may easily do from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>April</hi> till <hi>August,</hi> and then the <hi>Frogs</hi> mouth grows up and he continues so for at least six months without eating, but is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained, none, but he whose name is Wonderful, knows how. I say, put your hook, I mean the arming wire, through his mouth and out at his gills, and then with a fine needle and Silk sow the upper part of his leg with only one stitch to the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wire of your hook, or tie the <hi>frogs</hi> leg above the upper joint to the armed wire, and in so doing use him as though you loved him, that is, harme him as little as you may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, that he may live the longer.</p>
               <p>And now, having given you this direction for the baiting your ledger hook with a live fish or frog, my next must be to tell you, how your <pb n="154" facs="tcp:114857:86"/>hook thus baited must or may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and it is thus: having fastned your hook to a line, which if it be not fourteen yards long, should not be less than twelve; you are to fasten that line to any bow neer to a hole where a <hi>Pike</hi> is, or is likely to lye, or to have a haunt; and then wind your line on any forked stick, all your line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a half yard of it, or rather more, and split that forked stick with such a nick or notch at one end of it, as may keep the line from any more of it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling from about the stick, then so much of it as you intended; and chuse your forked stick to be of that bigness as may keep the <hi>fish</hi> or <hi>frog</hi> from pulling the forked stick under the water till the <hi>Pike</hi> bites, and then the <hi>Pike</hi> having pulled the line forth of the clift or nick in which it was gently fastned, will have line e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to go to his hold and powch the bait: and if you would have this ledger bait to keep at a fixt place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed <pb n="155" facs="tcp:114857:86"/>by wind or other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which may drive it to the shoare side (for you are to note, that it is likeliest to catch a <hi>Pike</hi> in the midst of the water) then hang a small Plummet of lead, a stone, or piece of tyle, or a turfe in a string, and cast it into the water, with the forked stick to hang upon the ground, to be as an Anchor to keep the forked stick from moving out of your intended place till the <hi>Pike</hi> come. This I take to be a very good way, to use so many ledger baits as you intend to make tryal of.</p>
               <p>Or if you bait your hooks thus, with live fish or Frogs, and in a windy day, fasten them thus to a bow or bundle of straw, and by the help of that wind can get them to move cross a <hi>Pond</hi> or <hi>Mere,</hi> you are like to stand still on the shoar and see sport, if there be any store of <hi>Pikes</hi>; or these live baits may make sport, being tied about the body or <pb n="156" facs="tcp:114857:87"/>wings of a <hi>Goose</hi> or <hi>Duck,</hi> and she chased over a Pond: and the like may be done with turning three or four live baits thus fastned to blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or boughs, or bottles of hay, or flags, to swim down a <hi>River,</hi> whilst you walk quietly on the shore along with them, and are still in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sport. The rest must be taught you by practice, for time will not alow me to say more of this kind of fishing with live baits.</p>
               <p>And for your dead bait for a <hi>Pike,</hi> for that you may be taught by one dayes going a fishing with me or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other body that fishes for him, for the baiting your hook with a dead <hi>Gudgion</hi> or a <hi>Roch,</hi> and moving it up and down the water, is too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a thing to take up any time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to do it; and yet, because I cut you short in that, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute for it, by telling you that that was told me for a secret: it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:114857:87"/>
                  <hi>Dissolve</hi> Gum of Ivie <hi>in Oyle of</hi> Spike, <hi>and therewith annoint your dead bait for a</hi> Pike, <hi>and then cast it into a likely place, and when it has layen a short time at the bottom, draw it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top of the water, and so up the stream, and it is more then likely that you have a</hi> Pike <hi>follow you with more then common eagerness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This has not been tryed by me, but told me by a friend of note, that pretended to do me a courtesie: but if this direction to catch a Pike thus do you no good, I am certaine this direction how to roste him when he is caught, is choicely good, for I have tryed it, and it is somewhat the better for not being common; but with my direction you must take thisCaution, that your Pike must not be a smal one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First open your</hi> Pike <hi>at the gills, and if need be, cut also a little slit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his belly; out of these, take his guts, and keep his liver, which you <pb n="158" facs="tcp:114857:88"/>are to shred very small with:</hi> Time, Sweet Margerom, <hi>and a little</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Savoury; <hi>to these put some pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Oysters, <hi>and some</hi> Anchovis, <hi>both these last whole for the</hi> Anchovis <hi>will melt, and the</hi> Oysters <hi>should not.) to these you must add also a pound of sweet Butter, which you are to mix with the herbs that are shred, and let them all be well salted (if the</hi> Pike <hi>be more then a yard long, then you may put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these herbs more then a pound, or if he be less, then less Butter will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:) these being thus mixt, with a blade or two of Mace, must be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Pike's <hi>belly, and then his belly so sowed up; then you are to thrust the spit through his mouth out at his tail; and then with four, or five, or six split sticks or very thin laths, and a convenient quantitie of tape or filiting, these laths are to be tyed round about the</hi> Pike's <hi>body, from his head to his tail, and the tape tied somewhat thick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his breaking or falling off from <pb n="159" facs="tcp:114857:88"/>the spit; let him be roasted very leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and often basted with Claret wine, and anchovis, and butter mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and also with what moisture falls from him into the pan: when you have rosted him sufficiently, you are to hold under him (when you unwind or cut the tape that ties him) such a dish as you purpose to eat him out of, and let him fall into it with the sawce that is rosted in his belly; and by this means the</hi> Pike <hi>will be kept unbroken and complete; then to the sawce, which was within him, and also in the pan, you are to add a fit quantity of the best butter, and to squeeze the juice of three or four Oranges: lastly, you may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put into the</hi> Pike <hi>with the</hi> Oysters; <hi>two cloves of Garlick, and take it whole out when the</hi> Pike <hi>is cut off the spit, or to give the sawce a hogoe, let the dish (into which you let the</hi> Pike <hi>fall) be rubed with it; the using or not using of this Garlick is left to your discretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:114857:89"/>This dish of meat is too good for any but Anglers or honest men; and, I trust, you wil prove both, and therefore I have trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with this Secret.

               <p>THE <hi>Carp</hi> is a stately, a good, and a subtle fish, a fish that hath not (as it is said) been long in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but said to be by one Mr. <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> (a Gentleman then living at <hi>Plumsted</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi>) brought into this Nation: and for the better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, you are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I told you that <hi>Gesner</hi> sayes, there is not a <hi>Pike</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Eele, which lives longest out of the water, there is none that will endure more hardness, or live longer then a <hi>Carp</hi> will out of it, and so the report of his being brought out of a forrain Nation into this, is the more probable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carps</hi> and <hi>Loches</hi> are observed to breed several months in one year, <pb n="162" facs="tcp:114857:90"/>which most other fish do not, and it is the rather believed, because you shall scarce or never take a <hi>Male Carp</hi> without a <hi>Melt,</hi> or a <hi>Female</hi> without a <hi>Roe</hi> or <hi>Spawn</hi>; and for the most part very much, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all the Summer season; and it is observed, that they breed more naturally in Ponds then in running waters, and that those that live in Rivers are taken by men of the best palates to be much the better meat.</p>
               <p>And it is observed, that in some Ponds <hi>Carps</hi> will not breed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in cold Ponds; but where they will breed, they breed innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, if there be no <hi>Pikes</hi> nor <hi>Pearch</hi> to devour their Spawn, when it is cast upon grass, or flags, or weeds, where it lies ten or twelve dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be enlivened.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carp,</hi> if he have water room and good feed, will grow to a very great bigness and length: I have <pb n="163" facs="tcp:114857:90"/>heard, to above a yard long; though I never saw one above thirty three inches, which was a very great and goodly fish.</p>
               <p>Now as the increase of <hi>Carps</hi> is wonderful for their number; so there is not a reason found out, I think, by any, why the should breed in some Ponds, and not in others of the same nature, for soil and all other circumstances; and as their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so are their decayes also very mysterious; I have both read it, and been told by a Gentleman of tryed honestie, that he has knowne sixtie or more large <hi>Carps</hi> put into several Ponds neer to a house, where by reason of the stakes in the Ponds, and the Owners constant being neer to them, it was impossible they should be stole away from him, and that when he has after three or four years emptied the Pond, and expected an increase from them by breeding young ones (for that they might do <pb n="164" facs="tcp:114857:91"/>so, he had, as the rule is, put in three Melters for one Spawner) he has, I say, after three or four years found neither a young nor old <hi>Carp</hi> remaining: And the like I have known of one that has almost watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Pond, and at a like distance of time at the fishing of a Pond, found of seventy or eighty large <hi>Carps,</hi> not above five or six: and that he had forborn longer to fish the said Pond, but that he saw in a hot day in Summer, a large <hi>Carp</hi> swim neer to the top of the water with a <hi>Frog</hi> upon his head, and that he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occasion caused his Pond to be let dry: and I say, of seventie or eighty <hi>Carps,</hi> only found five or six in the said Pond, and those very sick and lean, and with every one a Frog sticking so fast on the head of the said <hi>Carps,</hi> that the Frog would not bee got off without extreme force or killing, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that did affirm this to me, told <pb n="165" facs="tcp:114857:91"/>me he saw it, and did declare his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to be (and I also believe the same) that he thought the other <hi>Carps</hi> that were so strangely lost, were so killed by <hi>Frogs,</hi> and then devoured.</p>
               <p>But I am faln into this discourse by accident, of which I might say more, but it has proved longer then I intended, and possibly may not to you be considerable; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you three or four more short observations of the <hi>Carp,</hi> and then fall upon some directions how you shall fish for him.</p>
               <p>The age of <hi>Carps</hi> is by S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon</hi> (in his History of Life and Death) observed to be but ten years; yet others think they live longer: but most conclude, that (contrary to the <hi>Pike</hi> or <hi>Luce</hi>) all <hi>Carps</hi> are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for age and bigness; the tongues of <hi>Carps</hi> are noted to be choice and costly meat, especially to them that buy them; but <hi>Gesner</hi> sayes, <hi>Carps</hi> 
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:114857:92"/>have no tongues like other fish, but a piece of flesh-like-fish in their mouth like to a tongue, and may be so called, but it is certain it is choicely good, and that the <hi>Carp</hi> is to be reckoned amongst those lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mouthed fish, which I told you have their teeth in their throat, and for that reason he is very seldome lost by breaking his hold, if your hook bee once stuck into his chaps.</p>
               <p>I told you, that Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> thinks that the <hi>Carp</hi> lives but ten years; but <hi>Janus Dubravius</hi> (a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> as I think) has writ a book in Latine of Fish and Fish Ponds, in which he sayes, that <hi>Carps</hi> begin to Spawn at the age of three yeers, and continue to do so till thirty; he sayes also, that in the time of their breeding, which is in Summer when the Sun hath war med both the earth and water, and so apted them also for generation, that then three or <pb n="167" facs="tcp:114857:92"/>four Male <hi>Carps</hi> will follow a Female, and that then she putting on a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coyness, they force her through weeds and flags, where she lets fall her eggs or Spawn, which sticks fast to the weeds, and then they let fall their Melt upon it, and so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a short time to be a living fish; and, as I told you, it is thought the <hi>Carp</hi> does this several months in the yeer, and most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that most fish breed after this manner, except the Eeles and it is thought that all <hi>Carps</hi> are not bred by generation, but that some breed otherwayes, as some <hi>Pikes</hi> do.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said out of him, and out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which <hi>Dubravius</hi> often quotes in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but it might rather perplex then satisfie you, and therefore I shall rather chuse to direct you how to catch, then spend more time in <pb n="168" facs="tcp:114857:93"/>discoursing either of the nature or the breeding of this <hi>Carp,</hi>
                  <figure/>
or of any more circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, but yet I shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you of what I told you before, that he is a very subtle fish and hard to be caught.</p>
               <p>And my first direction is, that if you will fish for a <hi>Carp,</hi> you must put on a very large measure of <hi>patience,</hi> especially to fish for a <hi>River Carp:</hi> I have knowne a very good Fisher <pb n="169" facs="tcp:114857:93"/>angle diligently four or six hours in a day, for three or four dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a <hi>River Carp,</hi> and not have a bite: and you are to note, that in some Ponds it is as hard to catch a <hi>Carp</hi> as in a River; that is to say, where they have store of feed, &amp; the water is of a clayish colour; but you are to remember, that I have told you there is no rule without an exception, and therefore being possest with that hope and patience which I wish to all Fishers, especially to the <hi>Carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Angler,</hi> I shall tell you with what bait to fish for him; but that must be either early or ate, and let me tell you, that in hot weather (for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will seldome bite in cold) you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee too early or too late at it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carp</hi> bites either at wormes or at Paste; and of worms I- think the blewish Marsh or Meadow worm is best; but possibly another worm not too big may do as well, and so <pb n="170" facs="tcp:114857:94"/>may a Gentle; and as for Pastes, there are almost as many sorts as there are Medicines for the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, but doubtless sweet Pastes are best; I mean, Pastes mixt with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or with Sugar; which, that you may the better beguile this crafty fish, should be thrown into the Pond or place in which you fish for him some hours before you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your tryal of skil by the Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rod: and doubtless, if it be thrown into the water a day or two before, at several times, and in smal pellets, you are the likelier when you fish for the <hi>Carp,</hi> to obtain your desired sport: or in a large Pond, to draw them to any certain place, that they may the better and with more hope be fished for; you are to throw into it, in some certaine place, either grains, or bloud mixt with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, or with bran; or any Garbage, as Chickens guts or the like, and then some of your smal sweet pellets, <pb n="171" facs="tcp:114857:94"/>with which you purpose to angle; these smal pellets, being few of them thrown in as you are Angling.</p>
               <p>And your Paste must bee thus made: Take the flesh of a Rabet or Cat cut smal, and Bean-flower, or (if not easily got then) other flowre, and then mix these together, and put to them either Sugar, or Honey, which I think better, and then beat these together in a Mortar; or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times work them in your hands, (your hands being very clean) and then make it into a ball, or two, or three, as you like best for your use: but you must work or pound it so long in the Mortar, as to make it so tough as to hang upon your hook without washing from it, yet not too hard; or that you may the better keep it on your hook, you may kneade with your Paste a little (and not much) white or yellowish wool.</p>
               <p>And if you would have this Paste keep all the year for any other fish, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:114857:95"/>then mix with it <hi>Virgins-wax</hi> and <hi>clarified honey,</hi> and work them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your hands before the fire; then make these into balls, and it will keep all the yeer.</p>
               <p>And if you fish for a <hi>Carp</hi> with Gentles, then put upon your hook a small piece of Scarlet about this big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <figure/>, it being soked in, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with <hi>Oyl of Peter,</hi> called by some, <hi>Oyl of the Rock</hi>; and if your Gentles be put two or three dayes before into a box or horn anointed with Honey, and so put upon your hook, as to preserve them to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, you are as like to kill this craftie fish this way as any other; but still as you are fishing, chaw a little white or brown bread in your mouth, and cast it into the Pond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place where your slote swims. Other baits there be, but these with diligence, and patient watchfulness, will do it as well as any as I have ever practised, or <pb n="173" facs="tcp:114857:95"/>heard of: and yet I shall tell you, that the crumbs of white bread and honey made into a Paste, is a good bait for a <hi>Carp,</hi> and you know it is more <hi>easily</hi> made. And having said thus much of the <hi>Carp,</hi> my next discourse shal be of the <hi>Bream,</hi> which shall not prove so tedious, and therefore I desire the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your attention.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Bream</hi> being at a fuli growth, is a large and stately fish, he will breed both in Rivers and Ponds, but loves best to live in Ponds, where, if he likes the aire, he will grow not only to be very large, but as fat as a Hog, he is by <hi>Gesner</hi> taken to be more pleasant or sweet then wholesome; this fish is long in growing, but breeds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in a water that pleases him, yea, in many Ponds so fast, as to over store them, and starve the other fish.</p>
               <p>The Baits good for to catch the <hi>Bream</hi> are many; as namely, young Wasps, and a Paste made of brown bread and honey, or Gentels, or <pb n="175" facs="tcp:114857:96"/>especially a worm, a worm that is not much unlike a Magot, which you will find at the roots of <hi>Docks,</hi> or of <hi>Flags,</hi> or of <hi>Rushes</hi> that grow in the water, or watry places, and a <hi>Grashopper</hi> having his legs nip'd off, or a flye that is in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> to be found amongst the green Reed, growing by the water side, those are said to bee excellent baits. I doubt not but there be many others that both the <hi>Bream</hi> and the <hi>Carp</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so would bite at; but these time and experience will teach you how to find out: And so having according to my promise given you these short Observations concerning the <hi>Bream,</hi> I shall also give you some Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the <hi>Tench,</hi> and those also very briefly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tench</hi> is observed to love to live in Ponds; but if he be in a River, then in the still places of the River, he is observed to be a Physician to <pb n="176" facs="tcp:114857:97"/>other fishes, and is so called by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have been searchers into the nature of fish; and it is said, that a <hi>Pike</hi> will neither devour nor hurt him, because the <hi>Pike</hi> being sick or hurt by any accident, is cured by touching the <hi>Tench,</hi> and the <hi>Tench</hi> does the like to other fishes, either by touching them, or by being in their company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Randelitius</hi> sayes in his discourse of fishes (quoted by <hi>Gesner</hi>) that at his being at <hi>Rome,</hi> he saw certaine Jewes apply <hi>Tenches</hi> to the feet of a sick man for a cure; and it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that many of those people have many Secrets unknown to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, secrets which have never been written, but have been successsive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly since the dayes of <hi>Solomon</hi> (who knew the nature of all things from the Shrub to the Cedar) delivered by tradition from the father to the son, and so from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration without writing, or (unless <pb n="177" facs="tcp:114857:97"/>it were casually) without the least communicating them to any other Nation or Tribe (for to do so, they account a profanation): yet this fish, that does by a natural inbred Balsome, not only cure himselfe if he be wounded, but others also, loves not to live in clear streams pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with gravel, but in standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where mud and the worst of weeds abound, and therefore it is, I think, that this <hi>Tench</hi>
                  <figure/>
is by so many accounted better for <pb n="178" facs="tcp:114857:98"/>Medicines then for meat: but for the first, I am able to say little; and for the later, can say positively, that he eats pleasantly; and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you a few, and but a few directions how to catch him.</p>
               <p>He will bite at a Paste made of brown bread and honey, or at a Marsh-worm, or a Lob-worm; he will bite also at a smaller worm, with his head nip'd off, and a Cod-worm put on the hook before the worm; and I doubt not but that he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the three hot months (for in the nine colder he stirs not much) bite at a Flag-worm, or at a green Gentle, but can positively say no more of the <hi>Tench,</hi> he being a fish that I have not often Angled for; but I wish my honest Scholer may, and be ever fortunate when hee fishes.</p>

               <p>You say true, Scholer, the <hi>Pearch</hi> is a very good, and a very bold biting fish, he is one of the fishes of prey, that, like the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Trout,</hi> carries his teeth in his mouth, not in his throat, and dare venture to kill and devour another fish; this fish, and the <hi>Pike</hi> are (sayes <hi>Gesner</hi>) the best of fresh water fish; he Spawns but once a year, and is by Physicians held very nutritive; yet by many to be hard of digestion: They abound more in the River <hi>Poe,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> (sayes <hi>Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litius</hi>) then other parts, and have in their brain a stone, which is in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain parts sold by Apothecaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there noted to be very medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against the stone in the reins: These be a part of the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <pb n="180" facs="tcp:114857:99"/>which some Philosophycal brain have bestowed upon the fresh-water <hi>Pearch,</hi> yet they commend the Sea <hi>Pearch,</hi> which is known by having but one fin on his back, (of which they say, we <hi>English</hi> see but a few) to be a much better fish.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pearch</hi> grows slowly, yet will grow, as I have been credibly informed, to be almost two foot long; for my Informer told me, such a one was not long since taken by Sir <hi>Abraham Williams,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of worth, and a lover of Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that yet lives, and I wish he may: this was a deep bodied fish; and doubtless durst have devoured a <hi>Pike</hi> of half his own length; for I have told you, he is a bold fish, such a one, as but for extreme hunger, the <hi>Pike</hi> will not devour; for to affright the <hi>Pike,</hi> the <hi>Pearch</hi> will set up his fins, much like as a <hi>Turkie-Cock</hi> wil sometimes set up his tail.</p>
               <p>But, my Scholer, the <hi>Pearch</hi> is <pb n="181" facs="tcp:114857:99"/>not only valiant to defend himself, but he is (as you said) a bold biting fish, yet he he will not bite at all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeer; he is very abstemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Winter; and hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by some, not usually to bite till the <hi>Mulberry tree</hi> buds, that is to say, till extreme Frosts be past for that Spring; for when the <hi>Mulberry tree</hi> blossomes, many Gardners ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their forward fruit to be past the danger of Frosts, and some have made the like observation of the <hi>Pearches</hi> biting.</p>
               <p>But bite the <hi>Pearch</hi> will, and that very boldly; and as one has wittily observed, if there be twentie or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a hole, they may be at one standing all catch'd one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they being, as he saies, like the wicked of the world, not afraid, though their fellowes and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions perish in their sigh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:114857:100"/>And the baits for this bold fish
<figure/>
are not many; I mean, he will bite as well at some, or at any of these three, as at any or all others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; a <hi>Worm,</hi> a <hi>Minnow,</hi> or a little <hi>Frog</hi> (of which you may find many in hay time) and of <hi>worms,</hi> the Dunghill worm, called a <hi>brandling,</hi> I take to be best, being well scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Moss or Fennel; and if you fish for a <hi>Pearch</hi> with a <hi>Minnow,</hi> then it is best to be alive, you sticking <pb n="183" facs="tcp:114857:100"/>your hook through his back fin, and letting him swim up and down about mid-water, or a little lower, and you still keeping him to about that depth, by a Cork, which ought not to be a very light one: and the like way you are to fish for the <hi>Pearch</hi> with a small <hi>Frog,</hi> your hook being fastened through the skin of his leg, towards the upper part of it: And lastly, I will give you but this advise, that you give the <hi>Pearch</hi> time enough when he bites, for there was scarse ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Angler</hi> that has given him too much. And now I think best to rest my selfe, for I have almost spent my spirits with talking so long.</p>

            <p>IT is agreed by most men, that the <hi>Eele</hi> is both a good and a most daintie fish; but most men differ about his breeding; some say, they breed by generation as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish do; and others, that they breed (as some worms do) out of the putrifaction of the earth, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other waies; those that denie them to breed by generation, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish do, ask, if any man ever saw an <hi>Eel</hi> to have Spawn or Melt? and they are answered, That they may be as certain of their breeding, as if they had seen Spawn; for they say, that they are certain that <hi>Eeles</hi> have all parts fit for generation, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish, but so smal as not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discerned, by reason of their fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but that discerned they may <pb n="188" facs="tcp:114857:103"/>be; and that the Hee and the She <hi>Eele</hi> may be distinguished by their fins.</p>
            <p>And others say, that <hi>Eeles</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, breed other <hi>Eeles</hi> out of the corruption of their own age, which Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> sayes, exceeds not ten years. And others say, that <hi>Eeles</hi> are bred of a particular dew falling in the Months of <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> on the banks of some particular Ponds or Rivers (apted by nature for that end) which in a few dayes is by the Suns heat turned into <hi>Eeles.</hi> I have seen in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> in a River not far from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> some parts of it covered over with young <hi>Eeles</hi> about the thickness of a straw; and these <hi>Eeles</hi> did lye on the top of that water, as thick as motes are said to be in the Sun; and I have heard the like of other Rivers, as namely, in <hi>Severn,</hi> and in a <hi>pond</hi> or <hi>Mere</hi> in <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> where about a set time in Summer, such small <pb n="189" facs="tcp:114857:103"/>
               <hi>Eeles</hi> abound so much, that many of the poorer sort of people, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit near to it, take such <hi>Eeles</hi> out of this Mere, with sieves or sheets, and make a kind of <hi>Eele-cake</hi> of them, and eat it like as bread. And <hi>Gesner</hi> quotes venerable <hi>Bede</hi> to say, that in <hi>England</hi> there is an Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ely,</hi> by reason of the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of <hi>Eeles</hi> that breed in it. But that <hi>Eeles</hi> may be bred as some worms and some kind of <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Wasps</hi> are, either of dew, or out of the corruption of the earth, seems to be made probable by the <hi>Barnacles</hi> and young <hi>Goslings</hi> bred by the Suns heat and the rotten planks of an old Ship, and hatched of trees, both which are related for truths by <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartas,</hi> and our learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> and laborious <hi>Gerrard</hi> in his <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is said by <hi>Randelitius,</hi> that those <hi>Eeles</hi> that are bred in Rivers, that relate to, or be neer to the Sea, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <pb n="190" facs="tcp:114857:104"/>return to the fresh waters (as the <hi>Salmon</hi> does alwaies desire to do) when they have once tasted the salt water; and I do the more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, because I am certain that powdered Bief is a most excellent bait to catch an <hi>Eele</hi>: and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon</hi> will allow the <hi>Eeles</hi> life to be but ten years; yet he in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Life and Death, mentions a <hi>Lamprey,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, to be made tame, and so kept for almost threescore yeers; and that such useful and pleasant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations were made of this <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey,</hi> that <hi>Crassus</hi> the Oratour (who kept her) lamented her death.</p>
            <p>It is granted by all, or most men, that <hi>Eeles,</hi> for about six months (that is to say, the six cold months of the yeer) stir not up and down, neither in the Rivers nor the Pools in which they are, but get into the soft earth or mud, and there many of them together bed themselves, and live <pb n="191" facs="tcp:114857:104"/>without feeding upon any thing (as I have told you some <hi>Swallows</hi> have been observed to do in hollow trees for those six cold months); and this the <hi>Eele</hi> and <hi>Swallow</hi> do, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure winter weather; for <hi>Gesner</hi> quotes <hi>Albertus</hi> to say, that in the yeer 1125 (that years winter being more cold then usual) <hi>Eeles</hi> did by natures instinct get out of the water into a stack of hay in a Meadow upon dry ground, and there bedded themselves, but yet at last died there. I shall say no more of the <hi>Eele,</hi> but that, as it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he is impatient of cold, so it has been observed, that in warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Eele</hi> has been known to live five days out of the water. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let me tell you, that some curious searchers into the natures of fish, observe that there be several sorts or kinds of <hi>Eeles,</hi> as the <hi>silver-Eele,</hi> and green or <hi>greenish Eel</hi> (with which the River of Thames abounds, and <pb n="192" facs="tcp:114857:105"/>are called <hi>Gregs</hi>); and a blackish <hi>Eele,</hi> whose head is more flat and bigger then ordinary <hi>Eeles</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an <hi>Eele</hi> whose fins are redish, and but seldome taken in this Nation (and yet taken sometimes): These several kinds of <hi>Eeles,</hi> are (say some) diversly bred; as namely, out of the corruption of the earth, and by dew, and other wayes (as I have said to you:) and yet it is affirmed by some, that for a certain, the <hi>Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eele</hi> breeds by generation, but not by Spawning as other fish do, but that her Brood come alive from her no bigger nor longer then a pin, and I have had too many testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of this to doubt the truth of it.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Eele</hi> of which I have said so much to you, may be caught with divers kinds of baits; as namely, with powdered Bief, with a <hi>Lob</hi> or <hi>Garden-worm,</hi> with a <hi>Minnow,</hi> or gut of a <hi>Hen, Chicken,</hi> or with almost <pb n="193" facs="tcp:114857:105"/>any thing, for he is a greedy fish: but the <hi>Eele</hi> seldome stirs in the day, but then hides himselfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is usually caught by night, with one of these baits of which I have spoken, and then caught by laying hooks, which you are to fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the bank, or twigs of a tree; or by throwing a string cross the stream, with many hooks at it, and baited with the foresaid baits, and a clod or plummer, or stone, thrown into the River with this line, that so you may in the morning find it neer to some fixt place, and then take it up with a drag-hook or otherwise: but these things are indeed too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be spoken of; and an hours fishing with any <hi>Angler</hi> will teach you better, both for these, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other common things in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of <hi>Angling,</hi> then a weeks discourse. I shall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this direction for taking the <hi>Eele,</hi> by telling you, that in a warm <pb n="194" facs="tcp:114857:106"/>day in Summer, I have taken ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good <hi>Eele</hi> by <hi>snigling,</hi> and have been much pleased with that sport.</p>
            <p>And because you that are but a young Angler, know not what <hi>snig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> is, I wil now teach it to you: you remember I told you that <hi>Eeles</hi> do not usually stir in the day time, for then they hide themselvs under some covert, or under boards, or planks about Floud-gates, or Weirs, orMils, or in holes in the River banks; and you observing your time in a warm day, when the water is lowest, may take a hook tied to a strong line, or to a string about a yard long, and then into one of these holes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any boards about a Mill, or under any great stone or plank, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place where you think an <hi>Eele</hi> may hide or shelter her selfe, there with the help of a short stick put in your bait, but leisurely, and as far as you may conveniently; and it is <pb n="195" facs="tcp:114857:106"/>scarce to be doubted, but that if there be an <hi>Eel</hi> within the sight of it, the <hi>Eele</hi> will bite instantly, and as certainly gorge it; and you need not doubt to have him, if you pull him not our of the hole too quickly, but pull him out by degrees, for he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing folded double in his hole, will, with the help of his taile, break all, unless you give him time to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with pulling, and so get him out by degrees; not pulling too hard. And thus much for this present time concerning the <hi>Eele:</hi> I will next tel you a little of the <hi>Barbell,</hi> and hope with a little discourse of him, to have an end of this showr, and fal to fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the weather clears up a little.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Barbell,</hi> is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (sayes <hi>Gesner</hi>) from or by reason of his beard, or wattels at his mouth, his mouth being under his nose or chaps, and he is one of the leather mouthed fish that has his teeth in his throat, he loves to live in very swift streams, and where it is gravelly, and in the gravel will root or dig with his nose like a Hog, and there nest himself, taking so fast hold of any weeds or moss that grows on stones, or on piles about <hi>Weirs,</hi> or <hi>Floud-gates,</hi> or <hi>Bridges,</hi> that the water is not able, be it never so swift, to force him from the place which he seems to contend for: this is his constant custome in Summer, when both he, and most living creatures joy and sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <pb n="197" facs="tcp:114857:107"/>in the Sun; but at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Winter, then he forsakes the swift streams and shallow waters, and by degrees retires to those parts of the River that are quiet and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; in which places, (and I think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time) he Spawns; and as I have formerly told you, with the help of the Melter, hides his Spawn or eggs in holes, which they both dig in the gravel, and then they mutually labour to cover it with the same sand to prevent it from being devoured by other fish.</p>
                  <p>There be such store of this fish in the River <hi>Danubie,</hi> that <hi>Randeitius</hi> sayes, they may in some places of it, and in some months of the yeer, be taken by those that dwel neer to the River, with their hands, eight or ten load at a time; he sayes, they begin to be good in <hi>May,</hi> and that they cease to be so in <hi>August</hi>; but it is f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This fish is of a fine cast and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some shape,

and may be rather said not to be ill, then to bee good meat; the <hi>Chub</hi> and he have (I think) both lost a part of their credit by ill Cookery, <pb n="199" facs="tcp:114857:108"/>they being reputed the worst or coarsest of fresh water fish: but the <hi>Barbell</hi> affords an <hi>Angler</hi> choice sport, being alustie and a cunning fish; so lustie and cunning as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the breaking of the Anglers line, by running his head forcibly towards any covert or hole, or bank, and then striking at the line, to break it off with his tail (as is observed by <hi>Plutark,</hi> in his book <hi>De industria a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalium</hi>) and also so cunning to nibble and suck off your worme close to the hook, and yet avoid the letting the hook come into his mouth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Barbell</hi> is also curious for his baits, that is to say, that they be clean and sweet; that is to say, to have your worms well scowred, and not kept in sowre or mustie moss; for at a well scowred Lob-worm, he will bite as boldly as at any bait, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, if the night or two before you fish for him, you shall bait the <pb n="200" facs="tcp:114857:109"/>places where you intend to fish for him with big worms cut into pieces: and Gentles (not being too much scowred, but green) are a choice bait for him, and so is cheese, which is not to be too hard, but kept a day or two in a wet linnen cloth to make it tough; with this you may also bait the water a day or two before you fish for the <hi>Barbel,</hi> and be much the likelier to catch store; and if the cheese were laid in clarified honey a short time before (as namely, an hour or two) you were still the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to catch fish; some have dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to cut the cheese into thin pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and toste it, and then tye it on the hook with fine Silk: and some advise to fish for the <hi>Barbell</hi> with Sheeps tallow and soft cheese beaten or work'd into a Paste, and that it is choicely good in <hi>August,</hi> and I believe it: but doubtless the Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm well scoured, and the Gentle not too much scowred, and cheese <pb n="201" facs="tcp:114857:109"/>ordered as I have directed, are baits enough, and I think wil <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  <p>We thank you, and intend once in a Month to call upon you again, and give you a little warning, and so good night; good night <hi>Maudlin.</hi> And now, good Master, lets lose no time, but tell me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of fishing; and if you please, first something of fishing for a <hi>Gudgion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
                  <p>I will, honest Scholer. The <hi>Gudgion</hi> is an excellent fish to eat, and good also to enter a young <hi>Angler</hi>; he is easie to bee taken with a smal red worm at the ground and is one of those leather mouthed <pb n="204" facs="tcp:114857:111"/>fish that has his teeth in his throat, and will hardly be lost off from the hook if he be once strucken: they be usually scattered up and down every River in the shallows, in the heat of Summer; but in <hi>Autome,</hi> when the weeds begin to grow sowre or rot, and the weather colder, then they gather together, and get into the deeper parts of the water, and are to be fish'd for there, with your hook alwaies touching the ground, if you fish for him with a flote or with a cork; but many will fish for the <hi>Gudgion</hi> by hand, with a running line upon the ground without a cork as a <hi>Trout</hi> is fished for, and it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way.</p>
                  <p>There is also another fish called a <hi>Pope,</hi> and by some a <hi>Ruffe,</hi> a fish that is not known to be in some Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; it is much like the <hi>Pearch</hi> for his shape, but will not grow to be bigger then a <hi>Gudgion</hi>; he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fish, no fish that swims is of a <pb n="205" facs="tcp:114857:111"/>pleasanter taste; and he is also excellent to enter a young <hi>Angler,</hi> for he is a greedy biter, and they will usually lye abundance of them together in one reserved place where the water is deep, and runs quietly, and an easie Angler, if he has found where they lye, may catch fortie or fiftie, or sometimes twice so many at a standing.</p>
                  <p>There is also a <hi>Bleak,</hi> a fish that is ever in motion, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by some the River Swallow; for just as you shall observe the <hi>Swallow</hi> to be most evenings in Summer ever in motion, making short and quick turns when he flies to catch flies in the aire, by which he lives, so does the <hi>Bleak</hi> at the top of the water; and this fish is best caught with a fine smal Artificial Fly, which is to be of a brown colour, and very smal, and the hook answerable: There is no better sport then whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Bleaks</hi> in a boat in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <pb n="206" facs="tcp:114857:112"/>evening, with a hazle top about five or six foot long, and a line twice the length of the Rod. I have heard Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> say, that there be many that in <hi>Italy</hi> will catch <hi>Swallows</hi> so, or especially <hi>Martines</hi> (the Bird-Angler standing on the top of a Steeple to do it, and with a line twice so long, as I have spoke of) and let me tell you, Scholer, that both <hi>Martins</hi> and <hi>Blekes</hi> be most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent meat.</p>
                  <p>I might now tell you how to catch <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Dace,</hi> and some other fish of little note, that I have not yet spoke of; but you see we are almost at our lodging, and indeed if we were not, I would omit to give you any directions concerning them, or how to fish for them, not but that they be both good fish (being in season) and especially to some palates, and they also make the Angler good sport (and you know the Hunter sayes, there is more sport in hunting <pb n="207" facs="tcp:114857:112"/>the Hare, then in eating of her) but I will forbear to give you any directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning them, because you may go a few dayes and take the pleasure of the fresh aire, and bear any common Angler company that fishes for them, and by that means learn more then any direction I can give you in words, can make you capable of; and I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore end my discourse, for yonder comes our brother <hi>Peter</hi> and honest <hi>Coridon,</hi> but I will promise you that as you and I fish, and walk to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row towards <hi>London,</hi> if I have now forgotten any thing, that I can then remember, I will not keep it from you.</p>
                  <p>Well met, Gentlemen, this is luckie th at we meet so just together at this very door. Come Hostis, where are you? is Supper ready? come, first give us drink, and be as quick as you can, for I believe wee are all very hungry. Wel, brother <pb n="208" facs="tcp:114857:113"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Coridon</hi> to you both; come drink, and tell me what luck of fish: we two have caught but ten <hi>Trouts,</hi> of which my Scholer caught three; look here's eight, and a brace we gave away: we have had a most pleasant day for fishing, and talking, and now returned home both weary and hungry, and now meat and rest will be pleasant.</p>

Come Hostis, give us more Ale, and our Supper with what haste you may, and when we have sup'd, lets have your Song, <hi>Piscator,</hi> and the Ketch that your Scholer promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <pb n="209" facs="tcp:114857:113"/>us, or else <hi>Coridon</hi> wil be doged.</p>

               <p>GOod Master, as we go now towards <hi>London,</hi> be still so courteous as to give me more instructions, for I have several boxes in my memory in which I will keep them all very safe, there shall not one of them be lost.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Well Scholer, that I will, and I will hide nothing from you that I can remember, and may help you forward towards a perfection in this Art; and because we have so much time, and I have said so little of <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Dace,</hi> I will give you some directions concerning some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of baits with which they be usually taken; they will bite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at any flies, but especially at <pb n="221" facs="tcp:114857:119"/>Ant-flies; concerning which, take this direction, for it is very good.</p>
               <p>Take the blackish <hi>Ant-fly</hi> out of the Mole-hill, or Ant-hil, in which place you shall find them in the Months of <hi>June</hi>; or if that be too early in the yeer, then doubtless you may find them in <hi>July, August,</hi> and most of <hi>September</hi>; gather them alive with both their wings, and then put them into a glass, that will hold a quart or a pottle; but first, put into the glass, a handful or more of the moist earth out of which you gather them, and as much of the roots of the grass of the said Hillock; and then put in the flies gently, that they lose not their wings, and so many as are put into the glass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bruising, will live there a month or more, and be alwaies in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for you to fish with; but if you would have them keep longer, then get any great earthen pot or barrel <pb n="222" facs="tcp:114857:120"/>of three or four gallons (which is better) then wash your barrel with water and honey; and having put into it a quantitie of earth and grass roots, then put in your flies and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and they will live a quarter of a year; these in any stream and clear water are a deadly bait for <hi>Roch</hi> or <hi>Dace,</hi> or for a <hi>Chub,</hi> and your rule is to fish not less then a handful from the bottom.</p>
               <p>I shall next tell you a winter bait for a <hi>Roch,</hi> a <hi>Dace,</hi> or <hi>Chub,</hi> and it is choicely good. About <hi>All-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantide</hi> (and so till Frost comes) when you see men ploughing up heath-ground, or sandy ground, or greenswards, then follow the plough, and you shall find a white worm, as big as two Magots, and it hath a red head, (you may observe in what ground most are, for there the Crows will be very watchful, and follow the Plough very close) it is all soft, and full of whitish guts; a <pb n="223" facs="tcp:114857:120"/>worm that is in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and some other Countries called a <hi>Grub,</hi> and is bred of the spawn or eggs of a Beetle, which she leaves in holes that she digs in the ground under Cow or Horse-dung, and there rests all Winter, and in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> comes to be first a red, and then a black Beetle: gather a thousand or two of these, and put them with a peck or two of their own earth into some tub or firkin, and cover and keep them so warm, that the frost or cold air, or winds kill them not, and you may keep them all winter and kill fish with them at any time, and if you put some of them into a little earth and honey a day before you use them, you will find them an excellent baite for <hi>Breame</hi> or <hi>Carp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after this manner you may also keep <hi>Gentles</hi> all winter, which is a good bait then, and much the better for being lively and tuffe, or <pb n="224" facs="tcp:114857:121"/>you may breed and keep Gentle thus: Take a piece of beasts liver and with a cross stick, hang it in some corner over a pot or barrel half full of dry clay, and as the Gentles grow big, they wil fall into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and scowre themselves, and be alwayes ready for use whensoever you incline to fish; and these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles may be thus made til after <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi>: But if you desire to keep Gentles to fish with all the yeer, then get a dead <hi>Cat</hi> or a <hi>Kite,</hi> and let it be fly-blowne, and when the Gentles begin to be alive and to stir, then bury it and them in moist earth, but as free from frost as you can, and these you may dig up at any time when you intend to use them; these wil last till <hi>March,</hi> and about that time turn to be flies.</p>
               <p>But if you be nice to fowl your fingers (which good Anglers sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are) then take this bait: Get a handful of well made Mault, and <pb n="225" facs="tcp:114857:121"/>put it into a dish of water, and then wash and rub it betwixt your hands til you make in cleane, and as free from husks as you can; then put that water from it, and put a smal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of fresh water to it, and set it in something that is fit for that purpose, over the fire, where it is not to boil apace, but leisurely, and very softly, until it become some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what soft, which you may try by feeling it betwixt your finger and thumb; and when it is soft, then put your water from it, and then take a sharp knife, and turning the sprout end of the corn upward, with the point of your knife take the back part of the husk off from it, and yet leaving a kind of husk on the corn, or else it is marr'd; and then cut off that sprouted end (I mean a little of it) that the vvhite may appear, and so pull off the husk on the cloven side (as I directed you) and then cutting off a very little of the other end, that <pb n="226" facs="tcp:114857:122"/>so your hook may enter, and if your hook be small and good, you will find this to be a very choice bait ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Winter or Summer, you sometimes casting a little of it into the place where your flote swims.</p>
               <p>And to take the <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Dace,</hi> a good bait is the young brood of Wasps or Bees, baked or hardned in their husks in an Oven, after the bread is taken out of it, or on a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shovel; and so also is the thick blood of <hi>Sheep,</hi> being halfe dryed on a trencher that you may cut it into such pieces as may best fit the size of your hook, and a little salt keeps it from growing black, and makes it not the worle but better; this is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a choice bait, if rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>There be several Oiles of a strong smel that I have been told of, and to be excellent to tempt fish to bite, of which I could say much, but I remember I once carried a small <pb n="227" facs="tcp:114857:122"/>bottle from Sir <hi>George Hastings</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> (they were both chimical men) as a great present; but upon enquiry, I found it did not answer the expectation of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> which with the help of other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, makes me have little belief in such things as many men talk of; not but that I think fishes both smell and hear (as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in my former discourse) but there is a mysterious knack, which (though it be much easier then the Philosophers-Stone, yet) is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by common capacities, or else lies locked up in the braine or brest of some chimical men, that, like the <hi>Rosi-crutions,</hi> yet will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it. But I stepped by chance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this discourse of Oiles, and fishes smelling; and though there might be more said, both of it, and of baits for <hi>Roch</hi> and <hi>Dace,</hi> and other flote fish, yet I will forbear it at this time, and tell you in the next place how <pb n="228" facs="tcp:114857:123"/>you are to prepare your tackling: concerning which I will for sport sake give you an old Rhime out of an old Fish-book, which will be a part of what you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>My rod, and my linc, my flote and my lead,</l>
                  <l>My hook, &amp; my plummet, my whetstone &amp; knife,</l>
                  <l>My Basket, my baits, both living and dead,</l>
                  <l>My net, and my meat, for that is the chief;</l>
                  <l>Then I must have thxed &amp; hairs great &amp; smal,</l>
                  <l>With mine Angling purse, and so you have all.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But you must have all these tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and twice so many more, with which, if you mean to be a fisher, you must store your selfe: and to that purpose I will go with you either to <hi>Charles Brandons</hi> (neer to the <hi>Swan</hi> in <hi>Golding-lane</hi>); or to Mr. <hi>Fletchers</hi> in the Court which did once belong to Dr. <hi>Nowel</hi> the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> that I told you was a good man, and a good Fisher; it is hard by the west <pb n="229" facs="tcp:114857:123"/>end of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church; they be both honest men, and will fit an Angler with what tackling hee wants.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Wel, Scholer, and I shal be right glad to hear them; and I wil tel you whatsoever comes in my mind, that I think may be worth your hearing: you may make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choice bait thus, Take a hand ful or two of the best and biggest <hi>Wheat</hi> you can get, boil it in a little milk like as Frumitie is boiled, boil it so till it be soft, and then fry it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leisurely with honey, and a little beaten <hi>Saffron</hi> dissolved in milk, and you wil find this a choice bait, and good I think for any fish, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for <hi>Roch, Dace, Chub</hi> or <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; I know not but that it may be as good for a River <hi>Carp,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the ground be a little baited with it.</p>
               <p>You are also to know, that there be divers kinds of <hi>Cadis,</hi> or <hi>Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms,</hi> 
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:114857:124"/>that are to bee found in this Nation in several distinct Counties, &amp; in several little Brooks that relate to biggerRivers, as namely one <hi>Cadis</hi> called a <hi>Piper,</hi> whose husk or case is a piece of reed about an inch long or longer, and as big about as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a two pence; these worms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept three or four days in a wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len bag with sand at the bottom of it, and the bag wet once a day, will in three or four dayes turne to be yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and these be a choice bait for the <hi>Chub</hi> or <hi>Chavender,</hi> or-indeed for any great fish, for it is a large bait.</p>
               <p>There is also a lesser <hi>Cadis-worm,</hi> called a <hi>Cock-spur,</hi> being in fashion like the spur of a Cock, sharp at one end, and the case or house in which this dwels is made of smal <hi>husks</hi> and <hi>gravel,</hi> and <hi>slime,</hi> most curiously made of these, even so as to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, but not made by man (no <pb n="232" facs="tcp:114857:125"/>more then the nest of a bird is:) this is a choice bait for any flote fish, it is much less then the <hi>Piper Cadis,</hi> and to be so ordered; and these may be so preserved ten, fifteen, or twentie dayes.</p>
               <p>There is also another <hi>Cadis</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by some a <hi>Straw-worm,</hi> and by some a <hi>Ruffe-coate,</hi> whose house or case is made of little pieces of bents, and Rushes, and straws, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weeds, and I know not what, which are so knit together with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd slime, that they stick up about her husk or case, not unlike the <hi>bristles</hi> of a <hi>Hedg-hog</hi>; these three <hi>Cadis</hi> are commonly taken in the beginning of Summer, and are good indeed to take any kind of fish with slote or otherwise. I might tell you of many more, which, as these doe early, so those have their time of turning to be flies later in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but I might lose my selfe, <pb n="233" facs="tcp:114857:125"/>and tire you by such a discourse, I shall therefore but remember you, that to know these, and their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds, and to what flies every particular <hi>Cadis</hi> turns, and then how to use them, first as they bee <hi>Cadis,</hi> and then as they be flies, is an Art, and an Art that every one that professes Angling is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
               <p>But let mee tell you, I have been much pleased to walk quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Brook with a little stick in my hand, with which I might easily take these, and consider the curiosity of their composure; and if you shall ever like to do so, then note, that your stick must be cleft, or have a nick at one end of it, by which meanes you may with ease take many of them out of the water, before you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion to use them. These, <pb n="234" facs="tcp:114857:126"/>my honest Scholer, are some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations told to you as they now come suddenly into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, of which you may make some use: but for the practical part, it is that that makes an Angler; it is diligence, and observation, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice that must do it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pisc.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Scholer, I have held you too long about these <hi>Cadis,</hi> and my spirits are almost spent, and so I doubt is your patience; but being we are now within sight of <hi>Totenham,</hi> where I first met you, and where wee are to part, I will give you a little direction how to colour the hair of which you make your lines, for that is very needful to be known of an <hi>Angler</hi>; and also how to paint your rod, especially your top, for a right grown top is a choice Commoditie, and should be preserved from the water soking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which makes it in wet weather to be heavy, and fish ill favouredly, and also to rot quickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:114857:127"/>Take a pint of strong Ale, half a pound of soot, and a like quantity of the juice of Walnut-tree leaves, and an equal quantitie of Allome, put these together into a pot, or pan, or pipkin, and boil them half an hour, and having so done, let it cool, and being cold, put your hair into it, and there let it lye; it wil turn your hair to be a kind of water, or glass colour, or greenish, and the longer you let it lye, the deeper coloured it will bee; you might be taught to make many other colours, but it is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for doubtlesse the water or glass coloured haire is the most choice and most useful for an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you desire to colour haire green, then doe it thus: Take a quart of smal Ale, halfe a pound of Allome, then put these into a pan or pipkin, and your haire into it with them, then put it upon a fire and let it boile softly for half an hour, and <pb n="237" facs="tcp:114857:127"/>then take out your hair, and let it dry, and having so done, then take a pottle of water, and put into it two handful of Mary-golds, and cover it with a tile or what you think fit, and set it again on the fire, where it is to boil softly for half an hour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time the scum will turn yellow, then put into it half a pound of Copporis beaten smal, and with it the hair that you intend to colour, then let the hair be boiled softly till half the liquor be wasted, &amp; then let it cool three or four hours with your hair in it; and you are to observe, that the moreCopporis you put into it, the greener it will be, but doubtless the pale green is best; but if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire yellow hair (which is only good when the weeds rot) then put in the more <hi>Mary-golds,</hi> and abate most of the <hi>Copporis,</hi> or leave it out, and take a little Verdigreece in stead of it.</p>
               <p>This for colouring your hair. And as for painting your rod, which must <pb n="238" facs="tcp:114857:128"/>be in Oyl, you must first make a size with glue and water, boiled together until the glue be dissolved, and the size of a lie colour; then strike your size upon the wood with a bristle brush or pensil, whilst it is hot: that being quite dry, take white lead, and a little red lead, and a little cole black, so much as all together will make an ash colour, grind these all together with Linseed oyle, let it be thick, and lay it thin upon the wood with a brush or pensil, this do for the ground of any colour to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wood.</p>
               <stage>For a Green.</stage>
               <p>Take Pink and Verdigreece, and grind them together in Linseed oyl, as thick as you can well grind it, then lay it smoothly on with your brush, and drive it thin, once doing for the most part will serve, if you lay it wel, and besure your first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be throughly dry, before you lay on a second.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:114857:128"/>Well, Scholer, you now see <hi>Toten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and I am weary, and therefore glad that we are so near it; but if I were to walk many more dayes with you, I could stil be telling you more and more of the mysterious Art of Angling; but I wil hope for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunitie, and then I wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with many more, both necessary and true observations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning fish and fishing: but now no more, lets turn into yonder Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for it is a cleane and cool place.</p>

               <p>'Tis a faire motion, and I will requite a part of your courtesies with a bottle of <hi>Sack,</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> and <hi>Oranges</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> which all put together, make a drink too good for any body, but us Anglers: and so Master, here is a full glass to you of that liquor, and when you have pledged me, I wil repeat the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which I promised you, it is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py printed amongst Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
