            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ACCCOUNT Of ſeveral of the moſt Remarkable TRYALS That were Tryed at the Seſſions-houſe in the <hi>OLD-BAILEY,</hi> At the Seſſions holden there for the City of <hi>London</hi> and County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> begun on Friday the Tenth of this inſtant <hi>September,</hi> and euding on Munday the Thirteenth of the ſame: with a particular Relation of the Robbery committed on the <hi>Bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND THE Tryal and Sentence of Mrs. <hi>Eliz. Cellier</hi> the Popiſh Midwife: With the Number of thoſe Condemned to Die, Burnt in the Hand, Whipt, and to be Tranſported.</p>
            <p>FIrſt <hi>Thomas Sutton</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Browne,</hi> pretended to be his Wife, were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and brought upon their Tryals, for Breaking and Robbing the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Richard King,</hi> a Mercer upon the <hi>Bridge,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Olives Southwark;</hi> the manner of the Robbery was as follows: The two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before-mentioned, on the 8th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, being Sabbath day, as it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, having Intelligence that Mr. <hi>King</hi> and all his Family (except his Maid-ſervant, by name <hi>Joan Elge)</hi> was gone to Church, came and knocked at the door; upon which, the Maid peeping through the Key-hole, demanded what they would have? their anſwer was, That they were friends of Mr. <hi>Kings,</hi> and would needs ſpeak with him: the Maid replyed he was not within: to which <hi>Sutton</hi> anſwered, that his Wife and he were newly come out of the Countrey, and that the Air was not agreeing with her, ſhe was taken ſick coming over the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and that if ſhe would open the door, they would ſtay till Mr. <hi>King</hi> come home; upon which ſhe opened it and let them in, they telling her that they were her Maſters Cozens, and ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to admire the Furniture of the Houſe, commending it above whatever they ſaw in the Country; the Woman ſtill feigning herſelf ſick: and ſo cunning were they, that they would not believe the Wench, though ſhe ſeveral times affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was none at home but her ſelf; till asking for a Vault, ſhe told him, it was up ſtairs at the top of the Houſe, where going up, he ſtaid but a very ſhort time, and then coming down again, went ſeemingly to kiſs the Maid, and thereupon clapt his hands to her Throat, ſaying, <hi>He came for Money;</hi> at which ſurprize ſhe crying out, the Woman cry'd, <hi>God dam her cut her Throat,</hi> and thereupon both of them falling upon her, bound her, and then ſearching for a Knife, at laſt found one, with which they endeavoured to cut her Throat; but ſhe with ſtrugling got her hands looſe, and wreſted the Knife out of their hands, upon which they binding her faſter, upon promiſe ſhe would no more cry out, left her, and went to breaking open the Trunks and Cheſts, and got one Silver Baſon, ſix Silver Plates, two dozen of Spoons, two Tankards, one Sugar-diſh; and then breaking open the ſhop-door, got a hundred and ninety ſeven pounds in money; but in the time they were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, the Maid got looſe, though all bloody, ſhut her ſelf into a Room, and cryed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95616:2"/>
out Thieves, Murther; upon which ſeveral of the Neighbours coming, broke open the door, but e're they came into the Houſe, the now Priſoners were got out of the Cellar-windows upon the Piles, where the Woman was taken, and ſhortly after the Man, who was got off in a Boat; upon ſearching of him, there was about fifteen pounds found in his breeches, the reſt they onely removed, but had no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of carrying it away. Upon their Tryals they pleaded both guilty to the Felony, and were by the Jury brought in guilty of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The next was one <hi>John Salter,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins in the fields,</hi> who was Indicted for being an Aider and Abetter to one <hi>Henry Lee,</hi> now fled, in the Murthering of one Mr. <hi>Dobſon,</hi> the manner thus: They being together at Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Griffin</hi>'s Chamber in the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> happened to fall out about a wager of a Guiney, which cauſed <hi>Dobſon</hi> to give <hi>Lee</hi> the Lye, upon which he drew his Sword: the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſeeing that, endeavoured to pacifie the quarrel, but before he could any ways hinder them, they had cloſed with each other, and the party dead had wreſted the others Sword out of his hand; whereupon, Mr. <hi>Salter</hi> interpoſing, deſired them to deſiſt, but <hi>Lee</hi> being inraged, ſnatched <hi>Salters</hi> Sword from his ſide, and with the ſame, over his Shoulder ran <hi>Dobſon</hi> into the body, juſt under the left pap, of which Wound the 16th of the ſame inſtant he dyed; but there being not the leaſt ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Malice proved againſt the Priſoner, the Jury acquitted him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tibia Hog</hi> was Tryed for ſtealing two pieces of Indian Silk from <hi>Thomas Suttel</hi> Indian-gown-ſeller in the <hi>New Exchange</hi> in the <hi>Strand:</hi> ſhe coming to his ſhop, cheapned ſeveral parcels of ſilk, and thereby took the opportunity whilſt they were buſie, to ſlip two pieces under her Coats, valued at ten pounds; but being perceived by a youth that ſtood in an oppoſite ſhop, who told Mr. <hi>Suttel</hi> of the ſame, he went to ſearch her, whereupon ſhe dropped the ſame. Upon her Tryal ſhe denyed that ever ſhe touched, or had any ſuch parcel of Silk; but the Evidence was ſo plain, that the Jury brought her in guilty of the Felony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Duffer</hi> was tried for breaking the Shop of <hi>Thomas Weſtwood</hi> a Barber in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> and taking thence eight Razers, three pair of Cizars, three Napkins, one pair of Beard-irons, one Perriwig, and ſeveral other things. The Felony and Burglary were both proved againſt him by his former Confeſſion, and by a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whom he ſold one of the Razers to, though Newgate had taught him the impudence to deny his former aſſeveration; yet upon the teſtimony that was given againſt him he was brought in guilty of the Felony and Burglary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Bucknal</hi> was tried for Murthering her Male Baſtard-childe on the 24th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt; the manner of the Fact according to the Evidence was as enſues. She living in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> and lodging with another woman, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two of the Clock in the Morning found her pains come faſt upon her, aroſe, (the other being ſo faſt aſleep that ſhe perceived it not, as ſhe ſwore) and was by her ſelf delivered, but not ſo ſecretly but that the other Woman heard ſome noiſe; whereupon ſhe asked her what was the matter; to which ſhe repli'd, that ſhe had bought the day before one pennyworth of Damſons, and that by eating them ſhe had ſurfeited her ſelf, the which had caus'd her to Vomit; upon which anſwer her Bed-fellow went to ſleep: ſhe taking the opportunity thereof, thruſt the Child between the Bed and the Mat, where it was afterwards found: Upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe denied that ſhe any way made away with the Childe, but that it was ſtill-born, which availed her not; for upon the reading of the Act of Parliament made to prevent ſuch Cruelties, ſhe having none to juſtifie that is was Still-born, was found guilty of the Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Cole,</hi> of <hi>Biſhops-gate-ſtreet London,</hi> was tried for a Felony and Burglary, for robbing his Lodging, breaking open the Doors and Desks therein, and taking thence three or four pair of Flaxen Sheets, two Callico Pillowbeers, two Table-cloths, ſeveral Curtains and Valens, beſides Apparel, as Petticoats, Scarfs and Hoods, as likewiſe Thread and Gimp, all to the value of ſeven or eight pounds; this

he effected one Morning before any of the houſe were ſtirring, carrying them clear off without the leaſt diſcovery, leaving one that he pretended was his Wife in bed the mean while. And alſo ſeveral Pick-lock Keys were found that would open all the Houſe-doors, Trunks, Cheſts, and other faſtenings in the houſe; and was ſo impudent as not long after to ſend a Meſſenger for them, and ſome other things he had by over-haſte forgot, whereupon by the directions of the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was apprehended, and now upon Trial denied the Fact, but Mrs. <hi>Davis</hi> who loſt the Goods, and ſeveral belonging to the houſe, atteſting he onely had the Key of the Room and no body elſe, the Jurots gave their Verdict againſt him as to the Felony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Cleverard,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Edmonds Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> was arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for High-Treaſon, as Clipper of the current and lawful Coyn of this Realm, bringing ſeveral clipp'd Halt-crowns newly clipped to a Goldſmith, mixed with other large Money to change for Guineys; upon which ſhe was apprehended, and upon further enquiry found where ſhe Lodged, and in her poſſeſſion was found a pair of ſmall Sheers, Clippings, and other ſuchlike things, which ſhe ſaid was her Husband's; and that he being a working Silver-ſmith, and that he uſed them in his employ; and there being no proof of her clipping any piece, ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Hains</hi> was brought to the Bar, and tried for robbing one <hi>Herbert</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces to the value of five or ſix Pounds. The Indictment lay for taking them from his perſon in St. <hi>Bartholmew's-lane;</hi> but in Court he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſwear it, ſo that the Priſoner being known to be a notorious Beggar, the Jury thought a whipping might reform him, and ſo brought him in guilty to the value of Ten pence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Conway</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife were tried for robbing the houſe of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Bale</hi> of <hi>Iſlington</hi> in the day-time, and putting <hi>Anne Davis,</hi> a little Girl, in corporal fear of her Life. They being Vagrants, came to the Houſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Bale,</hi> and deſired him to lodge them in his Out-houſe or Shed that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to his Dwelling-houſe, which he conſented to; but they to require him for it, watching the opportunity of his Abſence, got into the Houſe through a hole in the Wall, which they alleadge was broke before, and then ſending the little Girl out for Bread and Cheeſe, having firſt ſtilled her from crying, by Threats and Promiſes, in the mean ſpace they went up ſtairs, and took away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hoods, Scarfs, Dreſſings, and the like, a Coat, Breeches and Doublet, with ſome Moneys, and many other things; but being ſhortly apprehended, they were committed to Newgate; and the proof upon their Tryals being very plain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, the former was found guilty of the Felony; but the latter being his Wife, could not be found ſo, and therefore was acquitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Johnſon</hi> took her Tryal for ſtealing a Silver-Tankard from Mr. <hi>Par</hi> in <hi>Covent-garden</hi> valued at eight Pounds and upwards, which ſhe ſold to a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Wife for Five Pounds or thereabouts. Her taking of it away was thus: She coming into the Houſe, there being none but a Maid-ſervant at home, to whom ſhe related, that meeting her Miſtriſs and another Woman, ſhe ordered her to come and ſtay there till ſhe came home, and withal deſired the Maid to fetch her a Tankard of Ale; which ſhe refuſing, ſhe again requeſted her to give her ſome ſmall Beer, the which whilſt ſhe was gone to fetch, ſhe opened the Cupboard, and took the Tankard thence, and e're the Maid returned was gone. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved againſt her, ſhe was brought in guilty of the Felony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Johnſon</hi> was brought to the Bar and Tryed, for Robbing her Maſter of of Four pound ten ſhillings, the which ſhe ſaid he gave her to debauch her; but no ſuch thing appearing in Court, ſhe was found guilty of the Felony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary Call, alias White Reed,</hi> was Tryed for Robbing of <hi>Henry Worley,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Giles in the fields,</hi> of a Petticoat, Gown, Pinners, Dreſſings, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95616:3"/>
and ſeveral other things, the which were taken upon her, and ſhe upon plain Evidence was brought in guilty.</p>
            <p>On the Eleaventh of this Inſtant, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> between three and four of the Clock in the Afternoon, was <hi>Elizabeth Cellier</hi> brought upon her Trial, being taken up the day before by a Bench warrant, granted for that purpoſe by the Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> for publiſhing a ſcandalous Libel, entituled, <hi>Malice defeated,</hi> in which was not onely ſeveral private men ſcandalized, but alſo the whole Government and Laws of the Nation. Several Witneſſes came in againſt her to prove that ſhe was the Author of it, and that ſhe handed the Copy to the Preſs, paying ten ſhillings a ream for printing of it. The Printer ſwore that he printed ſeveral of the Sſheets, in which were contain'd the matter and ſubſtance of the Indictment, which was long, importing that ſhe the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Cellier,</hi> Wife to <hi>Peter Cellier,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s <hi>Danes,</hi> had publiſhed in her ſaid ſcandalous Libel, that Racks and Tortures were uſed to make the Catholicks confeſs a Plot when there was none; and that <hi>Praunce</hi> and one <hi>Corrale</hi> a Coachman were ſo ſerved in Newgate; farther laying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Murther of his late Majeſty to the charge of the Proteſtants; and that the King's Evidence were Devils, and not men; with ſeveral Reflections upon ſome Peers of this Realm: to all which ſhe pleaded <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> and that ſhe was not the Author of the Book, though the day before ſhe had confeſſed and owned that ſhe did it, but as to the proof of that, one <hi>John Peny</hi> ſwore in Court, that he bought two of them of her at her own houſe in <hi>Arundel-ſtreet</hi> in the Pariſh aforeſaid, giving for the ſame the ſum of four ſhillings, and that ſhe owned to him that they were her own, that is, that ſhe was Author of the Libel; upon which, after her having mades long Apology for her ſelf, the Court gave the Jury their Charge, who going out and ſtaying about half an hour, brought her in guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Miſdemeanour or Treſpaſs, and ſhe was ordered into Cuſtody under the juriſdiction of the Keeper of Newgate, and all the ſaid Libels that could be found in her houſe or elſewhere appertaining to her, were ordered to be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
