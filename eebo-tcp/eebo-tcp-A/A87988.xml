         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
From two
PROTESTANT MINISTERS IN ENGLAND,
To the PRESBYTERIAN MINISTERS and People in Glaſgow in
SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>FRIENDS we have write theſe Lines to you, to be rightly informed, whether the
Report we have heard, concerning the Inhabitants of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
towards the <hi>Quakers</hi> be true or not: For it's the common Diſcourſe
in this Country, that the Presbyterians with you, do Beat, Stone, Pull, Hail,
and drage them by the Head and Shoulders, out of their Meetings, teare their Cloaths,
ſhede their Blood: And that ſome of them have been laid for Dead by ſome of you!
And their Goods without Law taken out of their Meeting-houſe, &amp; themſelves not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
quietly to be Entertained in common Inns, for their refreſhment! This however is
confidently Reported in diverſe Places in <hi>England,</hi> to the great Scandal and Reproach
of Profeſſors; The Practice being very inconſiſtant with that Chriſtian Maxime, worthy
the conſideration of all Men: <hi>Viz. Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris;</hi> But Peradventure
you may ſay, to excuſe your ſelves, that they differ from all other people, ſo ſay
we here, and yet the Law protects them; And indeed your Actions to the foreſaid
people, differ from all here, except the former <hi>Popiſh</hi> perſecutors; And aſſure your
ſelves, if you proceed as we are informed, you have of late done, you will bring your
ſelves, &amp; your Friends here, under the ſame Scandalous Denomination, that the perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Papiſts have had, and do yet ly under perſecution for conſcience ſake; Which they
pretend is a thing ſo hateful and Unreaſonable, <hi>Conſcience being</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith,) <hi>free
from the power of all Men.</hi> Therefore we deſire you to take the Advice of your Friends,
and Well Wiſhers here in <hi>England,</hi> who formerly have ſuffered for Meeting to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
GOD, as we perceive they now do by you: But if they by their Meeting do break
any good Law, made by the Government, then we Adviſe you to make application
to the Government, for your Aſſiſtance, and do not diſquiet them by a Scandalous
Rude Rable, of the Scum of the City, as they terme them; For have you not read
in the Holy Scriptures, and Books of the Holy <hi>Martyers, How it was the wicked that
alwayes perſecuted the Righteous:</hi> By which they have left an evil fame upon Record
to poſterity; Read the Hiſtory of <hi>Mordiea</hi> and <hi>Hamon:</hi> Sirs, We adviſe you, and it's for
the beſt, if any <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> of the foreſaid people come into your City, and be abuſed
as ſome of late have been, if we be rightly informed, they will no doubt make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the Government, who will hear and relieve them, as late Experience doth
ſhew; We beſeech you therefore, be adviſed, for if you proceed in this Method, it will
tend to the diſquiet of you in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and alſo to our diſturbance who are your late
perſecuted Friends and Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> F. L. and W R.</p>
