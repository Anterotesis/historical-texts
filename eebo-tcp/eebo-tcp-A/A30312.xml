            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable JOHN LORD <hi>LORN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Impute it to my good Fortune, My Lord, that the first appearance of this Play was on a <hi>Wednesday</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi>; for then (it seems) the Town look for a bad Entertainment, and if they met with any thing they did not expect; it was a disappointment that, I presume; they'll forgive.</p>
            <p>I confess it has succeeded beyond my Expectation, since I understand that Your Lordship also has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to speak in it's Favour. But You did not apprehend what You drew upon Your Self when you was doing so, and little thought, from commending the Brat, to have it laid at Your Door.</p>
            <p>But tho' your approbation in Publick makes me proud, yet the delicacy of your Judgment in private keeps me humble; your Understanding discovers all faults, but your good breeding will not let you take Notice of any, and you can discourage no body, but when they attempt to imitate you.</p>
            <p>If I had oftener had the honour to have been near your Lordship; the Conversation of the Comedy wou'd have discover'd it; and tho' it be my misfortune to be
<pb facs="tcp:47921:3"/>
almost a stranger to your Person. Yet I may safely affirm, that I am throughly acquainted with your Character, and to speak but truth of you, wou'd look too like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
            <p>I might inlarge upon the Antiquity of your Race, were I so vain, as to hope to add any thing to the honour of what's recorded in our Annals; I might dwell upon those Qualifications, that render you so amiable to all that know you, the Unaffected sincerity of your Nature, your Zeal for the welfare of your Country; your exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Bravery, and just Sence of true Honour; but to do this, my Lord, wou'd be to entertain you with the daily Discourse of your Friends; as for Enemies, you have none but those you found in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where you were giving Commands to a Regiment, at an Age that others are receiving Precepts from a Tutor.</p>
            <p>I dare say no more, tho' at the same time I disoblige one, I gratifie a thousand; for you are the only Person that can't bear to hear the Lord <hi>Lorn</hi> well spoke of: But since I would not purchase their approbation at the rate of your displeasure, I must relieve your Lordship from the pain of hearing what's your due, and only tell you that I am,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your Lordship's Most Devoted Humble Servant.</signed>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> don't know whether I have more reason to be pleas'd or griev'd at the Fate of this Play; for the World is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jealous of applause, and he is sure to make a great many Enemies, that is so unfortunate to succeed.</p>
            <p>Some have already done me the Honour to say, that it was not all Mine; tho' I am surpriz'd at the imputation, that what I once believed too great a Dowdy to belong to ev'n my self; should deserve to be thought another's! But the uneasy Criticks, upon a nearer view of its Features, have mortify'd me, and more judiciously concluded, that no Body wou'd own it but my self.</p>
            <p>All that I shall say to these last is, that I did not design a just Play, and that I am as well pleas'd as they are, that I had no regard to the Vnities of Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my Friends, without offending the Ladies, I have my wish.</p>
            <p>These angry Gentlemen, I presume, will thank me for one thing, in the Third Act, and that is, I have put a Pun in the Mouth of the fine Lady; a Gentleman very remarkable for his good Nature and good Sence; told me of it before it was Acted, but he agreed with me, to allow the Folly, for the sake of the Diversion; it succeeded as we guest, and was always Clap'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47921:4"/>I confess I have had some grave Thoughts on the Occasion of such Labours, and methinks 'tis very strange, that the chief thing, that flatters the vanity of most Writers, is, what they can't know, for Fame is a good that never arrives to us till we are past injoying it, and we are only immortal when we are no more; as for my self, I presume, it will appear by what I have done, that I as little value, as deserve, that Honour, notwithstanding I don't doubt, but I shall be yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to have my share of the vanity; and that 'twill always be one reason of writing, to be thought a little wiser than we are

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>SInce Novelties your Palates still pursue,</l>
            <l>You have to Night, both Play and Poet new:</l>
            <l>From whence alone his hopes of pleasing grew.</l>
            <l>For so much this prevailing Passion thrives,</l>
            <l>Each for his future Appetite contrives,</l>
            <l>New Friends, new Favourites, and of late—new Wives.</l>
            <l>You Criticks only keep your Old disease,</l>
            <l>When Authors please you least, you're most at ease.</l>
            <l>Our Poet's therefore glad of a pretence,</l>
            <l>To be insipid, in his own defence,</l>
            <l>And if you hiss, 'tis still at your Expence.</l>
            <l>Often for change the meanest things are good,</l>
            <l>Thus tho' the Town all delicates afford,</l>
            <l>A Kit-cat is a Supper for a Lord.</l>
            <l>But if your Nicer tast resolves to Day,</l>
            <l>To have no relish for our Author's Play.</l>
            <l>Place some diverting Scene before your Mind,</l>
            <l>And think of that, to which you will be kind.</l>
            <l>So thus when heavily the moments pass,</l>
            <l>Toaster's to Circulate the lazy Glass</l>
            <l>By nameing some bright Nymph their draughts refine,</l>
            <l>And tast at once the joys of Love and Wine.</l>

               <p>And 'tis his only way to gain it, for trust me <hi>Clarinda,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so distastful as a Husband's fondness, and you had better be hated of the Man you Love, than Lov'd of the Man you hate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>Then we must hate if we Marry!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
               <p>You'll find it difficult to Love, for Marriage sets the Object too near us, and Love is a fine Flower, that loses its Scent if we keep it always at our Nose.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>Where is the fault then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps 'tis in our selves—our Pleasures languish when they become familiar to us, and 'tis in Love as in Ambition, our thirst is still for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we have not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>I fansie the Dominion they pretend over us, may be one reason, and methinks the slavery's misplac'd, for the Government of Love shou'd be in the Women; They always make the Lover happy in his Chains; but—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
               <p>Husbands, alas! Are like other Tyrants, the greatest good we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from 'em, is to do no harm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>You indeed have reason to think so, for to a Woman of any Spleen, Sir <hi>Soloman</hi> must needs be of a very unlucky temper, and seems to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar in him to Create aversion, for he is always talking, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways giving his impertinent Advice.</p>

               <p>No, but she is an Apothecaries Shop, she holds all his Drugs, she has her Physick for every hour of the Day and Night — her Bed is lin'd with Poppies, the black Boys at the Feet, that the vulgar imploy to bear Flowers in their Arms, she loads with <hi>Diascordium,</hi> and other sleepy Potions, that the little Devils seem to nod o'er their Charge — her sweet Bags are not perfum'd with such common stuff, and offensive to the Brain, as Musk and Amber; but they breath the Delightful and Salubrious Scents of Hartshorn, Rue, and <hi>Assefetida.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cle.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, <hi>Tom,</hi> this is not half the Evil, her humour is as strange as her Dyet — all about her must have fine Airs, and if she cou'd, her Posti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion shou'd be a Gentleman — she setled a Pension upon one of her Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for losing a Foretooth, and said he was maim'd in her service.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cle.</speaker>
               <p>The best way to avoid that danger, wou'd be to marry her; for most Wives may be Antimonial Cups long enough, without being found out of their Husbands; but to prevent that, <hi>Tom,</hi> I design to break all the Glasses, and kick the Doctor down Stairs, on the Wedding day; and so I have told her.</p>

               <p>I find then you'd Cure her of her Physick by a Counter-Poyson—but prithee <hi>Cleremont</hi> let me prevail with you to leave this humour of abusing Marriage; 'tis a mean Entertainment, and there's not a Porter in Town but can be too witty for you in it.</p>

               <p>Madam, your Ladyship, I am sure will be in Love with 'em, I have made 'em to the Newest Fashion; some <hi>French</hi> Ladies were at my Shop Yesterday, and I cut 'em exactly with theirs.

               <speaker>Lady.</speaker>
               <p>Never worse <hi>Dr.</hi> but I know the reason, it was my Visiting-Night, and my Old Lady <hi>Linger</hi> stay'd after all were gone, and unmercifully kept me up, at least half an hour beyond my time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas unsufferable, Madam, but I'll order something to compose your Ladyship, and repair that misfortune.</p>

               <p>I like the Air of this Ruffle mightily — The <hi>French</hi> are certainly the most agreeable People upon Earth — Do they wear 'em so low?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pert.</speaker>
               <p>Exactly, an' please your Ladyship—the Bottom of the Lace must agree with the Tip of your Ladyship's little Finger — To wear it higher, wou'd show too much of your Ladyship's Arm.</p>

               <p>Which I wou'd not do by any means—it looks like a Washerwoman, to bare above the Ring—<hi>Dr.</hi> I long to enter on my New course of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, but Pray let me have nothing in it, that may any way interrupt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my Visits, for I wou'd not purchase health so dear, as with the loss of one Days agreements.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But you ask his Pardon there — I told you how 'twould be! Now, <hi>Tom,</hi> don't you, like some Generals, half flush'd with Victory, loose the Day by being too sure of it: There is Conduct to be used in Love as well as War, and you should pursue as well as Conquer— It was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Character, to be able to get a Battle, but not to keep it; but be you a <hi>Caesar</hi> in Love, and trust not your Enemy out of your sight; the next thing you do, is to get acquainted with her Husband.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fre.</speaker>
               <p>That's the Old way; but methinks it is drawing the Danger too near his Eyes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Sol.</hi>

               <p>Ay, so near, that he'll near be able to see it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fre.</speaker>
               <p>Yet it is better done by a Friend— for first, if I keep him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany abroad, I but make Opportunities that I can't use.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Then you should drink him down at home.</p>

               <p>And so while I am qualifying him for a Cuckold, put it out of my Power to make him one.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Talk what you will, <hi>Tom,</hi> ones bosom Friend is the properest Person to make one a Cuckold: then I'd fain have you acquainted with him, if it be only to see if there is any truth in that Old saying, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fond — My dear Rogue! of them that make 'em—He'll have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Affection for thee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fre.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose, according to the degree of mine, for his Wife; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is very grateful, before it is corrupted with Knowledge.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Ha! ha! Well, certainly the Life of a Cuckold is a very happy one, as long as he does not know it— for all that do him the favour, are still ready to wait on him, and to humour him; and he, without knowing why, is mightily in love with them— Well, <hi>Tom,</hi> you do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you bring this about— besides, I wou'd not be so unfashionably wicked, as not to make a Friend where I made a Cuckold.</p>

               <p>Many People are Fops in their Mien and Habit, but her Ladiship is so in her Understanding, and takes as much Pains to punish her Inside, as to adorn her Out.</p>

               <p>I have made at least twenty Visits to day, and not above Ten were at home, which I take to be a great good Fortune, in having my Day's Journey so happily shortned to your Ladiship, for in you I terminate my Evening: And 'tis so bless'd a thing to arrive where one loves, after the tedious Endearments of so many one hates in a Day's visiting. Huh! Huh! —</p>

               <p>Why, Madam, at my Lady <hi>Thrivewell</hi>'s in the City, who knows no other Happiness, and thinks there is no other Welcome but Eating and Drinking! At the Sight of her Table I was ready to swoon, coming out of the Air! Huh!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>At the upper End sat her Ladiship, and at each Elbow a Daughter with Arms like Plough-Men, and Cheeks like Milk-Maids — They were enough to beat one down with their Breath —</p>

               <p>The Table, (or rather Larder) was fill'd with <hi>Westphalia</hi> Hams, Pullets, and Turkey-Pies; with a great <hi>Cheshire</hi> Cheese, that rival'd every one in bulk but her Ladiship; and a large Tankard of Ale, enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy a Dozen Porters.

               <p>To see the Titles of Quality join'd with such Mob Dispositions! Well, there's nothing distinguishes the Commons so much as their Eating; and I never knew a true Plebeian but was a hungry — Huh! huh!</p>

               <p>Your Ladiship knows the Elegance of Life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>I aim at it a little — But there is one Mark by which you may know such Creatures, tho' you don't see 'em; for it is the most Essential Property of the Vulgar to speak loud; their common Discourse is some Degrees above the Noise of a Drum. For which Reason, when any raises their Voice above a Whisper, I strait conclude, That they are either no Quality, or at most but half Blood; and 'tis likely the Fault might be of the Side of the Mother.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha! Your Ladiship is certainly the most entertaining Creature!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>But now Ladies, exactly opposite to this, is the Life of the Refin'd and Well-bred part of the Creation. The Vulgar, like other Beasts, are up and Feeding before it is Day; but about a Delicate Creature every thing is slow and solemn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>The Noises of the Streets, Madam, must be great Enemies to that Quiet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>So great, that I have often wonder'd why the Government don't provide against so manifest a Barbarism. They should defend our Ears against offensive Sounds, and banish all that had the little Breeding to rise before Eleven a Clock.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ast.</speaker>
               <p>I shou'd vote for that Law; for I'm a mighty Friend to my Pillow—But pray, Madam, go on with your Description.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>Here then, Ladies, I must needs lament that we are in some respects not unlike the Crowd; And that it is still a Custom among us to go upon our own Legs. I have often admir'd the <hi>Chinese</hi> Nobility; who, to prevent the Infamy of so Vulgar an Exercise, contract the Feet of their Infant-Quality, and keep 'em so little, that when they are of Age they may not use 'em; and never cut their Nails that they might not be suspected to work with a Needle — Is it not a Scandal to the Nobles of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to let a <hi>Barbarian</hi> transcend 'em in so high a point of Elegance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cla.</speaker>
               <p>That, indeed, is one step to take away the Trouble of moving at all, and make 'em live the Life of a Plant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad.</speaker>
               <p>Which wou'd be truly, bless'd! For methinks People of Quality shou'd be known more by their Passions than their Figure; and that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a certain Way: For our Joy never rises above a Smile, nor our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row above the Decency and Colour of our Clothes.</p>

               <p>As ill as it does our Breeding; For our Love for the Dead is best shown in our Respect to the Living, and there the Fashion is against it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Tears are the worst Wash one can possibly use for the Complexion —

Huh, Huh!--But to make an end of this Subject; There is one thing that more remarkably distinguishes Persons of Rank from the Commons, and that is our Natural Contempt of Business.

               <p>And hope you'll find so — I never doubt a thing that depends on a Woman's Opinion of her self, for Nature has so order'd it that every one is prepar'd to believe whatever we can say of 'em.</p>

Indeed I have heard of Kings that were bred to the Plough and fancy you might Descend from such a Race, for you Court as if you were behind one — Huh! Huh! Huh! — to treat a Woman of Quality like an Exchange Wench, and express your Passion with your Arms, unpolish'd Man!</p>

            <l>For this was writ to mortifie you all.</l>
            <l>No Parson's here expos'd, no Brothel storm'd,</l>
            <l>But a kind handsome keeping <hi>Wife Reform'd.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A sign the Youth the World n'er understood,</l>
            <l>Or else he would not dare to be so good.</l>
            <l>He must the Fame he aims at quite disown,</l>
            <l>Who draws good Characters to spoil his own.</l>
            <l>This to excuse I thought a Friend he'd need,</l>
            <l>And came — sick as I am, his Cause to plead:</l>
            <l>'Tis the first Visit I protest I've made.</l>
            <l>You're sometimes kind to what I do before you;</l>
            <l>Pity the Youth, for my sake I implore you,</l>
            <l>Hissing to Death my tender Organ Wounds!</l>
            <l>And a sick Ear abhors ungrateful Sounds:</l>
            <l>Yet can Applause though ne'er so loud give Ease,</l>
            <l>For they who flatter Women always please.</l>
            <l>Then vain Assistance will I now explore</l>
            <l>In Physick and Astrology no more.</l>
            <l>You, dear Physicians, must my Health insure,</l>
            <l>And t'other Visit will confirm my Cure;</l>
            <l>Else what's already done — is all in vain,</l>
            <l>And I relapse — till you come here again.</l>
            <l>By you I shall be always to be seen,</l>
            <l>For whate'er ails the <hi>sickly Fair</hi> within,</l>
            <l>The Doctor at all Seasons is let in.</l>
