         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Papers a more cloſe
and uniform contexture of
the paſſages that make them up, if he
be ſeaſonably inform'd of the riſe and
occaſion of penning them, which was
this. The Author having many years
ago written an Eſſay about an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he made of <hi>Nitre,</hi> by whoſe <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
he endeavour'd to exemplifie
ſome parts of the Corpuſcular Philoſophy,
eſpecially the <hi>Production</hi> of <hi>Qualities;</hi>
he afterwards threw together divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
thoughts and experiments, which
he ſuppos'd might be imployed by way of
<hi>Notes,</hi> to prove or illuſtrate thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and eſpecially thoſe that concern'd
the <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bodies; and among theſe
<pb facs="tcp:44036:3"/>
obſerving thoſe that are call'd <hi>Occult,</hi>
to be Subjects uncultivated enough, (at
leaſt in the way that ſeem'd to him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,)
he propos'd to handle them more
largely than moſt of the reſt; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that Deſign he judg'd it almoſt
neceſſary, to premiſe ſome Conſiderations
and experimental Collections <hi>about</hi> the
Nature and power of Effluviums, <hi>about</hi>
the Pores of Bodies and Figures of Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles,
and <hi>about</hi> the efficacy of ſuch Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal-motions
as are wont either to be
judged very faint, or to be paſs'd by
unheeded. For he had often look'd upon
theſe three Doctrines, of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> of
<hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and of <hi>Unheeded
Motions,</hi> as the three principal Keys
to the Philoſophy of Occult Qualities. But
having hereupon made ſuch Collections,
as upon review appear'd too large to paſs
for Notes on ſo ſhort a
Text, he was induc'd to
draw them<note n="*" place="margin">And ſome that were publiſh'd <hi>An.</hi> 1669. under the Title of <hi>The Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres of conſiſtent Bodies.</hi>
               </note> into the
form (they now appear
in) of <hi>Eſſays;</hi> but he
would not put himſelf to
the trouble of doing it, with care to keep
<pb facs="tcp:44036:3"/>
them from retaiaing much of their firſt
want of exact Method and Connexion.
Nor was the Author ſolicitous to finiſh
them up, in regard that his other Studies
and occaſions made him perceive, that
in what he had deſign'd about Occult
Qualities, he had cut himſelf out more
work than probably he ſhould during many
years have opportunity to ſet upon in
earneſt, and complete. And in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
theſe Papers lay for divers years,
(as is well known to ſeveral that ſaw
them, or even tranſcrib'd ſome of them,)
and might have continued to do ſo, if
the Author had not been induc'd to let
them come abroad, <hi>partly</hi> by conſidering,
that though the Subjects, (however he
handled them) were as well important
as curious, yet he did not find himſelf
prevented by others in what he had to
publiſh about them; and <hi>partly</hi> by the
References he had made to them in ſome
other Papers, that he had promiſed his
Friends, wherein ſeveral things here
deliver'd are vouched, and others ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
And becauſe the Notes concerning
the Poroſity of greater Bodies and the
<pb facs="tcp:44036:4"/>
Figurations of minute Particles, together
with the Paper about unregarded Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
having been long laid aſide among
other neglected papers, were ſome of
them miſſing, and others ſo mis-us'd,
that they could not eaſily be made ready
to accompany thoſe that now come abroad;
the Author, that he might keep this
Book from having its dimenſions too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate,
was content to add to the
thickneſs of it, by ſubjoyning one of thoſe
little Tracts, that lay by him, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Flame,</hi> becauſe of the Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the preceding Doctrine about <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums</hi>
in general, and Experiments
that ſhew in particular the Subtilty and
the Efficacy of thoſe of Fire and Flame. And
though, to that Tract it ſelf, there belong
another, deſign'd to examine, Whether the
matter of what we call the <hi>Sun-beams,</hi>
may be brought to be ponderable; yet
ſuppoſing this, hitherto cold and wet
Summer, to be like to be as unfriendly
to the Tryals to be made with Burning-glaſſes
as of late years ſome other Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
have prov'd, he was eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with, not to make thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:44036:4"/>
that were ready, wait any longer
for thoſe, that probably will not in a
ſhort time be ſo; eſpecially ſince thoſe that
now come abroad have no dependency
upon the others.</p>

theſe Philoſophers, one of thoſe little

when it plays in the Sun-Beams, may
be compoſed of a multitude of Atoms,
and exceed many thouſands of them
in Bulk. This the Learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>
in his Notes on <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi>

a ſmall Mite, which, though ſcarce

diſtinctly diſcernable by the naked
Eye, unleſs when 'tis in motion, does
yet in a good Microſcope appear to
be a compleat Animal, furniſhed with
all neceſſary Parts; which I can
eaſily allow, having often in Cheeſe-Mites
very diſtinctly ſeen the Hair
growing upon their Legs. And to
the former Inſtance I might add,
what I have elſewhere told you of
a ſort of Animals far leſſer than
Cheeſe-Mites themſelves, namely
thoſe that may be often-times ſeen

on this occaſion,<note place="margin">In a Paper about Improbable Truths.</note>
what I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
on another
upon my own Obſervation; namely,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:9"/>
That Silver, whoſe Ductility and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctility
are very much inferiour to
thoſe of Gold, was, by my procuring,
drawn out to ſo ſlender a Wire, that,
when we meaſur'd it, which was
ſomewhat troubleſom to do, with a
long and accurate meaſure, we found,
that eight Yards of it did not yet
fully counterpoiſe one Grain: So that
we might add a Grain more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making the Scale, wherein 'twas
put, manifeſtly preponderate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Tenderneſs of the
Ballance. Whence we concluded,
that a ſingle Grain of this Wire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to 27 Foot, that is, 324
Inches. And ſince Experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inch can
by Diagonal Lines be divided into 100
parts great enough to be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd,
even for Mechanical uſes, it
follows, that a Grain of this wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
Silver may be divided into
64800 parts, and yet each of theſe
will be a true metalline, though but
ſlender and ſhort, Cylinder, which we
may very well conceive to conſiſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44036:9"/>
yet of a multitude of minuter parts.
For though I could procure no Gilt
Wire near ſo ſlender as our newly
mention'd Silver-wire; yet I tryed
that ſome which I had by me was
ſmall enough to make one Grain of
it fourteen foot long: At which
rate an Ounce did amount to a full
Mile, conſiſting of 1000 Geometrical
Paces, (of 5 foot a-piece,) and 720
foot over and above. And if now
it be permitted to ſuppoſe the Wire
to have been, as in probability it
might have been, further drawn out
to the ſame ſlenderneſs with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd
Silver-wire, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
will ſtill be far more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
for in this caſe, each of thoſe
little Cylinders, of which 64800 go
to the making of one Grain, will have
a ſuperficial <hi>Area,</hi> which, except at
the <hi>Baſis,</hi> will be cover'd with a Caſe
of Gold; which is not only ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from it by a mental Operation,
but perhaps alſo by a Chymical one.
For I remember, that from very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
gilt Wire, though I could get
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44036:10"/>
none ſo ſlender as this of meer Silver,
I did more than once, for Curioſities
ſake, ſo get out the Silver, that the
golden Films, whilſt they were in a
Liquor that plumpt them up, ſeem'd
to be ſolid wires of Gold: But when
the Liquor was withdrawn, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
(as indeed they were) to be
oblong and extremely thin and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Membranes of that Metal, which,
with an Inſtrument that had been
delicate enough, might have been
ripp'd open, and diſplayed, and been
made capable of further. Diviſions
and Subdiviſions. To this I ſhall
add, that each of the little ſilver Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders
I lately ſpake of, muſt not only
have its little <hi>Area,</hi> but its Solidity;
and yet I ſaw no reaſon to doubt, but
that it might be very poſſible, if the
Artificer had been ſo skilful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as I wiſh'd, to have drawn the
ſame quantity of Metal to a much
greater length, ſince even an Animal
ſubſtance is capable of being brought
to a ſlenderneſs much ſurpaſſing that
of our Wire, ſuppoſing the Truth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44036:10"/>
of an Obſervation of very credible
Perſons critical enough in making
Experiments, which, for a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and an Improvement of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Argument, I ſhall now ſubjoyn.
An Ingenious Gentlewoman of my
Acquaintance, Wife to a Learned
Phyſician, taking much pleaſure to
keep Silk-worms, had once the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to draw out one of the Oval Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
(which the Silk-worm ſpins, not,
as 'tis commonly thought, out of its
Belly, but out of the Mouth, whence
I have taken pleaſure to draw it out
with my Fingers,) into all the Silken-wire
it was made up of, which, to
the great wonder as well of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as her ſelf, who both inform'd
me of it, appeared to be by meaſure
a great deal above 300 Yards, and
yet weigh'd but two Grains and a
half: ſo that each Cylindrically ſhap'd
Grain of Silk may well be reckon'd
to be at leaſt 120 Yards long.</p>
                     <p>Another way, I remember, I alſo
employed to help men by the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Gold the better to conceive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44036:11"/>
the Minuteneſs of the Parts of Solid
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>We took ſix beaten Leaves of Gold,
which we meaſured one by one with
a Ruler purpoſely made for nice Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
and found them to have a
greater equality in Dimenſions, and
to be nearer true Squares, than could
be well expected: The ſide of the
Square was in each of them exactly
enough three Inches and 2/8, (or 1/4,)
which number being reduc'd to a
Decimal Fraction, <hi>viz.</hi> 3125/100, and
multiplied by it ſelf, affords 10|5625/10000
for the <hi>Area,</hi> or ſuperficial Content of
each ſquare Leaf: And this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 6, the number of the Leaves,
amounts to 63|3750/10000 ſquare Inches, for
the <hi>Area</hi> of the ſix Leaves. Theſe
being carefully weigh'd in a pair of
tender Scales, amounted all of them
to one Grain and a quarter: And ſo
one Grain of this foliated Gold was
extended to ſomewhat above fifty
Inches; which differ'd but about a
fifth part from an Experiment of the
like nature, that I remember I made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44036:11"/>
many years ago in a pair of exact
Scales; and ſo ſmall a difference may
very well be imputed to that of the
pains and diligence of the Gold-Beaters,
who do not always work
with equal ſtrength and skill, nor
upon equally fine and ductile Gold.</p>
                     <p>Now if we recal to mind what
I was lately ſaying of the actual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility
of an Inch into an hundred
ſenſible parts, and ſuppoſe an Inch
ſo divided to be applied to each ſide
of a ſquare Inch of the Leaf-Gold
newly mention'd, 'tis manifeſt that by
ſubtle parallel Lines, drawn between
all the oppoſite Points, a Grain of
Gold muſt be diviſible into five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand little Squares, very
minute indeed, but yet diſcernible by
a ſufficiently ſharp-ſighted Eye. And
if we ſuppoſe an Inch to be divided
into two hundred parts, as I lately told
you it was in a Ruler I employ, then,
according to the newly recited way,
the number of the Squares, into which
a ſingle Grain is capable of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
will amount to no leſs than two
Millions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:12"/>
There is yet another way that I
took to ſhew, that the extenſibility,
and conſequently the diviſibleneſs of
Gold is probably far more wonderful,
than by the lately mention'd Tryal
it appears.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe I went to a great
Refiner, whom I uſed to deal with
for purify'd Gold and Silver, and
inquir'd of him, how many Grains of
Leaf-Gold he was wont to allow to
an Ounce of Silver, when it was
to be drawn into gilt Wire as ſlender
as an Hair? To this he anſwer'd
me, that eight Grains was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
he allowed to an Ounce
when the Wire was to be well gilt;
but if it were to be more ſlightly
gilt, ſix Grains would ſerve the turn.
And to the ſame purpoſe I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
by a skilful Wire-drawer.
And I remember, that deſiring the
Refiner to ſhew me an Ingot of Silver,
as he did at firſt gild it; he ſhew'd
me a good fair Cylindrical Bar,
whereon the Leaf-Gold, that overlaid
the ſurface, did not appear to be by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:12"/>
odds ſo thick as fine <hi>Venetian</hi> Paper;
and yet comparing this with gilt
Wire, which I alſo deſired to ſee,
the Wire appeared to be the better
gilt of the two; poſſibly becauſe the
Gold in paſſing through the various
Holes, was by the ſides of them not
only extended but poliſhed, which
made it look more vividly than the
unpoliſh'd Leaves that gilded the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</p>
                     <p>So that, if we ſuppoſe an Ounce
of the gilt Wire formerly mention'd
to have been gilt with ſix Grains of
Leaf-Gold, it will appear by an eaſie
calculation, that at this rate one
Ounce of Gold, employ'd on gilding
Wire of that ſlenderneſs, would reach
between ninety and an hundred Miles.
But if now we further ſuppoſe, as
we lately did, that the ſlender Silver-wire,
mention'd at the beginning of
this Chapter, were gilt; though we
ſhould allow it to have (becauſe of
its exceeding ſlenderneſs,) not, (as
the former) 6 Grains, but 8 Grains
of Leaf-Gold to an Ounce of Siver,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:13"/>
it muſt be acknowledged, that an
hollow Cylinder or ſheath of Gold
weighing but eight Grains, may be
ſo ſtretch'd, that 'twill reach to no
leſs than 60 times as much (in weight)
of Silver-wire as it covers: [I ſaid
60 times, for ſo often is 8 contain'd
in 480, the number of Grains in an
Ounce;] and conſequently (a Grain
of <hi>that</hi> Wire having been found to
be 27 foot long,) the Ounce of Gold
would reach to ſeven hundred ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeven thouſand ſix hundred foot,
that is, an hundred fifty five Miles and
above a half. And if we yet further
ſuppoſe this ſuperficial or hollow
Cylinder of Gold to be ſlit all along,
and cut into as ſlender liſts or
thongs as may be, we muſt not deny
that Gold may be made to reach to
a ſtupendious length. But we need
not this laſt ſuppoſition to make
what preceded it an amazing thing:
which yet though it be indeed Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
and <hi>ſeem</hi> Incredible, ought
not at all to be <hi>judg'd</hi> Impoſſible,
being no more than what upon the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44036:13"/>
Suppoſitions and Obſervations above
laid down, does evidently follow.</p>

be actually divided, the multitude of
theſe being afforded by ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

declaring, that each of them, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,

                     <p>Among the inſtances, where the
ſmallneſs of Bodies may be deduc'd
from what is immediately the Object

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44036:14"/>
notice of the evaporation of Water,
which though it be granted to conſiſt
of groſs particles in compariſon of
the ſpirituous and odoriferous ones
of divers other Liquors, as of pure
Spirit of Wine, Eſſential Oyls of
Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet to ſhew that a ſmall
Quantity of it may be diſpers'd into
a multitude of manifeſtly viſible
Corpuſcles, I thought upon, and
more than once try'd, the rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it into Vapors by help of an
<hi>Aeolipile,</hi> wherein, when I made the
Experiment the laſt time, I took the
pains to regiſter the Event as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>We put an Ounce of common
Water into an <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> and having
put it upon a Chaſing-diſh of coals,
we obſerv'd the time when the
ſtreams of Vapors began to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.
This ſtream was for a good
while impetuous enough, as appear'd
by the noiſe it made, which would
be much increaſed, if we applied to
it at a convenient diſtance a kindled
brand, in which it would blow up
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:14"/>
the fire very vehemently. The ſtream
continued about a quarter of an hour
(ſixteen minutes or better,) but
afterwards the Wind had pauſes and
guſts for two or three minutes before
it quite ceaſed. And by reaſon of
the ſhape of the <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fram'd chiefly for other purpoſes,
was not ſo convenient for this) a
great portion of the Vapors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd
in the upper part of it, and
fell down in drops; ſo that ſuppoſing
that they alſo had come out in the
form of Wind, and the blaſt had not
been intermitted toward the latter
end, I gueſs'd it might have continued
uninterruptedly 18 or 20 minutes.
<hi>Note,</hi> That applying a meaſure to
the Smoak, that came out very viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in a form almoſt conical, where
it ſeem'd to have an Inch or more in
Diameter, 'twas diſtant from the
hole of the <hi>Aeolipile</hi> about twenty
Inches; and five or ſix Inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that, though it were ſpread ſo
much, as to have four or five Inches
in Diameter, yet the not uniform
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44036:15"/>
but ſtill-cohering Clouds (which
was the form wherein the Vapors
appear'd) were manifeſt and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</p>
                     <p>After the rarefaction of Water
when 'tis turn'd into Vapors, we
may conſider <hi>that</hi> of Fewel when 'tis
turn'd into Flame; to which purpoſe
I might here propoſe ſeveral Tryals
as well of our own as others, about
the prodigious Expanſion of ſome
Inflammable Bodies upon their being
actually turn'd into Flame. But in
this place to mention all theſe,
would perhaps too much intrench
upon another Paper; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall here propoſe to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
but one inſtance, and that
very eaſie to be tryed; of which I
find this account among my <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having oftentimes burnt Spirit of
Wine, and alſo Oyl in Glaſs-lamps,
that for certain uſes were ſo made,
that the ſurface of the Liquor was

how little the Liquor would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:15"/>
ſubſide by the waſt that was made
of it, in about half a quarter of an
hour. And yet if we conſider, that
the naked Eye after ſome Exerciſe,
may, as I have often tryed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
the motions of a <hi>Pendulum</hi> that
ſwings faſt enough to divide a ſingle
minute of an hour into 240 parts,
and conſequently half a quarter of an

into how many parts of the
time imployed by a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,
ſlow enough to be diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the Eye, may be mentally
ſubdivided; and if we further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that without intermiſſion, the
Oyl is preyed upon by an actual
Flame, and the particles of it do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
furniſh a conſiderable ſtream
of ſhining matter, that with a
ſtrange celerity is always flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
we may very well conceive,
that thoſe parts of Flame into which
the Oyl is turned, are ſtupendiouſly
minute, ſince, though the waſting
of the Oyl is in its progreſs too ſlow
to be perceived by the Eye, yet 'tis
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:16"/>
undoubted that there is a continual
decrement of the depth of the Oyl,
the Phyſical ſurfaces whereof are
continually and ſucceſſively attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and turn'd into flame; and the
ſtrange ſubtilty of the Corpuſcles of
flame would be much the ſtronglier
argued, if we ſhould ſuppoſe, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of common Oyl the flame were
nouriſh'd by a fewel ſo much more
compact and durable, as is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable
ſubſtance made of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
Body, of whoſe laſtingneſs
I have elſewhere made
particular mention,<note place="margin">In ſome Papers about <hi>Flame.</hi>
                        </note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having taught the
way of preparing it.</p>
                     <p>Having in a pair of tender Scales
carefully weigh'd out half a Grain
of good Gunpowder, we laid it on
a piece of Tile, and whelm'd over it
a veſſel of glaſs (elſewhere deſcrib'd,
and often mention'd) with a Braſs-plate
to cover the upper orifice of it.
Then having fir'd the Gunpowder,
we obſerv'd that the ſmoak of it did
opacate, and as to ſenſe ſo fill the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44036:16"/>
whole cavity of the Glaſs, though
its <hi>Baſis</hi> were eight inches, its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
height above twenty
inches, and its figure far more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
than if it were conical, and
this ſmoak, not containing it ſelf
within the veſſel, iſſued out at two or
three little intervals, that were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
left between the orifice of the
veſſel and the plate that lay upon it.
This cover we then remov'd, that
we might obſerve how long the
ſmoak would continue to aſcend;
which we found it would do for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half a quarter of an hour, and
during near half that time, <hi>(viz.</hi> the
three firſt minutes) the continually
aſcending ſmoak ſeem'd to be, at its
going out, of the ſame Diameter with
the orifice at which it iſſu'd; and it
would aſcend ſometimes a foot, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
half a yard, ſometimes two
foot or more into the Air, before it
would diſperſe and vaniſh into it.</p>
                     <p>Now if we conſider, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of this round Orifice was two
inches in Diameter, how many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44036:17"/>
of viſible Corpuſcles may we
eaſily conceive throng'd out at ſo
large an out-let in the time above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd,
ſince they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
thruſting one another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
And into ſo many viſible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of ſmoak muſt we admit, that
the half Grain of Powder was ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
beſide thoſe multitudes, which,
having been turn'd into actual flame,
may probably be ſuppos'd to have
ſuffer'd a comminution, that made
them become inviſible. And though
I ſhall not attempt ſo hopeleſs a
work, as to compute the number of
theſe ſmall Particles, yet to make an
eſtimate whereby it would appear to
be exceeding great, I thought fit to
conſider, how great the Proportion
was between the ſpaces, that to the
Eye appear'd all full of ſmoak, and
the dimenſions of the Powder that
was reſolv'd into that ſmoak. Cauſing
then the Glaſs to be fill'd with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, we found it to contain
above two and twenty Pints of that
liquor, and cauſing one of thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44036:17"/>
meaſures to be weigh'd, it was found
to weigh ſo near a pound (of ſixteen
ounces,) that the computation of the
whole Water amounted to at leaſt
160000 grains, and conſequently
320000 half grains. To which if
we add, that this Gunpowder would
readily ſink to the bottom of Water,
as being (by reaſon of the Saltpeter
and Brimſtone, that make up at leaſt
ſix parts of ſeven of it) <hi>in ſpecie</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than it, and in likelyhood twice
as heavy, (for 'tis not eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it exactly,) we may probably
gueſs the ſpace to which the ſmoak
reach'd to exceed 500000 times that,
which contain'd the unfir'd Powder;
and this, though the ſmoak, being
confin'd in the veſſel, was thereby
kept from diffuſing it ſelf ſo far as
by its ſtreaming out it ſeem'd likely
that it would have done.</p>
                     <p>To theſe Inſtances from Inanimate
Bodies I ſhall ſubjoyn one more
taken from Animals. Whereas then
men have with Reaſon wonder'd,
that ſo ſmall a Body as a Cheeſe-mite,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:18"/>

not to be taken notice of, unleſs
it move, (if even then it be ſo,) ſhould

parts; whereas this, I ſay, has given
juſt occaſion to conclude, that the

be extremely ſmall; I think

calls <hi>Punctum ſaliens,</hi> diſcloſes the
motion of the Heart, and the colour
of the Blood; and that even about
the ſeventh or eighth day the whole
Chick now viſibly form'd, bears
no great proportion to the whole
Egg, which is to ſupply it with
Aliment, not only for its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:18"/>
but ſpeedy growth for many
days after.</p>
                     <p>To apply this now to the matter
in hand, having ſeveral times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and ſhewn to others, that
Cheeſe-mites themſelves are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Eggs, if we conceive, that in
theſe Eggs, as in ordinary one, the
Animal at its firſt formation bears
but a ſmall proportion to the bulk of
the whole Egg, the remaining part
being to ſuffice for the food and
growth of the <hi>Embryo</hi> probably for
a pretty while; ſince, if an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
perſon, that I deſired to watch
them, did not mis-inform me, they
uſed to be about ten or twelve days
in hatching; this whole Egg it ſelf
will be allowed to be but little in
reference to the Mite it came from,
how extremely and unimaginably
minute may we ſuppoſe thoſe parts
to be, that make up the Alimental
Liquors, and even the Spirits, that
paſſing through the Nerves or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
parts, ſerve to move the Limbs
and Senſories of but, as it were,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:19"/>
the Model of ſuch an Animal, as,
when it reſts, would not (perhaps)
it ſelf to the naked Eye be ſo much
as viſible; and in which we may
preſume the nobler ſort of ſtabler
parts to be of an amazing ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if we conſider, that, though in
other hairy Animals, the Optick or
ſome other of the larger Nerves do,
I know not how many times, in
thickneſs and circuit ſurpaſs a hair
of the ſame Animal; yet in a Cheeſe-Mite,
though none of the largeſt of
thoſe Creatures, we have divers
times manifeſtly ſeen, as is before
intimated, ſingle Hairs that grow
upon the Legs.</p>
                     <p>Another way there is, that I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to give men cauſe to think,
that the inviſible <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Bodies
that wander through the Air may
be ſtrangely minute; and this was,
by ſhewing how ſmall a fragment of
matter may be reſolved into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
minute enough to aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſuch numbers with a Fluid
ſo much more denſe than Air, as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:19"/>
Water is, as to impart a determinate
Colour to the whole liquor. What
I did with <hi>Cocheneel</hi> in proſecution
of this deſign, my Experiments about
<hi>Colours</hi> may inform you; but I ſhall
now relate the ſucceſs of an attempt
made another way, for which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome of your friends the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
will thank me; though I was
not ſolicitous to carry on the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very far with Gold, not becauſe
I judged that leſs diviſible into a
number of colour'd particles, but
becauſe I found, as I expected, that
the paleneſs of the native colour of
the Gold may make it in the end leſs
conſpicuous, though, if I had then
had by me a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> as I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
had, that would diſſolve Gold
blood-red, perhaps the experiment
with Gold would have ſurpaſs'd that,
which 'tis now time I ſhould begin
to relate, as ſoon as I have hinted
to you by the way, that, for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſake, I made a tryal with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
calcin'd <hi>per ſe,</hi> that I might not
be accuſed of having omitted to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:20"/>
employ a Metal whoſe Body Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
ſuppoſe to be much opened by
Calcination. And though the event
were notable even in Compariſon of
that of the experiment made with
<hi>Cocheneel,</hi> yet my conjectures inclin'd
me much to preferr the way deſcrib'd
in the following Account.</p>
                     <p>We carefully weigh'd out in a pair
of tender Scales one grain of Copper
not-calcin'd, but barely fil'd; and
becauſe, as we made choice of this
Metal for its yielding in moſt <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums</hi>
a Blew, which is a deep and
conſpicuous colour; we alſo choſe
to make a ſolution, not in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi>
or <hi>Aqua regis,</hi> but the Spirit of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi>
(as that is an urinous Spirit,)
having found by former tryals, that
this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> would give a far deeper
ſolution than either of the others.
This lovely Liquor, of which we us'd
a good proportion, that all the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
might be throughly diſſolved,
we put into a tall cylindrical Glaſs
of about four inches in Diameter,
and by degrees pour'd to it of diſtill'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:20"/>
Water, which is more proper in this
caſe than common Water, which
has oftentimes an inconvenient Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs,
'till we had almoſt fill'd the
Glaſs, and ſaw the colour grow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pale, without being too dilute
to be manifeſt; and then we warily
pour'd this liquor into a conical
Glaſs, that it might be the more
eaſie to fill the veſſel ſeveral times to
the ſame height. This conical Glaſs
we filled to a certain mark four times
conſecutively, weighing it, and the
liquor too, as often in a pair of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Scales purpoſely made for Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
experiments, and which, though
ſtrong enough to weigh ſome pounds
in each Scale, would, when not too
much loaden, turn with about one
grain. Theſe ſeveral weights of the
Glaſs, together with the contained
liquor, we added together, and then
carefully weighing the empty Glaſs
again, we deducted four times its
weight from the above-mentioned
ſumm, and thereby found the weight
of the liquor alone, to be that, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44036:21"/>
reduc'd to grains amounted to 28534;
ſo that a grain of Copper, which is
not full half ſo heavy <hi>in ſpecie</hi> as fine
Gold, communicated a Tincture to
28534 times its weight.</p>
                     <p>But now if you pleaſe to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the ſcope of my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to ſhew, into what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of parts one grain of Copper
might be divided, you will allow
me to conſider, as I did, that this
multitude of parts muſt be eſtimated
by the Proportion, not ſo much in
weight as in bulk, of the tinging
Metal to the tinged Liquor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
ſince that divers Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical
tryals have inform'd me, that
the weight of Copper to the weight
of Water of the ſame bulk is <hi>proximè</hi>
as 9 to 1, a grain-weight of Copper
is in bigneſs but the ninth part of as
much Water as weighs a grain; and
ſo the formerly mention'd number of
the grains of Water muſt be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 9, to give us the Proportion
between the tinging and tinged Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that is, that a ſingle grain of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44036:21"/>
Copper gave a blewneſs to above
256806 parts of limpid Water, each
of them as big as it. Which, though
it may ſeem ſtupendious, and ſcarce
credible; yet I thought fit to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Experiment ſomewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by pouring all the liquor out
of the tall cylindrical Glaſs into
another clean veſſel, whence filling
the conical Glaſs twice, and emptying
it as often into the ſame cylindrical
Glaſs, the third time I fill'd the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Glaſs with colourleſs diſtill'd
Water, and pouring that alſo into
the cylindrical Glaſs, we found the
mixt liquor to have yet a manifeſt,
though but a pale, blewneſs. And,
laſtly, throwing away what was in
the cylindrical Glaſs, we poured into
it, out of the ſame conical Glaſs, equal
parts of diſtill'd colourleſs Water,
and of the tincted Liquor we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſet apart in the clean Veſſel,
and found, that, though the colour
were very faint and dilute, yet an
attentive Eye could eaſily diſcern it
to be blewiſh; and ſo it was judg'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44036:22"/>
by an intelligent Stranger that was
brought in to look upon it, and was
deſir'd to diſcover of what colour he
thought it to be. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that one grain of Copper was
able to impart a colour to above
double the quantity of Water above
mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment I have allow'd
my ſelf to be the longer and more
particular in relating, both becauſe
I know not, that any ſuch has been
hitherto either made or attempted,
and becauſe it will probably gratifie
your Chymiſts, that love to have
the Tinctures of Metals believ'd very
diffuſive; and becauſe, if Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
were not added, it would ſeem
to you as well incredible, as perhaps
it does ſeem ſtupendious, that a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of matter ſhould be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
a <hi>conſpicuous</hi> colour to above
256806 times its bulk of Water, and
a manifeſt tincture to above 385200,
(for ſo it did, when the proportion
of the ting'd part to the whole
mixture, made of it and the unting'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44036:22"/>
part, was as 2 to 31,) and a faint, but
yet <hi>diſcernible</hi> and diſtinguiſhable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to above five hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thouſand ſix hundred and twenty
times its bulk of Water.</p>

affect the Hand and Arm of him that

though their affecting the ſtriker at

to the ſtupefactive or other venemous

are as it were darted) from the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

                     <p>Other Examples belonging to this

I ſhall only add here that moſt
remarkable Proof, <hi>That ſome Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
even of ſolid Bodies, may be
ſubtil enough to get through the pores,
even of the cloſeſt Bodies;</hi> which is
afforded us by the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
which are by Magnetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſaid to penetrate without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
all kind of Bodies. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44036:24"/>
though I have not tryed this in all
ſorts, yet having tryed it in Metals
themſelves, I am apt to think, the
general Rule admits of very few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
eſpecially, if that can be
fully made out, which is affirm'd
about the perviouſneſs of Glaſs to
the Effluxions of the Loadſtone.
For, not only Glaſs is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be as cloſe a Body as any is,
but (which weighs more with me)
I have by Tryals purpoſely made,
had occaſion to admire the cloſeneſs
of very thin pieces of Glaſs. But
the reaſon why I juſt now expreſs'd
my ſelf with an <hi>If,</hi> was, becauſe I
was not entirely ſatisfied with the
Proof wont to be acquieſc'd in, of
the perviouſneſs of Glaſs; namely,
that in Dials and Sea-Compaſſes that
are cover'd with plates of Glaſs, the
Needle may be readily moved to and
fro by a Loadſtone held over it. For
theſe Plates being commonly but
faſten'd on with Wax, or at beſt
with Cement, a Sceptick may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that the magnetical <hi>Effluvia</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:25"/>
paſs not through the Glaſs, but
through that much more pervious
matter, that is imployed to ſecure the
Commiſſures, only from the acceſs
of the Air. To put then the matter
paſt doubt, I cauſed ſome Needles to
be Hermetically ſeal'd up in Glaſs-pipes,
which being laid upon the
ſurface of water (whereon by reaſon
of the bigneſs of the Cavities they
would lightly float,) the included
Needles did not only readily feel the
virtue of an externally applied Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
(though but a weak one) but
complied with it ſo well, that I could
eaſily, by the help of the Needle, lead,
without touching it, the whole Pipe,
this was ſhut up in, to what part of
the ſurface of the water I pleaſed. And
I alſo found, that by applying a better
Loadſtone to the upper part of a ſealed
Pipe, and a Needle in it, I could make
the Needle leap up from the lower
part as near to the Loadſtone as the
interpoſed Glaſs would give it leave.</p>
                     <p>But I thought it would be more
conſiderable, to manifeſt that the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:25"/>
Magnetical <hi>Effluvia,</hi> even of ſuch a
dull Body, as the Globe of the Earth,
would alſo penetrate Glaſs. And
though this ſeem difficult to be tryed,
becauſe no ordinary Loadſtone, nor
any Iron touch'd by it, was to be
imployed to work on the included
Iron; yet I thought fit to attempt it
after this manner: I took a cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
piece of Iron of about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ones little finger, and between
half a foot and foot long, (for I had
formerly obſerved, that the quantity
of unexcited Iron furthers its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon excited Needles,) and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Hermetically ſeal'd it up in a
Glaſs-pipe but very little longer than
it; I ſuppoſed, that if I held it in a
perpendicular poſture; the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Earth, penetrating
the Glaſs, would make the lower
extreme of the Iron anſwerable to the
North Pole; and therefore having
applied this to the point of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in a Dial, or Sea-Compaſs, that
look'd toward the North, (for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
mean not all the ſame thing by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44036:26"/>
the Northern Pole of a Needle or
Loadſtone,) I preſum'd it would,
according to the Laws Magnetical
(elſewhere mention'd) drive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which accordingly it did.
And having for farther tryal inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the included Iron, (ſo that the
end which was formerly the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt,
was now the uppermoſt)
and held it in a perpendicular poſture
juſt under the ſame point of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
that extreme of the Iron-rod,
which before had driven away this
point, being by this inverſion become
(in a manner) a South-Pole, did (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſame Laws) attract it:
By which ſudden change of Poles,
meerly upon the change of ſituation,
it alſo appear'd, that the Iron ow'd
its Virtue only to the Magnetiſm of
the Earth, not that of another Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
which would not have been
thus eaſily alterable. And this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
I the more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
becauſe this is not the only
place, where I have occaſion to make
uſe of it.</p>

                     <p>That Bodies, which infus'd in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
impregnate them with new
Qualities ſuitable to thoſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd

them ſomewhat of their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
will, I preſume, be readily
granted by thoſe that conceive not,
how one Body ſhould communicate to
another a ſolitary and naked Quality,
unaccompanied by any thing Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
to ſupport and convey it. But I
would not have you think, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi>
that the only matter of fact I have to
countenance this notion, is that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
which has convinc'd divers
Chymiſts and Phyſicians, otherwiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44036:27"/>
not friends to the Corpuſcular Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
that Medicines may operate
without any conſumption of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For, <hi>though</hi> divers of theſe,
ſome of them Learned men, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
written, that <hi>Glaſs of Antimony</hi>
and <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> being either of

Wine, will make it vomitive; and
if that liquor be poured off, and new

the ſame virtue, and this though the
liquor be chang'd a thouſand times,
and yet the <hi>Antimonial Glaſs</hi> or <hi>Crocus</hi>

I have ſome doubts, whether the

in what has been ſaid, till ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44036:27"/>
own Tryal, and acquaint us too, with
what Inſtruments and what Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
he made it. For, beſides
that the Ingeniouſeſt Phyſicians I
have queſtion'd about it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Taſt, and ſometimes the
Colour of the Wine to be alter'd by
the infus'd Mineral, I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
in the affirmation of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Chymiſt or Apothecary, or even
Phyſician, if he ſhould barely averr,
that he had weigh'd an Antimonial
Medicine before 'twas put to infuſe,
and after the infuſion ended, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
no decrement of weight. For
I have had too much experience (as
I elſewhere mention) of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of making exact Statical tryals;
not to know, that ſuch Scales, as are
wont to be imployed by Chymiſts
and Apothecaries in weighing Drugs,
are by no means fit to make tryals
with the nicety which that I am
ſpeaking of requires: It being eaſie,
even with the better ſort of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate
Scales, eſpecially if they be
not ſuſpended from ſome fixt thing,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44036:28"/>
but held with the hand, to miſtake
half a grain or a grain; and perhaps
a greater quantity, and at leaſt more
than by divers of the Experiments of
this Eſſay appears neceſſary to be
ſpent upon the impregnating of a
conſiderable proportion of Liquor
with Corporeal Effluxions. Beſides,
that if, when the beaten <hi>Crocus</hi> or
<hi>Glaſs</hi> be taken out of the Wine to be
weigh'd again, the Experimenter be
not cautious enough to make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
for the Liquor that will adhere
to the Medicament, 'tis plain that he
may take notice of no decrement of
weight, though there may be really
<hi>Effluviums</hi> of the Mineral amounting
to ſeveral grains, imbib'd by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
And though he be aware of
this, and dry the powder, yet 'tis
not ſo eaſie, even for a skilful man,
to be ſure that none of the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcous

the ſenſe of theſe difficulties put me
upon the attempting to make ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Experiment with excellent
Scales, and the care that it deſerves:
But after a long tryal, an unlucky
accident fruſtrated at laſt my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
But though, till competent
Relators give us an account of this
matter upon their own tryal, and
repeat the Infuſion very much oftener,
than, for ought I find, any man has
yet done, I muſt not acquieſce in all
that is ſaid of the Impregnation of
Wine or other Liquors by <hi>Antimonial
Glaſs</hi> and <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> yet that
after divers repeated Infuſions the
Mineral ſubſtance ſhould not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
diminiſh'd in bulk or virtue,
may well ſuffice to make this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
though not the only or chief
that may be brought for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
yet a pertinent one to it. For
that there is a powerful Emetick Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
imparted to the Liquor, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by experience; and that the
Mineral does not impart this virtue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44036:29"/>
as 'twere by irradiation, but by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
effluxion, ſeems to me very
probable; not only becauſe I conceive
not, how this can be done otherwiſe,
but becauſe, as 'tis noted above, the
Wine does oftentimes change colour
by being kept a competent time upon
the Mineral, as if it drew thence a
Tincture; and even when it is not
diſcolour'd, I think it unſafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> has not
wrought upon it. For I have kept
good Spirit of Vinegar for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time upon finely powder'd
Glaſs of Antimony made <hi>per ſe,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding the Spirit to be at all
ting'd, though 'tis known, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial
Glaſs is ſoluble in Spirit of
Vinegar, as mine afterwards appear'd
to be, by a longer digeſtion in the
ſame Liquor. But there may be a
great number of minute particles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> before they
be numerous enough to change the
Colour of it. And with this agrees
very well what is obſerv'd, That
though too great a quantity of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44036:29"/>
prepar'd Antimony be put into the
liquor, yet it will not be thereby
made too ſtrongly Emetick. For the
Wine, being a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> will, like
other <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> be impregnated but
to a certain meaſure, without diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the overplus of the matter that
is put into it. And <hi>Mars,</hi> which is
a harder and heavier body than Glaſs
of Antimony, is it ſelf in part ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in good <hi>Rheniſh</hi> or other white
Wine, (and that in no long time,)
and ſometimes even in Water.</p>
                     <p>I do not therefore reject the Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Infuſion, as unfit to have a place
in this Chapter, but till the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been a little more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
made, I think it inferiour, as
to our purpoſe, to ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
to be met with in the next
Chapter, and perhaps alſo to that
mention'd by <hi>Helmont,</hi> and tryed by
more than one of my Acquaintance,
concerning the Virtue of killing
Worms, that Mercury imparts to
the water or wine wherein it has
been long enough infus'd, or elſe for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44036:30"/>
a while decocted. Though Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver

as an effectual Medicine againſt
Worms, not only by
many profeſt<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>As</hi> Quercetanus, Libavius, Zabata, Burggravius.</note> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſts,
but by divers
<note n="**" place="margin">
                           <hi>As</hi> Vidius, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, Caeſalpinus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Methodiſts of good
Note. And though,
ſome other things, Chymical and
Philoſophical, keep me from being of
their opinion, who think that in this
caſe the Mercury impregnates the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
as it were by Irradiation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in a Corporeal manner, yet
the Eye does not perceive, that even
limpid water takes any thing from
clean and well purg'd Mercury,
which we know that divers corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
liquors themſelves will not work
upon.</p>
                     <p>To this Inſtance I muſt add one
that is yet freer from exceptions,
which is, that having for Curioſity
ſake ſuſpended in a pair of exact
Scales, that would turn with a very
ſmall part of a grain, a piece of
<hi>Amber-greece</hi> bigger than a Walnut,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44036:30"/>
and weighing betwixt an hundred and
ſix-ſcore grains, I could not in three
days and a half that I had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to make the tryal, diſcover, even
upon that Ballance, any decrement
of weight in the <hi>Amber-greece;</hi> though
ſo rich a perfume, lying in the open
Air, was like in that time to have
parted with good ſtore of odoriferous
Steams. And a while after ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Lump of <hi>Aſſa foetida</hi> five days
and a half, I found it not to have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
any diſcernible loſs of weight,
though, in ſpite of the unfavourable
cold weather, it had about it a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Atmoſphere repleniſh'd with
foetid exhalations. And when twelve
or fourteen hours after, perhaps upon
ſome change of weather, I came to
look upon it, though I found that
in that time the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> was
ſomewhat alter'd, yet the whole Lump
had not loſt half a quarter of a grain;
which induc'd me to think, that
there may perhaps be Steams diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible
even by our Noſtrils, that are
far more ſubtil than the odorous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44036:31"/>
exhalations of Spices themſelves.
For, having in very good Scales ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended
in the Month of <hi>March</hi> an
ounce of Nutmegs, it loſt in about
ſix days five grains and a half. And
an ounce of Cloves in the ſame time
loſt ſeven grains and five eigths.</p>
                     <p>You will perhaps wonder, why I
do not preferr to the Inſtances I make
mention of in this Chapter, that
which may be afforded by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
that is acknowledg'd conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to emit multitudes of Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Steams without decrement of
weight. But though I have not
thought fit to paſs this wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſilence; yet I forbear to lay ſo
much ſtreſs on it, not only becauſe
my Ballances have not yet ſatisfied
me about the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Loadſtones,
(for I take them not all to be equally
diffuſive of their Particles;) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I foreſee it may be doubted,
<hi>whether</hi> Loadſtones, like odorous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
do furniſh afreſh of their own,
all the Corpuſcles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that from time to
time iſſue from them? <hi>Or,</hi> whether
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:31"/>
they be not continually repaired,
<hi>partly</hi> by the return of the Magnetical
Particles to one Pole that ſallied out
of the other; and <hi>partly</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
paſſage of Magnetical matter
(ſupplied by the Earth or other
Mundane Bodies) it make the Pores
or Channels of the Loadſtone their
conſtant Thorow-fares.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but it will make it
more probable, that a ſmall Quantity
of matter being ſcatter'd into inviſible
<hi>Effluvia</hi> may be exceedingly rarified
and expanded, if it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that this little portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall, for a conſiderable time,
emit multitudes of viſible parts, and
that in ſo cloſe an order among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as to ſeem in their Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
but one intire liquor, endow'd
with a ſtream-like motion, and a
diſtinct <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> wherein no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is to be ſeen, even by an
Eye plac'd near it. To deviſe this
Experiment, I was induc'd, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that hitherto all the (total)
diſſolutions that have been made of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44036:32"/>
Pigments, have been in liquors natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cold, and conſiſting probably
of much leſs ſubtile, and certainly
of much leſs agitated parts, than that
fluid aggregate of ſhining matter that
we call <hi>Flame;</hi> whereas I argued,
that if one could totally diſſolve a
Body compos'd of parts ſo minute as
thoſe of a Metal into actual Flame,
and husband its Flame ſo, as that
it ſhould not immoderatly waſte, I
ſhould thereby diſſolve the Metal in
a far more ſubtil <hi>Menſtruum</hi> than our
common water, or <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or
<hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> or any other known
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> I have yet imployed.
And conſequently the attenuation
and expanſion of the Metal in this
truly Igneous <hi>Menſtruum</hi> would much
ſurpaſs not only what happens in
ordinary Metalline ſolutions, but
poſſibly alſo what I have noted in
the third Chapter of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſtrange diffuſion of Copper
diſſolv'd in Spirit of Urine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
In proſecution of this deſign,
I ſo prepar'd one ſingle grain of that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44036:32"/>
Metal, by a way that I elſewhere
teach, that it was diſſolv'd in about
a ſpoonful of an appropriated <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum.</hi>
And then having caus'd a
ſmall Glaſs-lamp to be purpoſely
blown to contain this liquor, and
fitted it with a ſocket and wieck, we
lighted the Lamp, which, without
conſuming the wieck, burnt with a
flame large enough and very hot, and
ſeem'd to be all the while of a greeniſh
blew, as if it were a but finer and
ſhining ſolution of Copper. And yet
this one grain of prepar'd Metal
ting'd the flame that was from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to moment produc'd, during
no leſs than half an hour and ſix mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.
And now if we conſider, that
in this flame there was an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Succeſſion of multitudes of
colour'd Particles newly extricated,
and flying off in every of thoſe many
parts wherein a minute of time may
either actually or mentally be divided;
<hi>and,</hi> if we conſider Flame as a light
and very agitated body, paſſing with
a ſtream upwards through the Air,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44036:33"/>
                        <hi>and</hi> if we alſo conſider the quantity
of liquor that would (as I ſhall by
and by tell you) run through a Pipe
of a much leſſer diameter than that
Flame, within the compaſs of the
forementioned time: What a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the ſtreaming fluid we call
Flame, if it could have been preſerv'd
and collected into one Body, may we
ſuppoſe would appear to have iſſued
out of one grain of Copper in the
ſpace of thirty-ſix minutes; and what
a multitude of metalline Corpuſcles
may we ſuppoſe to have been ſupplied
for the tinging of that Flame during
ſo long a time? ſince a Cylindrical
ſtream of water falling but through
a very ſhort Pipe of glaſs, conſtantly
ſupplied with liquors, did paſs at
ſuch a rate, that, though the aqueous
Cylinder ſeem'd more ſlender by half,
(or perhaps by two thirds or better)
than the Flame, yet we eſtimated, by
the help of a Minute-watch and a
good pair of Scales, that, if I had
had conveniencies to let it run long
enough, the water efflux'd in thirty-ſix
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44036:33"/>
minutes (the time of the Flames
duration) would have amounted to
above nine gallons, or, (reckoning
a pint of water to contain a pound of
ſixteen ounces) ſeventy-two pounds.</p>

                     <p>THE laſt ſort of Inſtances I ſhall

that may by a ſmall quantity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when rarified or diſpers'd, be
either fill'd as to ſenſe, or, at leaſt,
made (as they ſpeak) the ſphear of its
activity.</p>
                     <p>To manifeſt this Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as well confirm the foregoing
Chapter, as make out what is deſign'd
in this, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, and
help your imagination to conceive,
how great a ſpace may be impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Effluxions of a Body,
oftentimes without any ſenſible, and
oftener without any conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44036:34"/>
in bulk or weight of the
Body that affords them. And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this, though I ſhall not pretend
to determine preciſely how little the
ſubſtances, I am to inſtance in, would
waſte upon the Ballance, becauſe you
will very eaſily ſee they are not that
way to be examin'd; yet I preſume,
you will as eaſily grant, that the
decrement of weight would be but
inconſiderable, ſince of ſuch light
ſubſtances the loſs even of bulk is ſo;
which laſt clauſe I ſhall now attempt
to make good, by ſetting down ſome
Obſervations, partly borrow'd from
the writings of approv'd Phyſicians,
and partly that my friends and I have
made about the durable Evaporation
of ſuch ſmall particles of the Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions
of Animals, as are actually not
to be diſcern'd by the Eye to have any
of thoſe things ſticking to them,
which are ſo very long in flying ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
away.</p>
                     <p>'Tis wont to be ſomewhat ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
to men of Letters, when they
firſt go a hawking with good Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44036:34"/>
to obſerve, with how great
ſagacity thoſe dogs will take notice
of, and diſtinguiſh by the ſcent, the
places where Partridges, Quails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have lately been. But I have much
more wonder'd at the quick ſcent of
an excellent Setting-dog, who by his
way of ranging the fields, and his
other motions, eſpecially of his Head,
would not only intimate to us the
kinds of game, whoſe ſcent he chanc'd
to light on, but would diſcover to
us where Partridges had been (though
perhaps without ſtaying in that
place) ſeveral hours before, and aſſiſt
us to gueſs how long they had been
gone before we came.</p>
                     <p>I have had ſtrange anſwers given
me in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by thoſe who make
a gain if not an intire livelihood by
killing of Wolves in that Countrey,
(where they are paid ſo much for
every head they bring in) about the
ſagacity of that peculiar race of dogs
they imploy in hunting them; but
not truſting much to thoſe Relators,
I ſhall add, that a very ſober and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44036:35"/>
diſcreet Gentleman of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who has often occaſion to
imploy Blood-hounds, aſſures me,
that if a man have but paſs'd over a
field, the ſcent will lye (as they ſpeak)
ſo as to be perceptible enough to a
good dog of that ſort for ſeveral
hours after. And an ingenious Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aſſures me, that he has obſerv'd,
that the ſcent of a flying and heated
Deer will ſometimes continue upon
the ground from one day to the next
following.</p>
                     <p>And now we may conſider theſe
three things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
left upon the graſs or ground
by the tranſient tread of a Partridge,
Hare, or other <hi>animal,</hi> that does but
paſs along his way, does probably
communicate to the graſs or ground
but ſome of thoſe Effluxions, that
tranſpire out of his feet, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſmall enough to eſcape the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernment
of the Eye, may probably
not amount to one grain in weight,
or perhaps not to the tenth part of it.
<hi>Next,</hi> That the parts of fluid Bodies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44036:35"/>
as ſuch, are perpetually in motion,
and ſo are the inviſible particles that
ſwim in them, as may appear by
the diſſolution of Salt or Sugar in
water, and the wandering of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous
Vapours through the Air,
even when the Eye perceives them
not. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> That though the
Atmoſphere of one of theſe ſmall
parcels of the exhaling matter we are
ſpeaking of, may oftentimes be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
vaſt in compariſon of the
emittent Body, as may be gueſs'd by
the diſtance, at which ſome Setters,
or Blood-hounds, will find the ſcent
of a Partridge, or Deer; yet in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
expos'd to the free air or wind,
'tis very likely that theſe ſteams are
aſſiduouſly carried away from their
Fountain, to maintain the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Atmoſphere for ſix, eight, or
more hours, that is, as long as the
ſcent has been obſerv'd to lye, there
will be requiſite a continual recruit
of ſteams ſucceeding one another
And that ſo very ſmall a portion of
matter as that which we were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44036:36"/>
the <hi>fomes</hi> of theſe ſteams may be
judg'd to be, being ſenſibly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate
an Atmoſphere incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
greater than it ſelf, and ſupply
it with almoſt continual recruits,
we cannot but think, that the
ſteams it parts with, muſt be of an
extreme and ſcarce conceivable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs.</p>
                     <p>And we may further conſider,
that the ſubſtances, which emit theſe
ſteams, being ſuch as newly belong'd
to Animals, and were, for the moſt
part, tranſpir'd through the pores of
their feet, muſt be in likelihood a
far more evaporable and diſſipable
kind of Bodies than Minerals or aduſt
Vegetables, ſuch as Gunpowder is
made of; ſo that if the grains of
Gunpowder emit Effluviums capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being by ſome Animals per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at a diſtance by their ſmell,
one may probably ſuppoſe, that the
ſmall grains of this powder may hold
out very many times longer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
an Atmoſphere with odorable
ſteams, than the Corpuſcles left on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44036:36"/>
the ground by tranſient Animals.</p>
                     <p>Now though it be generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree'd
on, that very few Birds have
any thing near ſo quick a ſenſe of
ſmelling as Setting-dogs or Blood-hounds,
yet that the odour of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
eſpecially when aſſiſted by
the ſteams of the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of
Powder formerly fir'd in the ſame
Gun, may be Fowls be ſmelt at a
notable diſtance, particularly when
the wind blew from me towards
them, I often perſwaded my ſelf I
obſerv'd, eſpecially as to Crows,
when I went a ſhooting; and was
confirm'd in that opinion, both by
the common Tradition, and by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and ingenious perſons much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
in the killing of Wild-fowl,
and of ſome fourfooted Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>I had forgotten to take notice of
one Obſervation of the experienc'd
<hi>Julius Palmarius:</hi> Whence we may
learn, that Beaſts may leave upon
the Vegetables, that have touch'd
their bodies for any time, ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
as, though unheeded by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44036:37"/>
other Animals, may, when eaten
by them, produce in them ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
as the infected Animals had.
For this Author writes in his uſeful
Tract <hi>de morbis Contagioſis,</hi> that he
obſerv'd Horſes, Beeves, Sheep and
other Animals, to run mad upon the
eating of ſome of the ſtraw on which
ſome mad Swine had layn.</p>
                     <p>And now to reſume and proſecute
our former diſcourſe, you may take
notice, that the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> mention'd
to have been ſmelt by Animals, are,
though inviſible, yet big enough to
be the objects of ſenſe; ſo that 'tis
not improbable, that, among the
ſteams that no ſenſe can immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive, there ſhould be ſome
far more ſubtil than theſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
capable of furniſhing an
Atmoſphere much longer, without
quite exhauſting the effluviating
matter that afforded them.</p>

wonder of theſe ſtrange Relations,
without rendering them <hi>unfit</hi> for our
preſent purpoſe, I ſhall add, that
though 'tis the opinion of divers
Learned Phyſicians, that the matter
harboring Contagion cannot laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Twenty or a few more days,
if the Body it adheres to be expos'd
to the free air and the wind, and
though I am not forward to deny,
that their judgement may hold in
ordinary caſes; yet I muſt not deny
neither, that a Contagion may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44036:38"/>
happen to be much more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
and obſtinate: Of which I

                        <hi>Dimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
in his own Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
who having but remov'd with
his foot, from one ſide to the other
of a little Arbour (in his Garden)
ſome ſtraw, that had layn under the
Pallet, on which near eight Months
before a Bed had layn, wherein a
Servant of the Apothecaries, that
recover'd, had been ſick of the
Plague; the infectious ſteams pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
invaded the lower part of his
leg, and produc'd a pungent pain
and bliſter, which turn'd to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential
Carbuncle, that could ſcarce
be cur'd in a Fortnight after, though
during that time the Patient were
neither feaveriſh, nor, as to the reſt
of his Body, ill at eaſe. This memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

extorted, even from him, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
which I add, becauſe it
contains ſome conſiderable, and not
yet mentioned Circumſtances of the
recited caſe: <hi>Hoc exemplo Medicorum
Doctrina de Contagio in fomite latente
ſatis confirmatur. Mirum tamen est,
hoc Contagium tanto tempore in praedicto

                     </p>
                     <p>And now I will ſhut up this
Chapter with an inſtance, that ſome
will think, perhaps, no leſs ſtrange
than any of the reſt, which is, that
though they that are skilful in the
perfuming of Gloves, are wont to
imbue them with but an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quantity of odoriferous matter,
yet I have by me a pair of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gloves, which I had by the favour
of your fair and virtuous Siſter <hi>(F.)</hi>
that were ſo skilfully perfum'd, that
partly by her, partly by thoſe, that
preſented them her as a Rarity, and
partly by me, who have kept them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44036:39"/>
ſeveral Years, they have been kept
about eight or nine and twenty years,
if not thirty, and they are ſo well
ſcented, that they may, for ought
I know, continue fragrant divers
years longer. Which inſtance, if
you pleaſe to reflect upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that ſuch Gloves cannot have
been carried from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or ſo much as uncover'd
(as they muſt often have been) in
the free Air, without diffuſing from
themſelves a fragrant Atmoſphere,
we cannot but conclude thoſe odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Steams to be unimaginably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that could for ſo long a time
iſſue out in ſuch ſwarms, from a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
perfum'd matter lodged in the
pores of a Glove, and yet leave it
richly ſtock'd with particles of the
ſame nature; though, (eſpecially by
reaſon of ſome removes, in which I
took not the Gloves along with me,)
I forgot ever ſince I had them, to keep
them ſo much as ſhut up in a Box.</p>

                     <p>THey that are wont in the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
they make of Natural
Things, to truſt too much
to the negative informations of their
Senſes, without ſufficiently conſulting
their Reaſon, have commonly but a
very little and ſlight opinion of the
Power and Efficacy of <hi>Effluviums;</hi>
and imagine that ſuch minute Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
(if they grant that there are
ſuch,) as are not, for the moſt part
of them, capable to work upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44036:42"/>
tendereſt and quickeſt of Senſes, the
Sight, cannot have any conſiderable
Operation upon other Bodies. But
I take this to be an error, which,
<hi>as</hi> it very little becomes Philoſophers,
<hi>ſo</hi> it has done no little prejudice to
Philoſophy it ſelf, and perhaps to
Phyſick too. And therefore though
the nature of my deſign at preſent did
not <hi>require</hi> it, yet the importance of
the ſubject would <hi>invite</hi> me to ſhew,
That this is as ill-gounded as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
a Suppoſition.</p>
                     <p>And indeed if we Conſider the
ſubject attentively, we may obſerve,
That though it be true, that, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> the greatneſs of Bodies doth,
in moſt caſes, contribute to that of
their Operation upon others, yet Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Body being in its own preciſe
nature an unactive or moveleſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
one part of the Maſs acts upon
another but upon the account of its
Local Motion, whoſe Operations are
facilitated and otherwiſe diverſified
by the Shape, Size, Situation and
Texture both of the Agent and of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44036:42"/>
Patient. And therefore if Corpuſeles,
though very minute, be numerous
enough, and have a competent degree
of motion, even theſe ſmall Particles,
eſpecially if fitly ſhap'd, when they
chance to meet with a Body, which
the congruity of its texture diſpoſes
to admit them at its Pores, and receive
their either friendly or hoſtile impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
may perform ſuch things in the
patient, as viſible and much groſſer
Bodies, but leſs conveniently ſhap'd
and mov'd, would be utterly unable
(on the ſame Body) to effect.</p>
                     <p>And that you may with the leſs
difficulty allow me to ſay, that the
Effluviums of Bodies, as minute as they
are, may perform Conſiderable things,
give me leave to obſerve to you, that
there are <hi>at leaſt</hi> ſix ways, by which
the Effluviums of a Body may nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
operate upon another; namely,
1. By the <hi>great number</hi> of emitted Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles.
2. By their <hi>penetrating</hi> and
pervading nature. 3. By their <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and other Modifications of their
Motion. 4. By the <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44036:43"/>
of their Bulk and Shape to the
Pores of the Bodies they are to act
upon. 5. By the <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>one</hi> part
<hi>upon another,</hi> that they excite or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
in the Body they work upon
according to its Structure. And <hi>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,</hi>
By the Fitneſs and Power they have
to make themſelves be <hi>aſsiſted,</hi> in their
Working, by the <hi>more Catholick Agents</hi>
of the Univerſe. And though it may
perhaps be ſufficiently proved, that
there are ſeveral caſes wherein a Body
that emits Particles, may act notably
upon another Body by this or that
ſingle way of thoſe I have been
naming; yet uſually the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are performed by the aſſociation
of two, three or more of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to produce the ſame Effect.
Upon which ſcore when I ſhall in the
following Paper referr an Inſtance or
a Phenomenon to any one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Heads, I deſire to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
as looking upon that but as the

                     <p>TAking thoſe things for granted,
that have, I hope, been ſufficiently
proved in the former Tract about the
ſubtlety of Effluviums, I ſuppoſe it will
readily be allowed, That the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of a Body may be extremely
minute; whence it may be rightly
inferr'd, that a ſmall portion of matter
may emit great multitudes of them.</p>
                     <p>Now that the great number of
Agents may in many caſes compenſate
their littleneſs, eſpecially where they
Act or Reſiſt <hi>per modum unius,</hi> (as they
ſpeak,) men would perhaps the more
eaſily grant, if they took notice to this
purpoſe of ſome familiar Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that not only leſſer Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods
that overflow the neighbouring
Fields, but thoſe terrible Inundations
that ſometimes drown whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
are made by Bodies ſingly ſo
ſo ſmall and inconſiderable as Drops
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44036:44"/>
of Rain when they continue to fall in
thoſe multitudes we call Showers.</p>
                     <p>So the aggregates of ſuch minute
Bodies as grains of Sand being heaped
together in ſufficient Numbers, make
Banks wherewith greateſt Ships are
ſometimes ſplit, nay and ſerve in moſt
places for Bounds to the Sea it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And though a ſingle Corn of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,
or two or three together,
are not of Force to do much miſchief,
yet two or three Barrels of thoſe Corns
taking Fire all together are able to
blow up Ships and Houſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
prodigious things.</p>
                     <p>But inſtead of multiplying ſuch
Inſtances, afforded by Bodies of
ſmall indeed but yet viſible Bulk,
I ſhall (as ſoon as I have intimated,
that the above-mentioned drops of
Rain themſelves conſiſt of convening
Multitudes of Vapors moſt commonly
Inviſible in their Aſcent,) endeavour
to make out what was propoſed, by
two or three Inſtances drawn from
the Operations of Inviſible particles.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, we ſee, that though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44036:44"/>
Aqueous Vapours be look'd upon as
the fainteſt and leaſt active Effluviums
that we know of, yet when multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of them are in Rainy weather
diſperſed thorow the Air, and are
thereby qualified to work on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
expoſed to it, their Operations
are very conſiderable, not only in
the diſſolution of Salts, as Sea-Salt,
Salt of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive
changes they produce in many
Bodies, but in the intumeſcence they
cauſe in Oak and other ſolid Woods;
as appears by the difficulty we often
find in and before Rainy weather, to
ſhut and open Doors, Boxes, and other
Wooden pieces of work, that were
before fit enough for the Cavities they
had been adjuſted to.</p>
                     <p>I might here urge, that though the
ſtrings of Viols and other Muſical
Inſtruments are ſometimes ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſuſtain conſiderable weights,
yet if they be left ſcrewed to their full
tenſion, (as it frequently happens)
they are oftentimes by the ſupervening
of moiſt weather made to break, not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:45"/>
without impetuoſity and noiſe. But
it may ſute better with my preſent
aim, if I mention on this occaſion,
(what I elſewhere more fully take
notice of:) Being deſirous to try what
a multitude even of Aqueous Steams
may do, I cauſed a Rope that was long,
but not thick, and was in part ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by a Pully, to have a Weight
of Lead ſo faſtned to the end of it, as
not to touch the ground, and after
the Weight had leiſure allowed it to
ſtretch the Cord as far as it could,
I obſerved that in the moiſt weather
the wateriſh particles, that did invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
abound in the Air, did ſo much
work upon and ſhorten the Rope, as
to make it lift up the hanging Weight,
which was, if I mis-remember not,
about an hundred Pounds.</p>
                     <p>The inviſible Steams, iſſuing out
of the Walls of a newly plaſter'd or
whited Room, are not ſenſibly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to thoſe that do but tranſiently
viſit it, or make but a very ſhort ſtay
in it, though there be a Charcoal-fire
in the Chimney; but we have many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44036:45"/>
inſtances of perſons, that by lying for
a night in ſuch Rooms, have been the
next morning or ſooner found dead
in their Beds, being ſuffocated by the
multitude of the noxious Vapours
emitted during all that time.</p>
                     <p>And here I think it proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
That it may much aſſiſt us to
take notice of the multitude of <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
and make us expect great matters from
them, to conſider, that they are not
emitted from the Body that affords
them all at once, as Hail-ſhot out of
a Gun, but iſſue from it as the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous
Winds do out of an Aeolipil
well heated, or Waters out of a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
in continued Streams, wherein
freſh parts ſtill ſucceed one another;
ſo that though as many Effluxions of
a Body as can be ſent out at one time
were numerous enough to Act but
upon its Superficial parts, yet the
Emanation of the next minute may
get in a little farther, and each ſmalleſt
portion of time ſupplying freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
and perhaps urging on the
Steams already entred, the Particles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44036:46"/>
may at length get into a multitude
of the pores of the invaded Body, and
penetrate it to the very innermoſt
parts.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to ſhew in the ſecond
place, That the ſubtile and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
nature of Effluviums, may
in many caſes cooperate with their
multitude in producing notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
and that there are Effluviums
of a very piercing nature, though
we ſhall not now enquire upon what
account they are ſo, we may evince
by ſeveral Examples. For not only
the inviſible Steams of good <hi>Aqua
Fortis</hi> and Spirit of Nitre do uſually
in a ſhort time, and in the cold, ſo
penetrate the corks wherewith the
Glaſſes that contained them were
ſtop'd, as to reduce them into a yellow
pap; but alſo the emanations of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
have been ſometimes found in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44036:46"/>
the form of coagulated, or even of
running Mercury in the heads or very
bones of thoſe Gilders, or Venereal
Patients, that have too long or too
unadviſedly been expoſed to the fumes
of it, though they never took Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver
in its groſs ſubſtance. Chymiſts
too often find in their Laboratories,
that the ſteams of Sulphur, Antimony,
Arſnick, and divers other Minerals,
are able to make thoſe ſtagger, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſtrike them down, that without
a competent warineſs unlute the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
wherein they had been diſtilled or
ſublimed; of which I have known
divers ſad Examples. And of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrancy
even of animal Steams we
may eaſily be perſwaded, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how ſoon in many Plagues the
contagious, though inviſible, Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are able to reach the Heart, or
infect other internal parts; though
in divers of theſe caſes the Blood helps
to convey the infection, yet ſtill the
Morbifick particles muſt get into the
body before they can infect the maſs of
Blood. And in thoſe ſtupefactions that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44036:47"/>
are cauſed at a diſtance by the <hi>Terpedo,</hi>
the parts mainly affected ſeem to be the
Nervous ones of the Hand and Arm,
which are of the moſt retired and beſt
fenced parts of thoſe members. And
there is a Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> that
I make to ſmell to, whoſe inviſible
Steams, unexcited by heat, are of ſo
piercing a nature, that not only they
will powerfully affect the Eyes and
Noſtrils, and Throats, and ſometimes
the Stomachs too (yet without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Vomitive,) of the Patients they
invade, but alſo when a great cold
has ſo clog'd the organs of ſmelling,
that neither ſweet nor ſtinking odours
would at all affect them, theſe piercing
Steams have not only in a few minutes
both made themſelves a way, and
which is more, ſo open'd the paſſages,
that ſoon after the Patient has been
able to ſmell other things alſo. And
by the ſame penetrating Spirit, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Quality was, ſome time ſince,
reſtored to a power of ſmelling, which
he had loſt for divers Years, (if he ever
had it equally with other men.) I could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44036:47"/>
eaſily ſubjoyn Examples of this kind,
but they belong to other places. And
here I ſhall only add, that the ſteams
of Water it ſelf aſſiſted by warmth,
are capable of diſſolving the Texture
of even hard and ſolid bodies, that
are not ſuſpected to be Saline; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Philoſophical calcination
(as Chymiſts call it) wherein ſolid
pieces of Harts-horn are brought to
be eaſily friable into pouder, by being
hung over waters, whil'ſt their ſteams
riſe in diſtillation and without the
help of Furnaces. The Exhalations,
that uſually ſwim every night in the
air, and almoſt every night fall to the
ground in the form of Dews (which
makes them be judged Aqueous,) are
in many places of the Torrid Zone
of ſo penetrating a nature, that, as
Eye-witneſſes have informed me, they
would in a very ſhort time make
Knives ruſt in their ſheaths, and
Swords in their ſcabbards, nay and
Watches in their caſes, if they did not
conſtantly carry them in their pockets.
And I have known even in <hi>England</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:48"/>
divers hard bodies, into which the
Vapours ſwimming in the air have
inſinuated themſelves, ſo far as to make
them friable throughout. But of the
penetration of Effluviums, I have
given, in ſeveral places, ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that 'tis not neceſſary to add
any here. And therefore to ſhew,
that, as I intimated at the beginning
of this Chapter, the Penetrancy and
the multitude of Effluviums may
much aſſiſt each other, I ſhall now
ſubjoyn; That we muſt not for the
moſt part look upon Effluviums as
ſwarms of Corpuſcles, that only beat
againſt the outſides of the Bodies they
invade, but as Corpuſcles, which by
reaſon of their great and frequently
recruited numbers, and by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
ſmallneſs of their Parts, inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
themſelves in multitudes into
the minute pores of the bodies they
invade, and often penetrate to the
innermoſt of them; ſo that, though
each ſingle Corpuſcle, and its diſtinct
action, be inconſiderable, in reſpect
of the multitude of parts that compoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:48"/>
the body to be wrought on; yet
a vaſt multitude of theſe little Agents
working together upon a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
number of the ſmall parts of the
body they pervade, they may well be
able to have powerful effects upon
the Body, that thoſe parts conſtitute;
as, in the caſe mentioned in the former
Chapter, the Rope would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have been enabled to raiſe ſo
great a weight, though a vehement
Wind had blown againſt it, to make
it loſe its perpendicular ſtraightneſs,
but a vaſt multitude of Watery Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
getting by degrees into the pores
of the Rope, might, like an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
company of little wedges, ſo
widen the pores as to make the
thrids or ſplinters of Hemp, the Rope
was made up of, ſwell, and that ſo
forcibly, that the depending weight
could not hinder the ſhortning of the
Rope, and therefore muſt of neceſſity
be rais'd thereby. And I have more
than once known ſolid and even
heavy Mineral Bodies, burſt in pieces
by the moiſture of the Air, though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:49"/>
we kept them within-doors carefully
ſhelter'd from the Rain.</p>

                     <p>THat the <hi>Celerity</hi> of the motion
of very minute Bodies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conjoyned to their multitudes,
may perform very notable things,
may be argued from the wonderful

ſubjoyn ſome others, which, though

more congruous to my preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
That the Corpuſcles whereof

by moſt, I preſume, be granted, and
may be eaſily prov'd. But I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſhewn, That the motion of the
Effluviums of ſome ſufficiently odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Bodies, has too little Celerity to
make a ſenſible impreſſion on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of ſmelling, unleſs thoſe Steams
be aſſiſted to beat more forcibly upon
the Noſtrils by the Air, which hurries
them along with it, when it enters
the Noſtrils in the form of a ſtream,
in the act of Inſpiration. And I have
by familiar obſervation of Hunters,
Fowlers, and partly of my own
made manifeſt, that Setting-dogs,
Hounds, Crows and ſome other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
will be much more affected with
ſents, or the odorous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,
Hares, Gunpowder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when
the Wind blows from the object to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſenſory, than when it ſits
the contrary way, which way ſoever
the Noſtrils of the animal be obverted,
ſo the Air be imbued with the odorous
Steams: And conſequently the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
ſeems to proceed from this,
that when the Noſtrils are obverted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44036:50"/>
to the Wind, the Current of the Air
drives the Steams forcibly upon the
Senſory, which otherwiſe it does
not.</p>
                     <p>That there is a briskneſs of motion
requiſite, and more than ordinarily
conducive to <hi>Electrical</hi> attractions,
may be argued from the neceſſity that
we uſually find by rubbing Amber,
Jett, and other Electrical bodies, to
make them emit thoſe Steams, by
which 'tis highly probable their action
is performed: And though I have
elſewhere ſhewn, that this precedent
rubbing is not alwayes neceſſary to
excite all Electrical bodies; yet in
thoſe that I made to attract without
it, it would operate much more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
after attrition; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceive
makes a reciprocal motion
amongſt the more ſtable parts, and
does thereby as 'twere diſcharge and
ſhoot out the attracting Corpuſcles;
whoſe real emiſſion, though it may
be probably argued from what has
been already ſaid, ſeems more ſtrongly
proveable by an Obſervation that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:50"/>
I made many years ago, and which
I have been lately inform'd to have
been long ſince made by the very
Learned <hi>Fabri.</hi> The Obſervation
was this; That if, when we took
a vigorouſly excited Electrick, we
did at a certain nick of time (which
circumſtances may much vary, but
was uſually almoſt as ſoon as the
body was well rubbed) place it at a
juſt diſtance from a ſuſpended Hair
or other light body, or perhaps from
ſome light powder; the Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
would not be attracted to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrick,
but driven away from it, as
it ſeem'd, by the briskly moving
ſteams that iſſue out of the Amber or
other light body.</p>
                     <p>This Argument I could confirm by
another Phaenomenon or two of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with this, if I ſhould not borrow
too much of what I have elſewhere
noted about the Hiſtory of <hi>Electricity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know a certain ſubſtance, which
though made by diſtillation, does in
the cold emit but a very mild and
inoffenſive ſmell, but when the veſſel
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44036:51"/>
that holds it is heated, though no
ſeparation of conſtituent Principles
appear to be thereby made, (the Body
being in all uſual tryals homogeneous,)
the Effluviums will be ſo altered, that
I remember a Virtuoſo, that, to ſatisfie
his curioſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would needs be ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to it, when 'twas heated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
to me, that he thought the
Steams would have killed him, and
that the Effluviums of Spirit of <hi>Sal
Armoniack</hi> it ſelf were nothing near
ſo ſtrong and piercing as thoſe.</p>
                     <p>And even among ſolid Bodies, I
know ſome, which, though abounding
much in a ſubſtance wherein ſome
rank ſmells principally reſide, yet (if
they were not chafed) were ſcarce
at all ſenſibly odorous; but upon the
rubbing of them a little one againſt
the other, the attrition making them,
as it were, dart out their Emiſſions,
would in a minute or two make them
ſtink egregiouſly.</p>
                     <p>And as the Celerity of motion
may thus give a vigor to the Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Bodies, ſo there may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:51"/>
other modifications of motion, that
may contribute to the ſame thing,
and are not to be wholly neglected in
this place. For as we ſee, that greater
Bodies do operate differingly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to ſuch and ſuch modifications;
as there is a great difference between
the effects of a Dart or Javelin, ſo
thrown as that its point be alwayes
forwards, and the ſame weapon if it be
ſo thrown, that during its progreſſive
motion the extremes turn about the
Center of gravity or ſome inward
parts, as it happens when Boyes
throw ſticks to beat down fruit from
the tops of trees; ſo there is little
doubt to be made, but that in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
themſelves 'tis not all one, as
to their effects, whether they move
with or without rotation, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſuch or ſuch a line, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with or without undulation,
trembling or ſuch a kind of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
and in ſhort, whether the
motion have or have not this or that
particular modification; which how
much it may diverſifie the Effects
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:52"/>
of the Bodies moved, may appear
by the Motion, that the Aerial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are put into by Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
For, though the effects
of harmony, diſcord and peculiar
ſounds be ſometimes very great, not
only in Human bodies, but, as we ſhall
ſhew in the following Tract, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
ones too; the whole efficacy
of Muſick and of Sounds that are not
extraordinarily loud and different,
ſeems, as far as 'tis aſcribable to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous
bodies, to depend upon the
different manners of motion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
that Air is put, that makes the
immediate impreſſion on our organs
of hearing.</p>

                     <p>I Should now proceed to ſhew, how
the <hi>Celerity</hi> and other modes, that
diverſifie the motion of Effluviums,
may be aſſiſted to make them operative
by their determinate ſizes and figures,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44036:52"/>
and the congruity or incongruity
which they may have upon that ſcore
with the Pores of the groſſer Bodies
they are to work on: But I think it not
fit to entrench upon the
ſubject of another<note n="*" place="margin">Of the <hi>Pores</hi> of Bodies, and <hi>Figures</hi> of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles.</note> Tract,
where the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the figures of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
and the Pores of groſſer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is amply enough treated of. And
therefore I ſhall only in this place
take notice of thoſe effects of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which ſeem referable, partly
to the Celerity and manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
and partly to the diſtinct ſizes
and ſhapes of the Corpuſcles that
compoſe the deſtructive matter, and
to the peculiar relation between the
particles of that matter and the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the bodies they invade.
I know that many ſtrange things
that are delivered about the Effects
of what the Latins call <hi>Fulmen</hi> (which
our Engliſh word <hi>Lightning</hi> does not
adaequately render) are but fabulous;
but there are but too many that
are not ſo; ſome of which I have been
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44036:53"/>
an Eye-witneſs of, within leſs than
a quarter of an hour after that the
things happened. And though it be
very difficult to explicate particularly
many of theſe true Phenomena, yet it
ſeems warrantable enough to argue
from them, that there may be Agents
ſo qualified, and ſo ſwiftly moved,
that notwithſtanding their being ſo
exceedingly minute, as they muſt be,
to make up a flame, which is a fluid
Body, they muſt in an imperceptible
time pervade ſolid Bodies, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
ſome of them without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
their Texture, burn, break,
melt, and produce other very great
changes in other Bodies that are fitted
to be wrought on by them. And of
this I muſt not forget to mention this
remarkable inſtance; That a perſon
Curious enough to collect many rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
bringing me one day into the
Study where he kept the choiceſt of
them, I ſaw there among other things
a fine pair of Drinking-glaſſes that
were ſomewhat ſlender, but extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
tall; they ſeem'd to have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44036:53"/>
been deſigned to reſemble one another,
and made for ſome drinking enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.
But before I ſaw them,
that reſemblance was much leſſen'd
by the Lightning, that fell between
them in ſo ſtrange a manner, that,
without breaking either of them, that
I could perceive, it alter'd a little
the figure of one of them, near the
lower part of the Cavity; but the
other was ſo bent near the ſame place
as to make it ſtand quite awry, and
give it a poſture, that I beheld not
without ſome amazement. And I
cannot yet but look upon it as a very
ſtrange thing, and no leſs conſiderable
to our preſent purpoſe, that Nature
ſhould in the free Air make of Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and that ſuch as probably
when they aſcended were inviſible,
ſuch an aggregate of Corpuſcles, as
ſhould without breaking ſuch frail
Bodies as Glaſſes, be able in its
paſſage thorow them, that is, in
the twinkling of an Eye, to melt
them; which to do is wont even in
our Reverberatory Furnaces to coſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:54"/>
that active flames a pretty deal of
time.</p>
                     <p>And this calls into my memory,
that upon a time, hearing not far off
from me ſuch a clap of Thunder as
made me judge and ſay, that queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſome of the neighbouring places
were thunder-ſtrook, I ſent preſently
to make inquiry; which having juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my conjecture, I forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to the houſe, where the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was done, by ſomething, which
thoſe, that pretended to have ſeen
it coming thither, affirm'd to be like
a flame moved very obliquely. To
omit the hurt, that ſeemed to have
been done by a Wind that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, or was perhaps produced by
it, to divers perſons and cattel; that
which makes me here mention it,
was, that obſerving narrowly what
had happen'd in an upper room,
where it firſt fell, I ſaw, that it had
in more than one place melted the
Lead in its paſſage, (though that
poſſibly outlaſted not the twinkling
of an Eye,) without breaking to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:54"/>
pieces the glaſs-caſements, or burning
(that I took notice of) either the Bed
or Hangings or any other combuſtible
houſhold-ſtuff; though near the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
it had thrown down a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the ſolid ſubſtance of the Wall,
through which it ſeem'd to have
made its paſſage in or out. And that,
which made me the leſs ſcruple to
mention this accident, is, that having
curiouſly pry'd into the Effects of the
<hi>Fulmen,</hi> not only in that little upper
room, but in other parts of the Houſe,
beneath whoſe lowermoſt parts it
ſeem'd to have ended its extravagant
courſe, I could not but conclude,
That if ſo be it were the ſame <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
it muſt have more than once
gone in and out of the Houſe, and
that the line of its motion was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtraight, nor yet reducible to
any curve or mixed line, that I had
met with among Mathematicians;
but that, as I then told ſome of my
Friends, it moved to and fro in an
extravagant manner, not unlike the
irregular and wrigling motion of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:55"/>
thoſe fired Squibs that Boys are wont
to make by ramming Gunpowder
into Quills. But about Thunder more
perhaps elſewhere. I ſhall here only
add, That whereas 'tis a known Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which my own Obſervations
heedfully made ſeem now and then
to confirm, that vehement Thunder,
if Beer be not very ſtrong, will uſually
(for I do not ſay alwayes) ſowre it in
a day or two; if this degeneration
be not one of the conſequences of the
great and peculiar kinds of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions
of the Air that happens in
lowd Thunder (in which caſe the
Phenomenon will belong to the next
Diſcourſe,) the effect may probably
be imputed to ſome ſubtile Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
diffuſed thorow the Air, which,
penetrating the pores of the Wooden
veſſels, whoſe contexture is not very
cloſe, imbue the liquor with a kind
of acetous Ferment; which conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I ſhould think much confirmed
by a tryal, it ſuggeſted to me, if I
had made it often enough to rely
upon it. For conſidering that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:55"/>
pores of Glaſs are ſtraight enough to
be impervious (for ought I have
yet obſerved) to the Steams or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
parts of Sulphur as well as to
other odorous Exhalations, I thought
it worth trying, whether there be
any ſulphureous Steams or other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
diffuſed thorow the Air in
time of Thunder, that would not be
too groſs to get in at ſuch minute
pores as thoſe of Glaſs. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
having Hermetically ſealed
up both Beer and Ale apart, I kept
them in Summer time till there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
a great Thunder, a day or two,
after which the Beer which we drank,
that was good before, being generally
complained of as ſowred by the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I ſuffer'd my liquors to continue
at leaſt a day or two longer, that
the ſowring Steams, if any ſuch there
were, might have time enough to
operate upon them, and then breaking
the Glaſſes, I found not that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
had been ſowred, though we
had purpoſely forborn to fill the Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to facilitate the degeneration of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:56"/>
the liquors. Perhaps it will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
on this occaſion to mention
a practice, which is uſual in ſome
places where I have been, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
employ'd by a great Lady,
that is a great houſe-keeper, and is
very curious and expert in divers
Phyſical Obſervations; for, talking
with her about the remedies of the
Sowring of Beer and other drinks by
Thunder, which is ſometimes no
ſmall prejudice to her, ſhe affirm'd
to me, that ſhe uſually found the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
I was mentioning, ſucceed:
And that before the then laſt great
Thunder, of which I had obſerved
the Effects upon Beer, ſhe preſerved
hers by putting, at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
under the Barrels, Chaffing-diſhes
of Coals, when ſhe perceiv'd
that the Thunder was like to begin,
which practice, if it conſtantly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
may put one a conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Fire do not by rarifying the
Air and diſcuſſing the ſulphureous or
other Steams, by altering them, or
by uniting with them the Exhalations
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:56"/>
of the Coals, or by ſome ſuch kind of
way, render ineffectual theſe ſowring
Corpuſcles, which perhaps require a
determinate bulk and ſhape, beſides
their being crowded very many of
them together, to have their full
Operation on Barrell'd Liquors. But
theſe things are but meer Conjectures,
and therefore I proceed.</p>

                     <p>THE fifth way whereby Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums
may perform notable
things, is the Motion of one part upon
another, that they may excite or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
in the Body they work on
according to its ſtructure.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall in the following Tract have
occaſion to ſay ſomething of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into which the Internal parts of
Inanimate Bodies may put one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the Examples now produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
are deſigned to manifeſt the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
that Effluviums may, on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44036:57"/>
newly mentioned accounts, have on
Organical and living Bodies. To
which Inſtances it would yet be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to premiſe, That even Inanimate
and Solid Bodies may be of ſuch a
ſtructure as to be very much alterable
by the appropriated Effluviums of
other Bodies, as may be inſtanc'd in
the power, that I have known ſome
vigorous Loadſtones to have, of taking
away in a trice the attractive virtue
of an excited Needle, or giving a
verticity directly contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
without ſo much as touching it.</p>
                     <p>And we may pertinently take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the attractive virtue of the
Loadſtone, as that, which may afford
us an eminent Example of the great
power of a multitude of inviſible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums,
even from Bodies that are
not great, upon Bodies that are Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
or liveleſs: For taking it for
granted, what both the <hi>Epicureans,
Carteſians,</hi> and almoſt all other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularian
Philoſophers agree in,
that Magnetiſm is performed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Emiſſions, we may conſider,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44036:57"/>
that theſe paſſing unreſiſtedly thorow
the pores of all ſolid Bodies, and even
Glaſs it ſelf, which neither the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt
Odours nor Electrical Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are obſerv'd to do, ſeem to be
almoſt incredibly minute, and much
ſmaller than any other Effluviums,
though themſelves too ſmall to be
viſible; and yet theſe ſo incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
little Magnetical Effluxions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from vigorous Loadſtones,
will be able to take up conſiderable
quantities of ſo ponderous a Body as
Iron; in ſo much that I have ſeen
a Loadſtone not very great, that
would keep ſuſpended a weight of
Iron, that I could hardly lift up to it
with one Arm; and I have ſeen a
little one, with which I could take
up above eighty times its weight.
And theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> do not only for a

but keep the Metal ſuſpended as long
as one pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed, I come now
to obſerve, That the chief effects of
<hi>Effluvia</hi> belonging to the fifth Head
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44036:58"/>
are wrought upon Animals, which
by virtue of their curious and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſtructure, have their parts ſo
connected and otherwiſe contrived,
that the motions or changes that are
produced in one, may have by the
conſent of Parts a manifeſt operation
upon others, although perhaps very
diſtant from it, and ſo fram'd as to
declare their being affected by actions
that ſeem to have no affinity at all
with the Agents that work upon the
part firſt affected.</p>

                        </note>Treatiſe, that a Humane

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44036:58"/>

Effects as are wrought on Human

any immediate contact of the Bodies
that emit them.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, not to mention <hi>Light,</hi>
becauſe its being or not being a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
thing is much diſputed even
among the Moderns; 'tis plain, that
our organs of Smelling are ſenſibly
affected by ſuch minute Particles of
matter as the fineſt odours conſiſt of.
Nor do they alwayes affect us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
as odours, ſince we ſee, that
many perſons, both men and women,
are by Smells, either ſweet or ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
put into troubleſom Headaches.</p>
                     <p>If it were not almoſt ordinary, it
would be more than almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the ſmell of a pleaſing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
ſhould preſently produce in a
Human Body, that immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was well and ſtrong, ſuch faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
ſwoons, loſs of ſenſible reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
intumeſcence of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi>
ſeeming Epilepſies, and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
motions of the Limbs, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44036:59"/>
I know not how many other fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Symptoms, that by the unskilful
are often taken for the effects of
Witchcraft, and would impoſe upon
Phyſicians themſelves, if their own
or their Predeceſſors Experience did
not furniſh them with Examples of
the like <hi>Phaenomena</hi> produc'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
means. Thoſe Symptoms ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
what the conſent of Parts may
do in a Humane Body; ſince even
Morbifick Odours, if I may ſo call
them, by immediately affecting the
organs of Smelling, affect ſo many
other parts of the <hi>genus Nervoſum,</hi> as
oftentimes to produce Convulſive
motions, even in the extreme parts
of the Hands and Feet.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the efficacy of Effluviums
confined to produce Hyſterical fits,
ſince theſe inviſible Particles may
be able (and ſometimes as ſuddenly
as Perfumes are wont to excite them)
to appeaſe them, as I have very
frequently, though not with never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing
ſucceſs, tryed, by holding
a Spirit, I uſually make of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44036:59"/>
under the Noſtrils of Hyſterical
perſons. My remedy did not only
often recover, in a trice, thoſe whoſe
Fits were but ordinary, but did more
than once, ſomewhat to the wonder
of the By-ſtanders, relieve, within
a Minute or two, perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Ages and Conſtitutions, that
were ſuddenly fallen down by Fits,

                     </p>
                     <p>I attribute the good and evil Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the fore-mentioned Steams,
rather in general to the conſent of
the parts that make up the <hi>genus
Nervoſum,</hi> than to any hidden Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
or Antipathy betwixt them
and the Womb, not only for other
reaſons, not proper to be inſiſted on
here, but becauſe I have known
Odours have notable Effects even
upon Men. I know a very eminent
perſon, a Traveller, and a man of a
ſtrong conſtitution, but conſiderably
Sanguine, who is put into violent
Head-aches by the Smell of Musk.
And I remember, that one day being
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44036:60"/>
with him and a great many other
men of note about a Publick Affair,
a man that had a parcel of Musk
about him, having an occaſion to
make an application to us, this perſon
was ſo diſordered by the ſmell, which
to moſt of us was delightful, that in
ſpight of his Civility he was reduc'd
to make us an Apology, and ſend the
perfumed man out of the room, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
whoſe receſs this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
complained to me, a good while
after, of a violent pain in his Head,
which I perceived had ſomewhat
unfitted him for the Tranſaction of the
Affair whereof he was to be the chief
manager. I know another perſon,
whoſe happy Muſe hath juſtly made
him many Admirers, that is ſubject
to the Head-ach upon ſo mild a ſmell
as that of Damask-Roſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even of Red-Roſes, in ſo much
that walking one day with him in
a Garden, whoſe Alleys were very
large, ſo that he might eaſily keep
himſelf at a diſtance from the Buſhes,
which bore many of them Red-Roſes;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44036:60"/>
he abruptly broke off the diſcourſe
we were engag'd in, to complain of
the harm the Perfume did his Head,
and deſired me to paſs into a Walk,
that had no Roſes growing near it.</p>
                     <p>If it were not for the Sex of this
perſon, I could relate an Inſtance that
would be much more conſiderable of
the Operation of Roſes. For I know
a diſcreet Lady to whom their ſmell
is not <hi>unpleaſing,</hi> (for ſhe anſwer'd
me that 'twas not ſo at all,) but ſo
<hi>hurtful,</hi> that it preſently makes her
ſick, and would make her ſwoon if
not ſeaſonably prevented: And ſhe
told me that being once at a Court
in which ſhe was a Maid of Honour,
though ſhe her-ſelf did not know
whence it came, ſhe found her ſelf
extremely ill on a ſudden, and ready
to ſink down for faintneſs; but being
then in diſcourſe with a perſon, whoſe
High Quality ſhe payd her profound
reſpect to, her Civility, that kept her
from complaining or withdrawing,
might have been dangerous if not
fatal to her, had not the Princeſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:61"/>
who was ſpeaking with her, and
who knew her Antipathy to Roſes,
taken notice that her Face grew
ſtrangely pale, and was covered with
a cold ſweat. For thereby preſently
gueſſing what might be the cauſe,
which the ſick Lady her ſelf did not,
ſhe asked aloud whether ſome body
had not brought Roſes (which were
then in ſeaſon) into the Bed-chamber,
which queſtion occaſioned a ſpeedy
withdrawing of a Lady, that ſtood
at a diſtance off, and had about her
Roſes, which were not ſeen by the
Patient, who was by this means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from falling into a ſwoon,
though not from being for a while
very much diſcompoſed.</p>
                     <p>But this you may tell me was the
caſe of a <hi>Woman,</hi> who complain'd her
malady affected her Heart, not her
Head. Wherefore returning to what
I was ſpeaking of before I mention'd
Her, I ſhall proceed to tell you, that as
Odours may thus give Men the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
ſo I have often found the ſmell
of rectified-Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:61"/>
to free Men as well as Women from
the Fits of that diſtemper; and that
ſometimes in ſo few Minutes, that
the perſon reliev'd could ſcarcely
imagine, they could ſo quickly
be ſo.</p>
                     <p>To which I ſhall not add the Tryals
that I have ſucceſsfully made upon
my ſelf, becauſe being, thanks be to
God, very ſeldom troubled with that
diſtemper, the occaſions I have had
of making them have not been many.
And though I have not <hi>alwayes</hi> found
ſo ſlight a Remedy to work the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Cure, yet that it does it often,
even in Men, is ſufficient to ſhew the
Efficacy of Sanative Effluviums.</p>
                     <p>Now, to manifeſt, that Steams do
not Operate only upon Hyſterical
Women, or perſons ſubject to the
Head-ach, I will add ſome Inſtances
of the Effects they may produce upon
other perſons, and parts.</p>
                     <p>'Tis but too well known an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that Women with Child
have been often made to miſcarry by
the ſtink of an ill-extinguiſht Candle,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44036:62"/>
though perhaps the ſmoak aſcending
from the Snuff were diſſipated into
the inviſible Corpuſcles, a good while
before it arriv'd at the Noſtrils of
the unhappy Woman; and what
violent and ſtraining motions Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are frequently accompanied
with, is ſufficiently known already.</p>
                     <p>I think I have elſewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that a Gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
a proper and luſty man,
will be put into the fits of Vomiting
by the ſmell of Coffee, boyl'd in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I ſhall therefore rather mention,
that I know a Phyſician, who having
been, for a long time when he was
young, frequently compelled to take
<hi>Electuarium lenitivum,</hi> one of the
gentleſt and leaſt unpleaſant Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Shops, conceived ſuch a
diſlike of it, that ſtill, as himſelf has
complained to me, if he ſmell to it,
as he ſometimes happens to do in
Apothecaries Shops, it will work
(now and then for ſeveral times) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and downwards with him.</p>
                     <p>I know another very ingenious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44036:62"/>
perſons of the ſame faculty, that has
been a Traveller by Sea and Land,
who has complain'd to me, that the
ſmell of the Greaſe of the Wheels of
a Hackney-coach, though it do but
paſs by him, is wont to make him ſick
and ready to Vomit.</p>
                     <p>Every body knows, that Smoak is
apt to make mens Eyes water, and
excite in the organs of Reſpiration
that troubleſom and vehement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
we call Coughing. But we
need not have recourſe at all to viſible
Fumes, for the production of the like
Effects; ſince we have often obſerved
them, and repeated Sneezings to boot,
to proceed from the inviſible Steams
of Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> when Vials
containing that liquor, though they
were perhaps but very ſmall, were
approached too haſtily, or perhaps
too near to the Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe in moſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Inſtances, the chief Effects
ſeem to be wrought, by the conſent
of parts, on the <hi>genus Nervoſum</hi> and
the action of one of them upon the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44036:63"/>
other, and thereby upon ſeveral other
parts of the Body, I will ſubjoyn a
remarkable inſtance of the Operation
of a mild and grateful Odour upon
the Humors themſelves, and that
in a Man.</p>
                     <p>A famous Apothecary, who is a
very tall and big man, ſeveral times
told me, that though he was once
a great lover of Roſes, yet having had
occaſion to employ great quantities
of them at a time, he was ſo altered
by their Steams, that now, if he come
among the Roſe-buſhes, the ſmell does
much diſcompoſe him. And the
odour of Roſes, (I mean Incarnate-Roſes,
which we commonly call
Damask-Roſes, though they be not
the true ones,) makes ſuch a colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
of Humors in his Head, that
it ſets him a coughing, and makes
him run at the Noſe, and gives him
a ſore throat; and by an affluence
of Humors makes his Eyes ſore, in
ſo much that during the ſeaſon of
Roſes, when quantities of them are
brought into his Houſe, he is oblig'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44036:63"/>
for the moſt part to abſent himſelf
from home.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                     <p>ONE may ſhew on this occaſion,
that as there might be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
things performed by Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums,
as they make one part of a
living Engine work upon another by
virtue of its ſtructure, ſo the action
of ſuch inviſible Agents may in divers
caſes be much promoted by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
and laws of the Univerſe it ſelf,
upon this account, that, by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Effluvia</hi> upon particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they may diſpoſe and qualifie
thoſe Bodies to be wrought upon,
which before they were not fit to be,
by Light, Magnetiſms, the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,
Gravity or ſome other of the
more Catholick Agents of Nature, as
the World is now conſtituted. But not
to injure another Tract, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this, when I ſhall have taken
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44036:64"/>
notice, that in the Inſtances hitherto
produced, there has been a viſible
Local diſtance between the Body that
emits Steams, and that on which they
work. But if I thought it neceſſary,
it were not difficult to ſhew, that
one might woll enough referr to the
title of this Tract divers Effects of
Bodies that are applied immediately
to ours; ſuch as are Blood-ſtones,
Cornelions, Nephritick-ſtones, <hi>Lapis
Malacenſis,</hi> and ſome Amulets, and
other ſolid ſubſtances applied by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
outwardly to our Bodies. For
in theſe applications the groſs Body
touches but the Skin, and the great
Effects, which I elſewhere relate my
ſelf to have ſometimes (though not
often, much leſs alwayes) obſerved
to have followed upon this External
contact or near application, may
reaſonably be derived from the ſubtle
Emanations, that paſs thorow the
Pores of the Skin to the inward parts
of the Body: As is evident in thoſe,
who by holding <hi>Cantharides</hi> in their
Hands, or having them apply'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44036:64"/>
to ſome remote External part, have
grievous pains produc'd in their
Urinary parts, as it has happen'd to
Me as well as to many others. And
to the inſinuation of theſe minute
Corpuſcles, that get in at the Pores
of the Skin, ſeems to be due the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of ſome Medicines, that purge,
vomit, reſolve the Humors, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
notably alter the Body being
but externally applied; of which I
could here give ſeveral Inſtances, but
that they belong more properly to
another place, and are not neceſſary
in this, where it may ſuffice to name
the notorious Power, that Mercurial
Oyntments or Fumes, either together
or apart, have of producing Copious
Salvations, to ſhew in general, that
both the Steams and the Emanations
of outwardly applied Medicinal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may have ſome great Effects on
Human ones.</p>

                     <p>THE Effluviums of Bodies,
<hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> being for the moſt
part inviſible, have been wont
to be ſo little conſider'd by vulgar
Philoſophers, that ſcarce vouchſafing
to take notice of their Exiſtence, 'tis
no wonder that men have not been
ſolicitous to diſcover their diſtinct
Natures and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Only<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. Meteor. cap. 3, &amp; 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
and (upon his account)
the Schools, have been pleaſed to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44036:67"/>
think, that the two grand parts of
our Globe do ſometimes emit two
kinds of Exhalations or Steams; the
<hi>Earthy</hi> part affording thoſe that are
hot and dry, which they name <hi>Fumes,</hi>
and very often, ſimply, <hi>Exhalations;</hi>
and the <hi>Aqueous</hi> part, others that are
(not as many of his Diſciples miſtake
him to have taught, Cold and Moiſt,
but) Hot and Moiſt<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note>,
which they uſually
call <hi>Vapours,</hi> to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
them from the
Fumes (or Exhalations,) though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in common acceptation, thoſe
Appellations are very frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                     <p>But, though the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> have
thus perfunctorily handled this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it would not become Corpuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian
Philoſophers, who attribute ſo
much as they do to the Inſenſible
Particles of Matter, to acquieſce in
ſo ſlight and jejune an account of the
Emanations of Bodies. And ſince
we have already ſhewn, that beſides
the greater and more ſimple Maſſes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44036:67"/>
of Terreſtrial and Aqueous matter
newly mention'd, there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mixt Bodies, that emit Effluviums,
which make, as it were, little Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres
about divers of them, it will
be congruous to our Doctrine and
Deſign, to add in this place, That
beſides the ſlight and obvious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
taken notice of by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
the Steams of Bodies may be almoſt
as various as the Bodies themſelves
that emit them; and that therefore
we ought not to look upon them
barely under the general and confuſed
notion of Smoak or Vapours, but
may probably conceive them to have
their diſtinct and determinate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
oftentimes (though not always)
ſuitable to that of the Bodies from
whence they proceed.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the newly mentioned
Diviſion of the <hi>Schools</hi> gives us ſo
ſlight an account of the Emanations
of Bodies, that, methinks, it looks
like ſuch another, as if one ſhould
divide Animals into thoſe that are
<hi>Horned,</hi> and thoſe that have <hi>Two Feet:</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44036:68"/>
For, beſides that the Diſtinction is
taken from a Difference that is not
the conſiderableſt, there are divers
Animals (as many four-footed Beaſts
and Fiſhes) that are not compriſed
in it; and each member of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
comprehends I know not how
many diſtinct ſorts of Animals, whoſe
differences from one another are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times more conſiderable, than
thoſe that conſtitute the two ſupreme
<hi>Genus's,</hi> the one having Bulls and
Goats, and Rhinoceros's, and Deer,
and Elks, and certain Sea-Monſters
whoſe Horns I have ſeen; and the
other <hi>Genus</hi> compriſing alſo a greater
Variety, namely, a great part of
Four-footed Beaſts, and, beſides Men,
all the Birds (for ought we know)
whether of Land or Water. And as
it would give us but a very ſlender
Information of the Nature of an Elk
or an Unicorn, to know that 'tis an
<hi>Horned</hi> Beaſt; or of the Nature of a
Man, an Eagle, or a Nightingale, to
be told, that 'tis an <hi>Horn-leſs</hi> Beaſt;
ſo it will but very little inſtruct a man
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44036:68"/>
in the Nature of the Steams of <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver</hi>
or of <hi>Opium,</hi> to be told, that
they are Vapours Hot (or rather
Cold) and Moiſt; or of the Steams
of <hi>Amber</hi> or <hi>Cantharides,</hi> or <hi>Cinnamon,</hi>
or <hi>Tobacco,</hi> to be told, that they are
Hot and Dry. For, beſides that
there may be Effluviums, which, even
by their Elementary Qualities, are
not of either of theſe two ſupreme
<hi>Genus's,</hi> (for they may be Cold and
Dry, or Cold and Moiſt,) theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are often far from being the
Nobleſt, and conſequently thoſe that
deſerve to be moſt conſider'd in the
Effluviums of this, or that, Body;
as we ſhall by and by have occaſion
to manifeſt.</p>

                     <p>ANd here it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to mention an Experiment,
that, I remember, I divers years ſince
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:69"/>
employed to illuſtrate the Subject of
our preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>I conſider'd then, that Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may be of very unequal denſity
and gravity, as is evident in Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,
Water and pure Spirit of
Wine; which, notwithſtanding their
great difference in ſpecifick gravity,
may yet agree in the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to Fluid Bodies. Therefore
preſuming, that by what I could make
appear viſible in one, what happens
analogically in the other, may be ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
illuſtrated, I took ſome Ounces
of Roch-allom, and as much of fine
Salt-peter. I took <hi>ſome Ounces</hi> of each,
becauſe, if the quantity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
be too ſmall, the concoagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
grains will be ſo too, and the
ſucceſs will not be ſo conſpicuous.
Theſe being diſſolved together in fair
Water, the filtrated ſolution was ſet
to evaporate in an open-mouthed
Glaſs, and being then left to ſhoot in
a cool place, there were faſtned to the
ſides and other parts of the Glaſs ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſmall Cryſtals, ſome Octoedrical,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44036:69"/>
which is the figure proper to Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allom,
and others of the Priſmatical
ſhape of pure Salt-peter; beſides ſome
other Saline concretions, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſtinctly of neither of theſe two
ſhapes, argued them to be concoagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of both the Salts. And this
we did by uſing ſuch a degree of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
in Evaporating the liquor, as
was proper for ſuch an effect. For,
by another degree, which is to be
employ'd when one would recover
the Salts more diſtinctly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly,
the matter may (as I found
by tryal) be ſo ordered, that the alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Salt may, for the moſt part,
be firſt coagulated by it ſelf, and then
from the remaining liquor curiouſly
ſhap'd Cryſtals of Nitre may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
obtained.</p>
                     <p>Tryals like this we alſo made with
other Salts, and particularly with Sea-Salt,
and with Allom and Vitriol;
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of which you may
meet with in their due places. For
the recited Experiment may, I hope,
alone ſerve to aſſiſt the imagination
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44036:70"/>
to conceive, how the Particles of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may ſwim to and fro in a Fluid,
(which the Air is,) and though they
be little enough to be inviſible, may
many of them retain their diſtinct
and determinate natures, and their
aptneſs to cohere upon occaſion; and
others may, by their various occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and coalitions, unite into leſſer
Corpuſcles or greater Bodies differing
from the more ſimple Particles, that
compoſed them, and yet not of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
though compounded Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>

                     <p>THeſe things being premis'd, we
may now proceed to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Inſtances of the Determinate
Nature of Effluviums; and theſe we
may not inconveniently reduce to the
three following Heads, to each of
which we ſhall aſſign a diſtinct
Chapter; the firſt of theſe I ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44036:70"/>
briefly treat of in this third Chapter,
and treat ſomewhat more largely of
the others in the two following.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place then, That the
Effluviums of many Bodies retain
a determinate Nature oftentimes in
an inviſible ſmallneſs, and oftener in
ſuch a ſize as makes them little enough
to fly or ſwim in the Air; may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by this, that theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> being
by Condenſation or otherwiſe reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they appear to be of the ſame
nature with the Body that emitted
them. Thus in moiſt weather, the
Vapours of Water, that wander
inviſibly through the Air, meeting
with Marble-Walls or Pavements, or
other Bodies, by their Coldneſs and
other Qualifications, fit to condenſe
and retain them, appear again in the
form of Drops of Water; and the
ſame Vapours return to the viſible
form of Water, when they fall out
of the Air in Dews, or Rains.</p>
                     <p>Quickſilver it ſelf, if it be made
to aſcend in diſtillation with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
degree of Fire, will almoſt all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44036:71"/>
be found again in the Receiver in the
form of running Mercury. Which
ſtrange and piercing Fluid, is in ſome
caſes ſo diſpoſed to be ſtrip'd of its Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes,
and re-appear in its own form,
that divers Artificers, and eſpecially
Gilders, have found, to their coſt,
that the fumes of it need not be, as
in Diſtillation, included in cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
to return to their priſtine nature,
Mercury having been ſeveral times
found in the Heads and other parts
of ſuch People, who have in tract
of time been killed by it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made to diſcover it ſelf during
the Lives of thoſe that dealt ſo much
in it; of which I elſewhere give
ſome Inſtances. Wherefore I ſhall
only obſerve at preſent, that 'tis a
common Practice, both among Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and ſome Chymiſts, that,
when they have occaſion to make
an Amalgam, or force away the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
from one by the fire, they keep
Gold in their Mouthes, which by
the Mercurial fumes, that wander
through the Air, will now and then,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44036:71"/>
by that time 'tis taken out of their
Mouths, be turned white almoſt, as
if it had been ſilver'd over.</p>
                     <p>A maſs of purified Brimſtone being
ſublimed, the aſcending fumes will
condenſe into what the Chymiſts call
<hi>Flores Sulphuris,</hi> which is true Sulphur
of the ſame nature with that, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
expoſed to ſublimation; and
may readily by melting be reduced
into ſuch another maſs.</p>
                     <p>And to give you another like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of dry Bodies; I tryed, that
by ſubliming good Camphire in cloſe
veſſels, it would all, as to ſenſe, be
raiſed into the upper veſſel, or part
of the Subliming-glaſs in the form of
dry Camphire as it was before.</p>
                     <p>Nay though a Body be not by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but Art compounded of ſuch
differing Bodies as a Metal and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mineral, and two or three Salts;
yet, if upon Purification of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from its groſſer parts, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
and finer parts be minute
enough and fitly ſhap'd, the whole
liquor will aſcend, and yet in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:72"/>
Receiver altogether recover its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
form of a tranſparent Fluid,
compoſed of differing Saline and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
parts. This is evident in the
Diſtillation of what Chymiſts call
<hi>Butter,</hi> or <hi>Oyl</hi> of Antimony, very well
rectified. For, this Liquor will paſs
into the Receiver diaphanous and
fluid, though, beſides the Particles
of the Sublimate, (which is it ſelf
a factitious compounded Body) it
abounds with Antimonial Corpuſcles,
carried over and kept inviſible by the
corroding Salts; whatever <hi>Angelus
Sala,</hi> and thoſe Chymiſts that follow
him, have affirm'd to the contrary;
as might be eaſily here proved, if
this were a fit place to do it in.</p>
                     <p>I found by inquiring of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
perſon, that had an intereſt in
a Tin-Mine, that I was not deceived
in gueſſing, that Tin it ſelf, though
a Metal whoſe Ore is of a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
fuſion, and which I have by it
ſelf kept long upon the Cupel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding it to fly away, would yet
retain its Metalline nature in the form
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:72"/>
of fumes or flowers. For this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Gentleman anſwer'd me, that
divers times they would take great
ſtore of a whitiſh Sublimate from the
upper part of the Furnaces or Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
where they brought their Ore
to fuſion, or wrought further upon it;
and that this Sublimate, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
elevated to the height of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Man, would, when melted
down, afford at once many Pounds
of very good Tin. On which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I ſhall add, that I have my ſelf
more than once raiſed this Metal in
the form of white Corpuſcles by the
help of an Additament, that did ſcarce
weigh half ſo much as it.</p>

                     <p>THe ſecond way, by which we
may diſcover the Determinate
Nature of Effluviums, is, by the
difference that may ſometimes be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in their Senſible Qualities. For,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44036:73"/>
theſe Effluviums that are endow'd
with them, proceed from the ſame
ſort of Bodies, and yet thoſe afforded
by one kind of Bodies being in many
caſes manifeſtly differing from thoſe
that fly off from another, this evident
diſparity in their Exhalations argues
their retaining diſtinct natures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thoſe of the reſpective
Bodies whence they proceed.</p>
                     <p>I will not now ſtay to examine,
whether in the Steams, that are made
viſibly to aſcend from the Terreſtrial
Globe by thoſe grand Agents and
uſual raiſers of them, the Sun, and
the agitation of the Air, the Eye can
manifeſtly diſtinguiſh the diverſity of
colours: But in ſome productions
of Art ſuch different colours may be
diſcovered in the Exhalations, even
without the application of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heat to raiſe them. For, when
Spirit of Nitre, <hi>for example,</hi> has been
well rectified, I have often obſerv'd,
that even in the cold the fumes would
play in the unfill'd part of the ſtop'd
Vials it was kept in, and appear in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44036:73"/>
it of a reddiſh colour, and, if thoſe
veſſels were open'd, the ſame fumes
would copiouſly aſcend into the Air,
in the form of a reddiſh or orange-tawny
Smoak. Spirit or Oyl of Salt
alſo, if it be very well dephlegm'd,
though it will ſcarce in the cold vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
aſcend in the empty part of a
Vial, whilſt it is kept well ſtop'd;
yet, if the free Air be allow'd acceſs
to it, it will, in caſe it be ſufficiently
rectified, fly up in the form of a
whitiſh fume. But this is inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in compariſon of what happens
in a volatile Tincture of Sulphur, I
have elſewhere taught you to make
with Quick-lime. For, not only upon
a ſlight occaſion the vacant part of
the Vial will be fill'd with white
fumes, though the Glaſs be well ſtop'd;
but upon the opening the Vial theſe
fumes will copiouſly paſs out at the
neck, and aſcend into the Air in the
form of a Smoak, more white than
perhaps you ever ſaw any. And both
this and that of the Spirit of Salt-peter
do by their operation, as well as ſmell,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44036:74"/>
diſcloſe what they are; the latter
being of a Nitrous nature, (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd)
and the former, of a Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous:
In ſo much that having for
curioſities ſake in a fitly ſhap'd Glaſs
caught a competent quantity of the
aſcending white fumes, I found them
to have conven'd into Bodies tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and Geometrically figur'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
'twas eaſie to diſcover by their
ſenſible qualities, that there were ſtore
of Sulphureous particles mixt with
the Saline ones. That the liquors of
Vegetables, diſtill'd <hi>in Balneo</hi> or in
Water, are not wont to retain any
thing of the colour of the Bodies that
afforded them, is a thing eaſie to be
obſerv'd in Diſtillations made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Retorts or the violence of the Fire.
But it may be worth while to make
tryal, whether the Eſſential Oyl of
Wormwood aſcend colour'd like the
Plant, whence 'tis firſt drawn over
with Water in the Limbec, or recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>in Balneo.</hi> For, I forgot to take
notice of it, when upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities,
I obſerv'd in that Plant,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44036:74"/>
my curioſity led me to find, that not
only in the firſt diſtillation in a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Limbec, tinn'd on the inſide, the
Oyl came over green, but by a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
purpoſely made in a Glaſs-veſſel,
the purified liquor was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of that colour.</p>
                     <p>The mention of theſe Eſſential
Oyls, as Chymiſts call thoſe that are
drawn in Limbecs, leads me to tell
you, that, though theſe liquors be but
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Vegetables they are
diſtill'd from, condens'd again in the
Receiver into liquors; yet, as ſubtile
as they are, many of them retain the
genuine taſte of the Bodies, whence
the heat elevated them; as you will
eaſily find, if you will taſt a few drops
of the Eſſential Oyl of Cinamon, <hi>for
example,</hi> or of Wormwood diſſolv'd
by the intervention of Sugar or Spirit
of Wine in a convenient quantity of
Water, Wine, or Beer. For, by this
means you have the natural taſte of
this Spice or Herb. And Wormwood
is a Plant, whoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> do ſo retain
the nature of the Body that parts with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44036:75"/>
them, that I muſt not forbear to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
here an Obſervation of mine,
that may ſhew you, that 'tis poſſible,
though not uſual, that even without
the help of the Fire the expirations
of a Body may communicate its taſt.
For, among other things, that I had
occaſion to obſerve about ſome quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Wormwood laid up together,
I remember, I took notice, and made
others do the like, that coming into
a room, where 'twas kept, not only
the organs of ſmelling were power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wrought upon by the Corpuſcles
that ſwarm'd in the Air, but alſo the
Mouth was ſenſibly affected with a
bitter taſt. Perhaps you will ſcarce
think it worth while, that after this
inſtance I ſhould add, that I found
the expirations of <hi>Amber,</hi> kept a while
in pure Spirit of Wine, taſt upon the
tongue like Amber it ſelf, when I
chew'd it between my teeth. But
I chooſe to mention this inſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it will connect thoſe lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
with another ſort, very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our preſent purpoſe. For,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44036:75"/>
the expirations that I have obtain'd
from Amber, both with pure Spirit
of Wine, and a more piercing <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
did manifeſtly retain in both
thoſe liquors a peculiar ſmell, with
which I found it to affect the
Noſtrils, when, for tryals ſake, I
excited the Electrical faculty of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
by rubbing. And as for Odours,
'tis plain, that the Eſſential Oyls of
Chymiſts, well drawn, do many of
them retain the peculiar and genuine
ſent of the Spices or Herbs that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
them. And that theſe Odours
do really conſiſt of, or reſide in certain
inviſible Corpuſcles that fly off from
the viſible Bodies, that are ſaid to be
endow'd with ſuch Smells, I have
elſewhere prov'd at large; and it may
ſufficiently appear from their ſticking
to divers of the Bodies they meet
with, and their laſting adheſion to
them.</p>
                     <p>Other Examples may be given of
the ſetled difference of Effluviums
directly perceivable by Humane Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of Senſe, as dull as they are;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44036:76"/>
which laſt expreſſion I add, becauſe
I ſcarce doubt, but that, if our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories
were ſufficiently ſubtile and
tender, they might immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in the ſize, ſhape, motion, and
perhaps colour too of ſome now invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Effluviums, as diſtinguiſhable
differences, as our naked Eyes in their
preſent conſtitution ſee, between the
differing ſorts of Birds, by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
and their manner of flying
in the Air, as Hawks, and Partridges,
and Sparrows, and Swallows. To
make this probable I will not urge,
that in fine white Sand, whoſe grains
by the unaſſiſted Eye are not wont
to be diſtinguiſhed by any ſenſible
Quality, I have often obſerv'd in an
excellent Microſcope, a notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity
as to bulk, figure, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as to colour: And that in ſmall
Cheeſe-mites, which the naked Eye
can very ſcarcely diſcern, ſo far is it
from diſcovering any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, one may (as was noted
in the laſt eſſay) plainly ſee, beſides an
obvious difference in point of bigneſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44036:76"/>
many particular parts, on whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
the ſtructure of thoſe <hi>moving
points</hi> may difference them from each
other. And I have ſometimes ſeen
a very evident diſparity even in point
of ſhape between the very Eggs of
theſe <hi>living Atoms,</hi> (as a Poet would
perhaps ſtile them.) But theſe kinds
of proofs (as I was ſaying) I ſhall
forbear to inſiſt on, that I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to countenance my conjecture
by the effects of the Effluviums, that
are properly ſo call'd, upon Animals.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, though the Touch be
reckon'd one of the moſt dull of the
five Senſes, and be reputed to be far
leſs quick in Men than in divers other
Animals; yet the groſs Organs of
that, may, in Men themſelves, even
by accident, be ſo diſpos'd, as to be
ſuſceptible of impreſſions from <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via:</hi>
Of this in another Paper I give
ſome Inſtances. And I know not
whether divers of the Preſages of
Weather to be obſerv'd in ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and the Aches and other pains,
that, in many crazy and wounded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44036:77"/>
men, are wont to fore-run great
changes of Weather, do not often
(for I do not ſay alwayes) proceed
(at leaſt in part) from inviſible and
yet incongruous Effluxions, which,
either from the ſubterraneal parts, or
from ſome Bodies above ground, do
copiouſly impregnate the Air. And
on this occaſion it will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to mention here what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
Phyſician being (if I much
miſremember not) the Learned <hi>Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merbrook,</hi>
relates concerning himſelf,
who having been infected with the
Plague by a Patient that lay very ill
of it, though by Gods bleſſing, which
he particularly acknowledges, upon
a ſlight but ſeaſonable Remedy, he
was very quickly cured, and that
without the breaking of any Tumor;
yet it left ſuch a change in ſome parts
of his Body, that he ſubjoyns this
memorable paſſage; <hi>Ab illo periculo
ad contagioſos mihi appropinquanti in
emunctoriis ſucceſſit dolor, vix fallax Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
indicium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two or three other Obſervations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44036:77"/>
of the like nature you meet with in
another of my Papers<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>About</hi> Coſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Suſpitions.</note>.
And I ſhall now add,
that I know an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentlewoman (Wife to a famous
Phyſician) who was of a very curious
and delicate complexion, that has ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times aſſur'd me, that ſhe can very
readily diſcover, whether a perſon,
that comes to viſit her in Winter,
came from ſome place where there is
any conſiderable quantity of Snow;
and this ſhe does, (as ſhe tells me) not
by feeling any unuſual cold (for if the
ground be frozen but not cover'd
with Snow, the Effect ſucceeds not,)
but from ſome peculiar impreſſion,
which ſhe thinks, ſhe receives by the
organs of Smelling. I might add,
that I know alſo (as I may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
told you) a very ingenious
Phyſician, who falling into an odd
kind of Feaver, had his ſenſe of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby made ſo very nice and
tender, that he very plainly heard ſoft
whiſpers, that were made at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
diſtance off, and which were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44036:78"/>
not in the leaſt perceiv'd by the
healthy by-ſtanders, nor would have
been by him before his ſickneſs.
Which (ſickneſs) I mention as the
thing, that gave his organs of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this preternatural quickneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
when the Feaver had quite left
him, he was able to hear but at the
rate of other men. And I might tell
you too, that I know a Gentleman
of eminent parts and note, who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a diſtemper he had in his Eyes,
had his organs of Sight brought to
be ſo tender, that both his friends
and himſelf alſo have aſſur'd me, that
when he wak'd in the Night he could
for a while plainly ſee and diſtinguiſh
Colours, as well as other objects, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable
by the Eye, as was more
than once try'd, by pinning Ribbands
or the like Bodies of ſeveral colours,
to the inſide of his Curtains in the
dark. For if he were awaken'd in
the Night, he would be able to tell
his bed-fellow, where thoſe Bodies
were plac'd, and what colour each of
them was of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44036:78"/>
I have mention'd theſe Inſtances
only to ſhew you, that if our Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were more delicate and quick,
they would be ſufficiently affected by
Objects, that, as they are generally
conſtituted, make no impreſſions at
all upon them. For otherwiſe I know,
that the <hi>Species</hi> (as they call them) both
of Sounds and Colours, are not held
by many of the Moderns, (from whom
in that I diſſent not,) to be ſo much
corporeal Effluxions, trajected through
the <hi>medium,</hi> as peculiar kinds of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Motion convey'd by it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall now confirm the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
I would countenance by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination
made by the organs of
other Animals of ſuch <hi>Effluvia</hi> as to
us men are not only inviſible but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.
And therefore partly to
ſtrengthen what I deliver'd, and
partly to confirm what I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
of, it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to ſubjoyn two or three Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that I had from perſons of very
good credit, whom I thought likely
to make me no unſatisfactory returns
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44036:79"/>
to my Queſtions about things they
were very well vers'd in.</p>
                     <p>A perſon of Quality, to whom I
am near allied, related to me, that to
make a tryal, whether a young Blood-hound
was well inſtructed, (or as
the Huntſmen call it, <hi>made)</hi> he caus'd
one of his Servants, who had not
kill'd, or ſo much as touch'd any of
his Deer, to walk to a Countrey-town,
four Mile off, and then to a
Market-town three Miles diſtant from
thence; which done, this Nobleman
did, a competent while after, put
the Blood-hound upon the ſcent of the
man, and caus'd him to be follow'd
by a Servant or two, the Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thinking it alſo fit to go after
them to ſee the event; which was,
that the Dog, without ever ſeeing the
Man he was to purſue, follow'd him
by the ſcent to the above-mentioned
places, notwithſtanding the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Market-people that went along
in the ſame way, and of Travellers
that had occaſion to croſs it. And
when the Blood-hound came to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44036:79"/>
chief Market-town, he paſs'd through
the ſtreets, without taking notice of
any of the people there, and left not
till he had gone to the Houſe, where
the Man, he ſought, reſted himſelf,
and found him in an upper Room to
the wonder of thoſe that follow'd him.
The particulars of this Narrative the
Nobleman's Wife, a perſon of great
veracity, that happen'd to be with
him when the tryal was made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to me.</p>
                     <p>Enquiring of a ſtudious perſon,
that was Keeper of a Red-dear-park
and vers'd in making Blood-hounds,
in how long time, after a Man or
Deer had paſs'd by a graſſy place, one
of thoſe Dogs would be able to follow
him by the ſcent? He told me,
that it would be ſix or ſeven Hours:
Whereupon an ingenious Gentleman,
that chanc'd to be preſent, and liv'd
near that Park, aſſur'd us both, that
he had old Dogs of ſo good a ſcent,
that if a Buck had the day before
paſs'd in a Wood, they will, when
they come where the ſcent lies,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44036:80"/>
though at ſuch a diſtance of time
after, preſently find the ſcent and
run directly to that part of the Wood
where the Buck is. He alſo told me,
that though an old Blood-hound will
not ſo eaſily fix on the ſcent of a ſingle
Deer, that preſently hides himſelf in
a whole herd; yet if the Deer be
chas'd a little till he be heated, the
Dog will go nigh to ſingle him out,
though the whole herd alſo be chas'd.
The above-nam'd Gentleman alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
that he could eaſily diſtinguiſh
whether his Hounds were in chaſe
of a Hare or a Fox by their way of
running, and their holding up their
Noſe higher than ordinary when they
purſue a Fox, whoſe ſcent is more
ſtrong. Theſe Relations will not be
judg'd incredible by him that reflects
on ſome of the Inſtances that have
already (in the foregoing Eſſay) been
given of the ſtrange ſubtilty of <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia:</hi>
To which I ſhall now add,
that I remember, that to try whether
I could in ſome meaſure make Art
imitate Nature, I prepared a Body
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44036:80"/>
of a vegetable ſubſtance, which,
though it were actually cold, and
both to the Eye and Touch dry, did
for a while emit ſuch determinate and
piercing, though inviſible, Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that having for Tryals ſake
applied to it a clear Metalline Plate
(and that of none of the very ſofteſt
kind neither) for about one Minute of
an Hour, I found, that, though there
had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been no immediate contact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, I having purſpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed
a piece of Paper to hinder it;
yet there was imprinted on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Plate a conſpicuous ſtain
of that peculiar colour, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with whoſe Steams I had imbued
the vegetable ſubſtance, was fitted
to give a Plate of that mix'd Metal.
And though it be true, that in ſome
circumſtances, the lately mention'd
Inſtances about Blood-hounds have
a conſiderable advantage of this I
have now recited; yet that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is much leſſen'd, not to ſay coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail'd,
by ſome circumſtances of
our Experiment. For, not to repeat,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44036:81"/>
that the emittent Body was firm
and cold, the Effect produced by the
Effluvium that guided the Setting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog,
was wrought upon the Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a living and warm Animal;
and ſuch an one, whoſe organs of
Smelling are of an extraordinary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſtitution above thoſe of Men
and other Animals, and probably
the Impreſſion was but tranſient;
whereas in our caſe the inviſible
Steams of the vegetable ſubſtance
wrought upon a Body which was
of ſo ſtrong and inorganical a Texture
as a (compounded) Metal, though it
were fenc'd by being lapt up in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
notwithſtanding which theſe
Steams invaded it in ſuch numbers,
and ſo notably, as to make their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
on it manifeſt to the Eye, and
conſiderably permanent too; ſince
coming to look upon the Plate after
the third day, I found the induced
Colour yet conſpicuous, and not like
ſuddenly to vaniſh.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto in this <hi>Chapter</hi> I have
argued from the conſtant and ſetled
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44036:81"/>
difference of the ſenſible Qualities of
Effluviums, that they do not always
loſe their diſtinct natures, when they
ſeem to have loſt themſelves by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
into Air. But before I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
this Subject, I muſt conſider an
Objection, which I know may be
made againſt the Opinion we have
been countenancing. For it may be
alledg'd, that there may be many
caſes, wherein the Effluviums of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are, in their paſſage through the
Air, ſenſibly alter'd, or do affect the
Organs of ſenſe otherwiſe than each
kind of them apart would do: Nor
is this difficulty altogether irrational.
For it ſeems conſonant enough to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that ſome ſuch caſes ſhould
be admitted, and therefore in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Diſcourſe I have, where I
thought it neceſſary, forborn to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
my ſelf in ſuch general and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
terms, as otherwiſe I might have
done. But, as for ſuch caſes as I have
inſiſted upon, and many more, I ſhall
now repreſent, that the objected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
need not hinder, but that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44036:82"/>
Effluviums at their firſt parting from
the Bodies, whence they take wing
(if I may ſo ſpeak,) may retain as
much of the nature of thoſe Bodies,
as we have aſcribed to them, ſince
the ſubſequent change may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be deduc'd from the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or coalitions of divers Steams
aſſociating themſelves in the Air,
and acting upon the Senſory, either
altogether and conjointly, or at leaſt
ſo near it, that the Senſe cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Operations as diſtinct.
This I ſhall elucidate, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to prove, by what happens in
Sounds and Taſts. For if, by way
of inſtance, in a Muſical inſtrument,
two ſtrings tun'd to an eight, be
touch'd together, they will ſtrike the
Ear with a ſound, that will be judg'd
one, as well as pleaſing, though each
of the trembling ſtrings make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
noiſe, and the one vibrates as
faſt again as the other. And if, into
Oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> you drop
a due proportion of Spirit of Nitre,
and exhale the ſuperfluous moiſture,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44036:82"/>
the Acid and Alcalizate Corpuſcles,
that were ſo ſmall as to ſwim invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
in thoſe liquors, will convene
into Nitrous Concretions, whoſe
taſt will be compounded of, but very
differing from, both the taſts of the
Acid and Tartareous Particles; which
Particles may yet, for the moſt part,
by a skilful Diſtillation, be divorc'd
again. And ſo, if to a ſtrong ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pot-aſhes or Salt of Tartar
you put as much in weight of <hi>Sal
Armoniack,</hi> as there is of either of thoſe
fixt Salts contain'd in the liquor;
you may, beſides a ſubtil Urinous
Spirit that will eaſily come over in
the diſtillation, obtain a dry <hi>Caput
mortuum,</hi> which is almoſt totally a
compounded Salt, differing enough
from either of the ingredients, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Alcalizate, as well in Taſt
as in ſome other Qualities: This Salt
(free'd from its <hi>faeces)</hi> being that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick
Salt, I ſeveral years ago gave
quantities of, to ſome Chymiſts and
Phyſicians, from the moſt of whom
I received great thanks, accompanied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44036:83"/>
with the (more acceptable) accounts
of the very happy ſucceſs they had
employed it with, though uſually but
in a ſmall Doſe, as from ſix, eight or
ten Grains to a Scruple. But this
being mentioned only upon the by,
I ſhall proceed to tell you, that, ſince
I intimated to you already, that I
would mention Examples of <hi>Sounds</hi>
and <hi>Tasts</hi> only to illuſtrate what I
had been delivering; I ſhall now add
ſome Inſtances by way of Proof, of
the Coalition and reſulting change
of Steams in the Air. 'Tis eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in ſome Noſe-gays, where
the differing Flowers happen to be
conveniently mix'd, that in the ſmell
afforded by it, at a due diſtance, the
Odours of the particular Flowers are
not perceiv'd, but the Organ is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by their joynt-action, which
makes on it a confuſed but delightful
impreſſion. And ſo, when in a Ball
of Pomander, or a perfum'd Skin,
Musk, and Amber, and Civet, and
other ſweets are skilfully mix'd, the
coalition of the diſtinct <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44036:83"/>
ingredients, that aſſociate themſelves
in their paſſage through the Air, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in the Senſory one grateful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume,
reſulting from all thoſe Odours.
But if you take Spirit of fermented
Urine and Spirit of Wine, both of
them Phelgmatick, and mix them
together, they will incorporate like
Wine and Water, or any other ſuch
liquors, without affording any dry
concretions. But if you expoſe them
in a convenient Veſſel but to the
mild heat of a Bath or Lamp, the
aſcending Particles will aſſociate
themſelves, and adhere to the upper
part of the Glaſs in the form of a
white but tender Sublimate, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both of Urinous and Vinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
aſſociated into a mixture, which
differs from either of the liquors, not
only in Conſiſtence, Taſt and Smell,
but in ſome conſiderable Operations
performable by this odd mixture;
which, this is not the place, to take
further notice of. And if Spirit of
Salt and Spirit of Nitre be, by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
elevated in the form of Fumes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44036:84"/>
ſo order'd as to convene into one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
in the Receiver, this liquor will
readily diſſolve crude Gold, though
neither the Spirit of Nitre alone, nor
that of Salt would do ſo.</p>
                     <p>And that you may have an ocular
proof of the Poſſibility of the diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſubſequent Commixture of
Steams in the Air; I ſhall now
add an Experiment, which I long
ſince devis'd for that purpoſe, and
which I ſoon after ſhew'd to many
curious perſons, moſt of whom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at it.
The Experiment was; that I took
two ſmall Vials, the one fill'd with
Spirit of Salt, but not very ſtrong,
the other with Spirit of fermented
Urine or of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> very well
rectified: Theſe Vials being plac'd
at ſome diſtance, and not being ſtop'd,
each liquor afforded its own ſmell,
at a pretty diſtance, by the Steams it
emitted into the Air, but yet theſe
Steams were inviſible. But when
theſe Vials, (which ſhould be of the
ſame ſize) came to be approach'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44036:84"/>
very near to each other, though not
ſo, as to touch; <hi>as</hi> when the two
liquors are put together in the form
of liquors, they will notably act upon
one another; <hi>ſo</hi> their reſpective Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums
meeting in the Air, would,
anſwerably to the littleneſs of their
bulk, do the like, and, by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
occurſions, become manifeſtly
viſible, and appear moving in the
Air like a little portion of Smoak or
of a Miſt, which would quickly ceaſe,
if either of the Vials were remov'd
half a Foot or a Foot from the other.
And I remember, that, to add to
the oddneſs of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made a drop of the Spirit of
Salt hang at the bottom of a little
ſtick of Glaſs or ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Body, and held this drop thus
ſuſpended in the Orifice of a Vial
that had Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> in it,
and was furniſh'd with a ſomewhat
long neck; for by this means it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
as I expected, that the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Urinous Particles, though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
before, invading plentifully the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44036:85"/>
Acid ones of the drop, produced a
notable Smoak, which, if the drop
were held a little above the neck of
the Glaſs, would moſt commonly fly
upwards to the height of a Foot or
half a Yard: But if the drop were
held ſomewhat deep within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the neck, a good part of the
produced Smoak would oftentimes
fall into the Cavity of the Vial, which
was left in great part empty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the form of drops, but uſually
in the form of a ſlender and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
winding ſtream of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that ſeem'd to flow down juſt
like a Liquor from the depending
drop, till it had reach'd the Spirit of
<hi>Sal Armoniack;</hi> upon whoſe ſurface
it would ſpread it ſelf like a Miſt.
But this only upon the by. As for
the main Experiment it ſelf, it may
be, as I have found, ſucceſsfully try'd
with other Liquors than theſe; but
'tis not neceſſary in this place to give
an account of ſuch Tryals; though
perhaps, if I had leiſure, it might be
worth while to conſider, whether
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44036:85"/>
theſe Coalitions of differing ſorts of
Steams in the Air, and the Changes
reſulting thence of their particular
precedent Quantities, may not aſſiſt
us to inveſtigate the cauſes of divers
ſudden Clouds and Miſts, and ſome
other Meteorological <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and
alſo of divers changes that happen in
the Air in reference to the coming in
and ceaſing of ſeveral either Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or contagious Diſeaſes, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the <hi>Plague,</hi> that ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon ſome occult temperature
and alterations of the Air, which
may be copiouſly impregnated by the
differing ſubterraneal (not to add
here, Sidereal) Effluviums, that not
unfrequently aſcend into it (or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
invade it,) with Peſtiferous or
other Morbifick Corpuſcles, and
<hi>ſometimes</hi> with others of a contrary
Nature, and <hi>ſometimes</hi> too perhaps,
neither the one ſort of Steams, which
may be ſuppos'd to have imbued the
Air, is in it ſelf <hi>deleterious;</hi> nor the
other <hi>ſalutary,</hi> but becomes ſo upon
their caſual coalition in the Air. You
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44036:86"/>
will perhaps think this Conjecture of
the reſultancy of peſtilential Steams,
the leſs improbable, if I here add that
odd Obſervation, which was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
made in the formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Plague at <hi>Nimmegen</hi> by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
ſo Judicious as

of which, though perhaps ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44036:86"/>

I lately aſſign'd ſeems at leaſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
one, if not the moſt probable;
ſince, as 'tis manifeſt by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that the ſmell occaſion'd by
the waſhing of foul Linnen with the
Soap commonly uſed in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
produces not the Plague; ſo
by our Learned Author's Obſervation
it appears, either that there were not
yet any Peſtilential Effluxions in the
Air of thoſe places, which on the
occaſions of thoſe waſhings became
infected, or at leaſt that by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fetid <hi>Effluvia</hi> of the ſoapy
Water, thoſe Morbifick Particles, that
were diſpers'd through the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had not the power to introduce
a malignant conſtitution into the

till they were enabled to do ſo by
being aſſociated with the ill-ſcented
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Soap.</p>
                     <p>Whether alſo Salutary, and, if I

Corpuſcles may not be produc'd in

diſable them to produce their wonted
pernicious Effects. To which Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
ſuits well what is deliver'd
by more than one Traveller into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and more particularly by our
Ingenious Countreyman Mr. <hi>George

that about the time of the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Nitre has been obſerved even by the

<hi>To prove,</hi> ſayes he<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Sandys</hi> in the Book above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</note>,
ſpeaking of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of <hi>Nilus,</hi> that it proceedeth
from a natural Cauſe, this one, though
ſtrange, yet true Experiment will
ſuffice. Take of the Earth of <hi>Egypt</hi>
adjoining to the River, and preſerve
it carefully, that it neither come to

and you ſhall find it neither more nor

the Deluge, proceeding without
doubt from the Humidity of the Air,
which having a recourſe through all
paſſible places, and mixing therewith
increaſeth the ſame, as it increaſeth
in moiſture.</p>
                     <p>That theſe Sanative Steams per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Effects meerly becauſe
they are moiſt, I preſume Naturaliſts
will ſcarce pretend; but that they
may be of ſuch a nature as by their
Coalition with the Morbifick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
to increaſe their Bulk and
alter their Figure, or precipitate them
out of the Air, or clog their Agility,
or pervert their Motions, and in a
word deſtroy all or ſome Tat leaſt of
thoſe Mechanical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affections which
made thoſe Corpuſcles Peſtilential:
That, I ſay, theſe Antidotal Vapours
(if I may ſo call them) may have
theſe Effects upon thoſe that formerly
were Morbifick, and that ſo there
may reſult from the Aſſociation of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44036:88"/>
two ſorts of Particles, whereof one
was of a highly noxious nature, a
harmleſs mixture, might here be made
probable by ſeveral things; but that
I hope what I have lately recited
about the Coalitions of the <hi>Effluvia</hi>
of Spirit of Salt and of Urine (Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
known to be highly contrary
to each other) is not already forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by you.</p>
                     <p>And the Experiment with which
I am to conclude this Eſſay will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
make you think it poſſible, that
the Peſtiferous Steams that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſs'd out of the Air, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,
but not too much vitiated, the
Bodies of Men, may have their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
much debilitated by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening
of theſe Antidotal Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
For in that Experiment you
will find, that the Steams emitted
into the Air from the Liquor there
deſcribed, though that were actually
cold, were able to reach, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
to Operate, (and that probably
by way of Praecipitation,) upon Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
that were fenc'd from them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44036:89"/>
by the Interpoſition of other Bodies;
not more porous than thoſe of living
Men. Whether the fume of Sulphur,
which by many is extoll'd to prevent
the Infection of the Air, do by its
acid or other Particles diſarm, if
I may ſo ſpeak, the Peſtilential ones,
I have not now time to inquire:
No more than whether in <hi>Ireland</hi>
and ſome few other Countries, that
breed or brook no poyſonous Animals,
that hoſtility may proceed, at leaſt
in great part, from the peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Soyl, which both from its
ſuperficial and deeper parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſupplies the Air with Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
deſtructive to venemous Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
And ſome other Particulars,
that may be pertinently enough conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
here, you may find treated on in
other Papers. And therefore at preſent
I ſhall only intimate in a word, that
having purpoſely made a viſible and
laſting Stain on a ſolid Body barely
by cold <hi>Effluvia,</hi> I did by the inviſible
and cold Steams of another Body
make in two or three Minutes a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44036:89"/>
viſible change in the colour of that
Stain.</p>
                     <p>And as for the other part of the
Conjecture, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Meteors
may ſometimes be produc'd by the
Occurſions of Subterraneal <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
ſome of them of one determinate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſome of another, I think
I could, to countenance it, give you
divers Inſtances of the plentiful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation)
of the Air at ſome times,
and in ſome places, with Steams of
very differing Natures, and ſuch as
are not ſo likely to be attracted by
the Heat of the Sun, as to be ſent
up from the Subterraneal Regions,
and ſometimes from Minerals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But for Inſtances of this kind,
I ſhall, for brevities ſake, refer you
to another Paper<note n="*" place="margin">An Eſſay of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

Bodies may not ſo ſoon periſh in the

I ſhall add, that having deſir'd an
ingenious Gentleman, that went on
a conſiderable Employment to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to make ſome Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for me in his Voyage; he ſent
me among other things this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque:
That having ſayl'd along
the Coaſt of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> (famous for Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-trees
and well-ſcented Gums,)
though they Coaſted it almoſt a whole
day, the Wind, that then chanc'd
to blow from the ſhoar, brought them
a manifeſtly odoriferous Air from the
Iſland, though they kept off many
miles (perhaps twenty or twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five)
from the ſhoar. Nor ſhould this
be thought incredible, becauſe the
diffuſion ſeems ſo diſproportionate to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:91"/>
that of other Bodies diſſolved by
Fluids; as, for inſtance, though Salt
be an active Body and reſoluble into
abundance of minute Particles, yet
one part of Salt will ſcarce be taſtable
in an hundred parts of Water. For
ſenſibly to affect ſo groſs an Organ as
that of our Taſt, there is uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in ſapid Particles a bigneſs far
exceeding that which is neceſſary to
the making Bodies fit Objects for the
ſenſe of Smelling, and, which is here
mainly to be conſidered, there is a
great difference between the power
a Body has to impregnate ſo thin and
fine a Fluid as Air, whoſe parts are
ſo rare and lax, and that which it has
to impregnate Liquors, ſuch as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Wine, whoſe parts are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipated
as to make it not only viſible
and tangible, but ponderous. On
which occaſion I remember that
having had a Curioſity to try how
far a ſapid Body could be diluted
without ceaſing to be ſo, I found by
Tryal, that one drop of good Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
and, as Artiſts call it, Eſſential
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44036:92"/>
Oyl of Cinnamon being duly mix'd
by the help of Sugar with Wine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the determinate taſt of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
though it were diffus'd into near
a quart of Wine. So that making
a moderate eſtimate, I concluded, that
upon the common ſuppoſition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which a drop is reckon'd
for a Grain, one part of Oyl had given
the ſpecifick Taſt of the Spice, it was
drawn from, to near fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
parts of Wine. By comparing
which Experiment with what I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about the proportion of Salt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to make Water taſt of it, you
will eaſily perceive; that there may
be a very great difference in point of
diffuſiveneſs between the little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that make Bodies ſapid: Which
may ſerve to confirm both ſome part
of the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> of the foregoing
Eſſay of the Subtilty of <hi>Effluvia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and
what I was lately ſaying to ſhew it
poſſible, that Antimonial Glaſs might
impart ſtore of Steams to the Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Wine, without appearing upon
common Scales to have loſt of its
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44036:92"/>
weight; ſince we ſee, that one Drop
of ſo light a Body as Oyl may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
not inſenſible <hi>Effluvia,</hi> but
taſtable Corpuſcles to near a Quart
of Liquor. But this is not all for
which I mention our Experiment:
for I muſt now add, that beſides the
almoſt innumerable Sapid parts of
a ſpicy Drop communicated to the
Wine, it thence diffuſed a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of odorous Particles into the Air,
which both I, and others perceived
to be imbued with the diſtinct ſcent
of Cinnamon, and which perhaps
the Liquor would have been found
able to have Aromatized for I know
not how long a time, if I had had
leiſure to proſecute the Obſervation.</p>

                     <p>THE third and laſt way I ſhall

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44036:93"/>
be taken from the Conſideration of

already ſpoken in the foregoing <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi>
For the Effects, that certain

and oftentimes very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from thoſe, which other Agents

                     <p>We may from the foregoing Tract
of the Subtilty of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> borrow
ſome Inſtances very pertinent to this

produc'd in the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman's

through the Shoe, Stocking and Skin,
interpos'd betwixt the Fiſh and the
nervous part of the Foot benumb'd

few other Bodies in the World, that
are minute enough to paſs through
the pores of Glaſs, 'tis apparent, by
the Experiment there recited of the
oblong Iron Hermetically ſeal'd up
in a Glaſs-pipe, that the Magnetical

                     <p>But that I may neither repeat

I have not met with <hi>many,</hi> yet I have

                     <p>The Learned<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 6. parte 7. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Sennertus</hi> obſerves
as a known thing,
that the Apprentices
of Apothecaries have
been caſt into profound Sleeps, when
in diſtilling <hi>Opiat</hi> and <hi>Hypnotick</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
they have received in at their

thoſe Bodies.</p>
                     <p>'Tis recorded by the<note n="*" place="margin">In Explicatione Herbarum Biblica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cap. 2.</note> Writers
about Poyſons, that
the root and juyce of
<hi>Mandragora</hi> caſts thoſe,
that take it, into a
deep <hi>Sopor</hi> not unlike a Lethargy. And
though the Apples of the ſame Plant
be thought to be much leſs mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant;
yet <hi>Levinus Lemnius</hi> relates
that it happen'd to him more than
once, that having laid ſome Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drake-Apples

                        <hi>Caelius Aurelianus,</hi>
who writes, that ſome
have been made to run mad, not by
being bitten, but wounded only with
the Claws of a mad Dog, tells us
alſo of a man, that fell into a <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia</hi>
(which is wont to be a high

not a bare Scholaſtick <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but a

prov'd infected after many days, by
only having put his Hand into the

                     <p>Divers other Examples we have

which I forbear to add to theſe,
becauſe, I confeſs, I very much doubt

Note. But the probability of moſt
of the things already cited out of
credible Authors may be ſtrengthned
by what I ſhall now ſubjoyn, as a
further proof of the diſtinct Nature
of <hi>Effluvia;</hi> of which it will be a
very conſiderable Proof, if Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
which are of a milder and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44036:96"/>
more familiar nature and operation
than Poyſons, ſhall yet be able in ſome
caſes to retain, in their inviſible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
ſwimming in the Air, the ſame,
(though not ſo great) power of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
which is known to belong to
them when their groſs Body is taken
in at the Mouth. Of this I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
on another occaſion, given
ſome Examples. To which I ſhall
now add, that I know a Doctor of
Phyſick, that is uſually Purg'd by the
Odours or Exhalations of a certain
Electuary, whoſe Cathartick Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when it is taken in ſubſtance,
is wont to be but languid. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctor of my acquaintance,
cauſing good ſtore of the root of
black Hellebore to be long pounded
in a mortar, moſt of thoſe, that were
in the room, and eſpecially the party
that pounded it, were thereby purg'd,
and ſome of them ſtrongly enough.
And the Learned <hi>Sennertus</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
affirms, that ſome will be
purg'd by the very Odour of <hi>Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this.</hi>
And 'tis not to be paſs'd by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44036:96"/>
unregarded; that in the caſes I have
alledg'd, Exhalations, that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with Occult Qualities, (for
thoſe of Cathartick Medicines are
reckon'd among ſuch) aſcend into
the Air without being forc'd from
the Bodies they belong'd to by an
External heat.</p>
                     <p>And if I would in this place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Examples of the Operations of
ſuch <hi>Effluvia,</hi> as do not paſs into the
Air, but yet operate only by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact
of the External parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I could give Inſtances, not only
of the <hi>Purgative,</hi> but the <hi>Emetick</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of ſome Medicines exerted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their being taken in at the Mouth,
or injected with Inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo other ſorts of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
than thoſe hitherto mentioned,
that argue a Determinate Nature in
the Effluxions of ſome Bodies emitted
into the Air. Approv'd Writers tell
us, that the Shadow of a Walnut-tree
with the Leaves on it is very hurtful
to the Head; and ſome Inſtances
they give us of great miſchief it has
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44036:97"/>
ſometimes done. And though the
Shadow, as ſuch, is not likely to be
guilty of ſuch bad Effects; yet the
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the neighbouring Plant
may be noxious enough to the Head.
For I, that was not at all prepoſſeſs'd
with an opinion that it was ſo, and
therefore without ſcruple reſorted to
the Shade of Walnut trees in a hot
Countrey, was by experience forc'd
to think it might give others the
Head-ach, ſince it did to me, who,
thanks be to God, both was, and am
ſtill very little ſubject to that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
And this brings into my mind
an Obſervation that I have met with
among ſome ingenious Travellers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> who obſerve in
general, and of late a Country-man
of our own affirms it in particular,
of the poyſonous <hi>Manchinello-tree,</hi>
that Birds will not only forbear to
eat of the Fruit of venemous Plants,
but, as to ſome of them, will not ſo
much as light on the Trees: Which
I therefore mention, becauſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Nature inſtructs them to avoid
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44036:97"/>
ſuch Trees by ſome noxious Smell,
or other Emanation, that offends the
approaching Birds. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that ſome of our Navigators give
it for a Rule to thoſe that happen to
land in unknown Iſlands or Coaſts,
that they may venture to eat of thoſe
parts of Fruits which they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the Birds, like kind Taſters, to
have been pecking at before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolaus Florentinus</hi> (cited by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus)</hi>
tells us of a certain <hi>Lombard,</hi>
that having in a Houſe, that he nam'd,
at <hi>Florence,</hi> burn'd a great black Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the flame of a Candle, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily,
that he drew in the Steams
of it at his Noſtrils, preſently began
to be much diſorder'd and fell into
a fainting fit, and for the whole
night had his Heart much diſaffected,
his Pulſe being ſo weak, that one
could ſcarce perceive he had any;
though afterwards he was cured by
Treacle, Diamoſe, and the powder
of Zedoary mixt together.</p>
                     <p>And I remember, that being ſome
years ago in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I gather'd a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44036:98"/>
certain Plant (peculiar to ſome parts
of that Countrey) which the Natives
call <hi>Maccu-buy,</hi> becauſe of ſtrange
Traditions that go about it; the chief
of which I found by tryal not to be
true: But yet being ſatisfied, that its
Operations were odd and violent
enough, I was willing to gratifie the
chief Phyſician of the Countrey, who
was deſirous I ſhould propoſe to him
ſome wayes of correcting it; and
whilſt I was ſpeaking of one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the pounding of it, he told
me on that occaſion, that intending
to make an extract of it with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
he caus'd his man to beat it well
in a Mortar, which the man ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
he had begun to do: And
the Doctor himſelf, though at a pretty
diſtance off, was ſo wrought upon
by the Corpuſcles that iſſued out into
the Air, that his Head, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
his Face, ſwell'd to an enormous
and disfiguring bulk, and continued
tumid for no inconſiderable time
after.</p>
                     <p>I have not leiſure to ſubjoyn many
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44036:98"/>
more Inſtances to ſhew the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Nature of Effluviums, ſmall
enough to wander through the Air;
nor perhaps will it be neceſſary, if
you pleaſe but to conſider theſe two
things. The <hi>firſt,</hi> that many odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Bodies, as Amber, Musk, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they will, by the adheſion
of their whole ſubſtance, perfume
Skins, Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo they will in
time perfume ſome Bodies diſpoſed
to admit their action, though kept
at a diſtance from them. And the
<hi>other</hi> is, that in Peſtilential Feavers
and divers other Contagious ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as the Plague, Small-pox, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
the ſame determinate Diſeaſe is
communicable to found perſons, not
only by the immediate contact of the
infected party; but without it, by
the Contagious Steams that exhale
from his Body into the Air. And
having ſaid this and deſir'd you to
reflect upon it, I ſhall conclude this
<hi>Chapter</hi> with an Experiment, that
poſſibly will not a little confirm a
great part of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44036:99"/>
Conſidering then with my ſelf,
how I might beſt deviſe a way of
ſhewing to the very Eye, That <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia</hi>
elevated without the help of
Heat, and wandering in the Air, may
<hi>both</hi> retain their own Nature, <hi>and</hi>
upon determinate Bodies produce Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
that a Vulgar Philoſopher
would aſcribe to Occult Qualities:
I remember'd, that I had found by
tryals (made to other purpoſes) that
Volatile and Sulphureous Salts would
ſo work upon ſome Acid ones ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim'd
with Mercury, as to produce
an odd diverſity of Colours, but
chiefly an Inky one; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I judg'd it likely that my aim
would by anſwer'd by the following
Experiment.</p>
                     <p>I took an Ounce, or better, of
ſuch a Volatile Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Sulphur, as
I have elſewhere<note n="*" place="margin">The Liquor here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd is, for the main, the ſame with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Author in his Book of <hi>Colours,</hi> Experiment the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

taught you to make
of Quick-lime, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
and <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
and ſtop'd it up in a Vial
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44036:99"/>
capable of containing at leaſt twice
as much; then taking a Paper where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſomething had been written with
inviſible Ink, I laid it down ſix Inches
off of the Vial, which, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtop'd,
began, upon the acceſs of the
Fire, to emit white Fumes into it;
and by theſe, what was written upon
the Paper, notwithſtanding its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Liquor, quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very legible, though not quite
ſo ſuddenly, as if a Paper, written
with the ſame clear Liquor, were
held at the like diſtance directly over
the orifice of the Vial. And having
caus'd ſeveral pieces of clean Paper
to be written on, with a new Pen
dip'd in the clear Solution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
made in Water, 'twas pleaſant
to ſee, how divers of the Letters of
ſeveral of theſe Papers, being plac'd
within ſome convenient diſtance of
the Vial, would be made plainly legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ſome of them more, ſome
leſs blackiſh, according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
from the ſmoaking Liquor,
and other Circumſtances. But 'twas
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44036:100"/>
more ſurprizing to ſee, that when
I held or laid ſome of theſe Papers,
though with the written ſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
juſt upon or over the orifice
of the Vial, though the contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
did not by ſome Inches reach
ſo high, yet the latent Letters would
become not only legible but conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in about a quarter of a Minute
of an Hour (meaſur'd by a good
Watch fit for the purpoſe, as more
than one tryal aſſur'd me.) And as
it may be obſerv'd, that in ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
the ſmoaking Liquor and
the Solution of Sublimate will make
an odd Precipitate almoſt of a ſilveriſh
colour, ſo in one or two of our Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
we found a like colour produc'd,
by the Steams of that Liquor, in ſome
of the colourleſs Ink. Nor is it ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to employ a viſibly ſmoaking
Liquor for the denigrating of inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Ink at a diſtance. For I have,
to that purpoſe, with good ſucceſs,
though not equal to that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
employ'd a couple of Liquors,
wherein there was neither Sulphur,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44036:100"/>
nor <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> nor Sublimate.
What other Tryals I made with our
Volatile Tincture of Sulphur, 'tis not
neceſſary here to relate, only one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
which you will poſſibly
think odd enough, I ſhall not omit;
becauſe it will not only confirm the
precedent Tryals, but alſo much of
the foregoing Eſſay, by ſhewing the
great Subtilty and penetrating power
of Effluviums that ſeem rather to iſſue
out very faintly, than to be darted
out with any briskneſs.</p>
                     <p>Cauſing then ſomething to be
written with diſſolv'd Sublimate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a piece of Paper, we folded the
Paper with the written ſide inwards,
and then inclos'd this in the midſt of
ſix ſheets of Paper, laid one upon
another, not plac'd one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and folded up in the form of
an ordinary Letter or packet to be
ſeal'd, that, the edges of the encloſing
Paper being inſerted one within the
other, the Fumes might not get into
this written Paper but by penetrating
through the Leaves themſelves: This
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44036:101"/>
done, that ſide of the Packet, on which
there was no commiſſure, and on
which, were it to be ſent away, the
Superſcription ſhould be written,
was laid upon the orifice of the Vial,
which (as was before intimated) was
ſome Inches higher than the ſurface
of the Liquor, and left there about
ten Minutes; after which taking off
the folded Papers, and opening them,
we found, that the Steams had perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the Leaves, in which the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Paper had been enclos'd. For,
though the Leaves did not appear
ſtain'd or alter'd, yet the formerly
latent Characters appear'd conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.
I have not time to diſcourſe,
whether and how far this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may aſſiſt us to explain ſome
odd Effects of Thunder, or of that
ſtrange <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> (glanc'd at in the
foregoing Chapter,) which is ſaid to
have happen'd lately in the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples</hi> after the great Eruption of
<hi>Veſuvitus,</hi> which is ſaid to have been
follow'd by the appearing of the
Croſſes formerly mention'd, ſome of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44036:101"/>
which have been found on the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
parts of Linnen, that had been
carefully folded up. But of theſe and the
like things, I ſay, I have now no time
to diſcourſe, whether any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable
from our Experiment may be
pertinently apply'd to their Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For which reaſon I ſhall add
no more than that afterwards for
further tryal we took a printed Book,
that chanc'd to be at hand, and which
we judg'd the fitteſt for our purpoſe,
becauſe the leaves being broad they
might the better preſerve a ſmall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to be plac'd in the mid'ſt of them
from being acceſſible to the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
ſidewiſe, and having put the
deſign'd Paper into this Book, and
held it to the orifice of the Vial,
though there were no leſs than twelve
leaves between them; yet thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that happen'd to be the moſt
rightly plac'd, were made inky in
the ſhort ſpace of three Minutes at
the utmoſt; though this Liquor had
been ſo long kept and ſo often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtop'd
to try Concluſions with it,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44036:102"/>
that it had probably loſt a good part
of the moſt ſpirituous and piercing
Particles.</p>

PREFACE;
SHEWING
The Motive, Deſign, and Parts
of the enſuing Tract.</head>
                  <p>THE Inducements which put me
upon the Attempt, expreſs'd in
the Title of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> were
chiefly theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I conſider'd, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellar
part of the Univerſe, conſiſting of
Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> or Fluids analogous to
one of them, is diaphanous; and that the
<hi>Aether</hi> is, as it were, a vaſt Ocean,
wherein the Luminous globes, that here
and there like Fiſhes <hi>ſwim</hi> by their own
motion, or like Bodies in Whirlpools are
<hi>carried about</hi> by the Ambient, are but
very thinly diſpers'd, and conſequently
that the proportion, that the Fixt Stars
<pb facs="tcp:44036:104"/>
and Planetary Bodies bear to the diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
part of the World, is exceeding ſmall
and ſcarce conſiderable; though we ſhould
admit the Sun and Fixt Stars to be Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
Bodies upon the account of their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
our ſight: Which diffident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
I employ, becauſe I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſhewn by two or three Experiments,
purpoſely deviſed, that a Body may appear
<hi>opacous</hi> to our Eyes, and yet allow free
paſſage to the beams of Light.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>further</hi> conſider'd, that there being
ſo vaſt a diſproportion between the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
part of the World and the Globes,
about which 'tis every way diffuſed, and
with which it is ſometimes in great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
mingled, as in the water, which
together with the Earth makes up the
Globe we inhabit; and the nature of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
Bodies being ſuch, that, when
the Sun or any other Luminous Body
illuſtrates them, that which we call Light
does ſo penetrate and mix it ſelf <hi>per
minima</hi> with them, that there is no
ſenſible part of the tranſparent Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inlightned;
I thought it worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
whether a thing, ſo vaſtly diffuſed
<pb facs="tcp:44036:104"/>
as Light is were ſome thing Corporeal or
not? And whether, in caſe it be, it may
be ſubjected to ſome other of our Senſes
beſides our <hi>Sight,</hi> whereby we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
whether it hath any affinity with
other Corporeal beings, that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with here below?</p>
                  <p>I did not all this while forget, that
the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> make Light a meer
Quality, and that <hi>Carteſius</hi> ingeniouſly
endeavours to explicate it by a modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Motion in an Aetherial matter:
But I remember'd too, that the <hi>Atomiſts</hi>
of old, and of late the Learned <hi>Gaffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
and many other Philoſophers aſſert
Light to be Corporeal; and that ſome Tears
ſince, though I declined to paſs my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about the Question, yet I had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
Arguments, that appear'd plauſible
enough to ſhew, That 'twas not abſurd
to ſuppoſe, that the Sun, which is the Fixt
Star moſt known to us, might be a Fiery
Body. And therefore doubting, whether
the Corporeity of Light would be in haſte
Determined by meer Ratiocinations, I
thought it very well worth the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to try whether I could do any
<pb facs="tcp:44036:105"/>
thing towards clearing the diſpute of it
by Experiments; eſpecially being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that, though ſuch an attempt
ſhould be ineffectual, it would but leave
the controverſie in its former state,
without prejudicing either of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<hi>Hypotheſes;</hi> and yet, if it
ſhould prove ſucceſsful, the conſequences
of it would be very great and uſeful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the explicating of divers <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
in divers parts of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
as in Chymiſtry, <hi>Botanicks,</hi> and
(if there be any ſuch) the allowable part
of Aſtrologie. (Nor perhaps would it
be impoſſible by the help of ſlight Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
alterations; to reconcile the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I deſign'd, to either of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> and ſo as to the
Explication of Light, to one another.)</p>
                  <p>To compaſs then, what I aim'd at,
I thought, 'twas fit in the firſt place to
try, what I could do by the Union of the
Sun-beams, they being on all hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
to be Portions (as I may ſo ſpeak)
of true and Celeſtial <hi>Light:</hi> And then,
I thought fit to try, what could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from <hi>Flame;</hi> not only becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:44036:105"/>
                     <hi>that</hi> is acknowledg'd to be a Luminary
but becauſe I hoped, the difficulties, I
foreſaw in the other Tryals, might be in
ſome meaſure avoided in thoſe made with
Flame; and if both ſorts of them ſhould
ſucceed, the later and former would ſerve
to confirm each other. According to the
Method I propoſed of handling theſe two
Subjects, I ſhould begin with ſome account
of what I attempted to perform in the
Sun-beams: But the truth is, that
when I chanc'd to fall upon the Enquiry
that occaſion'd this Paper, beſides that
the time of the Year it ſelf was not
over-favourable, the weather proved ſo
extraordinary dark and unſeaſonable that
it was wonder'd at; ſo that, though I
was furniſh'd with good Burning-glaſſes,
and did ſeveral times begin to make tryals
upon divers Bodies, as Lead, Quickſilver,
Antimony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Clouds and Miſts did ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favour
my Attempts, that, however they
were not all alike defeated, yet I could
not proſecute the greateſt part of them
to my own ſatisfaction. And therefore
being unwilling to build on them as yet;
<pb facs="tcp:44036:106"/>
I ſhall reſerve an account of them for
another opportunity; and now proceed to
the mention of that ſort of Experiments
which depending leſs on Caſualities, 'twas
more in my power to bring to an Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>I know I might have ſaved both you and
my ſelf ſome time and pains by omitting
ſeveral of theſe Tryals, and by a more
compendious way of delivering the reſt.
But I rather choſe the courſe I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
<hi>partly</hi> becauſe the Novelty and
Improbabilities of the Truth I deliver
ſeems to require, that it be made out
by a good number of Tryals; <hi>partly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I thought it might not be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſeleſs to you and your Friends, to
ſee upon what Inducements the ſeveral
steps were made in this Inquiry; <hi>partly</hi>
becauſe I was willing to contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards the Hiſtory that now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will be thought fit to be made of
the Increment or Decrement that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Bodies may receive by being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Fire; and <hi>partly</hi> (in fine)
becauſe the Incongruity of the Doctrine
here aſſerted to the Opinions of the
Schools, and the general Prepoſſeſſions
<pb facs="tcp:44036:106"/>
of Mankind, made me think it fit by
a conſiderable Variety, as well as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
of Experiments to obviate, as far
as may be, the differing Objections and
Evaſions wherewith a Truth ſo paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
may expect to be encountred.</p>

following Tryals a Diverſity
that invites me, as to rank
them into four or five differing ſorts,
ſo to aſſign them as many diſtinct
Sections; yet for the conveniency of
making the References, there will
be occaſion to make betwixt them,

                        <p>[A Piece of Copper-plate not near
ſo thick as a Half-crown,
and weighing two Drachmes and
twenty-five Grains, was ſo plac'd
with its broad part Horizontal, in
a Crucible, whoſe bottom had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hole in it, for Fumes to get out
at, that it could not be removed
from its Poſition, nor be eaſily made
to drop down or loſe its Level to
the Horizon, though the Crucible
were turned upſide down: Then
about an Ounce and half of common
Sulphur being put into a taller and
broader Crucible, that, wherein the
Copper ſtuck, was inverted into the
orifice of it, that the Sulphur being
kindled, the flame, but not the melted
Brimſtone in ſubſtance, might reach
the Plate, and have ſome vent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it at the above-mentioned hole.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44036:109"/>
This Brimſtone burn'd about two
Hours, in which time it ſeem'd all
to have been reſolved into Flame, no
flowers of Sulphur appearing to have
ſublimed into the inſide of the upper
Crucible; and though the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
were at a conſiderable diſtance
from the ignited Sulphur, yet the
Flame ſeem'd to have really penetrated
it, and to have made it viſibly ſwell or
grow thicker; which appear'd to be
done by a real acceſſion of ſubſtance:
ſince, after we had wip'd off ſome
little adhering <hi>ſordes,</hi> and with them
divers particles of Copper that ſtuck
cloſe to them, the Plate was found
to weigh near two and thirty Grains
more than at firſt, and conſequently
to have increaſed its former weight
by above a fifth part.]</p>

we took a piece of the thus purified
Silver, that weighed one Drachm
wanting two Grains, and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it as the Copper-plate had been
in the former Experiment, after the
flame of above one Ounce and a
quarter of Sulphur, (that Quantity
chancing to be ſuitable to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

an Hour and a half beat upon it, the
Silver-plate ſeem'd to the Eye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſwell'd, and the lower ſurface
of it, that was next the flame,
was brought to a great ſmoothneſs,

which increaſe of weight fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſo ſhort of that which was gain'd
by the Copper, I leave it to you to
conſider, <hi>whether</hi> the difference may
be attributed to the cloſeneſs and
compactneſs of the Silver, argued by
its being heavier in <hi>ſpecie</hi> than Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
<hi>or</hi> to the greater congruity of

If you ſhould here ask me, by what
Rational inducements I could be led
to entertain ſo extravagant an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
as that ſuch a light and
ſubtile Body as Flame ſhould be able
to give an augmentation of weight
to ſuch ponderous Bodies as Minerals
and Metals; I ſhall now, to avoid
making anticipations here, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
repetitions hereafter, return you
only this Anſwer: That the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you wonder at may juſtly be
entertained upon the ſame or ſuch
like inducements, as you may eaſily
diſcover in another Paper, entitled
<hi>Corollarium Paradoxum.</hi> For, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon the grounds there laid,
that Flame may act upon ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> it ſeems no
way incredible, that, as almoſt all
other <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> ſo Flame ſhould
have ſome of its own Particles united
with thoſe of the Bodies expos'd to
its action: And the generality of
thoſe Particles being, (as 'tis ſhewn
in the <hi>Paradox</hi> about the Fewel of
Flames,) either Saline, or of ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44036:110"/>
ſuch piercing and Terreſtrial nature,
'tis no wonder, that being wedg'd
into the Pores, or being brought to
adhere very faſt to the little Parts of
the Bodies expos'd to their action,
the acceſſion of ſo many little Bodies,
that want not gravity, ſhould, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their multitude, be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
upon a Ballance, whereon one
or two, or but few of theſe Corpuſcles
would have no viſible Effect.</p>
                        <p>I could here, if it were expedient,
mention ſome odd ſcruples about the
preceding Experiments, and ſome alſo
of the ſubſequent; but, leſt you ſhould,
with ſome other of my Friends, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
me with being too jealous and
Sceptical, I will not trouble you
with them; but proceed to the next
ſort of Tryals, wherein, though the
matter were not always manifeſtly
beaten on by a <hi>ſhining</hi> Flame; yet
it was wrought on by that, which
would be called Flame by thoſe who
take not that <hi>word</hi> ſtrictly, but in a

may more properly be ſtiled,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44036:111"/>
than it can be call'd common Fire,
this being viſibly harbour'd in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Coals or other groſs materials,
from which our Metals were fenc'd.

above that obtained by the Copper-plates

Which conjecture ſeem'd the likelier,
becauſe, having kept them a while

we put in one Ounce of well-heated

                        <p>[We took a Cupel about two
Ounces in weight, made of about ten
parts of Bone-aſhes, and one of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal-aſhes,
made up together with
Ale. This was by it ſelf put in a
Cupelling-furnace, under a Muffler;
and the Laborant, well vers'd in
weighing, was order'd to take it out,
when 'twas throughly and highly
heated, and to weigh it whilſt 'twas
in that condition (I being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:)
This being done, 'twas forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
plac'd again under the Muffler,
where ſome Metalline Bodies were
Cupelling, and kept there for about
two Hours; at the end of which
time 'twas taken out red-hot, and
preſently put into the ſame Ballance,
as before, which was already faſtned
to a Gibbet; where having caus'd
the adhering aſhes to be blown off,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44036:114"/>
I found, that whereas, when 'twas
firſt taken from under the Muffler,
we had but two Ounces and two
Grains, now the ſame weight being
put into the oppoſite Scale, it had
gain'd very near one and twenty
Grains. And here note, that 'twas
not without ſome cauſe, that I was
careful to have the Cupel weighed
red-hot. For I had a ſuſpition, that,
notwithſtanding the dryneſs of the
Bone, it might receive ſome little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of weight by imbibing ſome
little Particles wandering in the Air;
which ſuſpition the event juſtified.
For leaving the Cupel counterpois'd
to cool in the Ballance, in a ſhort time
it began ſenſibly to preponderate;
and ſuffering it to continue there nine
or ten hours, till we had occaſion to
uſe the Ballance, I found it at the
end of that time to be about three
Grains heavier than before.]</p>
                        <p>This was not the only tryal we
made about the augmenting the
weight of Cupels; but this being
the faireſt, and exempt from thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44036:114"/>
miſchances, from which the other
were not altogether free; I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf to have ſet down this:
In the mention of which I thought fit
to take notice of the increaſe of the
weight of the Cupel after it had layn
in the Scales, and alſo that we weighed
it at firſt whilſt it was throughly hot,
becauſe thoſe Circumſtnces, as not
being ſuſpected, may eaſily be left
unthought on, even by skilful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenters;
and yet the weighing of
the Cupel, when it had been well
neal'd, and the not weighing it ſoon
enough after 'tis taken from the Fire,
may keep thoſe, that ſhall reiterate
this Experiment, from making it
cautiouſly and accurately enough.
For if the former Circumſtance be
omitted, that which the Cupel may
ſeem to have loſt of its ſubſtance,
was nothing but the adventitious
moiſture of the Air; and if the later
Circumſtance be neglected, the
weight, it may ſeem to have gain'd
from the Fire, was <hi>indeed</hi> due to the
wateriſh Particles of the Air. I could

whether the ſucceſs would be the

                        <p>And here I ſhall conclude One of
the Two Parts of our deſigned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe:
For, though I remember, that
theſe were not all the Tryals that
were made and ſet down upon the
Subject hitherto treated of; yet theſe
are the chief, that having eſcaped
the miſchances, which befel ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44036:124"/>
others, I can meet with among my
promiſcuous Memorials; whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
when I drew them together,
I could ſcarce increaſe, having by all
theſe and other Tryals of differing
kinds waſted my Cupels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
Glaſſes, where I could not
well repair my loſs. Whether I
ſhould have been able by Reduction,
ſpecifick Gravity, or any other of the
ways, which I had in my thoughts,
to make any diſcovery of the Nature
of the Subſtance that made the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of Weight in our Ignited
Bodies; the want as well of leiſure,
as of accommodations requiſite to
go through with ſo difficult a task,
keeps me from pretending to know.
But theſe three things, I hope, I may
have gained by what has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.
The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we ſhall
henceforth ſee cauſe to proceed more
warily in the Experiments we make
with Metals in the Fire, eſpecially
by Cupellation. The <hi>next,</hi> That it
will juſtifie and perhaps procure an

other Writings, that have Relation
to the Subſtance, what-ever it be,
that we are ſpeaking of. And the
<hi>third,</hi> (which is the principal,) That
it will probably excite you, and your
inquiſitive Friends, to exerciſe their
ſagacious Curioſity, in diſcovering
what kind of Subſtance that is,
which, though hitherto overſeen by
Philoſophers themſelves, and, being
a Fluid, far more ſubtile than viſible
Liquors, and able to pierce into the
Compact and Solid Bodies of Metals,
can yet add ſomething to them, that
has no deſpicable Weight upon the

a Glaſs, a Metal expos'd in it
to a naked fire might afford us a much
more proſperous tryal than that lately

ſo Hermetically ſealing a Retort, that
it might be expos'd to a naked fire

an Account of which Tryal was thus
ſet down.</p>

'twas laid on quick Coals, where the
Metal continued above a quarter of
an hour longer in fuſion; but before
the time was come that I intended
to ſuffer it to cool in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

a noiſe like the Report of a Gun; but
(thanks be to God) it did no harm

ſome drops of a yellowiſh Liquor,

them to be put into a ſmall Retort
with a long neck, wherein was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
left but an orifice not much
bigger than a pins head: Then leaving
directions with the Laborant what
to do, becauſe I was my ſelf call'd
abroad, at my return he brought me
together with the Glaſs, this Account:
That he had kept it over and upon
the Coals two hours, or better, and
then ſuppoſing the danger of breaking
the Glaſs was over, he had ſealed it
up at the little Orifice newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and kept it on the Coals two
hours longer. Before the Glaſs (which
I found to be well ſeal'd) was broken,
I perceived the pieces of Lead to have
been melted into a Lump, whoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44036:132"/>
ſurface was dark and rugged, and
part of the Metal to have been turn'd
into a dark-colour'd Powder or <hi>Calx:</hi>
All this being taken out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
was weigh'd in the ſame Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
whereon the Lead appear'd to
have gain'd by the Operation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above thirteen Grains.</p>

                        <p>One Experiment there is, which,
though it might have come in
more properly at another place, is
not to be omitted in this becauſe it
may invite us to conſider, whether
in the foregoing Experiments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
thoſe made on Lead and Tin
in ſeal'd Veſſels, there may not be
more of the Fire adherent to or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with the Body expos'd
to it, than one would conclude
barely from the recited Increments
of their Weight. For having taken
very ſtrong freſh Quick-lime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
on purpoſe for choice Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and expos'd it, before the Air
had time to ſlake it, upon the Cupel,
to a ſtrong fire where it was kept
for two hours; I found that it had
increas'd in weight even ſomewhat
beyond my expectation: For being
ſeaſonably put into the Ballance, the
Lumps that weigh'd, when expos'd,
but two Drachms, amounted to two
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44036:133"/>
Drachms and twenty-nine Grains;
which makes this Experiment a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
one to our purpoſe. For by
this it appears, that notwithſtanding
a Body may for many hours, or
even for ſome days, be expos'd to
a very violent Fire, yet it may be
ſtill capable of admitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
freſh Corpuſcles; ſo that,
though well made Lime be uſually
obſerv'd to be much lighter than the
Stones whereof 'tis made; yet this
lightneſs does not neceſſarily prove,
that, becauſe a burnt Lime-ſtone has
loſt much of its matter by the Fire,
it has therefore acquir'd no matter
<hi>from</hi> the Fire; but only inferrs, that
it has loſt far more than it has got.
And this may give ground to ſuſpect,
that in moſt of the foregoing tryals
the acceſſion of the fiery Particles
was greater (though in ſome more,
in others leſs ſo,) than the Ballance
diſcover'd; ſince, for ought we know,
divers of the leſs fixt Particles of the
expos'd Body might be driven away
by the vehemence of the Heat; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44036:133"/>
conſequently the Igneous Corpuſcles
that faſtned themſelves to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
matter might be numerous
enough, not only to bring the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Weight that was found by
the Scales, but to make amends for
all the fugitive Particles, that had
been expell'd by the violence of the
Fire. And ſince ſo fixt a Body as
Quick-lime is capable of being
wrought upon by the Igneous <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
ſo as that they come to be as
'twere incorporated with it, it may
perchance be worth conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in other calcin'd or incinerated
Bodies the remaining <hi>Calces</hi> or Aſhes
may not retain more than the bare
Impreſſion (unleſs that be ſtretch'd
to mean ſome participation of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,)
of the Fire. Whether theſe
Particles that adhere to or are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with the ſtony ones of the Lime
may have any thing to do in the
Heat and tumult that is produc'd
upon the ſlaking of Lime, this is not
a fit place to examine. And <hi>though</hi>
by this Experiment and thoſe made
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44036:134"/>
in ſeal'd Retorts, which ſhew that
what is afforded by Fire may in a

Wits upon this Circumſtance of our

from groſs matter as mere Flame is
allowed to be, knowing, that by
going cautiouſly with it to work,

                  <div n="1" type="experiment">
                     <head>EXPER. I.</head>
                     <p>Suppoſing then that good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sulphur by reaſon of its great
Inflammability and the vehemency
and penetrancy of its Flame, would
be a very fit fuel for my purpoſe,
I provided a ſmall double Veſſel ſo
contrived, <hi>that</hi> the one ſhould contain
as many Coals as was neceſſary to
keep the Sulphur melted, and <hi>that</hi>
the other, which was much ſmaller,
and ſhap'd like a Pan, ſhould contain
the Brimſtone requiſite for our Tryal;
and (laſtly,) <hi>that</hi> theſe two ſhould
be with a convenient Lute ſo joyned
to one another, that all being clos'd
at the top, ſave the orifice of the
little Pan, (the fire and ſmoak of the
Coals having their vent another
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44036:136"/>
way,) no fire ſhould come at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
to be employed, but the flame
of the burning Brimſtone. Then two
ounces of filings of Tin being heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
weigh'd out, and put into a
Glaſs-Retort provided for ſuch Tryals,
and made fit to be eaſily ſeal'd up at
the neck, when the time ſhould be
convenient, the Sulphur (which
ought to be of the purer ſort) was
kindled, and the Glaſs by degrees
expoſed to it; where it continued,
as the Laborant inform'd me, (the
ſmell of Brimſtone, peculiarly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to me, forbidding me to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,)
near two hours before the
Metal melted; after which he kept
the Retort near an hour and half
more with the Metal melted in it.
Then bringing it me to look upon,
I perceived a pretty deal of darkiſh
<hi>Calx</hi> at the bottom, and partly too
upon the ſurface of the far greater
part of the Metal, which now lay in
one Lump. The part of the Retort
that had been ſeal'd being broken off,
we firſt took out the <hi>Calx,</hi> and then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44036:137"/>
the Lump, and putting them into
the Scales, they had been formerly
weigh'd in, found them to have made
a very manifeſt acquiſt of weight,
which, if both the Laborant and I
be not miſtaken, (for the paper, which
ſhould inform us, is now miſſing)
amounted to four grains and a half,
gained by the recited Operation.
Afterwards, we being grown more
expert in making ſuch Tryals, the
experiment was repeated with the
ſame quantity of filings of the ſame
Metal: At the end of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which in all laſted ſomewhat
above three hours) having broken off
the ſeal'd neck of the Retort, we
found, that a good proportion of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd
<hi>Calx</hi> had been produc'd.
This being weighed with the uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd
part of the Metal, the two
ounces we firſt put in appear'd to
have acquir'd no leſs than eleven
grains and a half (and ſomewhat
better.)</p>
                     <p>Such Superſtructures, both for
number and weight, may poſſibly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44036:137"/>
in time be built on this and the like
Experiments, that I ſhall venture to
obviate even ſuch a ſcruple as is like
to be judg'd too Sceptical. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that, conſidering upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſome of the Experiments
formerly recited, that though it were
very improbable, yet it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
impoſſible, that the increment
of Weight, acquir'd by Bodies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in Glaſs-veſſels to the Fire,
might proceed, not from the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
of Fire, but from the Particles of
the Glaſs it ſelf, looſened by the power
of ſo intenſe a Heat, and forcibly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the inclos'd Body; I was
content to take a couple of Glaſſes,
whereof one was ſhap'd into a little
Retort, and having weigh'd them,
and then having kept them for a
conſiderable time upon kindled Coals,
and then weigh'd them again, I
could gather little of certainty from
the Experiment, (the Retort at one
time ſeeming to have acquir'd above
half a grain in the fire,) ſave that
there was no likelihood at all, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44036:138"/>
ſo conſiderable an increaſe of weight,
as we divers times obtain'd in cloſe
veſſels, ſhould proceed from the Glaſs
it ſelf, and not from the Fire.</p>

                     <p>Becauſe it ſeems evident enough,
that, whatever Chymiſts tell us of
their Hypoſtatical Sulphur, common
Brimſtone is a body Heterogeneous
enough, having in it ſome parts of
an oyly or inflammable nature, and
others acid; and very near of kin to
the Spirits of Vitriol; I thought fit
to vary our Experiment, by making
it with a liquor that is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be as Homogeneous as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
themſelves are wont to render
any, I mean with a Spirit of Wine,
or ſome ſuch liquor as will totally
flame away without affording Soot,
or leaving any drop of Phlegm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it. In proſecution of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
we carefully weighed out an
ounce of filings of Block-Tin, and
put them into a Glaſs-Retort, fit for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44036:138"/>
the purpoſe, whoſe neck was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
drawn out to a great ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and we alſo provided a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
ſhap'd metalline Lamp, ſuch
as that the flame of this ardent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
might commodiouſly burn in it,
and yet not melt nor crack it;
which Lamp, though furniſhed with
a Cotton wick, afforded no Soot,
becauſe as long as it was ſupplied
with liquor enough, it remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt.
Theſe things being in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,
the Retort was warily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
to the flame, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
was thereby in a ſhort time mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
After which the Glaſs being
kept expos'd to the ſame flame for
near two hours in all, the ſeal'd <hi>apex</hi>
of the Retort was broken off, and
there appear'd to have been produc'd
a not inconſiderable Quantity of
<hi>Calx,</hi> that lay looſe about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
part of the Tin, which, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its growing cold, was harden'd
into a Lump. This, and the <hi>Calx,</hi>
being taken out of the Retort with
care, that no little fragment of Glaſs
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44036:139"/>
ſhould at all impoſe upon us, was
weigh'd in the ſame Scales as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and found to have gain'd
four grains and a half, beſides the
Duſt that ſtuck in the inſide of the
Retort, of which we reckon'd
enough to make about half a grain
more; ſo that of ſo fine and pure
a flame as of this totally ardent
Spirit, enough to amount to five
grains was arreſted, and in good
meaſure fixt by its operation on the
Tin it had wrought upon.</p>

<hi>Spiritus ardens</hi> of Sugar, we made
the like experiment with highly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
Spirit of Wine, only ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
an ounce of Lead inſtead of
one of Tin. The event, in ſhort,
was this; that after the Metal had
been for two hours or better kept in
the flame, the ſeal'd neck of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
being broken off, the external
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44036:139"/>
Air ruſh'd in with a noiſe, (which
ſhew'd the Veſſel to have been very

the Lead; for 'twas above ſeven ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
turn'd into a grayiſh <hi>Calx,</hi>
which together with the reſt of the

was very near, if not full, ſix grains

remain'd after the newly recited
Operation, being ſeparated from the

wherein it was again expos'd
to the flame of Spirit of Wine, that
I might ſatisfie my ſelf, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the whole Body of the Lead
might not, by repeated Operations,
or (perhaps by one continued long
enough) be reduc'd to <hi>Calx.</hi> And
though, after the Retort (whoſe neck
had been drawn out) had been kept
in the flame for about two hours,
it was, by the negligence of a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy,
unluckily broken, and ſome of

to ſave about five grains of it, (whoſe

enough to make it likely, that, if
we had had conveniency to purſue
the Operation to the utmoſt, the

by the action of the flaming
Spirit.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>N. B.</hi> And leſt you ſhould be
induc'd by ſome Chymical conceits
to imagine, that the particles that
once belong'd to flame, did make
more than a Coalition with thoſe of
the Lead, and by a perfect Union
were Really tranſmuted into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
whoſe weight they increas'd;
I ſhall add, that (according to a
Method elſewhere deliver'd) I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
the <hi>ſeven ſcruples</hi> of <hi>Calx,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

as I expected, that though the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>

increas'd by the particles of Flame
that ſtuck faſt to it, yet this Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44036:140"/>
of Lead and extinguiſh'd Flame
had loſt much of its <hi>ſpecifick</hi> Gravity.
For, whereas Lead is wont to be to
Water of the ſame bulk, as about <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are not the only Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I made of the Operation of
meer Flame upon Bodies inclos'd in
Glaſſes; but theſe, I ſuppoſe, are
ſufficient to allow me to comply with
my preſent haſte, and yet make good
the <hi>Title</hi> prefixt to this Paper. For,
whence can this increaſe of <hi>abſolute</hi>
weight (for I ſpeak not of <hi>ſpecifick</hi>
Gravity,) obſerv'd by us in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
expos'd to the mere flame, be
deduc'd, but from ſome pondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts of that Flame? And how
could thoſe parts invade thoſe of
the Metal inclos'd in a Glaſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by paſſing through the

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44036:141"/>
                        <hi>or</hi> to be forward to advance the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

be perhaps but a remote one, or a

as to ſubjoyn on this occaſion
two or three ſhort Intimations, that
may prove <hi>both</hi> ſeaſonable for Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in reference to the Porouſneſs
of Glaſs, <hi>and</hi> give a hint or two in
relation to other Things.</p>
                     <p>I do not then by the foregoing
Experiments pretend to make out
the Poroſity of Glaſs any farther,
than is expreſt in the <hi>Title</hi> of this

of the Ponderable parts of Flame.
For otherwiſe I am not at all of their

we obſerve to be made in the Weight
of the Bodies that we expoſe to the
naked Fire, and thoſe of the ſame or
the like kinds that we included in
Glaſſes, or ſo much as in Crucibles;
it may be worth conſidering, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this difference in acquir'd weight
may not give cauſe to ſuſpect, that
the Corpuſcles, whereof Fire and
Flame conſiſts, are not all of the
ſame ſize, and equally agitated, but
that the interpos'd Veſſel keeps out
the groſſer Particles like a kind of
Strainer, though it gives paſſage to
the minuteſt and moſt active?</p>
                     <p>I offer it alſo to Conſideration,
Whether this perviouſneſs of Glaſs,
even to the minute particles that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
it, and their adheſion to the
Metal they work on, does neceſſarily
imply Pores <hi>constantly</hi> great enough
to tranſmit ſuch Corpuſcles? or,
Whether it may not be ſaid, <hi>that</hi>
Glaſs is generally of a cloſer Texture,
than when in our Experiments the
pores are open'd by the vehement
Heat of the flame that beats upon it,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44036:142"/>
and in that ſtate may let paſs Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
too big to permeate Glaſs in
its ordinary ſtate; and <hi>that</hi> this
penetration is much aſſiſted by the
vehement agitation of the Igneous
parts, which by the rapidneſs of their
motion both force themſelves a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
through the narrow pores of
the Glaſs, and pierce deep enough
into thoſe of the included Body to
ſtick faſt there; (as hail-ſhot thrown
with ones hand againſt a board, will
paſs off from it, but being ſhot out
of a Gun will pierce it, and lodge
themſelves in it?) And I know a
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> that does not work upon
a certain Metal whilſt the liquor is
cold, or but faintly heated, and yet
by intending the Heat would be made
to turn it into a powder or <hi>Calx,</hi>
(for it does not properly diſſolve it.)</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may not be amiſs to
add on this occaſion, that though
Glaſs be generally acknowledged to
have far ſmaller pores, than any
other matter wont to be implyed to
make veſſels, that are to be expos'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44036:142"/>
to the fire; yet till I be farther ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
I ſhall forbear <hi>both</hi> to determine,
whether the rectitude, that ſome
Philoſophers ſuppoſe in the pores of
Glaſs, as 'tis a tranſparent body, or
rather in their ranks or rows, may
facilitate the Perviouſneſs we above
obſerv'd in Glaſs, <hi>and</hi> to conclude
from the foregoing Experiments,
that ponderable parts of Flame will
be able as well to paſs through the
pores of Metalline veſſels as thoſe of
Glaſs. For though, with a ſilver
veſſel, made merely of plate without
Soder, I made two or three Tryals
(of which you may command an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
in order to the reſolving of
theſe doubts; yet by an accident,
which, though it were not a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
one, was unlucky enough
to defeat my endeavours, I was kept,
for want of fit Accommodations,
from bringing my intended tryals to
an iſſue.</p>

Flame may act as a Menſtruum,
and make Coalitions with the Bodies

                     <p>THE Experiments, we have made
and recited of the premeating
of Flame (as to ſome of its parts)
through Glaſs-veſſels, and of its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on included Metals, may much
confirm the Paradox I have elſewhere
propos'd, That Flame may be a
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and work on ſome Bodies
at the rate of being ſo; I mean not
only by making a notable Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
and Diſſipation of the parts,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44036:143"/>
but by a Coalition of its own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
with thoſe of the fretted Body,
and thereby <hi>permanently</hi> adding Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Weight to them. Nor is
it repugnant to Flames, being a <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi>
that in our experiment the
Lead and Tin, expos'd to it, were
but reduc'd to powder, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in the form of a Liquor, and
kept in that ſtate. For, beſides that
the interpos'd Glaſs hinder'd the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
particles from getting through
in plenty enough; I conſider, that
'tis not neceſſary, that all <hi>Menſtruums</hi>
ſhould be ſuch Solvents, as the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſuppoſes. For <hi>whether</hi> it be (as
I have ſometimes ſuſpected,) that
<hi>Menſtruums,</hi> that we think ſimple,
may be compounded of very differing
parts, whereof one may precipitate
what is diſſolved by the other; <hi>or</hi>
for ſome other Cauſe, I have not now
time to diſcuſs. Certain it is, that
ſome <hi>Menſtruums</hi> corrode Metals and
other Bodies without keeping diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
all, or perhaps any conſiderable
part; as may be ſeen, if you put Tin
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44036:144"/>
in a certain quantity of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
which will in a very ſhort time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it almoſt totally to a very white
ſubſtance, which, when dry, is a
kind of <hi>Calx.</hi> And ſo by a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Oyl of Vitriol, abſtracted
from Quickſilver by a ſtrong fire, we
have divers times reduc'd the main
body of the Mercury into a white
powder, whereof but an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part would be diſſoluble in water.
And ſuch a white <hi>Calx</hi> I have had
by the action of another fretting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
on a Body not Metalline.</p>
                     <p>And having thus clear'd our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
of the oppos'd Difficulty, my
haſte would immediately carry me on
to the next Corollary, were it not,
that there is one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this place that deſerves to be
taken notice of. For, <hi>whether</hi> it be,
as ſeems probable, from the vehement
agitation of the permeating particles
of Flame, that violently tear aſunder
the Metalline Corpuſcles, or from the
nature of the Igneous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi>
(which being as 'twere percolated
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44036:144"/>
through Glaſs it ſelf, muſt be ſtrangely
minute,) 'tis worth obſerving, how
ſmall a proportion, in point of weight,
of the additional adhering Body may
ſerve to corrode a Metal, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the Quantity of vulgar <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struums</hi>
that is requiſite for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
For, whereas we are oblig'd to
imploy, to the making the ſolution
of crude Lead, ſeveral times its weight
of Spirit of Vinegar, and (though not
ſo many times) even of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
'twas obſerv'd in our Experiment,
that, though the Lead was increas'd
but ſix grains in weight, yet above
ſix ſcore of it were fretted into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

Calcination and Calces.</head>
                     <p>Another Conſequence, deducible
from our diſcovery of the perviouſneſs
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44036:145"/>
of Glaſs to Flame, may be this; That
there is cauſe to queſtion the Truth
of what is generally taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about Calcination, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the notion, that not only
others, but Chymiſts themſelves, have
entertain'd about the <hi>Calces</hi> of Metals
and Minerals. For, whereas 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſuppos'd, that in Calcination
the greater part of the Body is driven
away, and only the Earth, to which
Chymiſts add the Fixt Salt, remains
behind; and whereas even Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Philoſophers, (for two or three
of Them have taken notice of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,)
are of opinion, that much
is driven away by the violence of the
fire; and the remaining parts by being
depriv'd of their more radical and fixt
moiſture are turn'd into dry and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
particles: Whereas theſe Notions,
<hi>I ſay,</hi> are entertain'd about Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it ſeems, that they are not well
fram'd, and do not univerſally hold;
ſince, at leaſt they are not applicable
to the Metals, our Experiments were
made on. For, it <hi>does not</hi> appear
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44036:145"/>
by our Tryals, that any proportion,
worth regarding, of moiſt and fugitive
parts was expell'd in the Calcination;
but it <hi>does</hi> appear very plainly, that by
this Operation the Metals gain'd more
weight than they loſt; ſo that the
main body of the Metal remain'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and was far from being, <hi>either</hi>
as a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> would think, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Earth, <hi>or</hi> a compound of
Earth and Fixt Salt, as Chymiſts
commonly ſuppoſe the <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead
to be. From which very erroneous
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> they are wont to inferr the
ſweet Vitriol of Lead, which they call
<hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> to be but the ſweet
Salt of it <hi>extracted</hi> only by the Spirit
of Vinegar, which does <hi>indeed</hi> plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
enough concurr to <hi>compoſe</hi> it.
Whence I conclude, that the <hi>Calx</hi>
of a Metal even made (as they ſpeak)
<hi>per ſe,</hi> that is, by fire without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament,
may be, at leaſt in ſome
caſes, not the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or <hi>Terra
damnata,</hi> but a Magiſtery of it. For,
in the ſenſe of the moſt intelligible
of the Chymical Writers, that is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44036:146"/>
properly a Magiſtery wherein the
Principles are not ſeparated, but the
bulk of the Body being preſerved, it
acquires a new and convenient form
by the addition of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> or
Solvent imployed about the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And, not here to borrow any
Argument from my Notes about
particular Qualities, you may gueſs,
how true it is, that the greateſt part
of the Body, or all the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is expell'd in Calcination, which
therefore turns the Metal into an
arid unfuſible powder; by this, That
I have ſeveral times from <hi>Calx</hi> of
Lead reduc'd corporal Lead. And
I remember, that having taken what
I gueſs'd to be but about a third or
fourth part of the <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by the third Experiment; I
found by a tryal purpoſely devis'd,
that without any Flux-powder or any
additament, but meerly by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Flame of highly Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Spirit of Wine, there could in
a ſhort time be obtain'd a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proportion of malleable Lead;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44036:146"/>
whereof the part I had the Curioſity
to examine, was true malleable Lead;
ſo little was the arid powder, whence
this was reduc'd, depriv'd by the
foregoing Calcination of the ſuppo'sd
radical moiſture requiſite to a Metal.
The Conſideration of what may be
drawn from this Reduction in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Doctrine of Qualities
belongs not to this place.</p>

                     <p>One uſe, among the reſt, we may
make, by way of Corollary, of the
foregoing Diſcovery, which is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to a Controverſie warmly
agitated among the Corpuſcular Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
themſelves. For, ſome of
them, that follow the <hi>Epicurean</hi> or
<hi>Atomical Hypotheſis,</hi> think, that when
Bodies are expos'd in cloſe veſſels to
the fire, though the Igneous Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
do not ſtay with the Bodies
they invade, yet they really get
through the Pores of the interpos'd
Veſſels, and permeate the included
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44036:147"/>
Bodies in their paſſage upwards;
whereas others, eſpecially favourers
of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Doctrine, will not
allow the <hi>Atomiſts</hi> Igneous Corpuſcles,
which they take to be but vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
agitated particles of Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
matter, to penetrate ſuch minute
pores as thoſe of Glaſs; but do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the operation of the fire to be
perform'd by the vehement agitation
made of the ſmall parts of the Glaſs,
and by them propagated to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
Bodies, whoſe particles by this
violent Commotion are notably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
and receive new Textures, or
other modifications.</p>
                     <p>But our Experiments inform us,
that, though neither of the two Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſeems fit to be deſpiſed, yet
neither ſeems to have hit the very
mark; though the <hi>Epicurean Hypotheſis</hi>
comprize ſomewhat more of the
Truth than the other. For, though
it be not improbable, that the brisk
agitation communicated by the ſmall
parts of the Glaſs to thoſe of the Body
contain'd in it, may contribute much
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44036:147"/>
to the effect of the fire; and though,
by the ſmall increment of weight,
we found in our expos'd Metal, 'tis
very likely, that far the greater part
of the Flame was excluded by the
cloſe Texture of the Glaſs; yet on
the other ſide 'tis plain, that Igneous
particles were trajected through the
Glaſs, which agrees with the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans;</hi>
and they, on the other ſide,
miſtook, in thinking that they did
but paſs through, and divide and
agitate the included Bodies; to which
nevertheleſs our Experiments ſhew,

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44036:148"/>

entangled among the metalline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Tin and Lead, and thereby
brought to be fixt enough to endure
the Heat that kept thoſe Metals in

that of Lead or Tin may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

which ſhews us, what light

permanently concurr to the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

may be with advantage) to thoſe
aggregates of ſpirituous Corpuſcles,

the Bodies of Plants and Animals.
And this hint may ſuggeſt a main

of the Sun-beams on appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
ſubjects, ſuppoſing it to
prove like that of flame on Tin and

                     <p>And now having diſpatch'd our

inquire, Whether all the particles of
