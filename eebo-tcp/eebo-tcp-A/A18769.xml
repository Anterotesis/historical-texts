            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Redoubted and Royall Queene, that Kings doe feare, Subiects doe honour, strangers seeke succour of, and people of speciall spirit acknowledge (as their manifold books declare) I least of all, presume to farre, either in presenting matter to be iudged of, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the cracking of credite, with writing any thing, that may breede mislike (presents not well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) in the deepe iudgement of so high and mightie a Princesse. But where a multitude runnes forward (forced through desire or fortune) to shewe duetie, or to see what falleth out of their forwardnes, I step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in among the rest, am driuen and led (by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to followe) beyond the force of my power or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any learned arte. So being thrust on with the throng, I finding my self brought before the presence of your Maiestie (but barely furnished of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to whom I must vtter some matter of delight, or from whom I must retourne all abashed with open disgrace. Thus Gracious Lady, vnder your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fauour I haue vndertaken to set foorth a worke in the honour of VVales, where your highnes aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors tooke name, and where your Maiestie is as much loued and feared, as in any place of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse dominion. And the loue and obedience of which people so exceedes, and surpasseth the common good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of the worlde, that it seemeth a wonder in our age (wherein are so many writers) that no one man doth not worthely according to the countries good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes set forth that noble Soyle and Nation. Though in deede diuers haue sleightly written of the same, and some of those labours deserueth the reading, yet except the eye be a witnes to their workes, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can not therein sufficiently yeeld due commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to those stately Soyles and Principalities. For which cause I haue trauayled sondry times of purpose through the same, and what is written of I haue beheld, and throughly seene, to my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb facs="tcp:5362:3"/>
and admiration. For the Citties, Townes, and goodly Castles thereof are to be mused on, and merites to bee registred in euerlasting memorie, but chiefly the Castles (that stand like a company of Fortes) may not be forgotten, their buyldings are so princely, their strength is so greate, and they are such stately seates and defences of nature. To which Castles great Royaltie and liuings belongeth, and haue bene and are in the giftes of Princes, now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of noble men and such as they appoint to keep them. The royalties whereof are alwayes looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but the Castles doe dayly decay, a sorrowfull sight and in a maner remediles. But nowe to come to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of the people, &amp; to shew somewhat of their curtesie, loyalty, &amp; naturall kindnes, I presume your Maiestie will pardon me to speake of, for of trueth your highnes is no soner named among them, but such a generall reioysing doth arise, as maketh glad any good mans hart to behold or heare it, it proceeds of such an affectionate fauour. For let the meanest of the Court come downe to that countrey, he shalbe so saluted, halsed and made of, as though he were some Lords sonne of that soyle, &amp; further the plain people thinks it debt &amp; duetie, to follow a strangers Stirrop (being out of the way) to bring him where
<pb facs="tcp:5362:4"/>
he wisheth, which gentlenes in all countries is not vsed, and yet besides all this goodnes and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, there is neither hewe nor cry (for a robbery) in many hundreth myles riding, so whether it be for feare of iustice, loue of God, or good disposition, small Robberies or none at all are heard of there. They triumph likewise so much of fidelitie, that the very name of a falsifier of promes, a murtherer or a theef, is most odious among them, especially a Traytor is so hated, that his whole race is rated at and abhord as I haue heard there, report of Parrie and others, who the common people would haue torne in peeces if the lawe had not proceeded. And such regard they haue one of another, that neither in market townes, high wayes, meetings, nor publicke assemblies they striue not for place, nor shewe any kind of roysting: for in sted of such high stomackes and stoutnes, they vse frendly salutations and courtesie, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging duetie thereby, &amp; doing such reuerence to their betters, that euery one in his degree is so well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derctood and honored, that none can iustly say hee hath suffered iniurie, or found offence by the rude &amp; burbarous behauiour of the people. These vsages of theirs, with the rest that may be spoken of their ciuil maner and honest frame of lyfe, doth argue there is
<pb facs="tcp:5362:4"/>
some more nobler nature in that Nation, then is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reported, which I doubt not but your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is as willing to heare as I am desirous to make manifest and publish: the hope whereof redoubleth my boldnes, and may happely sheeld me from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of worlds hastie iudgement, that condemnes men without cause for writing that they know, and praysing of people before their faces: (which suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heads call a kind of adulation) but if telling of troth, be rebukable, and playne speeches be offensiue, the ignorant world shall dwell long in errors, and true writers may sodaynly sit in silence. I haue not only searched sondry good Authors for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of my matter, but also paynfully traueiled to trye out the substance of that is written, for feare of committing some vnpardonable fault and offence, in presenting this Booke vnto your Highnesse. VVhich worke, albeit it is but litle, (because it trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not of many Shieres) yet greatly it shal reioyce the whole Countrey of VVales, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shall heare it hath found fauour in your gracious sight, &amp; hath passed through those blessed hands, that holds the rayne and bridle of many a stately Kingdome, and Terrytorie. And my selfe shall reape so much glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by the free passage of this simple labour, that
<pb facs="tcp:5362:5"/>
hereafter I shall goe through (GOD sparing life) with the rest of the other Shieres not heere named. These things only taken in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to cause your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to knowe, what puysance and strength such a Princesse is of, that may commaund such a people: and what obedience loue and <unclear>loyaltie</unclear> is in such a Countrey, as hereunto hath bin but little spoken of, and yet deserueth most greatest lawdation. And in deede the more honorable it is, for that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse princely Auncestors sprong forth of the noble braunches of that Nation. Thus duetifully pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for your Maiesties long preseruation, (by whose bountie and goodnesse I a long while haue liued) I wish your Highnesse all the hap, honour, victorie, and harts ease, that can be desired or imagined.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seeme straunge (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that I haue chosen in the end of my daies to trauaile, and make discription of Countries: whereas the beginning of my youth (and a long while after) I haue hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the warres, and written somewhat of Martiall Discipline: but as euery season breedeth a seuerall humour, and the humours of men are diuers: (drawing the mynd to sondrie dispositions) so common occasion that commands the iudgement, hath set me a worke, and the warme good will &amp; affection, borne in breast, towards the worthie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Wales, hath haled me often forward, to take this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in hand, which many before haue learnedly handled. But yet to shewe a difference in writing, and a playnnesse in speech (because playne people affects no florishing phrase) I haue now in as ample a maner (without borrowed termes) as I could, declared my opinion of that sweete Soyle and good Subiects therof, euen at that very instant, when Wales was almost forgotten, or scarce remembred with any great lawdation, when it hath merited to be written of: for son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie famous causes most meete to be honored, and necessary to be touched in. First, the world will confesse (or els it shall do wrong) that some of our greatest Kings (that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered much) were borne &amp; bred in that Countrey: which Kings in their times, to the glory of England, haue wrought wonders, &amp; brought great benefites to our weale publicke. Among the same Princes, I pray you giue me leaue to place our good Queene Elizabeth, and pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me withall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:5362:6"/>
you to the Chronicles, for the seeking out of her Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors noble actions, and suffer me to shewe a little of the goodnesse, gathered by vs, from her Maiesties well doing, and possessed a long season from her princely and iust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. An act so noble &amp; notorious, that neither can escape immortall fame, nor shall not passe my pen vnresited.</p>
            <p>Now weigh in what plight was our state when she came first to the Crowne, and see how soone Religion was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (a matter of great moment) peace planted, and warres vtterly extinguished, as the sequell yet falleth out.</p>
            <p>Then behold how she succoured the afflicted in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> (let the going to <hi>Newhauen</hi> beare witnesse) and chargeably without breaking of League mainteyned her friends and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed her enemies.</p>
            <p>Then looke into the seruice and preseruation of <hi>Scotland</hi> (at the siege of <hi>Leeth</hi>) and see how finely the French were al shipped away (they being a great power) and sent home in such sort, that neuer since they had mynd to returne thether againe, in that fashion and forme that they sayled towards <hi>Scotland</hi> at the first.</p>
            <p>Then consider how bace our money was, &amp; in what short tyme (with little losse to our Countrey) the bad coyne was conuerted to good siluer: and so is like to continue to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Then in the aduancing of Gods word and good people, regard how <hi>Rochell</hi> was relieued, and <hi>Rone</hi> and other places fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cause to pray for her life, who sought to purchase their peace and see them in safetie.</p>
            <p>Then thinke on the care she tooke for <hi>Flaunders,</hi> during the first troubles, and how that Countrey had bene vtterly destroyed, if her Highnes helping hand had not propped vp that tottering State.</p>
            <p>Then Christianly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue how many mul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itudes of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers she hath giuen gracious countenance vnto, and hath freely licensed them to liue here in peace and rest.</p>
            <p>Then paise in an equall ballance the daungerous estate of <hi>Scotland</hi> once againe, when the Kings owne Subiects kept
<pb facs="tcp:5362:6"/>
the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough</hi> against their owne naturall Lord &amp; Maister: which presumptuous part of Subiects, her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not abide to behold: wherevpon she sent a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power to ayde the Kings Maiestie: which power vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly wonne the Castle, and freely deliuered the same to the right owner thereof, with all the treasure and prisoners therein.</p>
            <p>Then regard how honourably she hath dealt with diuers Princes that came to see her, or needed her magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and countenance.</p>
            <p>Then looke throughly into the mightinesse &amp; managing of all matters gone about and put in exercise princely, and yet peaceably since the day of her Highnesse Coronation, and you shalbe forced to confesse that she surmounts a great number of her Predecessors: and she is not at this day no whit inferiour to the greatest Monarke of the world.</p>
            <p>Is not such a peereles Queene then, a comfort to Wales, a glorie to England, and a great reioysing to all her good neighbours?

            <p>So (good Reader) do iudge of my labours: my pen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a band of causes to write as farre as my knowledge may leade: and my duetie hath no end of seruice, nor no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits are set to a loyall Subiect, but to wish and worke to the vttermost of power.</p>
            <p>Within this worke are seuerall discourses: some of the beautie &amp; blessednes of the Countrey: some of the strength and statelynesse of their inpregnable Castles: some of their trim Townes and fine situation: some of their antiquitie, shewing from what Kings and Princes they tooke their first name and prerogatiue. So generally of all maner of matters belonging to that Soyle, as Churches, Monuments, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, Valleys, Waters, Bridges, fayre Gentlemens houses, and the rest of things whatsoeuer, may become a writers pen to touch, or a readers iudgement to knowe.

contenciously to find fault with any, or confute the former writers and tyme:<note place="margin">William <unclear>Malmesburie</unclear> de regibus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum. Dauid Powell a <unclear>late</unclear> writer, yet excellently learned, made a sharp <unclear>inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</unclear> against William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus and Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Virgill (&amp; all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them of lying tongues, enuyous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and veno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wilfull <unclear>ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</unclear>, dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged enuie, and <unclear>canckered</unclear> mindes, for that thei spake vnreuerently of Arthur, and many other thrise noble Princes. Jeffrey of Monmouth. Matthewe of Westminster, and others are here in like sort to be read &amp; looked on.</note> but to aduaunce and winne credite to the present trueth, agreeing and yeelding to all former tymes and ages, that hath iustly giuen euery Nation their due, and truely without affection hath set downe in plaine words the worthines of plaine people: for I honor and loue as much a true Author, as I hate and detest a reporter of trifeling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. A true Historie is called the Mistresse of life: and yet all Historyographers in writing of one thing, agree not well one with another: because the writers were not present in the tymes, in the places, nor saw the persons they make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of: but rather haue leaned and listned on the common report, than stayed or trusted to their owne experience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strabo</hi> a most famous writer findes fault (for the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) with <hi>Erstaotheus, Metrodorus, Septius, Possidonius,</hi> and <hi>Patrocles</hi> the Geographer: And such discord did arise amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g writers in tyme past, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith against <hi>Appio,</hi> that they reprooued one another by bookes, and all men in generall reprooued <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God shield me from such caueling: for I deliuer but what I haue seene and read: alledging for defence both auncient Authors, and good tryall of that is written. Wherefore (lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Reader) doe rather struggle with those two strong pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of knowledge, than striue with the weaknesse of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention: which to auoyde sharpnesse (and bitter words) is sweetned and seasoned with gentle verses, more pleasant to some mens eares then prose, and vnder whose smooth grace of speech, more acceptable matter is conuayed, then the common sort of people can comprehend. For verses like a familiar friend (with a gallant phrase) rides quietly by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and dasheth no one person, and galloping cleanly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way merites no rebuke: when prose with a soft pace cannot with such cunning passe vnperceiued. But all is one when in neither of both is found no matter of mistrust, nor speeches to offend, there is no cause of dislike. So crauing thy good opinion, good Reader farewell.</p>

               <p>BEcause many that fauoured not <hi>Wales</hi> (parsiall writers and historians) haue written &amp; set downe their owne opinions, as they pleased to publish of that Countrey: I therefore a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse from the orderly matter of the booke, and touch somewhat the workes and wordes of them that rashly haue written more then they knewe, or well could proue.</p>

                  <l>As learned men, hath wrote graue works of yore,</l>

                  <l>For such respect, I blame now <hi>Pollydore</hi>:</l>
                  <l>Because of <hi>Wales,</hi> his iudgement was but bad.</l>

                  <l>Yet better farre, they had not bene aliue,</l>
                  <l>Than sowe such seedes, as brings no goodnesse forth:</l>
                  <l>Their praise is small, that plucks backe others fame,</l>
                  <l>Their loue not great, that blots out neighbours name,</l>
                  <l>Their bookes but brawles, their bable bauld and bare,</l>
                  <l>That in disdaine, of fables writers are.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>What fable more, then say they knowe that thing</l>
                  <l>They neuer sawe, and so giue iudgement streight:</l>

                  <l>Did flatter tyme, and still abuse the troth.</l>
                  <l>Same for a fee, and some did humors feede,</l>

The substance whereof being in Latin, (may be read and vnderstood by thousands) is englished because the common sorte (as well as the learned) shall see how little the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Land, haue esteemed the power of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> or manasing and force of any forraine foe whatsoeuer. And for the amending of my tale, let our Soueraine Ladie be well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, (whose graces passeth my pen to shewe) and you shall see great things are encountred, and no small matters gone about and brought to good passe, in the action afore named: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth well a Quéene of that race, who is descended of so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a progenie. But now purposing orderly to procéede to the
<pb facs="tcp:5362:18"/>
former discourse, and to rehearse word for word, as it was left by our forefathers, (men of great learning and knowledge) I haue set doune some such Letters and Orations, as peraduenture wil make you to maruell of, or at the least to thinke on so much, that some one among a multitude, will yéeld me thankes for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and rather encourage a true writer to continue in the like exercises, then to giue him any occasion to sit ydle, and so forget the vse of pen. There followeth hereafter those things before mentioned, which I hope the Readers will iudge with aduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and construe to the best intent and meaning. For this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not only shewes by good authoritie the royall Coronation of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> but in like maner declares with what pride and pomp the <hi>Romaines</hi> sent hether (at the very instant of this great tryumph) for tribute and homage: at which proud and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous demaund, King <hi>Arthur</hi> (and all his other Princes about him) began to bee greatly moued, and presently without further delay, gaue so sharpe and sodaine an answer to the Embassadors of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were so vexed and abashed therewith, that they neither knewe well how to take it, nor made any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: as followes by matter presently here, if you please throughly to reade it. Consider withall, that after this Embassage, King <hi>Arthur</hi> in plaine battaile slue <hi>Lucius,</hi> and had gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to haue bene crowned Emperour there, if <hi>Mordred</hi> had not made a reuolt in <hi>Arthurs</hi> owne kingdome.</p>
