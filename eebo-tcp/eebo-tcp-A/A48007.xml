            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Well Sir, to ſhew you how far this Deſign hath influenced the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as well as the City, I have ſent you the following Narrative of what happened with us, which will ſhew you, that we were Hectored with this Plot, above a month before it was ſent to your Lodging. Our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath the Power of holding Aſſizes within this Iſle, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a Judge, and Juſtices of the Peace, and a Bayliff of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who hath the power of Returning all Juries, and whatſoever elſe the High Sheriff executeth in the County, which Place of Bayliff is now held by Mr. <hi>Wren,</hi> Son to our late Biſhop. And the Aſſizes being holden at <hi>Wisbich</hi> upon the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> paſt, there came thither from <hi>London</hi> one Mr. <hi>Perne,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Crowland,</hi> a Living as they ſay of 4 or <hi>500l.</hi> a year in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and brought News that the Plot was now diſcovered to be a Presbyterian Plot, &amp; reported a great number of the Proteſtant Peers, and Gentlemen, that had eminently and undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly aſſerted our Religion and Liberties to be engaged therein, many whereof he named, and that with ſuch confidence, that it had entire credit with ſome ſtaggering Proteſtants, who did not a little inſult at the News, and amongſt others, one Mr. <hi>Scotrell,</hi> a Gentleman of the Grand Jury was thereby ſo tranſported, that upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes, he with a glaſs of Wine in his hand, invited the Grand Jury to drink the <hi>Popes</hi> Health, and being oppoſed therein, did ſay that the <hi>Pope</hi> was a Worthy Perſon, whereupon complaint being made to the Judge in the Court, Mr. <hi>Scotrell</hi> boldly owned the Charge, and juſtified his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to Drink the <hi>Popes</hi> Health, and being reproved by the Judge for ſo offending, at a time when there was ſuch a damnable Popiſh Plot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and carried on; he confidently replyed, My Lord, is it a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh or a Puritan Plot; this unparallel'd confidence created, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97637:2"/>
a ſuſpicion with the Judge, that there might be diſguiſed Papiſts on the Grand Jury, and thereupon he put them to take the Oaths of Allegiance and ſupremacy in the Court. Afterwards, in that Evening Mr. <hi>Scotrell</hi> being in company with ſeveral Gentlemen, did again ſet on foot the Drinking the <hi>Popes</hi> Health. Upon the next day he was again charged in the Court, for drinking the <hi>Popes</hi> Health, and for having drank it at another time to two young Men of the Town of <hi>Wisbich,</hi> but he continued to juſtifie himſelf, and ſaid, my Lord, I know not but I may drink the <hi>Popes</hi> Health, as well as your Lordſhips, whereupon the Judge enquired of the Juſtices of the Peace, of the Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Mr, <hi>Scotrell,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>F.</hi> a Gentleman of about <hi>160l.</hi> a year, accounted a Proteſtant, who is a Juſtice of the Peace in our Iſle, and lately ſince the putting out of ſome Juſtices in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> made alſo a Juſtice there, did interceed with the Judge for him, and declared that there was not a known Papiſt in the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> (but God, and I believe Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> know ſome concealed ones) however the Judge bound Mr. <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trell</hi> to the good Behaviour, and acquainted the Country, that he would repreſent the offence to the King and Council.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be worthy Obſervation, that one of our Juſtices, who is alſo an Officer in the Militia, did at the ſame Aſſizes in the Court affirm, that there is a Puritan Plot, and indeed thoſe that deſired a belief thereof, did ſo outdoe in eonfidence though not number, that though ſome few ſaw through the Deſign, they were more that dreaded the difficulty of Detecting the contrivance and Contrivers, and for my part, I tremble to think what Blood would have been ſhed, and what ruine brought upon our beſt Patriots, if others had entertained this Plot as we did; and that we are not overwhelmed by it, deſerves a perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, at leaſt equal to that of our Deliverance from <hi>Faux<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. Now Sir with your leave, I will offer ſomething to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, and of the Sober Clergy of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church; for ſuch I hope are left with you, though here too rarely ſeen.</p>
            <p>What inducement have many, and eſpecially of the Clergy, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to defame as they do the Kings Evidence, and with all their might, to diſſuade from a belief of the Popiſh, and at the ſame time to endeavour, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to prepare the People ſor a Belief of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Plot. What do your good Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Proteſtants think of ſuch Men? I aſſure you Sir, that to the great diſhonour of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaniſm, the plain Countryman begins to call them by that harſh name of Papiſts, but they are numerous, therefore Heaven forbid there ſhould be ſuch Acceſſion to the Conſpirators: the moſt diſcerning, and moſt charitable in our Neighbourhood pitty their blindneſs, and hope that ſome that they think acting what may bring us under the yoke of Roman Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, will rather ſuffer Martyrdome, than take that Yoke upon themſelves; and we hope that thoſe of them that deſire to live and die Proteſtants, and to deliver over our Religion, and Liberties to a better Generation, will now awake; ſeeing God hath ſo providentially brought to light this laſt Villany.</p>
            <p>I read Sir, to my amazement in your Narrative, that that valiant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> (the Glory of our Nation) and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (who I hear is Son of the brave Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> who died
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97637:3"/>
a Martyr for our preſent Soveraign) and the Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> who fought ſo gallantly for King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, amongſt many others were deſigned to be cut off, and that as Presbyterians too. I conclude they are not tame and low Spirited Men, and therefore long to know how they reſent it, for methinks they ſhould call for Reparation, ſo far as all the Popiſh Party are able to make it; but I am tedious, and therefore ſhall conclude aſſuring you, that I am your Affectionate Friend and Servant.</p>
