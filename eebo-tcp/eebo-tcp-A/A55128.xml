            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Old Catch,</speaker>
               <p>HA—my Old Friend, how luckely have I found you this Morning; methinks you look a little muddy about the Gills: Prethee Man, how fares it with thee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>New Catch,</speaker>
               <p>But very indifferent, ſuch a Journey as I had the other day, muſt needs, you may well think, put a man of my Profeſſion into a Sweat; little did I think, I ſhould be put upon ſuch a Ramble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>O.C.</speaker>
               <p>I heard indeed, that you was turn'd Ambler, and was put upon running a Race, from <hi>Roſemary-Lane</hi> to the <hi>Hermitage;</hi> but it ſeems, you was ſo dull, that had you not been ſpur'd to it, 'tis Ten Crowns to a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, but you would a declined it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, <hi>Jack,</hi> mocking is catching: It little becomes you to Scoff at your Friend; it may be your own Caſe another day, and if I am not miſ-informed, you have been within a Spit and a Stride of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>O.C.</speaker>
               <p>But was ſo cunning, you ſee, to ſhift it off to him that would needs be taking my Trade cut of my Hands—Why, it was a conſiderable hanſel Man, and worthy of Remembrance; a thing ſo remarkable, to know the time of your Advancement, that it's Ten to Ohe, if ſome Wag or other, don't make Coments on it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>You ſeem very pleaſant, tho' indeed it is very unfair at this time, conſidering the Pickle, my Journey as put me into.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>O.C.</speaker>
               <p>It was a Journey it's true, to which you was driven with much ado; and thoſe that ſaw you, ſay thao you Travers'd your Ground very odly, and often look'd back, as if you had no mind to come to the end on't; but it ſeems, by the help of driving and leading, you did it at laſt, though with ſome reluctancy, as appeared by the bluſhing of your Back-ſide.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Right; but methinks, after ſuch handling, you ſhould Pity him that ſucceeds you, in the Dignity of the <hi>Triple-Tree.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>O.C.</speaker>
               <p>O! by no means—what Pity you, for learning part of your Trade, that's a good one indeed; what Pity a Man, for becoming experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally acquainted with that, on which his Profeſſion chiefly depends: No, no, conſider experience is a great Maſter, and reſt your ſelf ſatisfied. But prethee what was the occaſion you was ſo ſoon put to your Trumps, I heard ſomething on it confuſedly, but ſeeing we are upon the Subject, let us have't out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee ceaſe that inquiry, I would forget it, as a thing no ways pleaſant to my Remembrance.</p>
