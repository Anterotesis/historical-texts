            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A short View of the Historical things that are in the foregoing part of this Chapter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEFORE we come to the Prophecy it self, it will be of <note place="margin">Of the Historical things.</note> use to consider those historical things that are deliver'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it in the same Chapter; particularly, what the Prophet tells us concerning Himself, and the Time when he had this Revelation from God, and the Occasion on which it was given him. These things, we shall see, are communicated to us with great exactness and care; which, we have reason to believe, was done not only to stir up our Attention in reading, but also in order to our better Understanding of this Prophecy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, of the Prophet himself, it will be our business elsewhere <note place="margin">Cóncerning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> himself. See</note> (in our <note n="a" place="margin">DISSERT. I. His great Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> first DISSERTATION,) to shew what a bright shining Saint he was in his Generation; and that even from his Childhood, throughout the whole course of his Life. But here we are to speak only of those instances of it that occur in the Historical part of this Chapter. Such were, his diligent studying of the Holy Scriptures, his pious zeal and concernedness for the Church of God, his deep <note place="margin">His Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>

sense of the Sins of his People, his sad apprehension and fear of their obstructing the promised Deliverance, for which he applied himself to God with fasting and fervent Prayer. How highly acceptable these <note place="margin">His Favour with God.</note> things were to God, we cannot but see by his sending such a Person, and much more by the several gracious Messages that he sent by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Favour appear'd very signal in God's sending to <note place="margin">Shew'd in God's Sending Messages to him by the Angel GABRIEL, the same whom he sent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin MARY.</note> him by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the only Angel of his rank whom God has made known to us by name. And that we had not known, but on the account of God's sending him with such extraordinary Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages; first, to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and afterwards to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Those to <hi>Daniel</hi> were of a very different nature. The two first were only Discoveries of the meaning of those dark figures that he had seen. They were frightful Sights of Beasts, that appear'd to him in a prodigious manner: the <note n="a" place="margin">Ann. 555. before <hi>Christ. Dan.</hi> VII.</note> first, in a Dream of the Night, in the first Year of King <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> as we read in the seventh Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of this Book; the <note n="b" place="margin">Ann. 553. before <hi>Christ. Dan.</hi> VIII.</note> other in a Vision which he had two Years after, as we read in the eighth Chapter. But now at the Angel's third <note n="c" place="margin">Ann. 558. before <hi>Christ. Dan.</hi> IX.</note> coming to <hi>Daniel,</hi> (which was fifteen Years after his second coming,) in the first Year of King <hi>Darius,</hi> He was sent to him, not as before, to interpret a Dream, or a Vision, but to deliver him a Message from God; in plain words, containing a Prediction of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the most wonderful Events that were to happen in this world; and that of such great and lasting Consequence, that God would have him put it in writing, to be left upon Record for the use of his Church in after times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why God was pleased to make choice of <hi>Daniel</hi> for this service <note place="margin">It was so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Angel.</note> before any other person, the Angel tells him in <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 22. 23.</note> these words; <hi>I am sent to shew thee these things,</hi>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>because thou art</hi> GREATLY BELOVED. It might as well have been translated in the same words as that is which the same Angel said to the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Luke I. 28. <hi>Thou art</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">

                  </gap> HIGHLY FAVOURED OF GOD. The same Angel uses the same Expression again to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> twice after this; calling him <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>a man</hi> GREAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY BELOVED; which being not used to any other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor perhaps to any other person, but only the blessed Virgin; there must be something extraordinary in it. And it seems to be plain what that is, by the Angel's never speaking these words to <hi>Daniel</hi> before till he came to deliver this Prophecy to him from God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is plain why he used these words to the blessed Virgin, by his <note place="margin">But appear'd much more by his Messages: to Her of <hi>Christ's</hi> Incarnation;</note> telling her the Effect of his Message, that she should be the Mother of Christ. For certainly there could be no greater Instance of the singular favour of God to any Human creature than that which God vouchsafed to the blessed Virgin, that Christ should be born of her body.

III. 9, 10. <hi>to the intent that unto the Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places,</hi> (that is, to the blessed Angels themselves) <hi>might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God.</hi> According to both these Apostles, the Discovery of the Determinate time of <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, which God was pleased to send to <hi>Daniel</hi> by the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> was not more surprising News to the Prophet, than it was to the Angel himself. But when the Angel consider'd withall, that he should not have known it now, but for the Prophet's sake; and knowing no doubt how well he was Qualified for it by those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Graces, that had so much endear'd him to God; the Angel could not find how to deliver his message with a fitter Preamble than that before mention'd: telling him how much he was beloved of God, from whom he brought him this sure Token of it, in giving him the first Revelation of the precise time of Christ's death; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which had been so earnestly desired, and sought after, by Angels as well as Men; but could never be attain'd by any of them.</p>

But that was upon the death of King BELSHAZZAR, who was kill'd immediately before, as the <note n="l" place="margin">v 30.</note> Text saith v. 30. And yet, as it appears by the following words, this <hi>Darius</hi> must have had a great number of Kingdoms before he came to this. For presently <note n="m" place="margin">VI. 1.</note> after, it is said, that he had <hi>a hundred and twenty Provinces</hi> under him. These were more than any King of <hi>Chaldea</hi> ever had: for among these were <note n="n" place="margin">v. 8, 12, 15.</note> the <hi>Medes</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> which were never under the Chaldeans.

But in this intermediate Prophecy they are introduced with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, that being compared with the former, gives them both a very great Illustration.

But the King could not doubt but that, whatsoever it was, it must be something that highly concerned him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sent for the wise men of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whose College was not far from the Court, to hear what they could say of the matter: offering very high, and even extravagant rewards, to any of them that should read and interpret this writing. They all confessed that it was past their skill; which made the King the more impatient to know what it should be. Thereupon his Mother, or Grandmother; (probably the wise <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. <hi>V.</hi> 10, 11.</note> Queen. <note n="d" place="margin">Herodot. <hi>I.</hi> 188.</note> 
                  <hi>Nitocris,)</hi> minded him of one that in King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s time was admired for his knowledge in such matters. <hi>Daniel</hi> was the man; so he was sent for in hast; and being brought in before the King, at his Command, he both read <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> read it publickly.</note> the writing, and gave him the Interpretation.</p>
               <p>The result of it was, in the words before cited, <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. <hi>V.</hi> 28.</note> 
                  <hi>thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is divided, and given to the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Persians. This another would not have adventured to say. But <hi>Daniel</hi> had a greater than the King to bear him out; and knowing this, he shewed himself to be not only void of fear, but above those rewards, as high as they were, that had been offer'd to Him, as well as to those others before him. Assoon as they were mentioned to him, he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused them. And yet afterwards, when the King, in a sort of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bravery, would needs force them upon him; he took them, as publick testimonies of his doing that wonderful thing which no other could do. And so, as the King had ordered it, Proclamation being presently made, all the Court came to know what it was that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> had Prophecied, some hours before they saw the first step of the Accomplishment. It began with that unhappy King's death; which <note place="margin">it was fulfilled the same night.</note> followed the same Night after the feast, as both <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> tell us; and immediately after <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prediction, as it follows

               <p>So great, and so wise a man, as he was, would never have said this to the honour of a God whom neither he nor his Forefathers

had known; and whom he now knew to be the God of no other but a Conquer'd people, that were come to be his vassals, and slaves. Especially, he would not have said it in such a publick Act as this was: if he had not Read what was written of himself in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; and if those Prophecies themselves had not been so well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to him, that he could have no reason to doubt, but that they were of that Age in which they were pretended to be written.</p>
               <p n="35">35. It is not to be imagined that <hi>Daniel</hi> had not read all those <note place="margin">But he could not build it yet.</note> Prophecies. No doubt they were his Comfort, and his Hope, the whole time of his Captivity: and therefore, when he saw them all fulfilled to the last, namely the Promise of his people's deliverance; that being the chief thing of all, he could not but be greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to see that fulfilled, as well as the rest. But yet it did not come presently after <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s taking of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For the Power that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had there at present being only under King <hi>Darius,</hi> who perhaps knew nothing of the Jews at that time, or at least had given no order concerning them; therefore when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had done all that he had Commission to do there at <hi>Babylon,</hi> he left it; and, as it seems, taking <hi>Daniel</hi> with him, he went to King <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Media;</hi> and leaving <hi>Daniel</hi> there, went on into <hi>Persia,</hi> as it has been <note n="a" place="margin">see n. 18, 19.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewn.</p>
               <p n="36">36. There being no appearance all this while of any thing done <note place="margin">This made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> think of Two Prophecies, each of LXX weeks.</note> for God's people, or to be done now <hi>Cyrus</hi> was gone so far from them; this was, in all likelyhood, that which put <hi>Daniel</hi> upon searching into BOOKS, as he tells us he did, <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 2. He knew and was fully assured, that the time of their Deliverance was not far off; but he had a Mind to know how much longer they were to wait for it. And where should he look to find this, but in those Prophecies of Scripture that set forth the time during which they were to be in Captivity? There are two such Prophecies in the Collection of <hi>Ieremy's</hi> writings. We call that whole Collection <hi>the Book of</hi> JEREMY; but the Prophet himself called each of these Prophecies, a BOOK. And in two of these BOOKS there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press mention of a time of <hi>seventy years,</hi> which God had prefixed for two very different purposes.

                  <hi>to God;</hi> first, as to the Matters he had to ask in it, this holy man was so intent on the concernments of his People, that he quite left out himself, as if he were not worth thinking of. It may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seem as if he had not any thing to ask for himself; being then as great as the greatest King in the World could make him, in his worldly condition. But besides, he could have no concernment him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that which he was chiefly to ask for his People. His great suit for them was that God would put an end to their Captivity, that they might return to their own Land. But that was above <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> VII. 9.</note> four months Journey, too much for a Man of his Age, being then above <note n="d" place="margin">See Dissert. I.</note> Ninety years old.

                     <hi>Dan.</hi> VI. 28.</note> even till King <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s time. It was four years at least, till the third year of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> after which God was pleased to give him his dismission. <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>Dan.</hi> XII. 12, 13. His Zeal for God's Glory will appear in the Arguments that he uses in his Prayer, which we shall presently come to consider.</p>
               <p n="49">49. But first, something more must be said of the Persons, and <note place="margin">his Concern for God's People, especially for the City of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
                  </note> things that he prayed for. He asked only in general for his People, that God would bring them back into the Land of their Fathers. But there he seems to have thought of nothing but the City of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> It is that which he insists upon more than any thing else in his Prayer. It appears by his mentioning this, five or six times at least; whereas he does not mention the Temple more than once, though that was surely the most valuable thing in that City. Both these <hi>Daniel</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Dissert. I.</note> had seen in their Glory, in the end of King <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s Reign, though he was very young at that time. But <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he could never forget, nor no Captive at <hi>Babylon</hi> could, that had read those passionate words in <note n="h" place="margin">Ps, CXXXVII. 5, 6. King <hi>David</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City.</note> 
                  <hi>Ps.</hi> CXXXVII.</p>
               <p n="50">50. The Royal Psalmist himself could not but have a vehement affection <note n="i" place="margin">See Ps. CXXII.</note> for that City, on many accounts. It was that which he, having taken it from the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> first made the Royal Seat of his Kingdom: afterwards, having brought the Ark of God thither, he made it the Mother-Church of all Israel: and to perpetuate that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34646:13"/>
to it, he would have built a Temple there for the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> but that God made him leave the doing of that to his Son <hi>Solomon.</hi> But without that Addition, the City alone <hi>David</hi> called <note n="a" place="margin">Ps. XLVIII. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the holy Mountain of God,</hi> Ps. XLVIII. 1. And so did <hi>Daniel</hi> in this <note n="b" place="margin">

It was the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that was called <hi>the holy Mountain</hi> by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Zech.</hi> VIII. 3. Now indeed it was nothing but a Mountain of Rubbish, without either Houses or Walls. It was as <hi>David</hi> foresaw it would be, a heap of Ruins without any Inhabitant; and he made several <note n="*" place="bottom">Ps. LXXIV. LXXIX, LXXX, CII, CVI, CXXXVII, all, or most of them: see Tract. V.</note> Psalms for it, when it should be in that condition. One of those Psalms, Ps.

               <p n="51">51. It may well be enquired, what the reason should be, why <note place="margin">not so much for the Temple.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Prayer speaks so <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 7, 12, 16, 18, 19.</note> often of the City of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that lay then in ruines; and scarce <note n="†" place="bottom">The Onely mention of the Temple in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prayer vers. 17. where the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>thy holy place,</hi> is render'd <hi>the Sanctuary:</hi> But some take that to be the same which the Angel calls <hi>thy holy City,</hi> vers. 24.</note> once mentions the Temple of God which was in the same condition. This deserves to be thought of so much the more, because the Angel in his Answer to <hi>Daniel,</hi> takes <note n="e" place="margin">vers. 24.</note> notice of his praying for his <hi>holy City,</hi> and in his Prophecy tells him of a <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>Commandment</hi> that there would be for the <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ierusalem;</hi> upon which <hi>the Wall</hi> should be <hi>built, and the Street;</hi> but the Angel saith nothing of the Temple in his Answer, nor promiseth any thing of it in his Prophecy. But at last, <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> vers. 26.</note> where he speaks of the death of the <hi>Messias,</hi> he saies that <hi>after</hi> that, both the <hi>City</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> should be <hi>destroyed.</hi> In these last words it was plainly implyed that there was a Temple to be built, for there was none in being at, the time of this Prophecy: and it must be Built before it could be destroyed. But there was no Promise of this.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Now the reason of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s saying so little of the Temple, <note place="margin">he knew that would forth with be built.</note> and therefore the Angel's saying nothing of the rebuilding of it, was plainly this, that <hi>Daniel</hi> was perfectly secure that the Temple should be built; the Angel also knew that he was so; having God's word for it, not only that it should be done, but that it should be now within a year or two. He also knew who should Order the doing of it. He saw and knew the Man, even CYRUS by name; of whom God had said, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Esaia</hi> XLIV. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>it is He that shall perform all my pleasure; saying to Ierusalem, thou shalt be built; and to the Temple, thy Foundation shall be laid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">53. It was little more than a year after this that King <hi>Darius</hi>

                     <hi>Ezra</hi> I. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the foundation of the Temple was laid,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <note n="k" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ezra</hi> IV. 5. 24.</note> second year of King <hi>Darius,</hi> which was some fifteen years after. No doubt <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave also order, or leave, for the building of Houses at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the dwelling of thòse few that had to do about the Temple. But for the Generality of the People that came up from <hi>Babylon,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> II. 70.</note> they went to <hi>live in the Cities</hi> about which their Inheritances lay; so that after all that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had done, there were no more than scatter'd Houses or Sheds for present use at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> There were <note n="i" place="margin">

When that would be done, <hi>Daniel</hi> had no manner of View; there being no Prophecy in Scripture concerning it, till that which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel now gave him in this <note n="l" place="margin">

                  <hi>from the going forth of the Commandment to build Ierusalem again:</hi> and that there might be no mistake of his words, the Angel shew'd what <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> he meant, by adding what was to follow upon it; namely <note n="n" place="margin">Ib.</note> that <hi>the Wall should be built, and the Street, even in a streight of Times.</hi> This was clear to them that lived in King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s time, when they came to see the <note n="o" place="margin">

                     <hi>Neh.</hi> III, VI, &amp;c.</note> before mention'd. And to Us it is as plain by reading the account of it in the Book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who lived at that time, and was employ'd by that King in that building.</p>
               <p n="54">54. But <hi>Daniel,</hi> who lived so long before, being wholely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">Therefore he prayed for that chiefly.</note> of this, till he had this intimation of it from the Angel in the words of this Prophecy; it is no wonder that he was so passionately concern'd for the rebuilding of the City of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> as we see he was, by his so often repeating it in his Prayer for his Church and Nation; that being their Center of Union, in all their Civil affairs, as well as those of Religion.</p>
               <p n="55">55. We are next to shew the ardent Zeal that he had for God's <note place="margin">He also shewed his Zeal for God's Glory, in the Arguments that he used in his Prayer.</note> Glory; which especially appears in the Arguments that he made use of for the speeding of those his Petitions.

                     <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 4, 7. 9, &amp;c.</note> Arguments from the Wisdom and Power, the Truth, and Holiness of God; his Justice, and Goodness, and Mercy; all these do afford us helps in Prayer; some of them for the strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Faith, and Hope, and Resignation to God; others also to mind us of those Divine qualities, in which we are, as near as we are able, to conform our selves to the Image of God: and thereby to qualify our selves for those Mercies and Blessings we ask of him, which is the most proper use of such Considerations.</p>

It is plain that God has so order'd a threefold dispensation of the Covenant of Grace to Mankind in that Estate into which we are faln by the sin of our first Parents.

Afterwards, when God had given us a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient trial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what shift Human Nature could make without any other helps than those before mentioned, then he proceeded to a second Dispensation, wherein he superadded to the former an immediate Divine Revelation.

to all the rest of Mankind, by living up to it, as he had reason to expect that they should during that Dispensation. Then at last, it pleased God to begin a third Dispensation, by sending his Son into the World, with the most perfect Revelation that ever shall be given to Mankind; causing this to be put in writing, for the use of all future ages even unto the end of the world.</p>

God told <hi>Moses</hi> what would be the issue of it; and accordingly he found it so the next morning: <hi>Behold, the Rod of Aaron was budded,</hi> and had <hi>brought forth Blossoms;</hi> and those came to be <hi>Almonds</hi> all in that one night. <hi>Moses</hi> brought out all those Rods that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> might see them.

                     <p>God heard this, and thereupon, for a farther provision against their falling into this Sin, he made a fresh Declaration of his mind, almost in the same words in which the People had repeated the former. They had said <gap reason="foreign">

the setting up of that Second Memorial of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod: which warning of his seems to have been the immediate occasion of those passionate words. Thereupon, the Text saith, <note n="a" place="margin">vers. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the Children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, behold, we dye, we perish, we all perish:</hi> then adding that which stuck most in their thoughts, namely, the <note n="b" place="margin">XVI. 40.</note> words that he spake at the setting up of the former Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, <hi>Num.</hi> XVI. 40. There it was declared, as they here repeated the words, <note n="c" place="margin">XVII. 13. See it here in the bottom.</note> 
                  <hi>Every one</hi> that comes <hi>near the Tabernacle of the Lord</hi> to offer Incense, <hi>shall dye.</hi> How then? say they, <hi>have we done dying?</hi> Is the Danger over? No certainly, unless we give up our Right of doing the same that <hi>Korah</hi> did; which, it seems, they would not promise for themselves. In short, here is nothing else in all their speech, but Tokens of the utmost impenitence. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ask Pardon of God, nor of either of his Ministers; they did not so much as desire that <hi>Moses</hi> would Pray for them; nor did they make the least confession of any Sin, that either they or those Rebels were guilty of.

                  <hi>Num.</hi> XVI. 41, where they charged <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with killing them. They told them plainly, <hi>you have killed the People of the Lord.</hi> For this God justly called them

                  <hi>dying and perishing,</hi> rather than they would promise to Amend, and give over those Rebellions, by which they that did dye and perish had brought those Judgements on themselves.</p>
               <p n="106">106. By what has been said, it abundantly appears, that as yet <note place="margin">God gives a New Law, against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding into the Priesthood.</note> 
                  <hi>the Murmurings</hi> were not <hi>quite taken away,</hi> nor were like to be, as long as this Generation was living. God was therefore so much the more concerned to take care that they might not destroy themselves by their <hi>Rebellions,</hi> before the Time was run out that he had set them to wander in the Wilderness. And since, for the preventing of this, no sort of Miracles would do, for all had been tried, and cast away, on this stiff-necked People; therefore God was pleased to resort to the Ordinary means, by enacting Judicial Laws, with strict Penalties; and making it the business of Persons concern'd to see them put in Execution.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Aaron</hi> himself that was chiefly concern'd in all matters of publick worship. He was the High Priest, that was appointed of God to be Judge in all causes touching Religion: and <note n="c" place="margin">

Therefore now to put an end to those disputes about the Priesthood, God was pleased to deliver to <hi>Aaron</hi> a Judicial Law, concerning Holy places and things, <hi>Num.</hi> XVIII. 1—7. By which, in the first place, <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> XVIII. 1—7.</note> God laid upon Him and his Sons the whole charge of those places and things that belonged to the Priesthood, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Sanctuary, and the Vessels thereof; and also of the Priest's Court, wherein was the Altar of Sacrifice. But for the People's Court, and all the Offices in the outer Verge of the Tabernacle, God laid the charge of all these on the other <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> that were not of the Sons of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And as well to oblige them, both Priests, and Levites, to look to their respective charges, as to deter others from breaking in upon them; he ordain'd, that if any one, who was not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> should intrude into any place of their Ministry, or should meddle with any of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels belonging to it, he should be put to death; and so should the <hi>Levites</hi> that suffer'd him to do it. And for those places and vessels that were within the charge of the Priests the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> if any stranger should presume to come near them, he must be <note n="e" place="margin">vers. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>put to death,</hi> v. 7. nay, though he were a <hi>Levite,</hi> as <hi>Korah</hi> was, he must dye for it; and the Priests that suffer'd it must also dye with him, <note n="f" place="margin">v. 3. Their second <hi>Massa</hi> and <hi>Meriba.</hi>

                  <hi>Balaam</hi> a <hi>(g) Syrian,</hi> that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34646:29"/>
lived then <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. XXIII. 4.</note> in <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> The Situation of that Country, lying so much nearer to <hi>Midian</hi> than it did to <hi>Moab,</hi> makes it very probable that <hi>Balak</hi> had this suggested to him first by the <hi>Midianites.</hi> And it seems much more likely, because of the Trade that the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites</hi> drove in <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Country, and through it to <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Ninive,</hi> the chief Cities then in the world. But that which puts it out of doubt was, his returning thither to <hi>Midian</hi> when <note n="b" place="margin">Num. XXIV. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Balak</hi> drove him out of his Country; of which more will be said <note n="c" place="margin">n 116.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. We take it therefore to have been by the <hi>Midianites</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that <hi>Balaam</hi> was sent for.

                  <hi>he loved</hi> at his heart; and it seems they knew it, for <note n="e" place="margin">Num. XXII. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Elders of Moab and of Midian</hi> came to him <hi>with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Divination in their hands.</hi> What those Rewards were, it is not said: but no doubt they were <hi>Silver and Gold,</hi> or else <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>might be able to overcome them, and drive them out</hi> of their Country. This they hoped he could obtain by Enchantments, and such like Diabolical ways as he was <note n="h" place="margin">v. 6.</note> commonly thought to be a great Master of. And so he was content they should believe; and yet he pretended, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly himself did believe, that all the great things that he had done, and was so famous for, he had obtained by his Intimacy with <note n="i" place="margin">v. 18.</note> the true God, <note n="k" place="margin">XXIII. 24.</note> the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> What Ground he had for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and how it came to fail him, will be considered <note n="l" place="margin">See the bottom.</note> elsewhere.</p>

Of late days, while, through the just judgment of God for his asking of things which were unfit for God to grant, he had turned him over to the Devil; during his Correspondence with him, the Devil had always granted him such things to chuse; and not only so, but had taught him that way of <note n="a" place="margin">Num. XXIV. 1.</note> Enchantments by which he used to converse with his Votaries. But now, when <hi>Balaam</hi> came for leave to curse <hi>Israel,</hi> the chosen people of God; as to that, God would not suffer the Devil to give him his Answer, but was pleased <note n="b" place="margin">XXII. 9.</note> to take that business on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But <hi>Balaam</hi> knew nothing of that. He went on in doing what he could to obtain what his Clients desired. First they brought him to a <note n="c" place="margin">XXII. 41.</note> High place from whence <hi>he might see the utmost part of the Camp of Israel.</hi> It was a place that was consecrated after the manner of that Country. There he <note n="d" place="margin">XXIII. 2, 4.</note> offered to God such sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as he formerly used to accept. But when he came to the point, God soon <note n="dd" place="margin">v. 8, 9, 10.</note> let him know that he must not curse <hi>Israel.</hi> When <hi>Balaam</hi> had told this to <hi>Balak</hi> and his Princes, they, being unsatisfied with it, were for putting him on a fresh Trial. It was the <note n="e" place="margin">See le Clere <hi>on</hi> Num. XXIII. 27.</note> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of most Heathen Nations, that when one Sacrifice would not do, they were for trying another, and a third if they saw occasion. So <note n="f" place="margin">v. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Balak</hi> would have him offer another Sacrifice. But it must be in <note n="g" place="margin">v. 14.</note> another View of the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> where possibly it might not be so well guarded with Angels as it was in the former. Thereupon <hi>Balaam</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">v. 15.</note> left them to sacrifice for themselves, and he went <note n="i" place="margin">XXIV. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>to seek for Enchantments;</hi> in which he never used to fail of such success as the Devil could give him. And that he might be sure of in this case, to Curse the people of God. But here again God interposed, and let him <note n="k" place="margin">v. 19, 20.</note> know, He had given <hi>his word <hi>to bless Israel,</hi>
                  </hi> and it was not for man to reverse it. <hi>Balaam</hi> made his own Reflections upon this, and plainly <note n="l" place="margin">v. 23.</note> told <hi>Balak,</hi> here was nothing to be done. He saw plainly that <note n="m" place="margin">v. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>God had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held iniquity in Iacob, nor perverseness in Israel.</hi> It is plain he had not hitherto, in this new Race of people. Therefore it was in vain for <hi>Balaam</hi> to think of reaching them <hi>with Enchantments,</hi> &amp;c. as he might other Nations. But yet after all this, upon the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of <hi>Balak,</hi> he attempted once more to curse <hi>Israel,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view of their Camp. But when he <note n="n" place="margin">XXIV. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>saw it pleased the Lord to bless Israel</hi> there also; then he went on no farther <hi>to seek for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments:</hi> but looking intently upon <hi>Israel,</hi> he received an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration from God. When this came upon him, <note n="o" place="margin">v. 5.</note> first he broke out in praises of <hi>Israel.</hi> Then <note n="oo" place="margin">v. 8.</note> he fell to magnify the things that God had done for them, and what he had yet to do. Then turning to <hi>Israel,</hi> he concluded all with these words; <note n="p" place="margin">v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>blessed is he that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34646:30"/>
blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.</hi> This was more than <hi>Balak</hi> had patience to hear. Who therefore interrupted him, and in plain Terms bade him, <note n="a" place="margin">v. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Fly thou to thy place.</hi> To which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> answered, <note n="b" place="margin">v. 14.</note>

But afterwards, by <hi>Moses</hi> Command, they killed all those <hi>Women that had known Man by lying with him</hi> for the Reason above-mentioned.

For though even for that they were not to pass without punishment; yet God did not therefore destroy them as he did the other. But he set a Mark upon them and all their Posterity. He made it a standing Law to his People, that <note n="n" place="margin">v. 9, 10, 11.</note> no Soul of either of those Nations should be admitted into the Congregation of the Lord, <hi>'till the tenth Generation,</hi> Deut.

It seems, at his hasty parting from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak,</hi> this was not yet come into his head. But the Devil, from whom it certainly came, help'd him to it soon afterwards. He came full of it to the people of <hi>Midian.</hi> There he certainly knew that any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would be welcome, that would rid them of the Nation that they feared; and he knew that, as they were best able, so they would not spare, to pay him well for this advice which he brought them. For both these Reasons, he must impart it first to the five Kings of <hi>Midian:</hi> and then he must take the general Consent of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34646:31"/>
Men, without which he could not have brought the Women into this Matter. For the women, they were to be more than passive in it. They had many things to do. They were first to take a pretty long journey into the Land of <hi>Moab.</hi> There they were to engage the <hi>Moabitish</hi> women, as many as they could, to joyn with them; and they were to go together, and Act according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.

It seems that hitherto <hi>Moses</hi> had no Information of those horrible doings; all this being done at Mount <hi>Peor,</hi> which was some miles distant from the Camp: or if he knew any thing of it, this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being a thing quite new to him, it struck him into such an Astonishment that, at first he knew not what to do in it. But for that he was to take his direction from God; and God was pleased to give him that before he asked it. The Lord said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">v. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>take all the Chief Men of the Transgressors, and hang them up before the Lord.</hi> This was necessary for the satisfying of his Justice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>for the turning away of his fierce Anger from Israel.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to do this as Publickly as he could, that all others might <hi>see, and fear.</hi> This Order was certainly put in Execution by those whom <hi>Moses</hi> Authorized for that Purpose. And to do it the more Effectually, he order'd the <note n="k" place="margin">v. 5.</note>

                  <hi>East-side of the Tabernacle,</hi> was the place where <hi>Moses and Aaron and his Sons were to keep the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34646:32"/>
Charge of the Sanctuary;</hi> and to attend there upon all such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. There was <note n="a" place="margin">Num. XXV. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> now present; and probably <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, though the Text mentions no more of them but <note n="b" place="margin">v. 7.</note>

That his chief Motive in it was Zeal for Gods sake, he had a <note n="f" place="margin">v. 10, 11.</note> Testimony from God himself. It was surely an Ardent Zeal for God that moved him to do so bold a thing as this was; to kill a young Prince among the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and together with him the Daughter of a King of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who would surely make it a National Quarrel. This was such a thing as God would not let vs be ignorant of: and therefore he plainly tells us, that the Name of the Man was <note n="g" place="margin">v. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Zimri the Son of Salu a Prince of the cheif family among thr Simeonites,</hi> and that the Woman was <note n="h" place="margin">v. 15.</note>

And not onely so, but as well for a Reward to <hi>Phineas</hi> at present, as for a Memorial of it in future times, God gave him the promise of continuing <hi>the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to him and his seed after him for ever.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34646:32"/>
for which they might perish in like manner. God was pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to let them know, that the danger they were in on that account was not long to continue. There was onely the <note n="a" place="margin">

To let them see it was the Care of Gods Providence that it should be equally shared, he was pleased to order <note n="c" place="margin">v. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priest to make a second Numbring of the People, like that which <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had <note n="d" place="margin">Num. <hi>l.</hi> 1.</note> formerly made in the Wilderness of <hi>Sinai.</hi> It could not but comfort them to see that, after the dying away of more than <note n="e" place="margin">v. 46.</note> 600000 men that had been then Numbred, many of them no doubt dying Natural deaths, but all the rest, save <note n="f" place="margin">

There was certainly Need of such Extraordinary ways, to <note place="margin">With little of the Ordinary.</note> instruct them, and to mind them of their duties; there being then so little of the Ordinary means which God gave to his People in after times. They had not the Sacrament of <note n="o" place="margin">Iosh.

124. And yet perhaps no people in the world ever needed teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Their great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy.</note> more than they did. For, though they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed by <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, and that according to the <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> XVII. 19.</note> promise of God, which was their great Privilege; yet even that did not free them from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption, that came to them from much nearer Parents than <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> The immediate Fathers of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> were the Twelve Sons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> by whose names they were called. But for these Patriarchs, how any of them lived, or what they did, we have no Account in any other Book but that of <hi>Genesis;</hi> and even there, we have nothing told us particularly, but of the four Eldest Sons, and of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> And though this last appears to us wholely without Spot: yet of those four others, the most that we know is of their Crimes. We cannot read of the Incests of <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> XXXV. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">XXXVIII. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudah,</hi> the Faithbreach and Cruelty of <note n="d" place="margin">XXXIV. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> without sad reflections on the Ignorance of those times. For the rest of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Sons, God has not been pleased to let us know any thing of them; save only this, that when those two Bloudy men were for <note n="e" place="margin">XXXVII 18.</note> killing their innocent Brother, though the other nine could not come up to that height of wickedness with them; yet they <note n="f" place="margin">v. 27.</note> all, but <note n="g" place="margin">v. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben,</hi> agreed to that which was but little short of the other. They all joined in <note n="h" place="margin">v. 26.</note> taking Money for their Brother <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whom they sold into perpetual Slavery, and that in an Idolatrous Nation.</p>
               <p>Such were the Fathers of this people of <hi>Israel.</hi> And surely the <note place="margin">Mingling with Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </note> Mothers were not like to mend the Breed. We read of no other wives that either they or their Fathers ever had, but what were either <hi>Canaanites,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians:</hi> and whatsoever corrupt Inclinations they derived, whether from their Mothers, or their Fathers, they were not like to be cured of them by their Education. For besides that Parents generally give their Children no other Education than what is most agreeable to their own Inclinations; there was this worse than ordinary in their Case, that the Nations among whom they lived were of the very worst of Mankind. They could scarce see any other Examples among them, than of things which they ought most to avoid. There could be nothing more contrary to the Religion that God had taught his chosen people, than the Sin of <note n="i" place="margin">See n. 76, 77.</note> Idolatry: and especially such as that was which generally obtain'd among the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> They worship'd those Brute beasts which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his people to <note n="k" place="margin">Ex. VIII. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him. Only he had dispensed with their offering him any Sacrifice of that kind, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the people would certainly have stoned them for it. How apt they were to have done that, it abundantly appear'd, by the extreme hard Usage that they gave that poor people without any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet they could not be Ignorant, that their Fathers owed their Lives to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> whom they knew to be one of this Nation. But that was so utterly <note n="l" place="margin">Ex. I. 8.</note> forgotten, that they treated, not onely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34646:33"/>
his Nation, but even his Posterity among the rest, with the utmost cruelty and Inhumanity. First, they took all the people for Slaves, and oppressed them, to that degree that <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex.</hi> I. 14.</note> they <hi>made their lives bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to them</hi> with drudgery. One while they were for <note n="b" place="margin">v. 16. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>killing</hi> all <hi>the Male Children</hi> of that Nation: And though that perhaps did not last, yet their <note n="c" place="margin">II. 23.</note> Slavery did, till it came to be quite intolerable. It may seem strange that even that could not restrain them from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the very worst of their Sins. But such a <note place="margin">See n. 64.</note> witchcraft there is in evil Example, that the people of Israel fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, even in that which God had most especially forbidden them. And they did this, not only while they lived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where it might have been done out of fear, or in Compliance with the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> but they continued to do it afterward, when they were perfect freemen. They shewed an astonishing instance of it, in their making and worshipping of the <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. XXXII.</note> Golden Calf.</p>
               <p n="126">126. But the sin which the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were chiefly charged <note place="margin">But their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sin was their Murmuring and tempting God.</note> with in these times, was their aptness, as often as any thing displeased them, to Murmur, and to run into Rebellion, against God and his Servant <hi>Moses.</hi> This they could not learn of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> for there was no such thing in that Nation. They were generally most duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">The <hi>Egyptians</hi> gave them no such Example.</note> to their Kings, and to their Gods, of all the Nations we read of in History. <hi>Moses</hi> gives us very great Instances of it, in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Ioseph;</hi> who, being brought a Slave into <hi>Egypt,</hi> became a Saviour to that Nation, as has been just now above-mentioned. That holy man, having it revealed to him from God, that there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>e</hi> Gen. XLI. 1—40.</note> should be <hi>Seven years of great Plenty</hi> in that Land, and after them <note n="f" place="margin">v. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Seven years of Famine,</hi> such as should be <hi>very grievous;</hi> and having thereupon advised King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> what to do for the saving of his People; was thereupon made by him his chief Minister, with power to Order every thing as he advised. The first thing he did was in those years of plenty to go <note n="g" place="margin">v. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>throughout all the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> having made Storehouses there in <hi>every City,</hi> there to lay up all the Corn he could buy out of the Country about it. Having done this every one of these years, and so <note n="h" place="margin">v. 48.</note> Engrossed all the spare Corn of <hi>Egypt</hi> into those Granaries, He was then provided for the seven years of Famine; in which, as the people came to want bread, so he continually supplyed them, by selling it at his own price. By this means he got <note n="i" place="margin">XLVII. 14.</note> all <hi>the money</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Kings Treasury, in two or three of the first years. Afterwards, in the following years, he made them sell him <note n="k" place="margin">v. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>their Cattle:</hi> and a year or two after, <note n="l" place="margin">v. 20.</note>

It was he only, under God, to whom they owed all the Thanks that were due, for their deliverance out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, for the Supply of all their wants in the Wilderness; for all their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation hitherto. They could not but see, it was He that stood always between God and them, as oft as his wrath was breaking forth to consume them.

                  <hi>That the Proof which has been given, of our Lord IESUS hit being the promised Messias, may be set in a better light, it has been thought fit to bring it into the two following sets of Chronological Tables; in which the Proof will appear to any man that has but so much skill in Common Arithmetic, as is not above the learning of an ordinary Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE first of these sets is of <hi>Iulian</hi> years, from the 20th. year of King ARTAXERXES, which was the 445th year before the common Christian <hi>Aera,</hi> till the 19th of TIBERIUS, which was the 33th year of that <hi>Aera;</hi> in which very year that our Lord JESUS was crucisyed on the 3d day of <hi>April,</hi> being the Jewish Passover, is the common Opinion of learned men among the Christians, and has been sufficiently proved in this Work. But here it is proved by PTOLEMIES CANON, the undoubted Measure of time among all the Astronomers, both Jews and Gentiles, That this 20th year of ARTAXERXES (being the year on which (according to <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> II. 1—8.) he gave the Commandment for the building of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> again, and on which it was accordingly built,) was 476 years and odd days before the said 19th year of TIBERIUS; that is, there were 483 <hi>Chaldee</hi> years from the one to the other; which is the ground work of the farther Proof that is offered in the second set of Tables.</p>
               <p>The Second is of these <hi>Chaldee</hi> years, whereof every one has 360 Days; which way of Measuring Time being unusual among us, it is therefore thought necessary, for the making of it the more intelligible, that every one of these <hi>Chaldee</hi> years should be adjusted with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current <hi>Iulian</hi> years, so as to shew in what Month and Day of those concurrent years it began and ended; and by these any ordinary Reader may know whereabout he is in the time before or after CHRIST, in every <hi>Chaldee Year</hi> that lies before him.</p>
               <p>The use of these Tables will be made the more easy and clear by sorting the 483 years above mentioned into <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, septenaries or <hi>Weeks,</hi> whereof there are just LXIX in that Number of years. For this being done, it will plainly appear that these are the VII <hi>Weeks</hi> and the LXII <hi>Weeks</hi> in that Prophecy, <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 25. and whereas there it is said that <hi>after those</hi> LXII <hi>Weeks the</hi> MESSIAS <hi>shall be cutt off;</hi> it is here very evident in the last of these Tables, that the last of these LXII Weeks ended on the 11th Day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Vulgar year of CHRIST 32: which was within lesse than a year of the 3d of <hi>April</hi> 33, that was the time of CHRIST'S death, as has been already shewed.</p>
               <p>And therefore CHRIST'S death being <hi>after the</hi> LXII <hi>Weeks;</hi> and that not a year after, for that year would have been reckoned into the following Week; it cannot be denyed but that he was crucifyed at the very Time when MESSIAS was to be <hi>cut off</hi> according to DANIELS prophecy.</p>
               <p>After the 1st set of Tables there will be added the years of the IV Gospels and of the Acts of the Apostles pag. xviij, xix. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And after Daniels VII &amp; LXII Weeks there will be added the single Week to make up the LXX.</p>

                  <pb n="ij" facs="tcp:34646:36"/>
IN the first set of Tables every JULIAN year therein contained, has a Line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it that runs through all the Columns in that page: in which line it is adjusted with 2 other sorts of years that are concurrent with it; namely, first with DANIEL'S Chaldee years, &amp; secondly with the years in PTOLEMY'S <hi>Canon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Column marked with B under it, shews what <hi>Iulian</hi> years are Bissextile, or leap-years: which, in every 20 years before <hi>Christ,</hi> are the 17, 13, 9, 5, &amp; 1st. in the years after <hi>Christ,</hi> the 4, 8, 12, 16, &amp; 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. These are carefully to be observed in Computation; because, whereas every common year has 365 days, every leap-year has 366, one day being added after the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>February,</hi> which makes that month to be of 29 days, which has but 28 in common years.</p>
               <p>Column C is of the <hi>Iulian</hi> years before <hi>Christ</hi> from the year 445 downward till the Vulgar <hi>Aera</hi> begins, &amp; then afterward this Column will be of the years of our Lord according to the Vulgar <hi>Aera.</hi> Every one of these <hi>Iulian</hi> years, beginning on the first of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> &amp; ending <hi>Dec.</hi> 31, is divided into 2 Numbers of Days in the Columns of <hi>Daniel's</hi> years. Those of the first number always begin on the first day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> &amp; those of the second end on the last of <hi>December:</hi> except onely those in the lesser figures, whereof more will be said in its proper place.</p>
               <p>The two Columns marked D, D, are for the years of <hi>Daniel's</hi> weeks; whereof the first VII <hi>weeks</hi> containing 49 years, the LXII following weeks containing 434 years, they make in all 483 years; every one of these years containing 360 days, as hath been already shewn.; and will more plainly appear in the 2d set of Tables. Tab. I, II.</p>
               <p>The first of these 483 years begins at the <hi>Nisan</hi> of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Now the first day of <hi>Nisan</hi> falling generally on the 21 day of <hi>April,</hi> according to the most learned Primate <hi>Usher's</hi>

                  <hi>Iulian</hi> which concurs with the first year of the 483 before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But this Number of 255 days wanting 105 of the 360 that are in every <hi>Chaldee</hi> year; therefore that first year of the 483 is placed a second time in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Column D in the second line; &amp; there it is made whole, by allotting to it the first 105 days of the <hi>Iulian</hi> year 444; namely, from <hi>Ian.</hi> 1 till <hi>Apr.</hi> 15 of that year: &amp; whereas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these 105 days, there remain 260 from <hi>Apr.</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end of that <hi>Iulian</hi> year, these go into the second year of the 483; and the Number 2 is therefore placed before the 260 in the second line of that Table.</p>
               <p>The 2 Columns marked F, F, contain in every line the 2 Numbers of days which divide the 365 days of the <hi>Iulian</hi> year in the beginning of that line, between those 2 of <hi>Daniel's</hi> 483 years which are in the very same line in the Columns D, D, above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Of these 2 Numbers of Days in every line it is to be always remembred, that the first Number begins on the first day of <hi>Ian.</hi> &amp; the 2 Ends with the last of <hi>December.</hi> But besides,</p>
               <p>Whereas in the Column over the letter G there is set down the month &amp; day on which every one of <hi>Daniel's Chaldee</hi> years begins, it is to be understood that the next foregoing <hi>Chaldee</hi> year ends on the month &amp; day next before it. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; The first <hi>Daniel's</hi> year beginning on <hi>Apr.</hi> 21 in the <hi>Iulian</hi> year 445, it has with that &amp; the last of <hi>December</hi> 255 days out of that <hi>Iulian</hi> year; &amp; this first <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel's</hi> year wanting yet 105 days of its 360, it has these out of the <hi>Iulian</hi> year 444 before <hi>Christ,</hi> beginning at <hi>Ian.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, &amp; ending <hi>Apr.</hi> 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. This appears in the
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:34646:36"/>
Column over G: for there on <hi>Apr.</hi> 16 begins the second <hi>Chaldee</hi> year. This second <hi>Chaldee</hi> year has from <hi>Apr.</hi> 16 to the last of <hi>Dec.</hi> inclusively, the Number therein noted, of 260 days out of that <hi>Iulian</hi> year, and these are made up 360 by adding 100 out of the <hi>Iulian</hi> year 443; in which year they begin at <hi>Ian.</hi> 1, and end at <hi>Apr.</hi> 10th in that year. Then on <hi>Apr.</hi> 11 begins the 3d <hi>Chaldee</hi> year, and taking in that day with all that follow to the end of <hi>December,</hi> it has 265 days out of that <hi>Iulian</hi> year 443: which Number being to be made up 360, therefore that third <hi>Chaldee</hi> year has other 95 days out of the <hi>Iulian</hi> year 442, beginning <hi>Ian.</hi> 1. and ending on the 5th day of <hi>Apr.</hi> which appears by the next day, <hi>viz. April</hi> 6th begining the 4th of the 483 years. And that 4th year goes on, and so do all that follow, in like manner with those above mentioned.</p>
               <p>Of the years in PTOLEMIE'S <hi>CANON</hi> more needs not be said, than that every one of those years that are mentioned in the 2 first Columns over the first H and K must be accounted to begin with the 1st of <hi>Ian.</hi> in that <hi>Iulian</hi> year that stands in the beginning of the line, and so to be concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with the same <hi>Iulian</hi> year until the next <hi>Thoth;</hi> that is, till that Month and day which in the same line is placed in the Column over L. And that same month and day begins those two following years in the 2 Columns over the 2d H and K: which last 2 years run on to the end of the <hi>Iulian</hi> in that line; and after that they are continued with the next <hi>Iulian</hi> year in the following line, from its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>st of <hi>Ian.</hi> till the next <hi>Thoth,</hi> as is above mentioned.</p>
               <p>The 2d set of Tables is of <hi>Daniel's</hi> VII &amp; LXII Weeks, consisting of 483 <hi>Chaldee</hi> years, which are here adjusted with the <hi>Iulian</hi> years, from the year before <hi>Christ</hi> 445, till the 32d year after <hi>Christ,</hi> ending lesse than a year before his Death.</p>
               <p>In the 1st Column of every Table are set down the above mentioned <hi>Weeks,</hi> as many of them as belong to that particular Table: and in the 2d Column are set down as many of the 483 years as come within the <hi>Weeks</hi> contained in that Table.</p>
               <p>The 8 following Columns are divided into 2 Fours, marked each of them with B, C, G, F. The 1st C, G, in every line shews the <hi>Iulian</hi> year, month, and day, with which that <hi>Chaldee</hi> year begins that stands in the 2d Column of that Line. The little b. shews when the <hi>Iulian</hi> is a Bissextile: and the 1st F. sheweth the Number of Days which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> year hath out of that 1st <hi>Iulian</hi> year. Whatsoever Number of Days that is, there must be so many added to it as will make it up 360 out of the 2d <hi>Iulian</hi> year in that line: Which 2d year is markt with the 2d B, C, in like manner as the 1st year was with the former B, C. And as the 1st G shewed what month and day in the former <hi>Iulian</hi> year did begin the <hi>Chaldee</hi> year of the same line; So the 2d G shews where that <hi>Chaldee</hi> year ends; namely on what month and day of the 2d <hi>Iulian</hi> year, (markt with the 2d, B, C.) in the same Line.</p>
               <p>NB. In every line of the 1st set of Tables, the two Numbers of Days in the Columns F, F. being added together make up the Number 365 in a common <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> year, and 366 in a Bissextile: But as to the 360 days of any <hi>Chaldee</hi> year, they are made up of the Number of Days in the 2d Column F in the same line, adding thereunto the Number of days in the 1st Column F, in the line next below it.</p>
               <p>In every Line of the 2d set of Tables, the two Numbers of Days in the Columns F, F, being added together make up the Number of 360 days for the <hi>Daniel's</hi> year in the beginning of the Line: But as to the 365 days of a common <hi>Iulian</hi> year, or the 366 of a Bissextile, they are made up of the Number of Days in the 2d Column F where that <hi>Iulian</hi> begins, adding thereunto the Number of Days in the 1st Column F, in the line next below it.</p>

Probably the 1st Sabbath of the year was in <hi>Tisri,</hi> at or near the Feast of the beginning of the year: and as that Feast was appointed to be kept in memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so this Sabbah might be observ'd in memory of the day in which God rested from his Work.

great multitude followed him on the account of his Miracles. <hi>Iohn.</hi> VI. 2. And he taught them there. <hi>Mar.</hi> VI. 34. <hi>Luk.</hi> IX. 11. The people staying too late to get back to the places where they might have provisions; <hi>Christ</hi> was pleased to feed them there with such as he had, being onely five loaves and two small fishes. With these he fed 5000 men, besides women and children. <hi>Matt.</hi> XIV. 21. and yet after they had eaten, and were filled, the fragments that remained filled twelve baskets. <hi>Matt.</hi> XIV. 20. <hi>Mar.</hi> VI. 43. <hi>Luk.</hi> IX. 17. <hi>Ioh.</hi> VI. 13. In this last place it is said that at this time the <hi>Passeover was nigh Ioh.</hi> VI. 4. by which it appears that <hi>Christ</hi> was not at this Passeover, but that still he continued in <hi>Galilee.</hi> For after this Miracle, when the people would have made him King by force; to avoid this, having first shipt away his Disciples, he withdrew himself into a Mountain to pray; and from thence, the night being stormy, he followed them walking on the Sea; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into the Ship he went ashore in the land of <hi>Genesareth. Matt.</hi> XIV. 34. <hi>Mar.</hi> VI. 53. Thence he went <hi>through that whole region round about. Mar.</hi> VI. 55. from thence, <hi>to the parts about Tyre and Sidon. Mar.</hi> VII. 24 and thence back <hi>through Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.</hi> v. 31. There in the desert he fed 4000 men, besides women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with seven Loaves and a few little fishes; whereof, after they had eaten and were filled, the fragments that remained were seven baskets full. <hi>Matt.</hi> XV. 34—38, and <hi>Mar.</hi> VIII. 1—9. It was soon after this, as appears by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words to his Disciples, <hi>Matt.</hi> XVI. 9, 10. that he had the debate with the <hi>Pharisees and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi> in the first verse of that chapter. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him <hi>a Sign from heaven,</hi> to prove that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> which they resolved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive. <hi>He sighed deeply in his spirit, Mar.</hi> VIII. 12. and asked them, <hi>Ye Hypocrites, you can discern the face of the Sky, but can you not discern the Signes of the Times? Matt.</hi> XVI. 3. It is hard to say what <hi>Times</hi> he should mean, but those two <hi>times</hi> that are mentioned in this Prophecy: namely, first, the time of the <hi>Messias</hi> being <hi>cut off,</hi> which was to be <hi>After the LXII Weeks;</hi> and 2dly, the time of the single <hi>Week,</hi> that follows in the end of the chapter, the <hi>Week</hi> that was appointed of God, for
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:34646:47"/>
the destroying of the City and Temple at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the dissolving of the Jewish Church. That our Saviour intended the former of these; namely, the time when the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be cut off; it will presently appear, by considering at what time it was that he said this. It was now this very year, on the 11th day of <hi>May,</hi> or some little time later, that the LXII <hi>Weeks</hi> were expired. <note n="†" place="bottom">The LXII Weeks expired.</note> Now our Saviour knew, <hi>the time was come,</hi> that St. <hi>Luke</hi> speaks of, <hi>Luke</hi> IX. 51. the <hi>Time</hi> when he should be <hi>taken up,</hi> that is crucifyed, as the pious and learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> expounds it: Or rather, as <hi>Christ</hi> expounds it himself; for this was his manner of speaking; He said, the <hi>Son of man</hi> should be <hi>lifted up, Ioh.</hi> III. 14. He used the word <hi>lifted up,</hi> thereby signifying <hi>what death he should dye.</hi> XII. 32, 33. and he was therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Pilate</hi> to be <hi>crucifyed,</hi> for the fulfilling of this Prophecy, as the Evangelist expounds it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 32. For the precise TIME of the <hi>Messias</hi> his death, there is no other prediction of it in Scripture, than that which we have in this Prophecy. Therefore those words of St. <hi>Luke</hi> before mentioned can signify no other TIME than this, AFTER the expire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>the LXII Weeks.</hi> So the most learned <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his Annotations on that Text, <hi>Matt.</hi> XVI. 3. understands those words of our blessed Saviour to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Saducees</hi> before mention'd. He takes them, as if Christ had said to those Jews; <hi>if you lookt into the Prophecies of Scripture, with as much concernedness as you doe into the face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when you are taking a Iourney, you would see and acknowledge out of doubt that the end of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIEL'S Weeks is at hand.</hi> Our blessed Lord knew it to be so near, that there was not one DAY of another <hi>Week</hi> left: he had not a year lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to live. But he also knew that his peice of a DAY should not be at an end till next Passeover. He knew that that was his HOUR. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIII. I. He should be <hi>cut off</hi> then, and no sooner. Therefore in the mean space he takes particular care that this should be no surprize to his Disciples. He first broke it to them, immediately after the reproof that he gave to the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> It was in his progress in the parts about <hi>Caesarea Philippi,</hi> that he <note n="*" place="bottom">

It seems not improbable that the Feast of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration is rightly placed on the 6th of <hi>August.</hi> For it was kept on that day in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church in St. <hi>Saba's</hi> time, which was within 500 years after this; as appears in the 60th chapter of his Life, published by <hi>Cote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> in the 3d Vol. of his <hi>Greek</hi> Monuments. There are also in that Volume some pieces of <hi>Nicon,</hi> by which it appears that this Feast was kept yearly 8 days at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> but in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> onely on the day abovementioned. At this time the Apostles both saw and heard <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> there present, and talking with our Saviour. Their discourse was concerning his <hi>EXODUS,</hi>

But as St. <hi>Luke</hi> goes on, IX. 51. <hi>the time being come that he should be taken up,</hi> he resolved thereupon to go to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to be there at all the great Feasts, and to make use of those Opportunities, to do all the good that he could before his going out of the World. The next Feast was that of <hi>TABERNACLES,</hi> on the 15th day of <hi>Tisri,</hi> which was about the middle of <hi>October.</hi>
                           <pb n="xxvj" facs="tcp:34646:48"/>
Against that Feast, his angry Relations at <hi>Nazareth</hi> would needs have him go up with them to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them together with himself to Greatness by his working Miracles there; or else to leave him to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Whatsoever the matter was, he would not go up with them, but stayd behind them in <hi>Galilee. Ioh.</hi> VII. 9. When they were gone up, he came after them, <hi>as it were in secret</hi> Vers. 10. leaving a great part of his company behind him. For whereas he was stopt in his next way through <hi>Samaria, Luk.</hi> IX. 52. for towards any of the great Feasts, the people there would hardly receive any one that was going up to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> Our Saviour took this Occasion to send out LXX of his Disciples to prepare the people to receive him in all places where he should come for the future. <hi>Luk.</hi> X. 1. and so took none but the Twelve, and those perhaps not all together, along with him in his Journey to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Thither he came <hi>about the midst of the Feast, Ioh.</hi> VII. 14 Where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as soon as it was known, the <hi>Iews</hi> were ready to kill him, Vers. 19. upon the old grudge they had against him, for healing on the Sabbath day. Vers. 23. But yet they could not hurt him Vers. 30. because his HOUR was not yet come. So another time <hi>Ioh.</hi> VIII. 20. when they would fain have layd hold on him, the same reason is given, why they could not, because his HOUR was not yet come: it could not be till the Passeover. The latter time here mention'd, was on the 23th of <hi>Tisri,</hi> when our Saviour was teaching in the Treasury. In the end of that day, upon his saying those words <hi>before</hi> ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM <hi>was I am,</hi> they took up Stones to cast at him. But not to work Miracles needlessly, he escaped from them in the throng: and that probably by the help of his Disciples, for they were then about him, or near him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> IX. 2. He had no sooner escaped that storm, but another was raised against him, upon his working a Miracle on the Sabbath day. It was his giving <hi>Sight</hi> to one that was <hi>born blind: Ioh.</hi> IX. 14. for which, since they could not reach our Saviour, they layd hold on the poor man and <hi>cast him out of the Synagogue.</hi> Vers 34. The mean while our blessed Saviour, in his return from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> met with his LXX Disciples; who brought him an account of what they had done in their Ministry. The first place he came to was <hi>Martha's</hi> house <hi>Luk.</hi> X. 38. She was a widow, as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks. Her House was at <hi>Bethany. Ioh.</hi> XI. 1. about fifteen furlongs from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> Vers. 18. From thence he went on through the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Villages, Luk.</hi> XIII. 22. which were prepared for him
<pb n="XXVij" facs="tcp:34646:48"/>
by his LXX Disciples. No doubt it was by their means that wheresoever he came, he found the People so ready to hear him. As we reade <hi>Luk.</hi> XI. 29. that in one place they were <hi>gathered thick together</hi> for that purpose; So in another, it is sayd, there were <gap reason="foreign">

Luk.</hi> XI. 15, 16. But it appears they put the people on the same. Vers. 29. and so again <hi>Luk.</hi> XII. 56. where he gives them the same answer as he had done before to the <hi>Pharisees.

Our Saviour thus going on through the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> where the LXX had been, was now again making his journey to <hi>Ierusalem, Luk.</hi> XIII. 22. This was no doubt to the Feast of DEDICATION, which was yearly held on the 25th of <hi>Cisleu,</hi> above two months after the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> In his way to that Feast, we find him at <hi>Peraea</hi> in <hi>Herod's</hi> Dominions. <hi>Luk.</hi> XIII. 31. There <hi>Herod</hi> kept his Court at <hi>Machaerus,</hi> as we learn from <hi>Iosephus</hi> Ant. XVIII. 7. and elswhere. But he could not like to have the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> so near him: for His being there could not but mind the people of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> whose death was very grievous to them. It seems most likely that <hi>Herod</hi> for that reason sent the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to try if they could affright him out of those coasts. It appears that our Saviour knew they came from <hi>Herod:</hi> for to Him he sends them with this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>go tell that Fox,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot dye out of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And thereupon he pronounced the Fate of that City: that it should be layd <hi>desolate,</hi> and should be <hi>left</hi> so till the time foretold, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXVIII. 25, 26. even the Time when the JEWISH Nation shall turn to him, saying, <hi>blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi> All this our Saviour repeated again, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIII. 37 &amp;c. when the <hi>Hosanna-</hi>time at his coming up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was past; and therefore it is not necessary that these words should refer to that particular Occasion. That being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a fulfilling of that Prophecy, <hi>Zech.</hi> IX. 9. of <hi>Christ's</hi> coming to <hi>Ierusalem, riding on an Asse,</hi> in such manner as is therein described, with all those Shews of public joy among the common People, which were but a low Type of the universal joy that shall be hereafter at their Restauation. Our Saviour's coming up now from <hi>Peraea</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                           <pb n="XXViij" facs="tcp:34646:49"/>
was to the Feast of DEDICATION before mentioned. It was now that he had that dispute with the <hi>Iews; Ioh.</hi> X. 24. upon which they were for stoning him, more than once; Vers. 31, 39. but both times he escaped out of their hands. And after the Feast he went again into <hi>Peraea.</hi> Vers. 40. About this time on the 25th of <hi>December</hi> began the 36th year of his Age.</cell>

                        <cell>Our blessed Lord being returned from the Feast of DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICATION, made his abode in <hi>Peraea</hi> with his Disciples for some time: <hi>Iohn</hi> X. 40. and there, on the account of what they had heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> say of him, as well as what they saw of the Miracles that he wrought, <hi>many believed on him</hi> Vers. 41, 42. From thence, at the desire of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> he came into <hi>Iudaea</hi> again, to help their Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was sick unto death. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XI. 7, 8. At his coming thither he found <hi>Lazarus</hi> dead and buryed some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There in the presence of many witnesses our Saviour restored him to life: which put his Enemies out of all patience. The chief <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> from that day forth were in consultation together how to put him to death. Now it was not safe for our Saviour to stay there, nor to go to any place that they were acquainted with; for they had given a Commandment that if any man knew where he was, he should shew it, that they might take him Vers. 57. Our Saviour therefore retired into the Country near to the Wilderness. It was that which reaches from <hi>Iericho</hi> to <hi>Bethel, Iosh.</hi> XVI. 1. and which is called <hi>the Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Bethaven</hi> XVIII. 12. There his retirement was in a City called <hi>Ephraim;</hi> which seems to have been that where <hi>Absolom</hi> had his Sheep-shearing, to which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited David and his Sons. II <hi>Sam.</hi> XIII. 23. In St. <hi>Ierom's</hi> time there was a very great Village, called <hi>Ephrea,</hi> about 20 miles North of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> This long Wildernesse, as <hi>Ioshua</hi> there shews, was in the confines between <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Ephraim;</hi> or between the Countries of <hi>Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> as they were called in our Saviour's time. Our blessed Saviour could not be safer than there, in any place at that distance from <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and he could not well be further off, being soon to return to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the Passeover was nigh at hand. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XI. 54, 55. So near, that they that sought his life were enquiring, whether he would not come up that year. Vers. 56. They were afraid he would stay away from this Passeover, as he had done from the two last beforegoing. But when our Saviour saw his time to come up to the Feast, then out of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:34646:49"/>
he passed through the midst of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee. Luk.</hi> XVII. 11. that is, as the learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> says in his Jewish Chorography, he went over <hi>Iordan</hi> at the bridge of <hi>Scythopolis,</hi> and so came into <hi>Peraea,</hi> which was called <hi>Galilee,</hi> as being a part of <hi>Hered's</hi> Tetrarchy. The reason of his going that way is plain enough from what has been said. His Enemies then were enquiring, and laying the roads for him, where soever they expected he would come. He therefore took his way through the midst of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had no power. And thence he went into <hi>Peraea,</hi> where <hi>Herod</hi> durst not touch him. There he had a multitude of Disciples ready at hand, <hi>Ioh.</hi> X. 42. who no doubt came many of them up to the Passeover, and helpt to make up that <hi>great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> that attended him from <hi>Iericho, Matt.</hi> XX. 29. and that much greater that welcomed him to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with their Acclamations. That that part of <hi>Galilee</hi> which <hi>Luka</hi> there speaks of was no other then <hi>Peraea,</hi> we find by those Passages of his History, <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII. 15, 18. &amp;c. which happened when he was in <hi>Peraea,</hi> as we are told in the other Gospels. <hi>Matt.</hi> XIX. 13, 16. <hi>Mar.</hi> X. 13, 17. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> goes on, as both those Gospels doe, with our Saviour's Journey from thence to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Where by the way, having his Disciples by themselves; he gave them the last Notice of his Sufferings in these Words: <hi>behold, we go up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief Priests, and unto the Scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles,</hi> that is, to the ROMANS, <hi>to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him, and the third day he shall rise again. Matt.</hi> XX. 18, 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> X. 33, 34. St. <hi>Luke</hi> has the same Prediction XVIII. 31. tho not in the very same words: he has not the word <hi>crucify</hi> in any of the Warnings they had from our Saviour. But he tells us, that after <hi>Christ's</hi> resurrection the Angel minded them of this very Word, <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIV. 6, 7. <hi>remember how he spake to you while he was yet in Galilee, saying, the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucifyed:</hi> Where it may be observed by the way, that he saith the words were spoken in <hi>Galilee,</hi> which were spoken in <hi>Peraea,</hi> as it is plain in both the other Gospels. But one thing St. <hi>Luke</hi> adds in our Saviours Prediction, which ought not here to be omitted. It was that part of it which virtually contained all the rest, <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII. 31. <hi>Behold, we go up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and all things that are written by the Prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</hi> Could our Saviour mention what the
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:34646:50"/>
Prophets had written concerning his suffering, and not think of <hi>Daniels</hi> Words in this Prophecy, that <hi>after</hi> LXII. <hi>Weeks</hi> MESSIAS <hi>was to be cut off?</hi> It can scarce be imagined that the Disciples could hear what he said now without thinking of them. All the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> seemed to have them in their heads at this time. One can judge no otherwise by the account that St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives of what our Saviour said then to them that were about him at <hi>Iericho, Luk.</hi> XIX. 11. He saith that <hi>Christ</hi> spoke the <hi>Parable</hi> there following, <hi>because he was nigh to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and because they thought that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven should immediately appear.</hi> The Disciples it seems were not singular in this Opinion: for, as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> saith, Vol. II. pag. 468. It was <hi>that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions universal Opinion,</hi> being so taught by the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi> He saies that hence arose the Question of the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> I. 6. and hence was that conflux of the <hi>Iews</hi> from all Countries to <hi>Ierusalem. Acts</hi> II. 1. He saith the same of this Prophecy, <hi>Daniel</hi> IX. expressly in Vol. I. pag. 276. Our blessed Lord in his way to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people about him passed through <hi>Iericho,</hi> where he lodged at the house of <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> the Publican. And from thence he came to <hi>Bethany</hi> abovementioned. There <note n="†" place="bottom">For the Days, see the page before <hi>Daniel's</hi> Tables.</note> on Palm-Sunday eve, the 9th of <hi>Nisan</hi> beginning, he was entertained at supper by <hi>Simon</hi> a Leper, being probably one of the many of that sort whom our Saviour had cured. There were with him his most especial Friends, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom he had raised from the dead, now sitting at Supper with him; and his sister <hi>Martha,</hi> serving our Lord at the Table; and <hi>Mary,</hi> anointing him with an Oil of very great price. This costly Ointment our Saviour's purs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer <hi>Iudas</hi> would fain have turned into Money, and so have got it into the Bag, that he might have made his profit of it. Whereupon there passed some Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Saviour and him, that stuck in his Stomach afterwards: and that, and his covetousnesse together, set him on that cursed Design of betraying his Lord. This occasioned the two first writers of our Saviours History to place this part of it, concerning that Supper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> so much later, to the time when <hi>Iudas</hi> made his bargain with the chief Priests. That Bargain was struck but two days before the Passeover: and from that time <hi>Iudas</hi> sought opportunity to betray him. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 3.—16. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 1—11. The whole History of this Supper in those two Gospels is placed as it were in a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> between the beginning and concluding of that Bargain;
<pb n="xxxj" facs="tcp:34646:50"/>
which occasioned the placing of it there. It began with the Consultation of the <hi>Sanhedrim, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 3—5. It ended with <hi>Iudas</hi>'s striking in with them. Vers. 14, 15, 16. But St. <hi>Iohn</hi> who no doubt was present at that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and had read the Account of it in these two Gospels, thought fit to bring it into its right Place, as he doth <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 1. <hi>Six days before the Passeover.</hi> He that reads and observes all the Words that <hi>Christ</hi> spoke, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered here <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 7, 8. and as they are in the two other Gospels, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 10—12. and <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 7—9. will find they are the same Words, and will not doubt but that they were spoke at the same Supper. The next day being Palm-Sunday, and still the 9th of <hi>Nisan,</hi> our Saviour made his publick Entry into <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the History whereof is recorded in all the four Gospels. His Attendance, and their Acclamations, were such as daunted his Enemys: So that, tho they were mad at what they both saw and heard, yet they durst not murmur against it; Onely, to be eased of it a little, they prayed him to make his Disciples hold their peace; <hi>Luk.</hi> XIX. 39, 40. Which he told them could not be, for it was the fulfilling of the Prophecy <hi>Zech.</hi> IX. 9. before mentioned. It is to be observed, that coming down from Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where he had the City in full view, he could not forbear weeping over it: and withall he broke out into these Words, <hi>If thou hadst known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> Thereupon he declared the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Destruction, which had been so long since fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes upon the Words, <hi>on this thy Day.</hi> He saies, <hi>respicitur hic potissimum locus</hi> Danielis IX. 27. Here our Saviour had an especial regard to the last Week in <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecy. Being come to the City, our Saviour at present did onely go into the Temple; and there he observed what was amiss, that he might set it right the next Day. This we learn from <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 11. Who herein clears what was obscure in the XXI of St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Gospel: There also he tells us, that at the Evening (which began <hi>Nisan</hi> 10th) our Saviour went out unto <hi>Bethany</hi> with the XII. Our blessed Lord took that care of himself, not only this night, but the three nights next following. He would not be shut up in the City, &amp; put to death before his time. Therefore, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, this was his manner on the three following days: <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. 37. <hi>In the Day time he was teaching in the Temple, and at Night he went out, and abode in the Mount of</hi> Olives; that is, at <hi>Bethany. Mar.</hi> XI. 1.

                           <note n="†" place="bottom">For the Days, see the page before <hi>Daniel's</hi> Tables.</note> According to this Method, on <hi>Munday</hi> morning the 10th of <hi>Nisan</hi> he went again from <hi>Bethany</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem. Mar.</hi> XI. 12. And there being hungry on the Way, and seeing a Figtree afar off, that had leaves, by which he had reason to hope there might be Fruit also, he came to see what he could find; for there are Figs more or lesse all the year; and therefore <hi>the time of</hi> gathering <hi>Figs</hi> being <hi>not yet come,</hi> he thought he might be sure to find some on the Tree: but finding nothing but Leaves, which plainly shewed that this was a barren Tree, that it might not draw others out of their Way, as it had done him to loose his labour, he ordered, that as naturally it bore no fruit, so neither should it bear Leaves for the future; whereupon the Tree presently withered away. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 19. And the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples saw it was so, Vers. 20. But their seeing that it was withered away was not till next day, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> plainly shews. <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 20. who herein also, as in many other places, clears what was obscure in St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Gospel. † On this <hi>Munday,</hi> the 10th day of <hi>Nisan,</hi> our Saviour being come into the Temple, cast out them that bought and sold, and made that Reformation that we read of <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 12. <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> XIX. 45. declaring that even this House, which God was now about to leave; Yet, while it continued a <hi>House of Prayer,</hi> even the worst part of it, the outer Court, which was not good enough for any <hi>Iew,</hi> but was allotted to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> (and where therefore <hi>the Publican stood afar off;</hi> when he was praying, <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII. 13.) even that was too good for these common uses. This was the 2d time that our Saviour declared this. The former was at his 1st Entrance into the Ministry, <hi>Ioh.</hi> II. 16. And now it was just before his going out of the World. There again, the Children crying in the Temple <hi>Hosanna,</hi> as they had heard the Men cry in the Highways and Streets, the Priests and Scribes being sorely displeased at it, our Saviour gave them a Text of Scripture to think upon, and so left them, and went out of the City to <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and lodged there, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 17. and <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 19. † This <hi>Munday</hi> Evening began the 11th of <hi>Nisan.</hi> On the <hi>Tuesday</hi> morning, as <hi>Christ</hi> was returning to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> his Disciples then observed that the Figtree was withered away. Whereupon our blessed Lord gave them that Instruction, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 20—22. <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 20—26. Soon after, he being come to teach in the Temple, the whole <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> came about him. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 23. <hi>Mar.</hi> XI. 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> XX. 1. and as well they might question any one that set up for a Prophet, they askt him by what Authority he did it: but he soon silenced them, by
<pb n="xxxiij" facs="tcp:34646:51"/>
asking them what they thought of <hi>Iohn Baptist?</hi> That He was a Prophet they durst not deny, for fear the People should stone them: and yet if they acknowledged that, they could not deny the Authority of the blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> whom <hi>

the <hi>Herodians,</hi> who in outward appearance differ'd not from the other <hi>Iews;</hi> But these being of <hi>Herod's</hi> Court, or Officers under him, knew they could not oblige him more, who was then at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and greedy of all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions there to shew his Zeal for the <hi>Roman</hi> Government; than by enabling him to make such a discovery as this would be, if our Saviour declared his mind freely, as they expected he would, there being none but <hi>Iews</hi> within hearing. Their Question was, <hi>whether it were lawfull to give Tribute to Caesar, or not?</hi> Not a word of his Answer should be lost, and therefore it ought to be read in the Text. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXII. 18.—21 <hi>Mar.</hi> XII. 15, 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> XX. 23.—25. It was a just and full Answer to their Question; &amp; yet such as they could not take hold of either way; which struck them all with Admiration: So that they gave him over, and returned to those that sent them. The same Day came to him the <hi>Sadducees; Matt.</hi> XXII. who might probably hope to magnify themselves by bafl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that had been too hard for the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> for they were among <hi>a multitude</hi> of People Vers. 33. And therefore they brought him such a Question as they thought was not to be Answered. It was concerning <hi>a Woman</hi> who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Law, had been <hi>marryed to seven Brethren,</hi> one after another, all of them dying without Children. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> for their parts believ'd no Resurrection: And perhaps they had posed the other <hi>Iews</hi> that did, by asking them whose Wife she should be of the seven, when they all came together at the Resurrection. They put this Question to our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXII. 23—32. <hi>Mar.</hi> XII. 18—27. <hi>Luk.</hi> XX. 27—38. In his Answer he shewd them their Ignorance of the Scriptures; and proved the truth of that Article of the Resurrection, so that <hi>the multitude were astonished at his Doctrine. Matt.</hi> XXII. 33. This advancing the Peoples esteem of our Saviour, was that which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> could not endure. And therefore, though they had left him, yet to try him once more, they set one of their <hi>Lawyers</hi> to attacque him, with a Question in his own Profession. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXII. 35. He askt him, <hi>which was the great Commandment of the Law?</hi> To this learned man our blessed Lord gave such an Answer as himself could not but approve. And <hi>after that no man,</hi> for the present neither <hi>Pharisee,</hi> nor other, <hi>durst ask him any Questions Matt.</hi> XXII. 46. But when the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had done with him, then he began with Them; and askt them such a Question as they could not Answer consistently with their Doctrine. So
<pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:34646:52"/>
they had <hi>not a word</hi> to say more; <hi>neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more Questions. Matt.</hi> XXII. 46. It does not seem likely that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> would have used these last words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had not given the <hi>Pharisees</hi> sufficient opportunity after that Day to have asked him more Questions, if they would: especially that day being now near expired. For this and other reasons that follow, it may be presumed, that our Saviour bestowed another Day after this, <hi>in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Temple,</hi> according to his dayly practice mention'd <hi>Luke</hi> XIX. 47. and XXI. 37. And even this day, after the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had done with him, still <hi>the common People heard him gladly, Mar.</hi> XII. 37. till toward night; when, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> there tells us, XXI. 37. <hi>he went out, and abode in the Mount of Olives.</hi> It was at <hi>Bethany,</hi> where he had lodged every night since Palm Sunday Eve: and no doubt there he lodged also this <hi>Tuesday</hi> night, which begun the thirteenth of <hi>Nisan.</hi> The next day, which was <hi>Wednesday</hi> the first of <hi>April;</hi> Our blessed Lord having done with the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> applied himself wholely to the People; who, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> says, XXI. 38. <hi>came early in the morning to him in the Temple to hear him.</hi> Of what he said this day <hi>in teaching</hi> the People, <hi>Mar.</hi> XII. 38. there is nothing recorded in Scripture, but onely the Warnings that he gave them of that dangerous Sect of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which he foresaw would harden them to their utter destruction. He had formerly said as much to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> themselves, <hi>Luk.</hi> XI. 39—52, telling them plainly how they had spoil'd the Religion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church with their Oral Tradition; and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Woes</hi> against them for their Hypocrisy, particularly in adorning the Sepulchres of the dead Prophets, and killing the living ones, whom God sent to reprove them for their Sins. Some of the same things he said of them now to his Disciples in <hi>the audience of all the People, Luk.</hi> XX. 46, 47. <hi>Mar.</hi> XII. 38, 39, 40. But he added a great deal more, which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> has given us at large, XXIII. 13—36. At last, out of a deep sense of the approaching ruine which that harden'd People were now bringing on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; he repeated there in the City and Temple, that form of Lamentation that he had made for them formerly at his coming thither, <hi>Luk.</hi> XIII. 34, 35. <hi>O Ierusalem, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIII. 37—39. The effect of what he said, was to let that People know he had done with them, and was now leaving THEIR HOUSE to them
<pb n="XXXVj" facs="tcp:34646:53"/>
DESOLATE; that is, leaving <hi>the City and Temple</hi> to that utter Destruction which <hi>Daniel</hi> had so long since foretold would come upon them, when the MESSIAS was CUT OFF, <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 26. By this Act, they were now about <hi>to fill up the measure of their Sins;</hi> after which they were no more to expect that he should send them a <hi>National</hi> Call, till they should be ready at their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to give Him that <hi>National</hi> wellcome, foretold in <hi>Psal.</hi> CXVIII. 25, 26. The Words of which they sing allwayes in their great <hi>Hallel</hi> at every Passeover, and the fulfilling whereof was typified in those public acclamations given him at his last Entrance into their City, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXI. 9. above mention'd. Having given this sad Farwell to the City and Temple, he sate a little while to see the People throw their Money into the <hi>Treasury;</hi> where the rich threw in much, but the poor <hi>Widow's two mites</hi> he valued above all. <hi>Mar.</hi> XII. 41.—44. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. 1—4. After this he <hi>went out, and departed from the Temple. Matt.</hi> XXIV. 1. to go to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement in <hi>Bethany. Luk.</hi> XXI. 37. But in his way thither, <hi>one of his Disciples Mar.</hi> XIII. 1. speaking of those vast <hi>buildings of the Temple,</hi> and the <hi>goodly stones and gifts,</hi> which they saw in them; our blessed Lord told them, the time was now coming when, of all they now saw, there <hi>should not be left one stone upon another. Matt.</hi> XXIV. 2. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 2. <hi>Luke</hi> XXI. 6. Then, it seems, he dismissed all his other Disciples, but <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Andrew:</hi> for these four stay'd, and talk'd <hi>privately</hi> with Him. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 3. He was now sitting on the <hi>Mount of Olives, Matt.</hi> XXIV. 3. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 3. in full view of the Temple. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they were thinking on what he had said at his leaving it. They desir'd him to tell them, when that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction should be; and with this, they joyn'd two other Questions, that, it seems, run much in their minds, <hi>viz.</hi> what the <hi>Signs</hi> would be <hi>of his coming,</hi> and of <hi>the end of the World?</hi> His answer to these three Questions, takes up near the whole Chapters <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIV. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. and <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. His answer to the first Question is in <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIV. 4—28. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 5—23. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. 8—29. He told them first what things would come one after another, before the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> to the end they might not be surpris'd, but might know what they were to do, when any of these things should come to pass. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in speaking of these things now mention'd, that his Disciples might not mistake, he had told them, <hi>these
<pb n="xxxvij" facs="tcp:34646:53"/>
things must come to pass, but the END is not yet; Matt.</hi> XXIV. 6. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. 9. he at last tells them of one particular thing that should be going on all the while; and says when that is done, <hi>then shall the END come. Matt.</hi> XXIV. 14. It was <hi>the preaching of the Gospel in all the</hi> [Roman] <hi>World.</hi> That was plainly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s <hi>future People,</hi> mention'd <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 26. This was the business of his holy Apostles; and by what steps they went on in the doing of it, we are told in the History St. <hi>Luke</hi> has given us of it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: whereof there is a summary Account at the End of the Tables of <hi>Daniel's</hi> Weeks: There it also will be shewn, that at the very year, which ends the History of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins <hi>Daniel's</hi> single Week. <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 27. That our Saviour referrs to that Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> he plainly declares <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIV. 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 14. And he not onely uses the Words of that Prophecy, <hi>let him that readeth understand,</hi> which, as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, are taken from <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 25. but he quotes the principal thing in it, concerning the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> viz <hi>the Abomination of desolation</hi> being set up <hi>in the holy place Dan.</hi> IX. 27. For the clear understanding whereof, the Reader may be pleased to see what is said upon that verse, in the explication of <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecy. After this Destruction, our blessed Saviour shews, what the miserable Estate of that People shall be, till their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Restauration. But this is a principal part of that which these Disciples meant by his COMING in their 2d Question; the Answer to which our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives them. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXIV. 29—35. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 24—31. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXI. 25—33. Then he comes to answer the last of the three Questions, in the last part of the three chapters now mentioned. But he ended not his Answer here, but went on with it through the whole 25th chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in three parables: the first of the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the 2d of the <hi>Talents,</hi> and the 3d. of his <hi>coming to Iudge the World.</hi> It follows in St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Gospel XXVI. 1. <hi>When IESUS had finished all these Sayings;</hi> which was most probably on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> night, that began the XIV of <hi>Nisan,</hi> that then, at his return to <hi>Bethany,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Iudas,</hi> since his dismission that evening, had gone to the chief Priests, and bargained with them to betray him; without naming the Person, he imparted the matter to his Disciples, in these words, vers. 2d. <hi>You know, that after two Days is the PASSEOVER, and the
<pb n="xxxviij" facs="tcp:34646:54"/>
Son of man is betrayed to be crucifyed.</hi> It follows vers. 16. that <hi>from that time,</hi> of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s contract with the Priests, <hi>he</hi> continually <hi>sought opportunity to betray him.</hi> Our blessed Lord knowing this, would not go on <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning, as he had done every day this Week, to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but continued at his retirement in <hi>Bethany.</hi> Thither some <hi>Greek</hi> Proselytes, known to <hi>Philip,</hi> got him to bring them, to see and hear the Lord <hi>Iesus. Iohn</hi> XII. 21. 22. It appears that he did admit them, by what follows, vers. 29—34. and that on this occasion he said such things, as he saw proper, as well for theirs, as for his Disciples Instruction Vers. 30—36. At his entrance into this discourse, he told them, <hi>the HOUR is come, that the Son of man should be glorifyed Iohn</hi> XII. 23. This is spoken of his Passion, and Death, Vers. 24—33. From which he prayed to be deliver'd, vers. 27; but with Submission to the Will of his Father. All this was proper to be said on <hi>Maundy Thursday,</hi> and no sooner; for Then he knew his next Sleep was to be that of Death. But having something yet to do, before his going out of the World; particularly in his Institution of the holy Sacrament: that he might not be surprised besore he had done that, <hi>he hid himself;</hi> no doubt he went out of <hi>Iudas</hi>'s knowledge. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 36. After this, the Evangelist gives a short Account of the reasons of the <hi>Iews</hi> unbelief Vers. 37—43. and after that, he repeats some of those vehement Words, which our Saviour had formerly said to his Disciples; declaring his faithfull discharge of his message from his Father, and the consequence of Mens hearing, or not hearing him. It appears that our blessed Lord was at his retirement in <hi>Bethany,</hi> when he sent <hi>two of his Disciples,</hi> to <hi>prepare the Passeover</hi> for him now, (as no doubt they had done in former years.) <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 8. This was, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us XXVI. 17. <hi>on the first day of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread:</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> XIV. 12. makes it plainer, by adding, that it was <hi>the day on which they killed the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> plainer yet, that it was <hi>the day on which the Passeover ought to be killed, Luke</hi> XXII. 7. And in the beginning of that Verse, he has these words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and <hi>that day came:</hi> which words plainly import that it was in the beginning of that day. But the Passeover ought to be killed on the XIV of <hi>Nisan,</hi> according to God's command by <hi>Moses. Exod.</hi> XII. 6. and, as it is said there expressely, it must be <hi>between the evenings,</hi> that is, as the <hi>Iews</hi> understand it, between three of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
<pb n="XXXiX" facs="tcp:34646:54"/>
and Sun-setting. So that this coming of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to our Saviour was after Sun-set, in the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the killing of the Passeover; that is, in the beginning of the XIV of <hi>Nisan.</hi> And that was after Sun-set, on <hi>Thursday</hi> the second of <hi>April,</hi> as will be shewn at large in the discourse before <hi>Daniel's</hi> Tables. St. <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 8. tells us, they were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom our Saviour sent on this Affair. It seems, as if none of the rest knew the place where he was. To be sure he would not trust <hi>Iudas</hi> with the knowledge of it, though it was his Office to buy in things for such an Occasion. As for those <hi>two Disciples,</hi> our Saviour bad them <hi>Go into the City;</hi> and told them, there <hi>they should meet a man bearing a Pitcher of Water,</hi> and they were to <hi>follow him to the House whither he was going. Mar.</hi> XIV. 13. We are told it is the manner of the <hi>Iews</hi> after Sun-set on the XIV of <hi>Nisan,</hi> to fetch in the Water, with which they are to make their <hi>Azyms</hi> the next day; and probably this man was so employed on this occasion. Our Saviour bad them, tell the Owner of the House, <hi>the Master says, my Time is at hand, I will keep the Passeover at thy House with my Disciples. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 18. that is, according to Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> Exposition, the time of my Death is so near at hand, that I cannot observe the Paschal Sacrifice; I will therefore eat the unleavened Bread and bitter herbs—this night at thy house with my Disciples. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour also told them, they should <hi>find</hi> every thing provided at that House, <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 15. According to his Command <hi>they came into the City,</hi> and there they <hi>found</hi> every thing, <hi>as he had said to them,</hi> vers. 16. So <hi>they made ready the Passeover, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 16. according to our Saviour's direction; which was no doubt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to what the time would afford: we have seen what that was, according to Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> opinion; and that of <hi>Grotius</hi> we shall have in the following Discourse. It seems not likely, that our blessed Lord would lose the benefit of his hiding himself, by coming abroad while there was day-light enough to discover him. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since there was no need of his exposing himself to any Danger on this Occasion: For the Passeover was to be <hi>eaten in the night. Exod.</hi> XII. 8. And so Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> expounds the Words, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 20. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>—,<hi>when it was evening,</hi> by those of St. Luke, <hi>when the hour was come, Luke</hi> XXII. 14. viz. the <hi>Hour of night,</hi> at which they were to eat the Passeover. Then (at that hour) <hi>he came with the Twelve (Mar.</hi> XIV.) to the house where all things were prepared;
<pb n="XL" facs="tcp:34646:55"/>
and there at the Table he sat down, <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 14. <hi>and the Twelve with him, Iudas</hi> not excepted. There no doubt they did eat the Passeover together, such as was prepar'd for them, according to our Saviour's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But whether they had a Paschal Lamb, or no, is a great Question. It should seem they had not, by those Words of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> XIII. 1, 2. where he says, that our Saviour, <hi>knowing the Hour was come, that he should depart out of the World to the Father, he loved his Disciples to the end;</hi> and he shewed it particularly by what he sayd and did at his last eating with them. That this in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was his last, will be made very plain by what he has of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Predictions concerning <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying, and <hi>Peters</hi> denying him. This last time that our Saviour did eat with his Disciples, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls a <hi>SUPPER,</hi> and not a <hi>Passeover.</hi> And to make this the plainer, he says it was <hi>before the Feast of the Passeover,</hi> vers. 1. which Words will be further consider'd in the Discourse before <hi>Daniel's</hi> Weeks. But what shall we say to those Words in the three other Gospels, where it is as plain that this last Supper of our Saviours is called a <hi>PASSEOVER</hi> several times, by our Saviour himself, and by his Disciples? Especially those Words of his, when he and they were eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are thought to imply that they had a Paschal Lamb then before them: <hi>with desire I have desired to eat this PASSEOVER with you before I suffer;</hi> adding this reason, for <hi>I say unto you, I will not eat any more thereof, untill it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God. Luke</hi> XXII. 15, 16. The like words he spoke of the <hi>fruit of the Vine,</hi> that he would drink no more of it after that Supper, <hi>till the Kingdom of God should come.</hi> They that hold <hi>Christs</hi> Death to have been on the XIV of <hi>Nisan,</hi> cannot admitt that he had a Paschal Lamb at his last Supper, for the reasons already mentioned, and others that will be offered in the following Discourse. Therefore they take those Words of our Saviour and his Disciples, where they call his last Supper a <hi>PASSEOVER,</hi> as a family of <hi>Iews</hi> would understand one another, if they were speaking now of a <hi>Passeover</hi> to be kept among themselves. They all know there can be no Paschal Lamb now, because they have no <hi>Place</hi> for a Sacrifice. And then, at <hi>Christ's</hi> last Supper, there was no <hi>Time</hi> for it, in their Opinion who believe that <hi>Christ</hi> died on the XIV of <hi>Nisan.</hi> They take it that the Passeover spoken of Now, could be no other than what they had the two last years in <hi>Galilee:</hi>
                           <pb n="XLj" facs="tcp:34646:55"/>
There, no doubt, it was onely of <hi>Unleavened bread</hi> and <hi>bitter herbs.</hi> So it was now, according to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in those words above mentioned. And this, as <hi>Grotius</hi> words it, was not <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, not a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but a <hi>Memorial;</hi> The Sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb was onely a Type of <hi>Christ's</hi> Death, for which at this time there was no Occasion, because <hi>Christ</hi> himself was to be slain at this <hi>Passeover.</hi> But for those other things, they were eaten onely in Remembrance of their Affliction in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their sudden deliverance from it; and for those to be called a <hi>Passeover,</hi> where there was no Lamb to be called so, this is the <hi>Iews</hi> common manner of speaking at this Day.

This was it that the Apostle would have us take especial notice of; what an infinite Condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension it was, that <hi>He, who knew he came from God, and was going to God, Ioh.</hi> XIII. 3. was pleased to take that low Office on himself to do this to his Disciples; and thereby to give them such an Example of charity and Humility, as might live in them, when He was gone. He told them plainly, that was the end of his doing it. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIII. 12—17. And withall, by this Bodily washing, he shewed what purity of Soul is required of them that
<pb n="XLij" facs="tcp:34646:56"/>
will have any Communion with him, vers. 8, 9, 10. This ought especially to be consider'd in our approaches to the Lord's Supper. And it was for this Reason, in that Learned man's Opinion, that our Saviour did thus to his Disciples, and thereupon, gave them that Lesson, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Institution of the Sacrament. But he first took his Clothes as before, and returned to his Place at the Table: where he made all that Discourse to his Disciples. vers. 12—17. And whereas upon those Words of his, <hi>ye are clean, but not All,</hi> vers. 10. their minds were in some kind of disorder, which he thought fit to quiet before their coming to the Sacrament; he therefore explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self vers. 18. by telling them, <hi>I speak not of you All.</hi> He had told them before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> VI. 70 that <hi>of the</hi> XII he had <hi>chosen, One of them was a Devil.</hi> The same in effect he tells them now. But he adds, that this being their last time of eating together; now they should see the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Prophecy, <hi>Psal.</hi> XLI. 9. <hi>He that eateth Bread with me, has lift up his Heel against me.</hi> David, who was so eminent a Type of the <hi>Messias,</hi> that the <hi>Messias</hi> is often called by his Name, spoke this immediatly of his false Servant <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that had betrayed him to his Enemies; but he spoke it Prophetically of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that would serve <hi>Christ</hi> in like manner. <hi>Iudas</hi> was also like <hi>Achitophel</hi> in his Death. This was one way of our Saviour's proving himself the <hi>Messias,</hi> by shewing, as he frequently did, how those things that were said of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Prophecies of Scripture, were fullfilled in Himself. Another way he used to prove it, was by his own Prophecies; shewing that he foreknew, and could foretell, all things that would come to pass. This he told them was the Reason of what he now said of <hi>Iudas,</hi> (though without naming him) <hi>that when it is come to pass you may believe that I AM HE</hi> vers. 19. And knowing who he was, even <hi>the CHRIST the Son of God,</hi> they knew what they were to expect from him, vers. 20 Such things he put in between whiles, to keep up their Hearts, that they might not be cast down by hearing of nothing but his sufferings. It was after all this, according to <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that our blessed Saviour, in his <hi>Postcoenium</hi> with his Disciples, did institute the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; whereof we have the History <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 26—28. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 22—24. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 19, 20. After this, our blessed Lord in his Table-Discourse foretold sundry things to his Disciples; particularly, in relation to his sufferings, to shew that he knew all that
<pb n="XLiij" facs="tcp:34646:56"/>
was coming upon him, and that he submitted to it will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in obedience to his Father: Withall he gave them such Warnings, &amp; Instructions, and Comforts, as he saw necessary for them in their present condition. But of all these things, in the two first Gospels we have onely three of our Saviour's Predictions: namely, that of <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying him, and then of the Disciples forsaking him, and of <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying him at last. And even these, in those two Gospels, are delivered in something a different order from that in which they are placed in the following Gospels. It appears not onely in these, but in many other Instances, that the two first Evangelists delivered things so in their Gospels, as if they chiefly minded the Truth of the things they delivered; without much concerning themselves for the Order in which they should be placed. It was plainly the Care of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> after he had read what <hi>Many</hi> others had written of the History of <hi>Christ,</hi> and had been <hi>throughly informed</hi> Himself <hi>of all things from the very first;</hi> then, as himself sayth, <hi>to write</hi> them <hi>in Order</hi> in his Gospel. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> composed His after he had read all the other; as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tell us, and as it evidently appears in his Gospel: so that where their placing things so at large in the former two Gospels did or might occasion any mistake in the Readers; there was care taken by the two other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists to rectify any such mistake, and to prevent the like for the future. We have an Instance of this, in that part of our Saviour's Discourse, wherein he foretold his Disciples of <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying him. This, as it is placed in the two first Gospels, may seem to have been spoken by our Saviour at his Paschal Supper. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 21—25. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 18.—21. And if the two other Evangelists had let it pass so, we had lost the knowledg of <hi>Iudas</hi> his being at the Sacrament; which is the declared Opinion of our Church in her Communion-Office. It is indeed on many Accounts of great use in the Christian Religion; which St <hi>Luke</hi> was so sensible of, that he would not suffer us to be ignorant of it. And therefore, after his Account of the Sacrament, he brings in those Words of our Saviour, as spoken in a kind of surprize: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the Table. Luk.</hi> XXII. 21. The Words with which our Saviour entred into this Discourse, are omitted by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> being full enough in the former Gospels. But St. <hi>Iohn</hi> having something to add of very great Moment, which was in none of the other Gospels, he began with those Words which he saw in St. <hi>Matthew's</hi> and St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Gospels: but having
<pb n="XLiV" facs="tcp:34646:57"/>
heard them himself from our Saviour's Mouth, he could not forget the unusuall manner in which he uttered them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIII. 21.

                           </gap> broke out into those vehement Words: <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</hi> At the hearing of which Words, as those other Evangelists tell us, the Disciples were all <hi>exceeding sorrowfull; and began to ask him one by one, Lord, is it I? Matt.</hi> XXVI. 21, 22. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 18, 19. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> sayth <hi>every one of them</hi> asked this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: not excepting <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> who surely would not have asked this, if our Saviour had told them already, it was <hi>Iudas</hi> that should betray him. Our Saviour gave this one general Answer to them all; <hi>It is one of the twelve that dips with me in the Dish, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 23. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 20. And to shew his own unconcernedness at it, He told them, as for himself, he was <hi>going as</hi> God had <hi>determined, Luk.</hi> XXII. 22. and <hi>as</hi> it was foretold <hi>in the Scriptures,</hi> that he should suffer. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 24. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 21. But for him that should be the wretched Instrument of this, he lamented his Condition; saying, <hi>wo unto him. Luk.</hi> XXII. 22. <hi>It had been good for him if he had never been born.</hi> It seems this touched <hi>Iudas:</hi> for he asked again, <hi>Lord is it I? Matt.</hi> XXVI. 25. to which our Saviour answered, it is even <hi>as thou hast said.</hi> But the cursed love of Money had so hardened his Heart, that this could make no impression upon it. It seems the other Disciples neither heard this last Question of <hi>Iudas,</hi> nor our Saviour's Answer: So that, their thoughts being taken up with what they heard last before, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us XIII. 22. they were <hi>looking one upon another,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> being at a loss <hi>to think who it should be</hi> of whom our Saviour said this: And after a while, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith XXII. 23. <hi>They began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing;</hi> The mean while, at St. <hi>Peter's</hi> desire, who <hi>beckned</hi> to him for that purpose, St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> lying next to our Saviour, asked him <hi>who it should be of whom he spake. Ioh.</hi> XIII. 23—25. Our Saviour answer'd him, <hi>it is he to whom I shall give a Sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the Sop, he gave it to Iudas.</hi> This great Benignity of our Saviour would have softned <hi>Iudas</hi> his Heart, if there had been any sense of goodness in it left But now it appearing there was none, it is said <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Then</hi> Satan <hi>enter'd into him;</hi>
                           <pb n="XLV" facs="tcp:34646:57"/>
that is, took him wholely into his possession. Whereupon our Saviour having quite done with him, said no more, but bid him, <hi>what thou doest do quickly.</hi> Then Judas <hi>went immediately out, and it was night;</hi> The properest time for that work of darkness, which he had sold himself to do. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> goes on XIII. 31, 32. to tell us our Saviour's reflection upon this, that now he was come near to an end of his state of Humiliation; and having glorifyed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, his next Step would be into that state of Glory in which he should for ever be with the Father. It seems that the other Disciples, lying at a farther distance from our Saviour, did not hear any thing of what passed between him and St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> and though they overheard his last words to <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet those were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by them; for they thought our blessed Lord had order'd him, being his Purs-bearer, to <hi>Buy</hi> in things <hi>for the Feast,</hi> or <hi>to give something to the Poor.</hi> So that this did not put a stop to the <hi>Enquiry</hi> that the Disciples were at among themselves. Nay it seems by the next following words of St. <hi>Luke</hi> XXII. 24. to have gone on <hi>to a Strife among them which of them should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the greatest.</hi> This Ambition was a Disease they were much subject to, as we read <hi>Matt.</hi> XX. 24—28. And now that they were falling into it again, our Saviour applyed to them again, the same needfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations; <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 24—26. shewing them how unsuitable this was to their Profession, how contrary to the Example he had given them, and especially Now, when he had been newly washing their Feet. Withall he told them, that as by his Covenant with his Father, he was through many Trials to enter into his Glory: So it was his Covenant with them, that by the like Patience and perseverance they should come to partake of the same with him in his heavenly Kingdom. It seems to have been for the checking of their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our Saviour gave them that Prediction which we read in the two former Gospels. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 31. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 27. The placing of it as it stands, in those Gospels, after his going to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> shall be considered afterwards: but at present for the Prediction it self. Our blessed Lord said to his Disciples, <hi>all You shall be offended because of me this night:</hi> what he meant by these Words it appeared by the Event; that, seeing him taken as a Malefactor, they would <hi>All</hi> leave him, and fly, to save their own lives. This being very sad and frightfull to them that considered it; he therefore told them two things, that might both give them Comfort at
<pb n="XLVj" facs="tcp:34646:58"/>
present, and be of greater use to them afterwards. One was, that their forsaking him in this manner, would be the fulfilling of that Prophecy of the <hi>Messias, Zech.</hi> XIII. 7. <hi>Smite the Shepherd, and the Sheep shall be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> It was for their Comfort that he call'd them <hi>His Sheep;</hi> for then, though they were to be scattered, they knew the <hi>good Shepherd</hi> would not suffer them to be lost. There was much more Comfort, if they had understood it, in the other Prediction, which followeth in the next Words: <hi>after I am Risen, I will go before you into Galilee. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 31, 32. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 27, 28. But they were in such Confusion at present, that they seem'd to have thought of this no farther, till the Angel minded them of it after <hi>Christ's</hi> Resurrection. <hi>Mar.</hi> XVI. 7. As that great Sin of the Disciples, in their forsaking our Lord, was the Punishment of that Sin beforegoing, in their Strife about superiority; so it should be some great Sin of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> that occasioned his falling into that far greater Sin of the denying of <hi>Christ.</hi> This was so much more remarkable than the other, that whereas we have our Saviours Prediction of the Disciples forsaking him, only from St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark;</hi> and they afterward give us the History of it, onely in five or six Words, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 56. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 50. We have both <hi>Christ's</hi> Prediction of <hi>Peter's</hi> denying him, and also the History of that, recorded at length in all the four Gospels, They all agree that he run himself into that Sin, by his over-confidence of himself; He seems to have presumed on his own strength, as if he had no need of any assistance from God. This he shewed that night on 3 severall occasions that arose in our Saviour's Table-Discourse; as hath been shewn in one Instance from St <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and will be shewn in a second from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> &amp; in a third from St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to shew him his folly, our Saviour told him once for all, that before the next morning, he would as many times <hi>deny that he knew him.</hi> The first Occasion that St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave our Saviour for this, was upon that last mentioned Prediction of his Disciples forsaking him. This being spoken of them all without any distinction; St. <hi>Peter</hi> declared that, however this might be true of all the rest, it would not be of him. These are his Words, <hi>though all men should be offended because of thee, yet will not I. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 33. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 29. To this St. <hi>Luke</hi> adds another thing, which was very considerable. He saith, that our Saviour told <hi>Peter</hi> that his Disciples, having given the Devil some advantage against them, (Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks it was by their strife
<pb n="XLVIJ" facs="tcp:34646:58"/>
about superiority,) that vigilant Enemy applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God against them, as he formerly did against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ob, <hi>desiring to have them, that he might sift them as Wheat, Luk.</hi> XXII. 31. Our Saviour told <hi>Peter,</hi> God had granted this for their Trial; but withall he told him this for His Comfort, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Our Saviour required him withall, that after so great a fall, when he was risen again, he should consider others Infirmities, and be the more ready, when they fell, to help them up. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 31, 32. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary an effect this had on St. <hi>Peter</hi> at the present, may be seen by his Answer to our Saviour: Wherein, with great Assurance he told him the same as before, <hi>Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into Prison, and to Death, Luk.</hi> XXII. 33. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> adds a third thing of his own observation: and it seems to have been that which immediately led our Saviour to this Prediction. He had said to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (and this also probably on occasion of the Strife before mention'd,) <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIII. 33. <hi>Little Children, yet a little while I am with you;</hi> after which, <hi>I shall go where you cannot come.</hi> He had told them just before vers. 32. he was going straitway to be <hi>Glorifyed</hi> in and with <hi>God.</hi> That was enough to assure them they should still be under his Fatherly care. But withall, they must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that his Eye would be over them, to see how they behaved themselves. Particularly in relation to his <hi>New Commandment</hi> that he gave them in these words, <hi>as I have loved you, so do you also love one another.</hi> He tells them, by their resembling him in This, they should shew they were his Children and his Disciples. It appears that by those words of his going away, <hi>Peter</hi> thought our Saviour meant, that he was now about to take a long Journey, probably in order to the restoring of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Israel,</hi> (for that still run in their minds) <hi>Acts</hi> I. 6. But whither soever it was, <hi>Peter</hi> would not stay behind: and therefore he asked him, <hi>Lord whither goest thou? Ioh.</hi> XIII. 36. Our Saviour meaning by those Words, that he was now going to dye upon the Crosse, as also he foresaw St. <hi>Peter</hi> would in God's time, accordingly answer'd him, <hi>Whither I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt afterwards.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Peter</hi> replyed, <hi>Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my Life for thy sake.</hi> This no doubt was his fixed Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he thought he had strength to make it good: but he Presumed too much on that; and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour told him, <hi>wilt thou lay down thy Life for my sake?
<pb n="XLVIIJ" facs="tcp:34646:59"/>
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, the Cock shall not crow, till thou hast denyed me thrice. Ioh.</hi> XIII. 38. St. <hi>Mark</hi> words the latter part thus; <hi>to day, even in this night, before the Cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. Mar.</hi> XIV. 30. It is most likely that he writ the Words as he had them from St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself. Of his two Cock-crowings, the first was at three in the morning; that being the middle between the two last Watches of the night, <hi>Mar.</hi> XIII. 35. and his second was at Day-break, which being the Principal, is the Onely Cock-crowing that is mentioned in the other three Gospels. What the present effect of our Saviour's Prediction was, St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> needed not repeat, having seen it so fully deliver'd in the two former Gospels: which tell us, that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as if he knew himself better than <hi>Christ</hi> did, answered him yet <hi>more vehemently</hi> than before; <hi>though I should dye with thee, yet I will not deny thee Matt.</hi> XXVI. 35. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 31. And they add, that when he had said this, <hi>all the</hi> other <hi>Disciples</hi> said the same; thinking, not without reason, that they might say it all, as well as he. After this, it might seem to little purpose for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to discourse with them any longer: besides that, it was now grown <note n="†" place="bottom">

But even of that little, he bestowed what he could, in giving them such Instructions and Comforts as he saw needfull to leave with them. These we have, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIV. which Chapter concludes with our Saviour's Words, that <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> understand of his rising from the Table. <hi>Arise, let us go hence,</hi> vers. 31. Then it seems most likely <hi>he sung a Hymn</hi> with his Disciples, as the <hi>Iews</hi> after their Passeover sing that which they call the great <hi>Hallel.</hi> After that, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with them to the Mount of <hi>Olives, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 30. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 26. St. <hi>Luke</hi> could not but see how those two Predictions, of the Disciples forsaking, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying our Lord, are placed in those two Gospels after our Saviour's <hi>going out to the Mount of Olives;</hi> though they were spoken by him, before his rising from the Table, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Evangelist's sure Information. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set them down in the order wherein they are here placed, in our Saviours Table-Discourse to his Disciples. After which, he added what our Saviour said to them, as it seems, after his rising from the Table <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 35—38. The summe of it was, to let his Disciples know,
<pb n="XLiX" facs="tcp:34646:59"/>
what a surprizing change there would presently be in their condition. That whereas hitherto they had been safe under his Wings, and he had provided for them, as his <hi>little Children;</hi> (so he called them) now he was to be taken from them this night, &amp; according to the Prophecy touching the <hi>Messias,</hi> to be <hi>reckoned among the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Esai</hi> LIII. 12. So that now they must provide for themselves; and that not onely against want, but against Danger, humanely speaking; their Country of <hi>Galilee,</hi> whither they would think to fly, so abounding with Robbers, that whosoever would live there, should rather sell his Clothes, than want Arms to defend himself. His last Words, being Proverbially spoken, they did not understand them, as it appears by their Answer, and he had not time now to explain himself. Therefore breaking off this Discourse, he onely said <hi>it is enough.</hi> And so, as it follows, <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 39. <hi>he went, <hi>as he was wont,</hi> to the Mount of Olives:</hi> that is, he went thither now this <hi>Maundy Thursday</hi> Night, as he had done every Night before since Palm-Sunday. It was in his way to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> according to <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> that he made those Discourses to his Disciples, which are recorded <hi>Ioh.</hi> XV. and XVI. And probably it was at his coming to that place that, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, XVII. 1. <hi>He lifted up his Eyes to Heaven,</hi> and his Soul to God in that Prayer, for himself, and for his Disciples, &amp; all that should <hi>believe on him through their Word.</hi> v. 17.

And there, as we read in <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 36. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 32. he came to the place called <hi>Gethsemane;</hi> which, according to Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> signifyes the place of <hi>Olive presses.</hi> It was, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> there observeth, vers. 2. a place that <hi>Iudas</hi> was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; <hi>for Iesus oft-times resorted thither with his Disciples.</hi> And that was the reason of his coming thither at this time. Our blessed Lord, knowing that his <hi>Hour</hi> was now come, as he must not do any thing to hasten it, so neither would he put it off longer. But with perfect Resignation to his Father, he came thither, <hi>as he was wont, Luk.</hi> XXII. 39. not doubting but that without his telling him, <hi>Iudas</hi> would soon come, and find him there. In the mean while, to make the best of his time, our Saviour retired himself to Meditation and Prayer. To be

Private, and yet not altogether without Witnesses, he took with him <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the same that were with him at his Transfiguration; Saying to the rest of his Disciples, <hi>sit you here, while I go and pray yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 36. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 32. When he was at the place that he had chosen for that purpose, having there before his Eyes the Terrors of Death, together with the many things he was to suffer in his way to it, with all their Aggravating Circumstances; all which things he saw now presently and unavoidably coming upon him; these (not to mention other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) lay extreme heavy upon his Soul: Especially being prest upon it <hi>by him that hath the power of Death,</hi> even <hi>the Devil,</hi> who no doubt strove with all his Might to overthrow him that was about to dispossess him of that Power, <hi>Hebr.</hi> II. 14. IV. 15. And though he had <hi>the Spirit given him without measure, Ioh.</hi> III. 34. which was an abundant support to him in all other Trials, yet the Power of it seemed to be suspended at present. He had complained some hours before, that he could not pray without interruption. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 27. Much more now, at entring into his Agony, <hi>he began to be sore amazed, and very heavy.</hi> He confest it to his Disciples, in these Words, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowfull, even unto Death:</hi> and therefore as if he had needed their help, he would have them <hi>stay and watch with him. Matth.</hi> XXVI. 37, 38. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 33. 34. But God provided bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, in sending a holy Angel to comfort him, <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 43. now in this most needfull time, as he had done before in lesser Trials. <hi>Matt.</hi> IV. 11. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 28. That those three Disciples might not be disheartned by seeing him in any of the three <hi>Fits,</hi> if we may so call them, of his <hi>Agony;</hi> he therefore every time <hi>went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a little; Matt.</hi> XXVI. 39. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 35. And being <hi>withdrawn</hi> from them <hi>about a Stones cast, Luk.</hi> XXII. 41. there he suffered all by himself. And having prayed <hi>vehemently</hi> to God; using every time <hi>the same Words,</hi> as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, XXVI. 44. and having thus obtained strength to persist; then he went to impart the same to his Disciples, stirring them up likewise to prayer. His first Conflict was in the Verses last mentioned: In the next following, we read how he <hi>fell on the ground,</hi> and lying there <hi>on his Face</hi> in the profoundest Humility <hi>he prayed,</hi> that <hi>if it were possible the Hour might pass from him.</hi> But when after this, he came to comfort his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he found them fast <hi>a sleep;</hi> whereupon he could not but mind them of their late Confidence; Especially <hi>Peter,</hi> that gave the ill Example to the rest. He therefore asked
<pb n="Lj" facs="tcp:34646:60"/>
Him particularly, <hi>Simon, sleepest thou? couldst not Thou watch with me One hour?</hi> He also exhorted them to <hi>watch and pray,</hi> as they had very great need, to keep them from sinking under the approaching Temptations. Our Saviour seems to have been so much weakned with his first Conflict, that he could scarce have gone through the Second; but that it pleased God to send his holy ANGEL to succour him in it, as we find <hi>Luk.</hi> XXII. 43. Together with this, that Evangelist tells us a Circumstance of this Agony, which was not in the two former Gospels: that his Terrors came so hard upon him, that <hi>his Sweat was as it were great drops of Bloud, falling down to the ground. Luk</hi> XXII. 44. Such bloudy sweats have been sometimes mentioned by Writers <note n="†" place="bottom">
                              <hi>Grotius</hi> from <hi>Aristot.</hi> hist. Animal. Lib. III.</note>; but it has been very rarely, as if it were onely to shew they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. This being much the hardest of our Saviour's three Conflicts, therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi> calls this <hi>an Agony,</hi> as if there were no other. Vers 44. And he tells us how our blessed Lord prayed in this, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, more vehemently than before: not but that <hi>he spake the same Words</hi> before, <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 39. but it was now <hi>with strong Crying and Tears, to him that was able to save him from Death. Hebr.</hi> V. 7. And there it is added that <hi>he was Heard,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, so as to be delivered, tho not from Death it self, yet <hi>from the Fear</hi> of Death, as <hi>Grotius</hi> understands it. After this, when he rose from prayer, and came to his Disciples, he found them <hi>sleeping for sorrow,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tell us: Whereupon <hi>he said to them, why sleep you?</hi> XXII. 45. St. <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>they wist not what to answer him.</hi> XIV. 40. St. <hi>Luke</hi> addeth that he said to them now, as we have seen he did before, <hi>rise and pray, that you enter not into Temptation.</hi> vers. 46. The third Conflict being after he was delivered from that <hi>Fear,</hi> was therefore so much easier than the two former, that little more is said of it, but that it is called <hi>the third</hi> in the two first Gospels: And St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, that now again our Saviour <hi>prayed, saying the same Words.</hi> After which, he was so easy in his mind, that coming to his Disciples, and finding them asleep again, <hi>he said to them,</hi> like one unconcerned, <hi>sleep on now, and take your Rest, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 45. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 41.

                           <hi>Pharisees,</hi> together with the Traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> who went at the head of them. There were also <hi>chief Priests, and Captains of the Temple, and Elders, Luk.</hi> XXII. 52. that came a little after the rest. And though it was full Moon, yet they had <hi>Lanterns, and torches, Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 3. to be sure that they might find him, and not mistake the Person. But for that, <hi>Iudas</hi> had given them <hi>a token,</hi> saying, <hi>whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I shall kisse, the same is He, hold him fast:</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, make sure of him, that he may not escape. Possibly it was that which this covetous wretch hoped he would do, after He had got his Money. But to make sure of that, (as it seems, while our Saviour was yet in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,) he stepped up to him, saying, <hi>Master, Master, &amp; kissed him. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 49. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 45. Our blessed Lord, at his first coming in view, asked him with his usual kindness, <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come? Mattb.</hi> XXVI. 50. But seeing what company he brought with him, <hi>Iesus said unto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kisse?</hi> Then, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, XVIII. 4—9. Our blessed Lord, <hi>coming forth</hi> out of the Garden, asked them that came foremost, <hi>whom seek you?</hi> They answered, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth.</hi> Our Saviour told them, <hi>I am He.</hi> which Words were no sooner out of his Mouth, but <hi>they went backward, and fell to the ground.</hi> When they were up again on their Legs, He asked them a second time, <hi>whom seek you?</hi> They answered as before; and he told them again, <hi>I am he: If therefore you seek me, let these go their way;</hi> pointing to his Disciples, who were his particular care: and of whom he had even now said in his prayer to God, <hi>of them whom thou gavest me have I lost none. Ioh.</hi> XVII. 12. They that came now to seize him, durst not touch those whom he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missd. But finding all this while, he would do nothing for the saving of himself; they took heart, and laid hands on him, and took him, as <hi>Iudas</hi> had bidden them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the two Disciples who had Swords, thinking now was the time to make use of them, they asked him, <hi>Lord, shall we smite with the Sword? Luk.</hi> XXII. 49. One of them, namely <hi>Peter,</hi> did not stay for an Answer; but forthwith drew upon <hi>Malchus</hi> a Servant of the High-Priests, and cut off his right Ear. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII, 10. That this might not occasion more Bloudshed, our Saviour first tied up the hands of his Enemies, with these Words, <hi>Suffer ye thus far:</hi> and withall, <hi>having touched the Ear of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, he healed him Luk.</hi> XXII. 51. Next, he bid <hi>Peter put up his Sword,</hi> and leave him to drink <hi>the Cup</hi> that the Father had ordered for him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 11. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, our blessed Lord gave him a Reprimend; telling
<pb n="Liij" facs="tcp:34646:61"/>
him, that his drawing the Sword against Authority was a Sin against God; and also that he run into that Sin very needlessly; for <hi>Peter</hi> could not but think, that if <hi>Iesus</hi> had thought fit to have a Guard, he could easily, upon <hi>prayer to his Father,</hi> have had <hi>twelve Legions of Angels</hi> about him, instead of his twelve Disciples. But <hi>then,</hi> saith he, <hi>how should the Scriptures be fulfilled,</hi> that have foretold <hi>that thus it must be. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 54. He also minded the chief Priests, and all the Multitude with them, how <hi>dayly</hi> and publickly <hi>he had taught in the Temple;</hi> and yet all that while God had not suffered them to lay hands on him: but the same Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had permitted it now. For, saith he, <hi>This is your Hour, and the Power of darkness. Luk.</hi> XXII. 53. And the reason of it was, <hi>that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled: Matt.</hi> XXVI. 56. God having so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by <hi>Esaiah, Daniel,</hi> and others, that this was his Decree, that <hi>Christ</hi> should suffer, saith <hi>Grotius</hi> on this Text. Our Saviour's Disciples having heard what now he had said, had not the courage to stay any longer: but, as he had foretold, <hi>they all forsook him, and fled. Matth.</hi> XXVI. 56. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 50. except onely <hi>Peter,</hi> that staid till he had fulfilled what our Saviour foretold of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him; and St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was the onely man of his Disciples that continued with him to the end. And it may be observed that <hi>Iohn</hi> was never question'd for it; which might shew the other Disciples, as well the Folly, as the Sin of their Desertion. Our blessed Lord being thus taken by his Enemies, they bound him, according to <hi>Iudas</hi> his Advice; and led him away, first to <hi>Annas,</hi> who was father in Law to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Priest <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 12, 13. It seems that <hi>Annas</hi> sent him away presently to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> vers. 24. who was more especially concerned in this matter, not onely by his Place, as being <hi>High-Priest the same Year,</hi> vers. 13; but also because the whole Proceeding against our Saviour was by his advice and instigation. vers. 14. The blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> being brought to the High-Priests Palace, was followed thither by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Disciples, vers. 15. The latter of these <hi>being known to the High-Priest,</hi> not onely went himself into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace after our Saviour, but understanding that <hi>Peter</hi> was kept out, he got him in also, by speaking for him to a Woman that was <hi>the Door-keeper</hi> vers. 16. But this very thing unexpectedly brought that Trial on <hi>Peter,</hi> in which, by his <hi>First denial</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> he shewed the weakness of that Resolution, which he had so much boasted of but a very few hours before; that

This might have made St. <hi>Peter</hi> remember his Masters Prediction: but it does not appear that it did; for there he stood warming himself with the High Priest's Servants and Officers, even till his second Denial. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 18. The mean while <hi>Caiaphas</hi> (as it should seem) having sent to call the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> together, was examining our blessed Lord, to prepare matters for them to proceed on at their meeting. He questioned him concerning <hi>his Disciples,</hi> and also <hi>his Doctrine,</hi> vers. 19; in hope to have got some matter to charge him with out of his own Mouth. Our Saviour plainly told him, that he had taught always in Publick, namely <hi>in the Synagogues, and in the Temple,</hi> vers. 20. where if he had said any thing amiss, there were enough to witness it against him. vers. 21. He referr'd him to Them, as being more proper for a Judge to examine, than him that was the Party Accused. For this Just Liberty that our Saviour used in giving this Answer to the High-Priest, he was sharply chastised by one of the Officers that stood by; who not onely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him for it, but also contumeliously <hi>slruck</hi> him on the Cheek vers. 22. whether with <hi>the Palm of his hand,</hi> or with his <hi>Sandal,</hi> as the Word may rather signify <note n="*" place="bottom">v. <hi>Hesychius</hi> in <gap reason="foreign">

for the Judicial proceding against our Saviour, vers. 66. The Beginning of that Insolent Usage of our blessed Lord might be about half an hour after three in Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For St. <hi>Luke</hi> says before this, vers. 58. that it was <hi>after some short time</hi> from St. <hi>Peter's</hi> first Denial of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he was tempted to it <hi>The Second time.</hi> It was while <hi>Peter</hi> was yet <hi>standing and warming himself,</hi> that some of them that stood by, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 25. namely a <hi>Maid, Matt.</hi> XXVI. 71. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 69. and a <hi>Man,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> says vers. 58. <hi>They,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says in the <hi>Plural,</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd St. <hi>Peter,</hi> saying to him, <hi>Art not thou also one of his Disciples?

It was at some distance of Time, <hi>about an Hour after,</hi> that <hi>another confidently affirm'd, saying, Of a Truth this man also was with them, for he is a Galilean, Luke</hi> XXII. 59.

And therefore at last, the High-Priest found it necessary for him to return to the way that he begun with at first, to try what he could get out of our Saviour himself. For that end he Asked first, what he had to say against the Evidence of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> now produced. But all they had said being nothing in effect, our Saviour would <hi>answer nothing</hi> to that Question. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 62, 63. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 60, 61. Then, as it follows in those two Gospels, <hi>the High-Priest asked him, art thou the Christ?</hi> There St. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions XXII. 67. something which they had omitted; namely our Saviour's way of avoiding that question. <hi>He said to them, if I tell you</hi> I am the Christ, <hi>you will not believe; and if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go,</hi> vers. 67, 68. His meaning was, as <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> understand it, that, if he should go about to prove it by Scripture; they would not Answer him, as he had tried, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXII. 46. nor would they release him, though he was the <hi>Christ</hi> of God, for ought they could say to the contrary. He told them what would come of this at last, that after all they could do to him, <hi>He, the Son of man should sit as their Iudge at the right hand of the Power of God. Luke</hi> XXII. 69. Now they reckon'd, if they could hold him to this, they had
<pb n="LVij" facs="tcp:34646:63"/>
enough for their turn. And therefore <hi>they all</hi> run into this Question, <hi>Art thou the Son of God?</hi> They would have a Categorical Answer, <hi>He said unto them, you say that I am</hi> vers. 70. Then <hi>they</hi> all <hi>said what need we any further witness? For we our selves have heard of his own Mouth</hi> vers. 71. But all this having past in a tumultuary way, they could do nothing upon it Judicially. And therefore to proceed in form of Law, there being no Witness against him, the Chief Priest was for putting him to his Oath. <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be the Christ the Son of God. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 63. Now our <hi>Saviour heard the voice of Swearing,</hi> as they call it when a Judge thus adjures <note n="†" place="bottom">Talmud Shebaoth IV. 5.</note>: and therefore he was bound by their Law to say the whole truth of all that was asked him, or else he must suffer as guilty. <hi>Levit.</hi> V. 1. To this therefore our Saviour answer'd, <hi>thou hast said it;</hi> as in St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> that is plainly, <hi>I am,</hi> as it is in St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Gospel. XIV. 62. And not to depart from what he had told them before, he added now, <hi>never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,</hi> tho I stand here as a Criminal before you, <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of heaven:</hi> meaning this of Himself, as the <hi>Messiah</hi> is described in <hi>Dan.</hi> VII. 13. Our blessed Lord having thus owned that he was the <hi>Messiah, the High Priest rent his clothes, as they used to do</hi> at the hearing of Blasphemy 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVIII. 37. XIX. 1. <hi>Now,</hi> he cryed, <hi>what need we any further Witness? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you have heard his blasphemy, what think you?</hi> By the Law, Blasphemy was a Capital Crime. <hi>Lev.</hi> XXIV. 16. <hi>And so they all condemned him, as being guilty of Death Matt.</hi> XXVI. 64—66. <hi>Mar.</hi> XIV. 61—64. Now they found a great want of the power of Life &amp; Death, that was taken from them by the <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Iews</hi> say that 40 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Destruction of the Temple, Capital Judgements were taken away from <hi>Israel.</hi> v. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> Vol. I. pag. 265.</note> 
                           <hi>Romans.</hi> But in this matter they did not doubt to get <hi>Pilate</hi> to supply that defect. The mean while they treated our Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> with the utmost spite and contempt, as if he were the very worst and vilest of men. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 67, 68. <hi>They</hi> that just before had Judged him <hi>Guilty of Death,</hi> came to him and <hi>spit in his Face;</hi> and then in mockery, having <hi>cover'd his Eyes,</hi> they <hi>Buffeted him.</hi> &amp; bid him <hi>Prophecy. Mar.</hi> XIV. 64, 65. Their <hi>Servants</hi> went on with their inhumane Sport, <hi>striking him with the Palms of their Hands,</hi> or their <hi>Sandals;</hi> and then saying, <hi>Prophecy unto us, thou Christ; who is he that smote thee?</hi> The mean

while the <hi>whole Sanhedrin,</hi> having sent, no doubt, to know <hi>Pilate's</hi> pleasure, when they should attend him with their Prisoner, to get Him, <hi>to put him to Death. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 1. were now <hi>consulting</hi> together about the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation they should bring in against him. They knew that to charge him, according to their manner with <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blasphemous Words against the Holy Place, and the Law, Acts.</hi> VI. 13. would signify nothing. And if they should charge him with that which they had condemned him for, his making himself the <hi>Christ, Pilate</hi> would not understand it: But they knew he would be toucht to the quick with any charge relateing to CAESAR: the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that then was, <hi>Tiberius,</hi> being a most jealous Prince, that would not endure the least seeming Neglect; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of them that were entirely his Creatures, as <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> was. This was the reason why they pitched upon that Ensnaring Question about the <hi>Lawfullness of paying Tribute to Caesar;</hi> and put that to our Saviour for this very End, <hi>that so they might deliver him to the Governor Luk.</hi> XX. 20. And though he escaped them then, by giving them such an Answer, as shewed how unjust it was in them, Now to charge him with the same Crime: yet, to make sure work, they resolved that this should be his Accusation. And so <hi>when the morning was come, Matt.</hi> XXVII. 1. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 1. at or after <note n="†" place="bottom">

There went <hi>the whole Sanhedrin</hi> together <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 1. to give the more coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their Business. When they were come thither, these bloody Hypocrites, that had just now <hi>Swallow'd a Camel,</hi> were presently <hi>straining at a Gnat.</hi> They held it a Legal pollution for any one of their Religion to go into a Room among <hi>the Sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> as they called them.

<pb n="LiX" facs="tcp:34646:64"/>
                           <hi>Accusation.</hi> vers. 29 He asked it in such a manner as shewed he would willingly have declined this Trouble. But they told him plainly, it was a Capital Cause; and therefore properly belonged to his Cognizance. Our blessed Lord being now to be <hi>cut off</hi> according to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel's</hi> Prophecy, and that Judicially, as it has been shewn in the Exposition: it was, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, XVIII. 32. so ordered by the Providence of God, that he should be brought before a <hi>Roman</hi> Judge, to be condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, to be <hi>Crucified,</hi> which was the very Death that our blessed Lord himself had foretold he should suffer; <hi>Ioh.</hi> XII. 32, 33. He could not have come to it otherwise. <hi>They began to Accuse him</hi> in these Words; <hi>we have found this Fellow perverting the Nation, and forbidding to give Tribute to Caesar; saying that he himself is Christ a King. Luke</hi> XXIII. 2. What they called now <hi>pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nation,</hi> they called afterward, vers 5. <hi>Stirring them up;</hi> no doubt, against the <hi>Roman</hi> Government. And if that, and all they charged him with, had been True; then he had been a <hi>Messias</hi> for their turn, as much as <hi>Barchochba</hi> was to the <hi>Iews</hi> in the next Age. But their Quarrel against our blessed Lord, was onely because he came in a low suffering Condition, as it was foretold that he should, in <hi>Esai.</hi> LIII. and other such Prophecies of Scripture. The things which they charged him with, being just contrary to what appear'd in all his Life and Doctrine, they could not pretend to bring any Proof of them. But for that, there would be no need of any, in the way that they took. The last thing in their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation being this, that he made himself a <hi>King,</hi> it was their way to get <hi>Pilate</hi> to ask him the Truth of That. They knew he would own it to <hi>Pilate,</hi> as he had done already to Them: and they reckoned his Owning of this would be taken for Proof of all the rest. <hi>Pilate</hi> could not think, by any thing he saw in the Prisoner, that they were in Earnest when they charged him with this. However, since they would have it so, he did ask him, <hi>Art thou the King of the Iews?</hi> Our Saviour answer'd him, <hi>thou sayest.</hi> vers. 3. Which Words were an Affirmation in the <hi>Syriac,</hi> that was his Native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But <hi>Pilate</hi> either understood not the Idioms of that tongue; or would not believe a thing so contrary to what he Saw in him. Therefore <hi>the chief Priests,</hi> seeing that would not do, went on to accuse him of <hi>many</hi> other <hi>things <hi>Mar.</hi>
                           </hi> XV. 4 But still they offer'd no proof of any thing that they said. And the things they charged him with, being palpably false, our blessed Lord heard them as one unconcern'd. <hi>He answer'd Nothing.</hi> At which <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="LX" facs="tcp:34646:65"/>
marvelled,</hi> believing there was something Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in it <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 3—5. To find the bottom of this, <hi>Pilate</hi> thought fit to ask our blessed Lord by Himself, what the meaning might be of that which they insisted upon, and he himself did not deny; namely, of his taking upon him to be a <hi>King.</hi> For this purpose he took our Saviour with him into <hi>the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Hall;</hi> and there he asked him a Second time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 33—38 saying, <hi>Art thou the King of the Iews?</hi> Our blessed Lord desired to know his Meaning in Asking him this: whether it was for his own Information, to know the truth of his Doctrine; or whether it was to know what he had to say to that Accusation. <hi>Pilate</hi> told him in the first place, vers. 35. he would know <hi>what he had done</hi> to give Occasion for this Accusation. Our Saviour told him plainly, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> And as to his doing any thing that might give Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for this charge, the contrary had sufficiently appear'd, in his Suffering himself to be <hi>delivered to the Iews,</hi> and forbidding any resistance. <hi>Pilate</hi> asked him, vers. 37. <hi>Art thou a King then?</hi> in any sense? He would know what our Saviour meant by it. The explaining of that matter, so as to make <hi>Pilate</hi> understand it, was not to be done in few Words; and there was not time now for many. But as to the matters of the Accusation, <hi>Pilate</hi> was now satisfied that there was nothing in Them: and therefore he went out again to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and told them, <hi>I find in him no fault at all. Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 38. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 4. What followed on <hi>Pilates</hi> clearing our Saviour, we are to learn from St. <hi>Luke:</hi> who goes on with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it XXIII. 5—16. He tells us, the chief Priests, having heard what <hi>Pilate</hi> said for the clearing of our Lord, were therefore <hi>the more fierce</hi> in Accusing him. They said, <hi>he stirrs up the People, teaching throughout all Iewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</hi> No doubt, by their mention of <hi>Galilee</hi> they would have it to be understood, that he was one of that Sect which was very prevalent in that Countrey ever since <hi>the Time of the Taxing, Acts</hi> V. 37. when <hi>Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> 
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> V. Not: h.</note> took up Arms to oppose the paying of Tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> It seems very likely that those <hi>Galileans, whose Blood Pilate ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their Sacrifices,</hi> were of that Sect. <hi>Luke</hi> XIII. 1. If they were, then the destroying of them was doing of Service to <hi>Caesar:</hi> and therefore <hi>Herod,</hi> being <hi>Caesar's</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee,</hi> had so much the more reason to take it ill of <hi>Pilate</hi> that he should take this Office out of his
<pb n="LXJ" facs="tcp:34646:65"/>
hands. This might very well be the occasion of <hi>the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> that was between <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> at this time, <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 12. <hi>Pilate</hi> knowing that <hi>Herod</hi> was now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> on the Account of the Passeover, did gladly take this Occasion; both to get rid of this troublesome matter, by putting it over to <hi>Herod;</hi> and also to let him see by this Instance how unwilling he was, without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessity for it, to meddle with any that <hi>belonged to Herod's Iurisdiction.</hi> And therefore as soon as he heard that our blessed Saviour was of <hi>Galilee;</hi> he presently <hi>sent him to Herod,</hi> that he might be Judge of this matter. <hi>Herod</hi> could not but be glad at our Saviour's first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, because he had been so long <hi>desirous to see him, in hope of seeing some Miracle done by him.</hi> But he soon found how much he was mistaken in his expectation. Our blessed Lord had something else to do, than to satisfy men's Curiosities. And therefore, though <hi>Herod asked him many Questions, he Answered him nothing. Luk.</hi> XXIII. 9. Much lesse would he Answer <hi>the chief Priests and Rulers;</hi> who, having followed him thither, vers. 10. <hi>Stood and vehemently accused him</hi> before <hi>Herod</hi> and all his Court. It could not but be a sad Spectacle to see our blessed Lord, as he stood there before them, so disfigur'd with the Barbarous Usage he had newly received from those very men that were now his Accusers. And now to hear them charge him with such Ambitious and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Practices and Designs, to make himself <hi>King of the Iews;</hi> it was a meer Jest to these Courtiers. And to carry it on a little farther, they <hi>arrayed him in a Gorgeous Robe;</hi> and so sent him back to <hi>Pilate</hi> in that Ludicrous Dresse, without any other Censure. Hereupon <hi>Pilate called together the chief Priests and the Rulers and the People,</hi> to give them an Account of this matter. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 13. It seems that the People were now coming to <hi>Pilate</hi> with their Demand for the Release of a Prisoner; which was a Favor the Governors had usually granted them against that good Time of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over vers. 17. <hi>Matt</hi> XXVII. 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 6. <hi>Pilate,</hi> having them and the chief Priests there together, told them, he had sent the Prisoner to <hi>Herod,</hi> and found <hi>Herod</hi> was of His Opinion touching the Prisoner's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as to any matter that could reach his Life. He therefore proposed it to the People, that this might be the Man they would chuse to have him Release to them now at the Passeover. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 39. But withall, for the Satisfying of the Priests, that they might not seem to have made all this Stirr about nothing; he offer'd that he would <hi>Chastise</hi> him first, before he <hi>Released</hi> him. <hi>Luke</hi>
                           <pb n="LXIJ" facs="tcp:34646:66"/>
XXIII. 14—17. The chief Priests were not at all pleased with this. And <hi>Pilate</hi> did not wonder at it, for <hi>he knew they had deliver'd him for Envy Matth.</hi> XXVII. 18. But the People, being the Body whom he most studyed to oblige, were by this time ingaged for the saving of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Prisoner. One <hi>Barabbas,</hi> that had been <hi>taken in an Insurrection, wherein he had also committed a Murder; Mar.</hi> XV. 7. for all this, had found Friends among the chief Priests. And they had secretly moved the People to shew Him this Favor. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 11. <hi>Pilate</hi> seem'd not to have so ill an Opinion of the People, as to think a Majority of them would be so wickedly partial as to preferr so great a Criminal before an Innocent Person. And therefore he ventured to join them both together in his Question. He asked the People; <hi>Whom will you that I release unto you?</hi> Barabbas, <hi>or</hi> Jesus <hi>which is called Christ? Matt.</hi> XXVII. 17. Now the <hi>Chief Priests and Elders</hi> with all their might <hi>perswaded the Multitude, that they should ask</hi> Barabbas, <hi>and destroy</hi> Jesus. vers. 20. Whereupon, as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> goes on, when the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor asked them again, <hi>whether of the Twain will you that I Release unto you? Matt.</hi> XXVII. 21. <hi>They cryed out all at once; saying, Away with this man, and Release to us</hi> Barabbas. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIII. 18, 19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVIII. 40. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Pilate asked them, what shall I do then with</hi> Jesus <hi>who is called</hi> Christ? <hi>They all cryed, saying, Crucify him, Crucify him. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 22. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 20, 21. <hi>He said to them <hi>the third time,</hi> Why? what Evil hath he done? Matt.</hi> XXVII. 23. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIII. 22. Then, hearing no Answer but a confused Noise, he declared to them, as he had done before; <hi>I have found no Cause of Death in him, I will therefore Chastise him, and let him go. Luk.</hi> XXIII. 22. And having said this, he returned with his Prisoner to the Judgement-Hall <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 16. What the Chastisement was that our Saviour received there, we are told briefly in the two first Gospels: <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVII. 27—30. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 16—19. for which reason St. <hi>Luke</hi> quite omitts it. But St. <hi>Iohn</hi> gives a fuller Account of this matter, and of all that followed it, in Order, till <hi>Pilate's</hi> giving the Sentence of Death on our Saviour. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 1—16. That Evangelist shews how <hi>Pilate</hi> strove, as much as such an Obnoxious man could, to have avoided the giving of that Sentence: Especially since his <hi>Wife</hi> had sent him an Account of her <hi>Dream,</hi> and thereupon warned him to <hi>have nothing to do against that just Man. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 19. This Message came to him <hi>When he was set down on the Iudgment-Seat.</hi> Ibid. And that might probably be at the time, when he gave
<pb n="LXiij" facs="tcp:34646:66"/>
Sentence for that, which he called <hi>Chastising</hi> him, whom a little before he had owned to be an Innocent Person. In all our blessed Lord's accusation, the only thing that stuck with <hi>Pilate,</hi> was his taking upon him to be <hi>a King.</hi> For tho he had explained himself, by saying his <hi>Kingdom was not of this World;</hi> yet in <hi>Pilate's</hi> Opinion, that did not clear him from being guilty of an innocent folly in affecting a Greatness that did not belong to him. He might think it necessary he should be Corrected for this. And therefore he condemned him to be <hi>Scourged;</hi> which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was properly the punishment of Slaves. For the executing of the Governor's Sentence, that being the Soldier's business, the whole Band of <hi>Pilate's</hi> Guards were called together, and our blessed Lord was delivered into their merciless Hands. No doubt they were acquainted with that which they were to Correct him for, which could not but seem extremely Ridiculous to them, in one of so despicable a Figure as he then made. It seems to have moved their Indignation and Scorn to the utmost Degree: Which they shewed, not only in <hi>Scourging</hi> him, according to his Sentence, but also in Handling him afterwards in a most cruel and Insolent manner. First <hi>they platted a Crown of Thorns,</hi> and <hi>put it on his Head;</hi> Then <hi>they stripped</hi> off his Clothes, and <hi>put on him a Robe of Scarlett Matt.</hi> XXVII. 28. <hi>of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Mar.</hi> XV. 20. <hi>Iohn</hi> XIX. 2. probably it was patched up of both these together. And to make the Mock Royalty complete, <hi>they put a Reed in his right Hand,</hi> and made him hold that for a Scepter. <hi>Matt</hi> XXVII. 29. Then, as it were doing Homage, <hi>they bowed the knee before him, saying, Hail King of the Iews. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 29. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 19. <hi>Iohn</hi> XIX. 3. And to finish their Sport, <hi>they spit on him: and taking the Reed out of his Hand, they</hi>

                           <hi>gave him several blows with it on his Head. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 30. <hi>Pilate</hi> seeing our blessed Lord in this cruel Mockery of Royall Attire, having his Face all besmear'd with their Spittle, and his own Blood, had Reason to hope such a Spectacle as this might have moved the Compassion of the People; especially, since he that suffered all this, for ought that appeared to Them, was an Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And therefore he <hi>brought him forth</hi> to them, saying, <hi>behold the Man,</hi> into what a miserable Condition you have brought him; and this for Nothing. It seems not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that this might have moved the People: but <hi>the Chief Priests</hi> no sooner Saw him, but they <hi>and their Officers cryed out, saying Crucifie him, Crucifie him, Ioh.</hi> XIX. 6. Then the People also, following their
<pb n="LXiV" facs="tcp:34646:67"/>
Example, <hi>were Instant with loud voices requiring that he might be Crucified. Luke</hi> XXIII 23. But <hi>Pilats</hi> knowing these were set on by the Chief Priests, applied himself to Them in particular: and told them, if they would have this Man Crucified, they must do it themselves; For his part <hi>he found no fault in him. Ioh.</hi> XIX. 6. They Answer'd him, <hi>we have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he made himself the Son of God.</hi> vers. 7. By the <hi>Son of God,</hi> they meant the <hi>Christ,</hi> as appears <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVI. 63. And it was true, that by their Law, he that falsely made himself to be the <hi>Christ</hi> ought to dye <hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 20. But <hi>Pilate</hi> understood not the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their Scriptures. And therefore, hearing that this Man <hi>made himself the Son of God,</hi> he understood by it that he pretended to be of Divine Extraction and Linage. And having likely heard of his Miracles, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his raising of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and of his last Publick Entring into <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> having seen also his unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able firmness of mind in all this Trial; and having heard from his Wife, what Dreams she had of him this very day; and hearing this at last which the Chief Priests said of him; he was afraid, as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks, he might be indeed of such a Birth, as some of those whom he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship't were said to have been. And therefore taking him <hi>again into the Iudgement-Hall,</hi> he asked him <hi>Whence art thou?</hi> Inquiring into his Birth and Family. <hi>Iesus</hi> gave him no Answer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 8, 9. for he saw as to himself, that there needed none to this last charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it came without any Proof: and he could do <hi>Pilate</hi> no good by any thing he could say at this time to his Question. Therefore our blessed Lord <hi>gave him no Answer.</hi> Then <hi>Pilate</hi> asked him in some kind of Anger, <hi>Speakest thou not to Mee? Knowest thou not, that I have Power to Crucifie thee, and Power to Release thee?</hi> vers. 10. It was true, he had the Power of Life and Death in his Hands: but he could Act by it no farther than God would give him leave. And our blessed Lord had often shewn, that when He pleased, no Humane Power could touch him. But it was the Will of God, that the <hi>Messias</hi> should be <hi>cut off,</hi> and Now the Time appointed for it was come: which things the <hi>Iews</hi> might have known by their Prophecies, and it was their Fault that they did not. This is what <hi>Grotius</hi> takes to be the effect of his Answer: <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 11. <hi>Thou couldest have no Power at all against Me, but that it is given thee</hi> FROM ABOVE: <hi>Therefore He that Deliver'd me to Thee, has the greater Sin.</hi> It was chiefly <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that <hi>deliver'd</hi> him to <hi>Pilate:</hi> and They were the Men that chiefly ought to have known
<pb n="LXV" facs="tcp:34646:67"/>
who he was; as, if they had been so disposed, they might have known by their Scriptures. Therefore though it was a great Sin in <hi>Pilate,</hi> to do what he was now going to do, against Law, and against his own Conscience: yet it was a far <hi>Greater Sin</hi> in Them, that went against a far Greater Light, even that of Divine Revelation. This touched <hi>Pilate</hi> so far, that, as the Text saith, <hi>from thenceforth Pilate sought</hi> more than ever <hi>to Release him.</hi> But the <hi>Iews,</hi> seeing that, cryed out; <hi>If thou let This Man go, thou art not Caesar's Friend. Whosoever makes himself a King,</hi> he takes so much from <hi>Caesar,</hi> vers. 12. This amounted to a Threatning of <hi>Pilate,</hi> with that which of all things in the World he most feared. He had been guilty of so many Acts of Misgovernment, which would have been brought in open View, upon any Complaint that should have been made to <hi>Caesar</hi> against him; that he dreaded nothing more than This. And it appeard he was in the right; for by such a Complaint he was Ruin'd within few years after. Therefore, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the Text, <hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>heard that Saying, he brought</hi> Jesus <hi>forth, and sat down on the Iudgement-Seat</hi> vers. 13. And from thence having shewn that miserable Spectacle, to the People now, as he had done before to the Priests; he said to them, <hi>Behold your King</hi> vers. 14. They no sooner heard it, but they cryed out, <hi>Away with him, Crucifie him.</hi> Then <hi>Pilate</hi> asked them, <hi>shall I Crucifie your King? The chief Priests</hi> Answer'd him, <hi>We have no King but Caesar. Ioh.</hi> XIX. 15. God has taken them at their Word: they have had no King but <hi>Caesar's</hi> Successors ever since. But here St. <hi>Iohn</hi> leaves us to the two first Gospels. They tell us, that <hi>Pilate, when he saw he could prevail Nothing, but that rather a Tumult was made: he took Water, and washed his Hands before the Multitude: saying, I am Innocent of the Blood of this just Person, See you to it. Then Answer'd all the People; and said, his Blood be upon Us and our Children Matt.</hi> XXVII. 24, 25. And so it is to this Day, and will be till their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Ioel.</hi> III. 21. Then <hi>Pilate</hi> hearing this; and <hi>being willing to content the People, Mar.</hi> XV. 15. <hi>he gave Sentence that it should be as they required Luke</hi> XXIII. 24. And so <hi>he Released</hi> Barabbas <hi>unto them, and delivered</hi> Jesus <hi>to be Crucified. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 26. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIII. 25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 16. <hi>It was the Preparation of the Passeover, and about the sixth Hour, Iob.</hi> XIX. 14. when <hi>Pilate sat down on the Iudgement-Seat,</hi> as was before mention'd.

V. p. 116.</note> Mr. <hi>Whiston.</hi> And therefore, as to the Point of Time, his <hi>sixth Hour</hi> was the same as ours is, at Six in the Morning. But then, the <hi>Romans</hi> dividing their natural Day from Sun-set to Sun-set into four Watches, whereof each was of three Hours, according to <note n="*" place="bottom">cap. XXIIX.</note> 
                           <hi>Censorinus;</hi> they called each of these Watches by the Name of that Hour at which it begun. The <hi>Iews</hi> also reckoned their Watches in the same manner, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> shews on this Text. Onely with this difference; that whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> called every Watch by the name of that Hour at which it began; The <hi>Iews</hi> called it by the name of that Hour at which it ended: So that the Space from six to nine, which the <hi>Iews</hi> called the Third Hour, was <hi>the sixth Hour</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Account. But this was common to them both, that the name of the Hour at which the Trumpet sounded, was continued the whole Space of 3 Hours till the Trumpet sounded again. As for St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>about,</hi> which, as Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> saith, <hi>may be taken any where within that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> it seems most likely in this place to be intended of the middle between six and nine in the morning. For there was a considerable part of this Watch already spent, since <hi>Pilate</hi> enter'd upon this Business: and yet, as it will presently appear in this Discourse, there remained Business enough to fill up the rest of the Time till Nine in the morning; which was, in the Jew's Account, <hi>the third Hour;</hi> and yet That, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, was the very Time of our Saviour's being Crucified. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 25. It is also to be observed, that this whole Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls it, <hi>the Preparation of the Passeover;</hi> the Paschal Lamb being to be Killed about 3 this Afternoon, and to be Eaten after it was dark the same Evening. It seems to have been toward Eight in the morning, when the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> was condemned by <hi>Pilate</hi> to that cruel and Ignominious Death. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 24. After which, our Saviour was immediatly by him delivered to his Soldiers, whose Office it was to put his Sentence in Execution. The Suddenness of this was against the <hi>Roman</hi> Law in all Ordinary cases: for by that Law some days of Respite were Generally allowed the condemned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to prepare themselves for their Suffering. But here was Order given for present Execution. The Chief Priests could admit no Delay, because the Passeover was to be within a few Hours. And <hi>Pilate,</hi> having yielded to them in the main Point, would not break with them about any
<pb n="LXVij" facs="tcp:34646:68"/>
less matter: especially since there was an Exception in that Law for any one that was to suffer on the Account of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which was our blessed Saviour's case. Therefore as soon as the Sentence was pass'd, the Soldiers were presently for hurrying him away. And so putting an end to their mockery, they took off the Purple Robe from our Saviour, and put on his own clothes. Then having provided a Cross on which he was to suffer, they layd that on his Shoulders, to make him carry it Himself; as all those used to do that were to be Crucified, according to the manner of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And thus our blessed Lord, <hi>bearing his Cross, went forth</hi> toward the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 17. But it appears he could carry it no great part of the Way, being so spent and disabled, that he was ready to sink under the Burthen. Therefore one <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> who was then <hi>coming out of the Countrey,</hi> happening to come in their way, the Soldiers <hi>layd the Cross upon Him,</hi> and <hi>compelled him to bear it after Him. Matth.</hi> XXVII. 32. <hi>Mark.</hi> XV. 21. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 26. St. <hi>Luke</hi> shews, that at that time there were many of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation who differ'd very much in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our Saviour from those of their Brethren, that had been all this morning crying out, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> For as he there tells us, vers. 27. even Now when he was going to suffer, <hi>there followed him a great Company of People, and of Women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</hi> Our blessed Lord could not but have a just Sense of their Compassion toward him in his present Condition. But he had a much greater Compassion for Them, considering what They were to suffer within a few Years, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of whom there were many in that Company. For as the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> himself was now going to be <hi>cut off,</hi> and so to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill His part of <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecy, so he Knew the next thing there foretold was to be fulfilled upon Them, in <hi>the destroying of their City and Sanctuary.</hi> Then they were to suffer those Direfull Calamities, which were foretold so long since, even by <hi>Moses</hi> himself <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Iews</hi> do acknowledge the fulfilling of this Prophecy was to be at the Destruction of their City by <hi>Titus.</hi> See <hi>Menass. ben Israel</hi> de term. vitae III. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> XXVIII. 49—57. The best Office our Saviour could do them at present was to let them know what they were to expect, that they might not be surprized, when these things should come to pass: and especially, the Women of that City, whose Condition was most Pityable of all
<pb n="LXViij" facs="tcp:34646:69"/>
others. Therefore <hi>he turned himself to them,</hi> and said, <hi>Yee Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Weep not for Mee, but weep for your selves and for your Children, For behold, the Days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the Barren, and the Wombs that never bare, and the Paps that never gave Suck.</hi> No doubt he reflected on the 56, and 57th. verses of that Prophecy, which speak of <hi>the tender and delicate Woman's eating her</hi> own young <hi>Children</hi> for hunger <hi>secretly in the</hi> Siege: Which thing <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us was most remarkably fulfilled in that Siege at which he was present. <hi>Ios.</hi> de Bell. <hi>Iud.</hi> VII. 8. And there also in Chapter 17. he tells of above two thousand men, among whom were two of the most bloody <hi>Zealots</hi> of all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, that had hid themselves in the Bottom of severall Jakes, to escape the Hands of the <hi>Romans.</hi> These no doubt were intended in those Words of the Prophet's, foretelling of those that should <hi>Cry to the Mountains,</hi> and <hi>to the Hills, to fall on them, and cover them</hi> from the Dreadfull Judgements of God. He bid them think by what they now saw, if God spared not <hi>the Green</hi> Fruitfull <hi>Trees</hi> in the Day of his Wrath, what the End must be of <hi>the Dry</hi> that are good for nothing but the Fire. St. <hi>Luke</hi> also takes notice of other Company that our Saviour had, who as to outward things were in the same Condition with himself; Namely, the <hi>two Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, that were led with him to be put to Death.</hi> vers. 32. according to that Prophecy. <hi>Esai.</hi> LIII. 12. <hi>When they were come to the Place called Calvary,</hi> vers. 33. in Hebrew <hi>Golgotha,</hi> that is <hi>the Place of a Scull;</hi> there St. <hi>Luke</hi> leaves his Reader to the two former Gospels. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVII. 33. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 22. And there, the First thing our blessed Lord was to suffer, being that which <hi>David</hi> foretold would happen to the <hi>Messias,</hi> (for he could not say this of himself,) <hi>they pierced my Hands and my Feet, Psalm.</hi> XXII. 16. this was fulfilled in their Nailing of our Saviour's <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> to the Cross on which he was to suffer. That was the <hi>Roman</hi> way of fastening all them that were to be Crucified. But it caused such horrible Pain while it was doing, and much more after it was done, that for the Supporting of them that were to suffer it, there was given them before hand a Draught of that which was called the <hi>Cup of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:</hi> that was onely <hi>Uinegar and Gall,</hi> which was thought good enough for the vilest sort of Criminals. And to them a great Favor it was, either to hasten their Death, and so to put them the sooner out of their Pain, or to Stupify them, so that they should be almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of it. This Cup was offer'd to our blessed Saviour

by <hi>the four Soldiers,</hi> that were his Executioners, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 23. as he doubtless expected it would; being foretold in one of the Psalms of his Passion. <hi>Ps.</hi> LXIX. 21. <hi>They gave me Gall for my Relief,</hi>

St. <hi>Mark,</hi> as others have observed, in his Gospel, hath both abridged that of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and hath added such things as He, or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> judged to be of great Moment.

But, as our blessed Lord, though he Tasted of that Cup with <hi>Gall</hi> in it for the fulfilling of a Prophecy, yet refused to Drink it, for the Reasons before mention'd; So, having the same Reasons not to Drink of this Draught, but not the same Reason to Tast of it, therefore <hi>he Received it not,</hi> he would not take it into his Mouth. By this Time it was the <hi>Third Hour, Mar.</hi> XV. 25. that is, it was Nine of Clock in the Morning. And now the four Soldiers that were our blessed Lords Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, having done their Preparatory Business, they Nailed him to the Cross, and so <hi>Crucified the Lord of Life.</hi> The mean while other Soldiers did the like to the two <hi>Malefactors</hi> whom they Crucified with him, <hi>One on the Right hand, and the other on the Left.

                           <hi>Seamless Coat,</hi> which they reserved to cast Lots for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This they did under the Eyes of the blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> who was then hanging on the Cross. And even there, amidst all his sufferings, he Prayed for them that were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Instruments of his Misery, as many of them as were capable of receiving Benefit by his Prayers; He said, <hi>Father! forgive them, for they know not what they do. Luke</hi> XXIII. 34. And as his Prayers seem'd to be more Particularly intended for the Soldiers, so the Blessing of them came down, first, and that visibly, on the <hi>Centurion, and those that were with him,</hi> while they were yet on the Place, as it follows, <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVII. 54. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 39. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 47. It was the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, when any one was Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to set up his Accusation written in a Table, Nailing it up over his Head. Now it being charged by the Chief Priests on our Saviour, that he called himself <hi>King of the Iews:</hi> as <hi>Pilate,</hi> being vexed at their pressing him with this, had, it seems to vex them, called him <hi>your King,</hi> more then once; <hi>Ioh.</hi> XIX. 14, 15. So now to vex them more, he had it written in the Table above mention'd, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth, the King of the Iews.</hi> It seems, before this was Nailed up, that many of the <hi>Iews</hi> had read it; as all might that would, for it was written in <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> there being scarce any of the <hi>Iews</hi> but understood one or more of these Languages. Hereupon the Chief Priests, being disturbed, did, as it seems, hinder the setting of it up for a while, till they had spoken with <hi>Pilate.</hi> And fain they would have perswaded him <hi>not to write, the King of the Iews; but that he said, I am King of the Iews.</hi> But <hi>Pilate</hi> did not fear their complaining to <hi>Caesar</hi> of This: and therefore being, as <hi>Philo</hi> says, <hi>inflexible</hi> in his own Nature, and Angry with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he Answer'd them accordingly, <hi>what I have written,</hi> I <hi>have written. Ioh.</hi> XIX. 19—22. While this matter was in Debate, the Soldiers expecting the Title, and having nothing else to do at present, <hi>sat down, and watched him there. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 36. It seems to have been on that Occasion of <hi>Pilate's</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour the Title of <hi>King of the Iews,</hi> that their Rage, which he had quieted a little before by Sentencing him to that cruel Ignominious Death, now flamed out afresh, to that degree that they were for punishing him More, if it were possible. They did what they could toward it, by falling upon him in several Attaques, reviling, and scoffing, and insulting over his Miseries. First we read how <hi>the People that stood Looking upon him,

Luk.</hi> XXIII. 35. wherein They fulfilld that part of the Prophecy <hi>Psal.</hi> XXII. 6. in which <hi>David</hi> says in the Person of the <hi>Messias, They that See me, laugh me to scorn.</hi> Next, <hi>They</hi> also <hi>that Passed by reviled him, wagging their Heads, Matt.</hi> XXVII. 39, 40. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 29, 30. therein fulfilling the following part of the same Prophecy.

Some of these Scoffers charged him with those Words that the <hi>false Witnesses</hi> could not agree about; that he said, <hi>he would destroy the Temple, and build it again in three Days:</hi> a plain Wresting of the Words of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his Death and Resurrection, which was even now to be fulfilled. Others scoffed at his Miracles, as if his <hi>saving others</hi> were nothing, unless he did now <hi>save himself,</hi> And yet they could not deny he had newly raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead: and they very well knew he had foretold that <hi>after three days he would rise himself. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 63. The Scoff they all join'd in was at his being called <hi>the King of the Iews, the King of Israel, the Messias, the Christ, the Son of God;</hi> these are severall Words for the same thing, and the Scoffers used some one Word, some another; all agreeing in this, that <hi>if he were the Christ, he must come down from the Cross.</hi> But he had told them often before, that he was <hi>to be lifted up, Ioh.</hi> XII. 34. but not once of his coming down. And he was to prove his being the <hi>Messias.</hi> not by his escaping Death, but by his Resurrection from the Dead. The strangest of all their Scoffs, was in these Words, <hi>He trusted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him. Matt.</hi> XXVII. 43.

A plain Instance of the just Judgement of God upon them for their Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; that though they <hi>read the Writings of the Prophets every Day,</hi> yet <hi>they fulfilled All that was written</hi> in them of our Saviours sufferings. <hi>Act.</hi> XIII. 27, 28, 29.

Matt.</hi> XXVII. 44. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 32. But it was onely one of them did this, as we learn from <hi>Luke</hi> XXIII. 39. <hi>He said, if thou be Christ, save they self and Us.</hi> The other hearing this, rebuked him for it; and told him how different their Case was from <hi>Christ's.

He knew also of his Doctrine, and Miracles; So far as to be thereby converted; though Probably not till since his committing those Crimes for which he suffer'd. This appears by his Prayer that he made to our Saviour: <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</hi> vers. 42.

They seem to have been so sensible of this, that they all withdrew themselves, and went home one after another; or at least they forbore giving our blessed Lord any farther disturbance; for we read nothing more of them, during all the Space of Three hours that the Darkness continued.

It could not have been safe for them, but that they kept at a distance, till now when their Enemies were frighten'd away. Now when they were come so near him, as they shew'd their

Affection in it, so he shewed his Care of his Mother, together with his Authority over Her and his beloved Disciple. He bad her, that was now losing Him, take <hi>Iohn</hi> instead of himself, to be her <hi>Son:</hi> and bad <hi>Iohn</hi> take charge of her, as his own <hi>Mother.</hi> Which he tells us, he accordingly did. <hi>From that hour he took her to his own home.</hi> vers. 26. 27. It may be observed of those two other devout Women, that as they were the last that stayd with our blessed Saviour at his Death, so they were the First whom he appear'd to after his Resurrection. Our blessed Lord being now to have no more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with Mankind in this Life, applyed himself wholy to God in Supplications and Prayers. For which he had much more Occasion now on the Cross, than he had in his Agony in the Garden the night before. He was Now suffering the utmost of all that he then onely fear'd. He was now in a nearer view of all the Terrors of Death. His Spirits were spent with so much Effusion of Blood; and Nature was now sinking under the burden. His onely Support being the supernatural Assistance of the Spirit of God, it seems he had lost the Sence of that for the present; which made him cry out, in the first Words of the two and twentieth Psalm, <hi>My God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> But as he shewed the firmness of his Faith in calling God by that Title: So it appears he did not forget himself to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> of God, for whom <hi>David</hi> made that Psalm in the Spirit of Prophecy. And God appear'd to Answer his Prayer, by a visible Token, in dispelling that <hi>Darkness,</hi> which had now continued three Hours, as was before mentioned. It was <hi>at the Ninth hour</hi> that the Darkness went off. <hi>Matt.</hi> XXVII. 45. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 33. That was <hi>the hour of Prayer</hi> in the Temple. <hi>Act.</hi> III. 1. the Time of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice.

The Words that he spoke were in the <hi>Syriac</hi> tongue, which was our Saviour's natural Language.

After this, Iesus knowing that all things were now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,</hi> that belong'd to his State of Humiliation, his Death onely excepted: to the end <hi>that the Scriptures might be fulfill'd, he said, I thirst.

St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> seems to have understood it of the fulfilling of the Prophecy. It is render'd in our Translation, <hi>it is Finished:</hi> and so the same word is used by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> II. <hi>Tim.</hi> IV. 7. Our blessed Lord had now <hi>Finished</hi> his great Work, that he had undertaken. He had pay'd the last drop of his Blood for our Redemption: and had nothing more to do, but to resign his Soul to God. To shew how willingly he did this, <hi>he cryed with a loud Voice, saying, Father! into thy hands I commend my Spirit. Luke</hi> XXIII. 46. They are the Psalmist's words, <hi>Psalm.</hi> XXXI. 5. to which our blessed Lord added onely the Title of <hi>Father,</hi> which he alone could use in his own proper Right. And so in perfect Obedience to his Father, he did, as it was foretold of him, <hi>pour out his Soul unto Death. Esai.</hi> LIII. 12. <hi>He Bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghost. Ioh.</hi> XIX. 30. St <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us in his next Words, vers. 31. that it was now <hi>the Preparation of the Sabbath.</hi> He further tells us, that <hi>that Sabbath-day was a High-day.</hi> So the <hi>Iews</hi> called the first and last days of their great Feasts. <hi>Ioh.</hi> VII. 37. This was therefore the first of the seven days of Unleaven'd Bread; which falling upon a <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> was a <hi>High-day</hi> more than Ordinary. But for this <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sabbath,</hi> the Apostle is carefull to distinguish it from <hi>the Preparation of the Passeover,</hi> mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="LXXVij" facs="tcp:34646:73"/>
vers. 14. That of <hi>the Passeover,</hi> as he there told us, was <hi>about the Sixt hour,</hi> which, as it was shewn before in page Lxvj. held from Six till Nine in the morning. But this <hi>Preparation of the Sabbath,</hi> was not till three of the Clock in the Afternoon. So it is expressly said in <hi>Augustus</hi> his <note n="†" place="bottom">Jos. <hi>Antiq.</hi> XVI. 10. p. 561. E.</note> Edict for the exempting of the <hi>Iews</hi> from giving Bail in Suits of Law; that it should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them on their <hi>Sabbath-dayes;</hi> nor on <hi>their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations</hi> or <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> Eves, from <hi>the Ninth hour,</hi> that is, from three of the Clock in the Afternoon. It was some three hours before our Saviours death, that, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, XXIII. 44, 45. <hi>The Sun was darkned, and the Vail of the Temple was rent in the midst;</hi> plainly shewing, that the <hi>Eclipse,</hi> as <hi>Phlegon</hi> calls it, and the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> came both together, as they have been placed before in this Discourse. But it seems very likely that there was another Shock of the Earth-quake, at the time when our blessed Saviour expired. For St. <hi>Matthew</hi> not only places the Earthquake immediately after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours death; but also saies, Thereupon <hi>the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, when they saw the Earthquake, feared greatly.</hi> But that which struck them most, was their seeing <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>(Matt.</hi> XXVII. 54 <hi>Luk.</hi> XXIII. 47.) <hi>what happened,</hi> in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Saviour's death. <hi>Mar.</hi> XV. 39. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he So Cryed Out, and</hi> then immediately <hi>gave up the Ghost.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> saies; <hi>The Centurion</hi> seeing these things happen together, <hi>Glorified God;</hi> Owned that this was <hi>certainly</hi> his Work; and that He must be <hi>a Righteous Man,</hi> for whom God was so much concerned; nay he must be what he owned himself to be, <hi>The Son of God.</hi> As that Word was what made <hi>Pilate</hi> afraid, <hi>Iohn.</hi> XIX. 8. so it did now the Soldiers, that had thus ill treated so great a Favorite of God. But not only They, but <hi>all the People that were come together to that sight, when they beheld</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>the things that had happened, smote their breasts, and returned. Luke.</hi> XXIII. 48. no doubt with sad hearts; thinking what heavy Judgements of God this Great <hi>Sin</hi> was like to bring upon their Nation. But soon after, they that had been the Authors of this, being still Zealous for the Externals of their Religion, were concern'd that the dead Bodies should not be suffered to hang upon the Cross on the <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> Especially, that being <hi>a High day,</hi> as was before mentioned. <hi>They</hi> therefore <hi>besought Pilate that</hi> the Bodies <hi>might be taken away. Ioh.</hi> XIX. 31. But to shew that they meant the Condemnd Men no Favor in this, they desired it might not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>breaking their Legs</hi> first, which was a Cruell way
<pb n="LXXViij" facs="tcp:34646:74"/>
of putting them out of their pain. <hi>Pilate</hi> ordered how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that it should be as they desired. <hi>So the Soldiers came, and brake the Legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with Him.</hi> vers. 32. <hi>But when they came to</hi> Jesus, <hi>and saw that He was Dead already, they brake not his Legs: but,</hi> to be sure of his being dead, <hi>one of the Soldiers with a Spear pierced his Side, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with there came out Blood and Water.</hi> vers. 33, 34. Which, as is commonly observed, was a sure sign that the Spear had pierced his Heart. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> declares himself to have been an Eye witness of this; against them that held that <hi>Christ</hi> died not really, but in appearance; which was a prevailing Heresie in those days. But withall he shews how wonderfully God orderd things, by taking our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour so soon out of the World, to make way for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of two other Prophecies of Scripture. One of them was, to shew that in Him that great Type of the Paschal Lamb was accomplished. In token whereof, as He Died at the same Hour when the Paschal Lamb was to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; so according to <hi>the Ordinance of the Passeover, Exod.</hi> XII. 43, 46. it truely came to pass <hi>that not a Bone of Him was broken. Iohn.</hi> XIX. 36. The other was, that in <hi>Zechary's</hi> Prophecy of the Conversion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> wherein it is saied by Him whose Spirit spake in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>They shall look on Mee whom they have pierced, Zech.</hi> XII. 10. So now to put them out of doubt that he was <hi>Dead,</hi> his blessed Body was <hi>pierced,</hi> which would have been Spared if he had been yet Living. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> layes great weight upon that which he Saw, of the fulfilling of both these Scriptures in our Saviours Person. First, that He was <hi>the</hi> true Paschal <hi>Lamb, that was slaine to redeem us by his Blood. Rev.</hi> V. 6, 9, 12. VII. 14. XII. 11. That we may often think of this, he mindes us of it above twenty times more in that Book. The other is, that the Jews shall know him to be their Messias by that very Token of their having <hi>Pierced</hi> him. <hi>Psalm.</hi> XXII. 16. <hi>Zech.</hi> XII. 10. That they would use him so, was foretold in those Prophecies which their own Writers <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Pearson</hi> on the Creed p. 201.

               <head>The fulfilling of this Prophecy concerning Christ's Death, proved by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances out of the foregoing Account of the Gospel History.</head>
               <p>THe Chief design of all this Discourse in relation to our present business, has been to shew how our blessed Saviour understood and Explained that principal part of the Angel's Prophecy, That <hi>after</hi> LXII <hi>Weeks the Messias shall be cut off:</hi> And also to shew how it was fulfilled in his Person, so as to prove beyond contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that He was the very <hi>Messias</hi> spoken of in this Prophecy. In Order to this, here are two things to be considered: First, what the <hi>Messias</hi> was to suffer; And Secondly, The time when it should come to pass.</p>
               <p>First what He was to suffer, the Angel expressed in one Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is properly rendred, <hi>he shall be cut off.</hi> But as the Reader will find in the Explication of this Prophecy, it is to be cut off Judicially; either by Man's Judgement, or by the Judgement of God. The learned <hi>Iews</hi> will find that the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies so in fortie places of their Scripture; and it is never used otherwise in speaking of a Person, Affirmatively, as it is here in this Prophecy. Now as to our blessed Saviour's case, we are to shew that He was <hi>cut off</hi> Judicially both ways.</p>
               <p>First, he was so by the Judgement of God, in <hi>being made a Curse for us, Gal.</hi> III. 13. and that according to the Sentence of the Law; which saies, <hi>He that is Hanged is accursed of God. Deut.</hi> XXI. 23. The <hi>Iews</hi> know to whom they Apply this.</p>
               <p>Secondly to be cut off by Man's judgement, is, according to the usuall practice, to be taken, and Tried for one's Life; and being found guilty, to be condemned, and put to Death. And it must be to such a Death as the Law of the Land has prescribed for such a Crime; as Particularly in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for any one of Servile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was found guilty of any State Crime, by their Law he was to be <hi>Crucified.</hi> Much needs not be said to shew that this was our blessed Saviour's case.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as to the Time when the <hi>Messias</hi> was to suffer this, to be <hi>cut off Iudicially,</hi> The Angel foretold it should be <hi>after LXII. Weeks. Dan.</hi> IX. 26. And in the next verse before he saies, there should be <hi>VII. Weeks, and LXII. Weeks, from the going forth of the Commandement to build</hi> Jerusalem <hi>again, till the</hi> Messias <hi>the Prince.</hi> VII. Weeks and LXII. are LXIX. Weeks, that is, they are 483 years. And these are to be reckond from <hi>Nisan</hi> or soon after, in the 20th of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus.</hi> So that after the End of these 483. years, was to be the Death of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as is shewn in the Explication of this Prophecy. Now these 483 being such years as were generally known in the place and Age in which <hi>Daniel</hi> lived; Namely years of 360 days; let them begin from <hi>Nisan</hi> in the 20th year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that is, from <hi>April</hi> in the year 445. before <hi>Christ;</hi> they will end in <hi>May,</hi> or very little later, in the 32th year of the Vulgar <hi>Aera,</hi> as hath been already shewn in the first set of Tables. And therefore, it must be within the compass of a year after <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> 32, that the <hi>Messias</hi> was to dye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Prophecy: it must not be a whole Day after the LXII Weeks.</p>
               <p>How our blessed Saviour himself understood those Words, of his being <hi>cut off,</hi> will appear by many Instances in the Chronological account, which are referr'd to at the bottom of the Page. The first time we read of the <hi>Iews</hi> having determined to <note n="a" place="bottom">pag. xx.</note> kill Him, was upon his healing one on the Sabbath. <hi>Iohn</hi> V. 16, 18. That was at the Time of Passeover, in the 30th year of the Vulgar <hi>Aera.</hi> The next year in <hi>Galilee,</hi> for another such Sabbath-breach, as they called it, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> took Counsel to <note n="b" place="bottom">pag. xxj.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Him. <hi>Matt.</hi> XII. 14. But our Saviour, knowing their design, did only <hi>withdraw Himself,</hi> He made no Reflexion upon it till the <hi>Weeks</hi> were Expired. Then in the 32th year of the <hi>Vulgar Aera,</hi> our blessed Lord upbraided the <hi>Pharisees</hi> with their unbelief, <hi>not</hi>

                  <hi>discerning the signs of the Times. Matt.</hi> XVI. 3. Then He BEGAN to shew his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, what He was to suffer, and by whom, with all the particular Circumstances. The

                  <hi>Iews</hi> having so long rejected their <hi>Messias,</hi> because he did not come as they would have him, in worldly Pomp, God had therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing of that Great sin, in <hi>fulfilling all that which was written of Him. Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> XIII. 29. Therefore now our blessed Lord, plainly tells his Disciples, how every thing should happen as God had <note n="a" place="bottom">pag. xLiv.</note> 
                  <hi>determined, Luk.</hi> XXII. 22. and how <note n="b" place="bottom">pag. xxix.</note> 
                  <hi>all things that were written by the Prophets, should be accomplished. Luk.</hi> XVIII. 31.</p>
               <p>It was at three several times that our Saviour declared these things to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; without any great variation; only the latter Declarations were fuller &amp; clearer than the former. The first time was soon after the Expiring of the LXIX. Weeks <note n="c" place="bottom">pag. xxv.</note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> XVI. <hi>Mar.</hi> VIII. <hi>Luke.</hi> IX. 22. The second time was presently after his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration <note n="d" place="bottom">xxv.</note> 
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> XVII. <hi>Mar.</hi> IX. <hi>Luk.</hi> IX. 44. The third time was at his going up from <hi>Iericho</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">pag. xxix.</note> 
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> XX. <hi>Mar.</hi> X. <hi>Luk.</hi> XVIII.</p>
               <p>The things that He foretold at those several times, being here summed up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it may be observed that He spoke of every thing in the same Order in which it happen'd. Which shews that throughout the whole Course of his sufferings, He saw before him every step he was to make, even to the End of his Life: so truely He sayd, <hi>The Son of Man goeth, as it is written of him. Matt.</hi> XXVI. 24. In summing up the things that our Saviour foretold of himself, it shall be noted, for the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Work, in what page of the Chronological Account it may be found, when, and how, every thing was Fulfilled.</p>
               <p>First our Saviour told them <note n="f" place="bottom">pag. xxxj.</note> 
                  <hi>He must go up to Ierusalem.</hi> (He could not dye but in that place. <hi>Luk.</hi> XIII. 33.) There <hi>he must be betrayed into the Hands of Men,</hi> namely, <hi>to the Chief Priests and Scribes.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">pag. xxxvij.</note> bargained with them, and <note n="h" place="bottom">pag. Lij.</note> delivered Him to them.</p>
               <p>He foretold that he should <hi>suffer many things of the Elders, and Chief Priests, and Scribes;</hi> that is, of the whole <hi>Sanhedrin:</hi> and that they should <hi>Condemn him to Death.</hi> How he <hi>suffer'd</hi> in <hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s House, <note n="i" place="bottom">pag. Liv.</note> before the Meeting of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> &amp; how afterwards by the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">pag. Lvj.</note> at their Meeting, and how they <hi>condemned him,</hi> may be seen in the pages here quoted. It follows that they should <note n="l" place="bottom">pag. Lvij. Lviij. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>deliver him to the Gentiles,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had then the Power of Life and Death: and that he should be <hi>mockt by them,</hi> and <hi>spitefully intreated,</hi> that they should <note n="m" place="bottom">pag. Lxiij.</note> 
                  <hi>scourge him, and spitt upon him;</hi> and that being <note n="n" place="bottom">pag. Lxv.</note> 
                  <hi>rejected by the Elders, Chief Priests and Scribes,</hi> he should be <note n="o" place="bottom">pag. Lxviij. Lxix. Lxx.</note> 
                  <hi>killed:</hi> That must be by the <hi>Romans;</hi> So it follows, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should <hi>crucifie him.</hi> There is a Prediction after all these, that <hi>the third day he should rise again.</hi> But that is beyond our present purpose.</p>
               <p>We have seen how the chief Matter foretold in this Prophecy, namely that of the <hi>Messias</hi> being <hi>cut off,</hi> was Understood by our blessed Saviour; and how it was Fulfilled in his Person. We are next to consider the Time here prefixed for the fulfilling of it. The Time is expressed in these Words, viz. <hi>after those LXII Weeks;</hi> which, as the Words have been just now explained, must fall within the Year after <hi>May, Iune</hi> or <hi>Iuly</hi> in the 32d Year of the Vulgar <hi>Aera.</hi> We cannot but be greatly concern'd to know how our blessed Lord himself understood this. And it is our business to shew others, that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> by his being <hi>cut off</hi> at the time spoken of in this Prophecy.</p>
               <p>Our blessed Lord himself, as has been shewn in the next foregoing Discourse <note n="p" place="bottom">pag. xxiij.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that <hi>the LXII. Weeks</hi> were expired within some short time after the last Passeover before that on which he was to be Crucified. The Passeover now spoken of was on the 11th of <hi>April</hi> in the Year of our Lord. 32. For it was soon after this, that our blessed <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
