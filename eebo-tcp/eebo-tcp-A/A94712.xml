            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To undeceive the People of this Common-wealth.</head>
            <p>WHereas there hath been, and now are great multitudes of Bibles in 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
and in 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> and in 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi> (known to all Bookſellers by theſe Terms) prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond the Seas, and Imported hither to this Common-wealth; and theſe
Books being extreme falſe, as hath been found out by examination, and full
of Errors, inſomuch that heretofore they have been Suppreſſed, Seized, and
taken away in Quires and Bound, yet nevertheleſſe there is now great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
Binding and Bound up moſt ſurreptitiouſly, and the Bibles, not only
themſelves falſe and imperfect, and baſely printed, and counterfeit; but alſo
the binding of the ſaid Books be bound moſt baſely in Mutton Taffety, ſo
termed, but in plaine Termes, in Sheeps Leather, both Black and Red, under
the name of Spaniſh Leather and others: And alſo many guilded with Party
Gold, and not headbanded, nor truly ſowed on Slips, but on Packthread, and
five Sawes in the back, and but three ſlips to the ſaid ſawings; ſo that the
people that buy them be meerly cheated of their money, and couzened in the
Book and binding, and they cannot laſt to doe good ſervice; and they goe
under falſe Names: As for example, The Bible in 12 Numprill, going under
the name of Cambridge print by <hi>Roger Daniell,</hi> 1648, and with blacke Lines
round about, a counterfeit, is one of the eaſieſt to be known; and that and
many others being ſold in Tavernes, Alehouſes, Inns, and in the Countrey by
Hawkers, Pedlers, Running Mercuries and ſuch like, wherby many be much
couzened and deceived: Therfore this is thought fit to give notice, that all
beware of this deceit, and to take notice they be ſold at two ſhillings a Book
bound, or rather under; ſo that by that very price, and cheaper, they may be
deſcryed, and by the falſe Binding, which will be (God aſsiſting) remedyed
by the Parliament and State, and ſuch courſe taken, as the Common-wealth
may no longer be abuſed, in a very ſhort juncture of time: And of this we
wiſh all good people to take notice of.</p>
