            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Do I mourn in secret, to see so many divisions and subdivisions? and Church set up against Church, and Pastors against Pastors, in the same Parishes; and each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty labouring to disgrace the other and their way, that they may promote their own? I suppose you will say, You do

               </gap>o. Do I lament it as the Nations shame, that in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion men are of so many minds, and manage their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences so unpeaceably, that it is become the stumbling block to the ungodly, the grief of our friends, and the der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sion of our enemies? I know you will say, that this also is your lamentation. And is it not a wonder indeed, that such a misery should be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, which all men are against; and which cannot be continued but by our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choice? Is it not strange that we are so long without so great a blessing as <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> while all men say they love it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd desire it, and while we may have it if we will? But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48302:5"/>
the cause is evident: while men love <hi>Unity,</hi> they hate the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in which we must <hi>Unite:</hi> While they love <hi>Peace,</hi> they hate the necessary means by which it must be obtained and maintained: The way of Peace they have not known; or knowing it, they do abhor it. As well as they love <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> they love the <hi>Causes</hi> of discord and division much better. The drunkard, and whore-monger, and worldling say they love the salvation of their souls: But yet while they love and keep their sins, they will miss of the salvation which they say they love. And so while men love their <hi>ungodliness</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding</hi> wayes, we are little the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48302:6"/>
better for their love of <hi>peace.</hi> If men love <hi>Health,</hi> and yet love <hi>Poyson,</hi> and hate both me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and wholsom food, they may miss of health, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they love it.</p>
            <p>Where know you a Parish in <hi>England,</hi> that hath no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? In this Parish where I live, we have not several Congregations, nor are we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into such parties as in many other places; But we have here the great division: some are for Heaven, and some for Earth: some love a holy diligent life, and others hate it: some pray in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and teath them the word and fear of God, and others do not: some
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48302:6"/>
spend the Lords Day in holy exercises, and others spend much of it in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vanity: some take the service of God for their delight; and others are weary of it; and live in ignorance, because they will not be at the pains to learn. Some make it the principal care and business of their lives, to prepare for death, and make sure of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life; and others will venture their souls on the wrath of God, and cheat themselves by their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, rather then be at this sweet and necessary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be saved. Some hate sin, and make it their dayly work to root out the relicts of it from their hearts and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48302:7"/>
lives: and others love it and will not leave it, but hate those that reprove them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their salvation.</p>
            <p>And as long as this great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is unhealed, what other means can bring us to any happy Unity? It would make a mans heart bleed to consider of the folly of the ungodly rout, that think it would be a happy Union, if we could all agree to read one form of prayer, while some love, and others hate the holiness which they pray for: and if we could all agree to use the sign of the Cross in Baptism, while one half either understand not the Baptismall Covenant, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully violate it, and neglect, or hate, and scorn that mortified
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48302:7"/>
holy life, which by that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vow and Covenant they are engaged to. They are solicitous to bring us all to unity in the gesture of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, while some take Christ and life, and others take their own damnation. When they should first agree in being all the faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of one Master, they make a great matter of it, that the servants of Christ, and of the Devil may use the same bodily posture in that worship where their hearts are as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as spirit and flesh. Poor people think that it is the want of Uniformity in certain Ceremonies of mans inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is the cause of our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48302:8"/>
great divisions and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; When, alas, it is the want of unity in matters of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er consequence, even of Faith, and Love, and Holiness, as I have here shewed. If once we were all children of one Father, and living members of one Christ, and all renewed by one sanctifying Spirit, and aimed at one end, and walked by one Rule (the word of God,) and had that special Love to one another which Christ hath made the mark of his Disciples, this were an Agreement to be rejoyced in indeed, which would hold us together in the most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table relations, and assure us that we shall live together with Christ in everlasting
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48302:8"/>
blessedness. But, alas, if our Agreement be no better, then to sit together in the same seats, and say the same words, and use the same ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and Ceremonies, our <hi>hearts</hi> will be still distant from each other, our <hi>natures</hi> will be contrary, and the <hi>malignity</hi> of ungodly hearts will be break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out on all occasions. And as now you hear men scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the practice of that Religion which themselves profess, so if God prevent it not, you may shortly see ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War take off their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and let them loose, and then they will seek the blood of those that now they seem to be agreed with. At furthest we are sure, that very shortly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48302:9"/>
we shall be separated as far as Heaven and Hell, if there be not now a nearer agreement then in words and outward Shews and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>It being then past doubt, that there is no happy lasting Unity, but in the Spirit and a holy life, What hindereth us from so safe, so sweet, so sure a Peace? Why might not all our Parishes agree on such necessary, honourable and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable terms? Why is there in most places, but here and there a Person, or a Family, that will yield to the terms of an everlasting peace, &amp; live as men that believe they have a God to serve and please, and immortall souls to save or lose? Is not God willing that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48302:9"/>
all should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. and that all should agree in so safe a path? Why then doth he invite all, and tender them his saving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and send his messengers to command and importune them to this holy Concord? He would take them all into the bond of his Covenant: How oft would Christ have gathered all the Children of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to him, as the Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings? but it was they that <hi>would not, Mat.</hi> 23.37. He would have the Gospel preached to every creature, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. &amp; would have the Kingdoms of the world become the Kingdoms of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48302:10"/>
the Lord and of his Christ.</p>
            <p>What then is the cause of this sad division in our Parishes? Are Ministers unwilling that their people should all agree in holiness? No, it would be the greatest favor you could do them, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est joy that you could bring to their hearts: They would be gladder to see such a blessed Unity, then if you gave them all that you have in the world. O how a poor Minister would boast and glory of such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish! He would bless the day that ever he came among them; and that ever he was called to the Ministry; and that ever he was born into the world for their sakes. How easie would all his studies and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48302:10"/>
labours be, if they were but sweetned with such success? How easily could he bear his scorns, and threatnings, and abuses, and persecutions from others, if he saw but such a holy Unity among his people to encourage him? So far are your Teachers from exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you from this happiness, that it is the end of their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; preaching, &amp; prayers, yea and of their lives, to bring you to partake of it. And glad would they be to preach to you, and exhort you, in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, in all the contempt and derision of the world, if thereby they could but bring their parishes to agree in a life of faith and holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48302:11"/>And sure our difference is not because the godly will not admit you to joyn with them in the waies of God; For they cannot hinder you if they would; and they would not if they could.

We might all be united, and our divisions be healed, and God much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and Ministers and good Christians be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted, and the Church and Commonwealth be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and highly honoured, and themselves be saved from everlasting misery, if we could but get the hearty consent of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48302:12"/>
these foolish obstinate ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men.</p>
            <p>What say you, wretched Souls, can you deny it? How long have your Teachers been labouring in vain, to bring you to the hearty Love o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How long have they in vain been perswading the worldling from his worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and the Proud person to humility, and the sensual beast from his tipling, and gluttony, and other fleshly pleasures?</p>
            <p>And besides this, most of the disorders and divisions in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48302:12"/>
the Churches are caused by ungodly men. I will instance in a few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we ask any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diligent Ministers, either in <hi>London,</hi> or the Country, why they do not unanimously ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techize, instruct and confer with all the Inhabitants of their Parishes, man by man, to help them to try their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall state, and to prepare in health for death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? they usually answer us, that alas their people will not consent, but many would revile them if they should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we ask them why they do not set up the practice of Discipline, which they so unanimously plead for? and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48302:13"/>
why they do not call their people to Confirmation, or open profession of faith and holiness in order thereto; they tell us, that their people will not endure it; but many will rather set themselves against the Ministry, and strengthen the enemy that now endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth the Churches safety, or turn to any licentious Sect, then they will thus submit to the undoubted Ordinance of Christ, which the Churches are so commonly agreed in as a duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have an ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> too-imperfect version of the Psalms, which we sing in the Congregations; &amp; in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Divines that ever I spoke with about it (of what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48302:13"/>
side soever) it is our duty to use a better Version, and not to perform so excellent a part of the publick Worship, so lamely, and with so many blemishes. And if you ask the Ministers why they do not unanimously agree on a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed corrected Version, most of them will tell you, that their people will not bear it, but proudly and turbulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach them, as if they were changing the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In many places the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptism is ofter used in private houses, then in the publick Assemblies; and if we ask the reason of so great a disorder, the Ministers will tell us that it is the unruliness and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48302:14"/>
wilfulness of the people, that proudly set themselves above their Guides, and instead of obeying them, must rule them, and have their humors and conceits fulfilled, even in the holy things of God, or else they will revile the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and make divisions in the Church: And this is done by them that in other cases do seem sufficiently to reverence the place of publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly as the house of God, and that speak against private meetings, though but for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, repeating Sermons, or singing to the praise of God, while yet themselves are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent for such private meetings as are set up in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the publick, and that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48302:14"/>
for the administration of so great an Ordinance as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptism, and in cases where there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Too many more such instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I could give you, which shew who they be that are the enemies of our Unity; Even those that cry out against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions while they cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e them, and cry up Unity, concord and obedience, while they destroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48302:15"/>And shall we thus continue a division that doth prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our Everlasting division? Is there no Remedy for so great a misery, when yet our poor ungodly neighbours m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to be found in at the last?]</p>
            <p>One would think, if a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should treat thus with his Parishioners, and urge such a motion as this upon them, they should not have the hearts or faces, to deny, or delay such a necessary Agreement and Engagement, that would make their Parish and their souls so happy, and which nothing but the Devil and the befooled corrupted minds of sinners hath any thing to say against! And yet its likely we should either have such an answer as <hi>Elijah</hi> had, even silence, (v. 21. <hi>The people answered him not a word.</hi>) Or else some plausible promise, while we have them in a good mood, which would quickly be broken &amp; come to

nothing. For indeed, they are all engaged already, by their baptismall Covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity, to the very same thing: and yet we see how little they regard it.</p>
            <p>But yet because it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to use the means for the <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> of our people, and wait on God by prayer for the success, I have here shewed you the only way to both.

give over your damning, and dividing course, and yield to the Spirit of Christ, that would Unite you to his Body, and walk in Communion with his Saints: and let not these warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be hereafter a witness against you to your confusion, which are intended for your salvation, and the healing of our discords by</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seems that <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> are near kin, in that the world is so like affected to them both. As our <hi>Felicity</hi> is in <hi>God,</hi> and we lost it by falling from <hi>God</hi>; so our <hi>Vnity</hi> is in <hi>God,</hi> and we lost it by departing from this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Unity. And as all men have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48302:21"/>
still a natural desire after <hi>Felicity</hi> in <hi>general</hi>; but God who is their Felicity, they neither know nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; so have we still a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>it self</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but God who is our Unity, is little known or desired by the most. And as <hi>nature</hi> can perceive the evil of <hi>Misery</hi> which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Felicity,</hi> and cry out against it, and yet doth cherish the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>causes</hi> of it, and will not be perswaded to let them go: So <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can perceive the evil of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>Vnity,</hi> and cry out against it, and yet will not forbear the <hi>causes</hi> of Division. And therefore as we say of <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Nature</hi> by <hi>Philosophy seeks</hi> it, <hi>Divinity findeth</hi> it, and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion possesseth</hi> it: So may we say of true <hi>Vnity; Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Nature seeks</hi> it, <hi>Divinity findeth</hi> it, and <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Holiness possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> it. And as most of the world
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48302:21"/>
do miss of Felicity, for all their high esteem of it, and fall into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery for all their hatred of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they love not the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of Felicity, and hate not the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> of Misery. Even so most of the world do miss of <hi>Vnity,</hi> for all their high esteem of Unity, and fall into miserable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions and <hi>Divisions</hi> for all their hatred of Division, because they love not the <hi>center</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Vnity,</hi> and hate not the <hi>occasion</hi> and <hi>causes</hi> of Division. And as the very reason why the most are shut out of Happiness, is their own wilful refusing of the true matter and means of Happiness, and no one could undo them but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for all that they are loth to be undone: Even so the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the world attaineth not to Unity, is their own wilful refusing of the true <hi>Center</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of Unity; and it is themselves that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48302:22"/>
are the wilful causes of their own Divisions, even when they cry out against Divisions. And as there's no <hi>way</hi> to <hi>Happiness,</hi> but by <hi>Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>God</hi> from whom we fell, that in <hi>him</hi> we may be happy; and no way to <hi>God</hi> but by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as the Saviour, and the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly-Ghost</hi> as the Sanctifier; so there is no <hi>way</hi> to true <hi>Vnity,</hi> but by <hi>Turning</hi> to <hi>God</hi> that we may be one in him; and no way to <hi>him,</hi> but being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Christ,</hi> and being quickned by that One most holy Spirit that animateth his members. And yet as poor souls do weary themselves in vain, in <hi>seeking Felicity</hi> in their own wayes and devices; so do they deceive themselves in <hi>seeking Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in wayes that are quite destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Unity. One thinks we must be united in the Pope; and another, in a General Council; another saith, we shall never have Unity till the Magistrate force us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48302:22"/>
all one way; (and yet they would not be forced from their own way.) Another turns Atheist, or Infidel, or Impious, by observing the Divisions that be among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and saith, [It is this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and Religion, and Christ, that hath set the world together by the ears; and we shall never have Unity till we all live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature, and cast off their needless cares and fears of another life.] And thus the miserable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded world are groping in the dark after <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Felicity,</hi> while both are at hand, and they wickedly reject them; and many of them become so mad, as to run away from God, from Christ, from the Spirit, as if <hi>he</hi> were the cause of <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Division,</hi> who is the only Center of <hi>Felicity</hi> and <hi>Vnity.</hi> And thus as it is but <hi>Few</hi> that arrive at <hi>Happiness</hi> for all their <hi>desire</hi> of it; so it is but <hi>Few</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48302:23"/>
that attain to <hi>Vnity</hi>; to <hi>such</hi> a Unity as is worth the attaining to.</p>
            <p>I dare presume to take it for granted, that all you that hear me this day, would fain have Divisions taken away, and have Unity, and Concord, and Peace through the world. What say you? would you not have us all of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and of one Religion? and would you not fain have an Agreement, if it might be, through all the world? I am confident you would. But you little think that its you and such as you that are the hinderers of it. All the question is, What <hi>Mind</hi> that is that all should be <hi>One</hi> in? and what Religion that is that all men s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould agree in? Every man would have all men of <hi>one mind,</hi> and <hi>one Religion</hi>; but then it must be of <hi>his</hi> mind, and of <hi>his</hi> Religion; and so we are never the nearer an agreement,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48302:23"/>Well! what would you give now to be certainly told the only way to Unity and Agreement? There is but <hi>One</hi> way; when you have sought about as long as you will, you must come to that <hi>One</hi> way, or you will be never the nearer it. What would you give to know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, which is that <hi>One</hi> way! O that the world were but <hi>willing</hi> to know it, and to follow it when they know it. Well! I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you from the information of the Holy-Ghost here given us in this Text that now I have read to to you, to tell you the <hi>Only</hi> way to true Unity; and blessed is he that learneth it, and walketh in it.</p>
            <p>This Text is a <hi>Precept</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>work</hi> required of us, with its double Object; the one the means to the other. The next verse is an exposition of this. As the Natural man hath <hi>One Body,</hi> and <hi>One Soul,</hi> which constitute it a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48302:24"/>
man; so the Church which is the mystical Body of Christ, is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, consisting of many members united by <hi>One</hi> Spirit. Every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth or Political Body hath 1. Its <hi>Constitutive</hi> causes that give it its Being and its Unity; and 2. Its <hi>Administration</hi> and <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> causes, as Laws, Execution, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that exercise and preserve, and perfect its Being. The Constitutive cause is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and the Subject conjoyned in their Relation. So is it with the Church, which is a Political Body, (but of a transcendent kind of Policy.) The <hi>Constitutive</hi> Cause of the Church are <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>members</hi> united in <hi>One Spirit</hi>: And this is the <hi>final</hi> part of the Duty here required [<hi>To keep the Vnity of the Spirit</hi>] The <hi>Preserving</hi> cause is the Peaceable behaviour of the members: and this is the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Duty here required, [<hi>In the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48302:24"/>
bond of Peace</hi>] Our own <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> are hereto required; because as every natural body must by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drinking, and fit exercise and usage, be a cause of its own preservation, and not forbear these under pretence of trusting the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of God; and as every <hi>Political</hi> Body, must by <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> in case of need preserve themselves under God; so must the Body of Christ, the Church, be diligent in using their best <hi>endeavours</hi> to preserve the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well-being of the whole. So that you see here are two causes of the Churches Unity expressed: 1. The <hi>principal Constitutive</hi> cause in which our Unity consisteth; and that is [<hi>The Spirit.</hi>] 2. The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving</hi> cause, by which our Unity is cherished, and that is [<hi>Peace</hi>] which therefore is called [<hi>the bond</hi>] of it. The fifth and sixth verses do open this <hi>Vnity of Spirit,</hi> in its
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48302:25"/>
parts, effects and ends. [<hi>There is One Hope of our Calling</hi>] that is, One Heaven or Life Eternal, which is the end of our Christianity and Church Constitution [<hi>There is one Lord</hi>] Jesus Christ; One Head, one Saviour, one Soveraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to whom by this Spirit the members are all United. [<hi>There is One Faith</hi>] both one <hi>summe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctrine,</hi> which all that will be saved must believe (which was used to be professed by the adult at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism) and <hi>One</hi> internal saving Faith, which this Spirit causeth in our Spirits, and useth it as a means of our union with Christ in whom we do believe. [<hi>There is One Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism</hi>] or solemn Covenanting with God, the Father, Son and Holy-Ghost; and the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise there to be made by all. And [<hi>there is One God the Father of all</hi>] from whom we fell, and to whom we must be recovered, and who is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48302:25"/>
the End of all, and to whom Christ and all these means are the Way. So that all these are implyed in, and conjunct with [<hi>the Vnity of the Spirit.</hi>]</p>
            <p>The sense of the Text then briefly is this: [<hi>As all the living true members of Christ and the Church have one Spirit (and so one Faith) by which they are all united to Christ the Head, and so to the Father in and by him, which Vnion in One Spirit is your very Life, and it that constituteth you true members of Christ and his Church; so it must be your care and great endeavour to preserve this Spirit in you, and this vital Vnity which by this Spirit you have with Christ and one another: and the way to preserve it, is by the bond of Peace among your selves.</hi>] It is here evident then that all the members of Christ and his Body have <hi>One Spirit,</hi> and in that is their Union. All the question is, <hi>What
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48302:26"/>
Spirit</hi> this is? And that's left past all doubt in the Chapter: For though the <hi>common</hi> gifts of the Spirit are sometime called by that name, yet these are no further meant in the Text then as appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or additions to greater gifts: As godliness hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the common mercies of this life, as well as of the special mercies of the life to come; but yet with great difference; the later being <hi>absolutely</hi> promised, and the former but <hi>limitedly</hi> (so far as God sees best for us): Even so the Spirit gave to the members of the Church both Sanctifying Grace, and common Gifts; but with great difference: giving San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification to all and only the members of Christ; but giving common gifts also to some others, and to them but with limitation, for sort, and season, and measure, and continuance, as God should
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48302:26"/>
see good. It is then the same Holy-Ghost as our Sanctifier into whose name we are baptized, as wel as into the name of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ather and the Son, and in whom we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to believe, that is here meant in my Text. And it is only the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified that are the people United to Christ and to One another. This is proved expresly by that which fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well then; there's nothing plainer in the Scripture, then that all men by nature are departed from God, and none are United to him but those that are regenerate and made new creatures, not a man is his child by Grace, and in his favour, but only those that are sanctified by his Spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.

Sirs, I tell you, (and I may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently tell you when I have proved it so fully), that it is <hi>the ungodly that are the great Dividers of the world.</hi> Its you that <hi>make</hi> the breach, and <hi>keep</hi> it open.

                  </gap>ches set all on fire, and then cry out against others as the Authors of it.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48302:39"/>
As <hi>Nero</hi> set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and then persecuted the Christians for it, as if it had been done by them. They pluck up the Foundations, and hold most damnable practical errours; and when they have done, they go about reviling other men as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous. I speak not in the excuse or extenuation of other mens errours. I have spoke my part against them also: But I tell you, it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ignorant rabble, and all the ungodly, whether Gentlemen, Schollars, or of what rank soever, that are the great dividers, and stand at the greatest distance from Christian Unity. O what a happy Church should we have, for all the sects that trouble us so much, if it were not for ungodliness that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth some of those sects, and virtually containeth many more! Had we none but men fearing God to deal with, we should have no opposition to the Essentials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48302:40"/>
and we should still have the comfort of agreeing with them in all things necessary to salvation. They would carry on their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Christian meekness, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and moderation: and at the worst our Agreement would be greater then our disagreement. But when we have to deal with haters of holiness, or at least with men that are strangers to the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying work of the Spirit, we have predominant Pride, and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness, and Covetousness to strive against: We have radicated Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and enmity to God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, giving life and strength to all their errours, and making them stubborn, and wilful, and scornful, against the clearest truths that can be shewed them. There is no deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually with a carnal heart, for any but God himself. Unless we can create light in them, as well as reveal the truth to them, what
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48302:40"/>
good can we do them? What good doth the Sun to a man that is blind? They have understandings left, and therefore they can err: but they have no heavenly light in them, and therefore they cannot choose but err: They have wills, and therefore are capable of sin: but they have no holy rectitude of them, and therefore sin they will with obstinacy. When we dispute with the godly, that err through <hi>weakness,</hi> we deal with men that have eyes in their heads, and life in their souls, and some favour and experience of the matters of God. But when we dispute with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, we deal with the blind, we talk to the dead, we offer the bread of life to men that have no appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or savour of it: yea we speak for God, to enemies of God; and for truth, to the natural enemies of such truths; and the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate enemies, because they know
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48302:41"/>
it not. Had we nothing but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to argue against, and had we but to do with men that have the free use of their reason, we should do well enough with them. But when we must perswade the deaf, the distracted and the dead; when we must dispute with Pride, and Passion, and Enmity, and perswade a Lyon to become a Lamb, and a Serpent to lay by his venom, no wonder if we find a difficult task of it. Had we none but the <hi>Godly</hi> to deal with, we should have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>advantage</hi> for success; we should deal with men that Love the truth, and are willing to use right means to discover it: They would pray with us for truth, as well as dispute; they would with meekness search the Scripture, and see whether these things be so or not: They would yield to light when it appeareth to them, and not in prison it in unrighteousness.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48302:41"/>
And it would move us to more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dealing with them, while we see and love Christ in them, and when we remember that the men that we now dispute with, we must live with in Heaven, and join with in the everlasting Praises of the Lord. I profess Sirs, I speak to you from sad experience, I have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Antinomians, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, and other errours in well-meaning men, as much as most: And many a daies work they have made me in writing and disputing against them. But alas, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the trouble that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, ungodly do put me to. I thank God, I have dealt with all these errours with so good success, that I live in peace by them; and I know not of an Anabaptist, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian, or Arminian, or Quaker, or Separatist, or any such sect in the Town where I live; except half a dozen Papists that never heard me
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48302:42"/>
But Infidels, Atheists, ungodly wretches I am pestered with still One heresie called Drunkenness that denyeth the use of reason it self, doth still walk the streets in despight of all that I can say, or all that the Magistrates will do; and none of us all are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. In one hours time they will fetch more arguments from the Alehouse, then all the reason in the Town can effectually answer.</p>
               <p>And as the ungodly are most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately <hi>principled</hi> of any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in the world, both for the quality and the radication of their errours, so there are far greater <hi>numbers</hi> of them, then of all other Heresies set together. It may be we have one or two Anabaptists in a Parish, and in some Parishes none; in some few it may be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But O that I could say, I had not twenty, and twenty, and twenty, and twice twenty more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48302:42"/>
unsanctified ungodly persons in my Parish! though I hope there is as many better, as in any Parish I know. Alas, Sirs, into how many Parishes may you go, and find gross ignorance, profaneness, worldliness, contempt of God and heavenly things, to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air which they breath in, and the natural complexion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as blackness is to Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians. It is a blessed Parish, that of three thousand inhabitants, hath not above two thousand natural hereticks; even ungodly persons that are strangers to sanctification. And who then do you think is likest to be the cause of our distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and divisions?</p>
               <p>Moreover, let me tell you, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness and Ungodliness is not a single errour or heresie; but it is the summe of all the heresies in the world. You will think this strange, when you see so many that joyn
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48302:43"/>
with us in a sound profession, and some of them zealous defenders of the truth; and many of them cry out against errours: But alas, they believe not that which they think they do believe. They hold not that which they say they hold. There's much in their Creed, that was never in their Belief. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less ungodliness is the nest of all the Heresies in the world.</p>
               <p>Will you give me leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in some particulars. The greatest errour in the world is Atheism, when men deny the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it self. And do not the most of the ungodly deny him in their hearts? If he be not Just, he is not God: and they deny and hate his Justice: If he be not Holy, he is not God: and they deny in their hearts, and hate his Holiness: If he be not True, he is not God: And they commonly believe that he is not true: shew them where he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48302:43"/>
hath said, that none but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the sanctified, the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the heavenly, the self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be saved; and they will not believe that this will be made good, but hope its false. If he be not wise, and be not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world, he is not God. And these wretches qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rel with his holy Laws, as if they could tell how to mend them themselves, and were wiser to make a Law then God is; and by flat Rebellion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Government. So that we may truly say with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 14. that these fools say in their hearts that there is no God: or else they durst not say and do in his presence as they do.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is the setting up of false Gods, is a most abominable damning sin. And every ungodly man is guilty of it. Covetousness is idolatry, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. and the sensual make their belly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48302:44"/>
their God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. And Pride and Selfishness which are the heart of the old man, are nothing else but making our selves our Idols. Every unsanctified man is his own Idol; giving to himself the honour, and pleasure, and love thats due to God alone; and setting up his own will instead of Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polutheism,</hi> which is the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Gods, is a most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errour: And how many Gods have all that are ungodly? No man departeth from the one true God, but he makes to himself many false Gods in his stead. His wealth, and his credit, and his throat, and his recreation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>To <hi>set up a false Christ,</hi> is one of the most damning sins in the world. And what else do all the ungodly, that place their hopes for pardon and salvation, either in their own good works, or carna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some Hereticks have denyed some parts of the Scripture, and Infidels deny it all. And what less do all ungodly men, that believe it not heartily, and will not obey it, but deny it in parts, and refuse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it? They will not be so holy, not they, let Scripture say what it will. Are not all the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Scripture? Many a

time have I heard them, when the times more encouraged them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding the Bible, and those that did but carry a Bible, or speak of the Scripture, or read it in their houses. Certainly, he that fights against Scripture in his life, is more against it, then he that only denies it with his tongue.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks denyed <hi>Original sin,</hi> and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified mans Nature: And so doth profaness in a very great measure.

                  </hi> and <hi>Gnosticks</hi> of old, did hold that men might do any outward action, when there is no other way to escape suffering, as long as they keep their hearts to God. So think the ungodly, as appeareth by their practice: Before they will lose their

               <p>Alas, the particular sects among us, do play a small game in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the ungodly; and hold but petty errours to theirs: <hi>One</hi> sect is against <hi>one</hi> Ordinance, and <hi>another</hi> sect is against <hi>another</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; but the ungodly are against <hi>all.</hi> The Sectaries are against something in the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>out-side</hi> of the work: but the ungodly are against the <hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> and substance of the duty it self: One sect depraveth the doctrine of Faith; and another the doctrine of Repentance, and another the doctrine of Obedience: But the ungodly deprave all the doctrine

of Godliness; yea <hi>deny</hi> it, and not only <hi>deprave</hi> it: They sweep away all before them, and go by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale: They stand not to speak as other Hereticks, against this Grace or that Grace, but against all: It is Godliness it self that the ungodly are against.</p>

believing, and by it they think to be saved. They believe that God will save them, and therefore they think they are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>The Antinomians say, that no man should be discouraged from such a belief by any sin whatsoever. And this the ungodly hold and practice. The Antinomians hold that no man should stay for any Evidences of Grace in himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thus believe that he is a child of God, and Justified. And this the ungodly hold and practice. They believe and hope they are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and shall be saved, when they have not a word of proof for their hopes, nor any reason why <hi>they</hi> should be saved more then the rest of the world that will be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Only they <hi>believe</hi> it and <hi>hope</hi> it, and that they think shall serve the turn.</p>
               <p>The Antinomians are against
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48302:51"/>
Repenting and Grieving for sin, and Confessing it, as a means of pardon. And I am sure the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are practically against it. Repent, and mourn, and turn from sin, they will not; nor confess any more but what they know not how to deny; but as much as they can they will hide it, excuse it and defend it.</p>
               <p>The Antinomians would not have one of their believers, if he fall into the grossest sins, to make the least question of his pardon and Justified state for that. And so is it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h the ungodly: They will confess, when they swear, or are drunk, that they sin (because they cannot deny it:) but they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48302:51"/>The Pelagians say that the will of man is so free, that he can turn and become a new creature at any time. And if this were not the Opinion of the ungodly, how could they put off Conversion, and say, Its time enough hereafter? but that it seems they think they can turn at any time, as if they had the Spirit and Grace of God at their command.</p>
               <p>And yet they hold the contrary to this. (And this is no wonder: for there is a very Babel of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the soul of the unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.) The Antinomians say, that man can do nothing to his own conversion, but is meerly passive: if God have Justified him before he was born, he shall be a Justified person; and if God will give him grace, well and good; if not, he cannot help it. Just so say many of the ungodly: {If we are elected we shall be saved: If not, let us
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48302:52"/>
do what we can, we cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: if God will not give us grace, we cannot have it; and if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish what remedy?] As if God did deny his Grace to any of you, but those that forfeit it by wilful sin? Or as if your wilful resisting of it were no fault or forfeiture: Or as if God did predestinate any besides the sanctified to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Abundance more such Heresies I might reckon up, that are all comprized in ungodliness. Some Infidels question the immortality of the Soul: And so do many of the ungodly: I have heard some of them flatly deny it: and others of them do not well believe it.</p>
               <p>Some Infidels question whether there be any Hell. And so do the ungodly in their hearts, or else they durst never so boldly venture on it, and so merrily live in the sudden danger of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48302:52"/>Some Infidels question the Joyes of Heaven. And if the ungodly did not so in their hearts, they would not think an holy life too much ado to get it, nor would they part with it for the pleasure of a filthy sin.</p>
               <p>There is never an Article of the Creed but some Heretick or other doth oppose it: And the ungodly are against them altogether, even while they profess to believe them all.</p>
               <p>There is never a one of the ten Commandments, but ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is against it. There is never a Petition in the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but ungodliness is against it; for all that they are content to use the words. Instead of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the name of God, they dishonour it, and instead of living to the Glory of God, they seek themselves and their own honour. The Kingdom of Christ they are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48302:53"/>
enemies to: In the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, they love not his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In their hearts within, they will not endure it: and the coming of his <hi>glorious</hi> Kingdom they are afraid of. Instead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, they quarrel with it, and murmur at it, and disobey it, and do their own wills, and would have God do their wills too, and have all others do them. Instead of being content with daily bread to fit them for Gods service, they drown themselves in pleasures, or in worldly cares to make provision to satisfie their flesh. Instead of valuing and accepting the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin, as purchased by Christ, and offered in the Gospel, they have slight apprehensions of so great a mercy, and refuse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it as too hard, and run deeper into debt, and wilfully sin more. Instead of avoiding Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that they are against every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in the Lords Prayer, though they use the words.</p>
               <p>They are also against every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and lick up the vomit of all sects that do oppose them. One sect is against the Lords day: and so are the ungodly against the sanctifying of it, and spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in holy worship, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves thereon in God. Else what need so many Acts to restrain them from sports and other profanation of it? And all will not do.</p>

               <p>The Separatists will withdraw themselves from our Churches and Gods Ordinances, if things be not suited to their mind. And so will many of the ungodly. Most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in <hi>England,</hi> that I hear of, where any kind of Discipline is

               <p>Another sect of late will not sing <hi>Davids Psalms</hi>: And the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly will not do it heartily and reverently, but only with the voice.</p>
               <p>Another sect (the Anabaptists) are against Baptizing Infants. And

the ungodly do not holily and heartily devote themselves and their infants to God: they do not themselves renounce the world, the flesh and the devil, and take God for their God, and Christ for their Saviour, to heal and rule them, and the Holy-Ghost for their Sanctifier to make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and how then can they do this for their children, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse themselves?

               <p>Another late sect will not Pray morning and evening in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, nor crave Gods blessing on their meat, nor teach children and servants the duties of Religion; And so is it with the ungodly:

Yea beside all that the sects aforesaid hold, they have many damning heresies of their own. These deadly hereticks hold, that the world is rather to be sought then everlasting Glory; that the pleasure of sin is to be chosen before the Holiness of the Saints: that their flesh is to be pleased before God; that its bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter venture on their beloved sins, and keep them yet a little long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48302:57"/>
the Separatist hath a wound; but the common ungodly multitude have the leprosie, and plague-sores from top to toe.</p>
               <p>Profaneness is a hodge-podge and gally-mawfry of all the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the world in one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many other hereticks do err but in <hi>Speculation,</hi> and only the <hi>brain</hi> is infected, and they do not at the <hi>heart digest</hi> their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes. But the Heresies of the Profane ungodly people are <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical,</hi> and have mastered the will: the Poyson is working in the heart and vital parts; so that it is far the more mortal for this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many sects at least do not Practise their errours; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly live upon them. Yea their lives are worse then their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they say bad, and do worse. You may <hi>see</hi> more Heresie, then you can <hi>hear</hi> from them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some erring persons have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48302:58"/>
the substance of Christian truth mixt with their errour, by which the power of the venom is abated, and they do good in the Church as well as hurt: But the ungodly do not savingly, heartily and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally hold fast any the most funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some sects are <hi>meek and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> in their way. But the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are carried on with <hi>fury and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> against the whole body of the Holy Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>And now I beseech you, judge impartially who they be that are the deadly and dangerous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: and who are the hinderers of Unity in the Church.

this and that, is as if we should hear a <hi>Blackamore</hi> scorn one for a spot on his face; or a murderer rebuke a man for an angry word; or a Souldier that kills as many as he can, cry out of the Surgeons for curing no more, or blame others for a foul word; or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon whore reproach another for a wanton word, or uncomely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Or as if a mad man should revile men for every slip he findeth in their speeches, and call them fools. O that we knew how to cast out this master Devil of <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness!</hi> this Beelzebub the Prince of Devils! and then I should not fear the rest; no not all the sects and errours in the world that are found with true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Yet still remember these two cautions: 1. I do not excuse the errours of the best: and I lament that they have lamentably wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48302:59"/>
the Church, and in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects they have the greatest ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations. 2. And I still confess that some of the unsanctified are so civil and Orthodox, as to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry usefull in the Church, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full against sects and heresies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are right in the brain as to speculation, and right in the tongue; and their errour is kept buryed deep in the heart, and therefore they err more to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then to others. I doubt not but many such are profitable Preachers and defenders of the truth; and the Church must be thankfull to God for their gifts. And yet all that I have affirmed standeth good, that Ungodliness is the transcendent Heresie and Schism.</p>

               <p>BY what hath been said you may easily perceive, how little cause the Papists, or Ceremonious, or any others, have to glory in such members of their Churches as I have described.

he professed. Do not say I speak censoriously or uncharitably in this; for I think upon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Papists will confess it: For they teach that all that be not of their Church are void of charity, and cannot so be saved: and that all must therefore come into their Church, because there is no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Salvation without it. Though this be false, yet you see by it that they confess that never any but graceless unsanctified Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants did turn to them: Nor can they invite any to them but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly people. And who ever turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Papist, doth thereby confess that he was ungodly before, and that he was not an honest godly man. For in turning Papist, he professeth to go into that Church out of which there is no salvation, and consequently no Charity or saving grace. And if indeed you desire none but the ungodly to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48302:61"/>
turn to you, take them if they will needs go, and try whether you can do any more good on them then we have done. I think we have little cause (but for their own sakes) to lament our loss of such as these: and that you have little cause to glory in your Proselites. And I have yet seen none that shew us any more Holiness since their change, then they had before. A fair Church you have, that is the common stie for all that will come to you; and that is glad of any to make up the number, that you may have that in quantity, that is wanting in quality.</p>

               <p>FRom hence also let Quakers, and Papists, and all reproachers of our Churches take notice, how groundlesly they hit us in the teeth with the ungodly that live among us.

These are the <hi>obstinate despisers</hi> of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; that instead of learning of us, do revile us; and instead of obeying our doctrine, do make a mock at it. If they are any of them brought to a sound confession, and restrained from any vice, they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48302:62"/>
may thank the doctrine which we preach for that (unless they do it only for fear of the Laws.) But their profaneness is it that we have endeavoured to cure them of, and cannot; for they are obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Quakers</hi> accuse our Doctrine as dead and weak, because it cannot cure all our hearers; What forgetful dotards are they that observe not how they condemn themselves? Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> or <hi>Papists</hi> change <hi>us all</hi> to their opinions by their books or preaching? Beyond Sea they are fain to keep men in their Church by fire and sword for fear of losing them: and here, it is but here and there an ignorant ungodly wretch, or a proud raw novice, that turns to them.</p>
               <p>You may therefore as well hit us in the teeth with your selves that revile us and say, [<hi>We are the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48302:62"/>
fruit of your Ministry</hi>] as with the ungodly, and tell us that [they are the fruit] of our Ministry. For though they live among us, they are not of us. And we teach men no more to be ungodly, then to be Quakers or Papists. If you say, that they are in our Churches; I answer, where Discipline is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, the most of them are out; and the rest we weed up as fast as they so discover themselves, that we may do it without danger of pulling up the Wheat with them. Many of us reject them by Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: and all of us rebuke and disown them by doctrine. If Jews and Heathens were among us, we could not preach more against them, then we do against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; nor could we labour harder to cure them. Tell <hi>us</hi> not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them: they are none of <hi>ours</hi>: they disown us, and we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them: They are our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48302:63"/>
as you are, that hate us when we have done our best for them, and love us least when we love them most; and cast back all our instructions in our faces, or cast it behind their backs, and tread it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet. They are those against whom we shake off the dust of our feet: They are not our Disciples; but such as refuse to be Christs own Disciples.</p>
               <p>Nay I wonder that Papists and Quakers do not to their shame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that it is like to be some evil Spirit that sets them a work to rail against us; seeing all the <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Whore-mongers,</hi> and covetous wretches, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly malicious people in our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes be of their mind, and rail against us as they do: Its like to be the <hi>same cause</hi> that hath the <hi>same effect.</hi> If it be the Devil that sets the Profane to rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O Sirs, if you were but all truly willing to search out the business, and to be ruled by God and reason, we should soon be agreed, for all our differences. And how happy would this be for the troubled Church? How happy for the offended distracted world? how happy for your own souls? Well! what terms shall we agree

upon? Some body must begin the motion; sitting still will not heal us. I will make a motion that never a man of you that hath the face of a Christian, can tell what justly to accept against. Let us set the <hi>Word of God before us,</hi> and take the best helps on both sides to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, and let this decide the case with us: What say you? will you stand to <hi>the Word of God?</hi> Shall we app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if any of you have catcht the Popish perversness, and say [The Scripture is dark, and a dead letter; every sect pleads Scripture for their way; this will not serve our turn; we must have a living Judge] I answer such a one as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. 1. Is the Scripture the Law of God or not? If you say <hi>Not,</hi> you may as well say you are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48302:66"/>
Infidels. If you confess <hi>it is,</hi> then it must have the <hi>use of</hi> a Law. And, 2. Must not subjects understand a Law to live by it, though they be not Judges? And when estate and life depends on our obedience to the Law; if this Law now be so dark that the subjects cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, then it is no Law, as not being capable of the use and ends of a Law. And so if our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or damnation lye on our obedience to Gods Word and Law, its an intolerable reproach to God and it, to say it is such as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand. 3. Must we not be judged by this Law? Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly we must. And then should we not measure our Causes by it now? 4. May not Arbitrators make use of a Law to decide a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, before it come to the Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e? Doubtless they may. 5. What Judge would you have? There are but two in the world that pretend
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48302:66"/>
to be the Universal Infallible Judge of controversies: and that is <hi>the Pope, and a General Council.</hi> For a <hi>General Council,</hi> there is none now in the world, nor like to be to the end of the world: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid we should defer our Peace till then. And its Decrees are as dark, and much more uncertain then the Word of God. And for the <hi>Pope,</hi> he is Head of a sect or party, and therefore not fit to be judge: you may well know he will judge on his own side. He must be judged by this Word of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He is too far off, of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, for us to go or send to. Where <hi>Rome</hi> is, the most of you know not: A shorter journey may better dispatch our work. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselves tell us that many Popes have been Murderers, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, Simonists, perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and some Hereticks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. And must such as these be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48302:67"/>
our <hi>only</hi> Judges? They have erred oft already, and therefore they may deceive us: And if you send for the Popes Sentence, you must take the Messengers word that he was there, and that its true.</p>
               <p>But yet if all this will not serve turn, I will make a motion that none can gainsay that hath the face of a Christian. <hi>Let us first agree in all those points that Papists and Protestants, Calvinists and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, Arminians and Anabaptists, and Seperatists, and all parties that deserve to be called Christians, are agreed in!</hi> What say you, is not this a reasonable motion! O happy you, and happy the places where you live, if you would but stand to it!</p>
               <p>And let us consider of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first in the General state of our difference, and then in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts of it!</p>
               <p>Truly Sirs, the main difference
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48302:67"/>
in this world is between the <hi>Godly</hi> and the <hi>Vngodly</hi>; and all other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are not parts of this, are nothing to this, being of lesser danger, and easier toleration or cure. The whole world is divided into two Armies: Christ is the Captain General of one, and the Saints only his true Souldiers, and the seeming Saints his seeming Souldiers: The Devil is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the other, and all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate or ungodly are his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.

Can there be such cruelty in any but the Devils, as to wish all the world to be damned with you for company, or to Agree with you on such terms, that you may go hand in hand together to damnation!

The Question now that we are treating about, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall all agree together to be godly? Do you not believe it to be best and necessary? If not, you are blind: If you do, let us agree on it without delay. You tell us with many great complaints of the many differences and divisions that are among us: but shall we Agree so far as we are agreed? that is, shall we agree in heart and practice, so far as we are agreed in opinion and profession? O that you would make a solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that you will but Consent and go along with the Godly so far as you confess you ought to do; and would but Unite with us in faithfulness to the truths which you cannot deny.

               <p n="1">1. Consider I pray you, that if you will not agree with us in the things that you make profession of, and confess to be your duty, you are then treacherous and false to God, and to your selves, and therefore not fit for any to make Agreement with, till you change your minds. Do you know that

God is best, and yet will you not Love him better then the world? Do you know that Heaven is the only happiness, and yet will you not seek it more then earth? Do you know that an holy life is best, and yet will you be unholy? Do you know sin is the worst and most dangerous thing in the world, and yet will you not let it go? Who will trust such men as you, that will go against their own knowledge and confessions? If you will be false to God, and false to your own souls, no wonder if you be false to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover all your pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed desires of Unity and Concord are base <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> as long as you refuse to Unite with us in the way and state of holiness: To take on you that you are troubled at the Divisions of the world, and to wish that we were all of one Religion, and to talk against sects and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

To hear these ungodly men talk against sects and divisions in the Church, is as if we heard a man that hath the leprosie cry out against those that have the itch, or a murderer childe another for foul words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I must tell you while you remain ungodly, you are the great Hereticks and Separatists that

trouble the Church of God, more then abundance of those that you reproach. I excuse not the least; but none of them are like you: As death is worse then sickness, as being that which all sickness tends to, and the worst that it can do; so Ungodliness is worse then sects and particular Errours or Heresies, it being the worst that any errour can do, to make a man ungodly. There are no such Separatists in the world as you. It is not only from a <hi>particular Church</hi> or <hi>Ordinance</hi> that you separate, but as I said even now, you separate from God that made you, from Christ that bought you, from the Spirit that should sanctifie you, from the Word of God that must Rule you or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, from the body of Christ, and the holy Communion of his people. The Church would have you joyn with them in holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and your godly neighbours

would have you joyn with them in prayer and holy lives, and you will not, but separate from them all.

               <p>But perhaps you will say, [<hi>Why are they not then more fully agreed?</hi>] I answer, 1. Because there are
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48302:111"/>
such a multitude of ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons among them, that hinder them from opportunities and advantages for agreement. And many of these ungodly ones are hypocrites, that take on them to be godly, and so are traytors in our bosoms, and hinder peace the more by seeming to be godly when they are not. 2. Because of the remnant of sin that is yet in the sanctified, and because they are not yet perfect, and in Heaven. If they had no sin, they would have no divisions: And as their sin is healed as to the dominion of it, but not perfectly till they come to heaven; so their divisions are healed in the main, but not perfectly till they are perfectly United to God in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

I am not so unacquainted with the power of sin, and the subtilty of the Devil, and the wilfulness of blind unsanctified men, and the ordinary course of Providence in this work, as to cherish any hopes that All the Town and Parish should Consent. If many or any more do, I shall be glad. But <hi>plurima quaeras, ut pauca feras:</hi> An high motion when reasonable, may be serviceable to lower hopes. By what I have here said, you may see how little hope there is that ever the Church

should have any such Peace on earth as we desire. If unho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But for your own parts, be sure among your selves to maintain the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. Love the Brother-hood, even Saints as Saints. And because you are not the searchers of the heart, proceed according to the Word of God. Let all that Profess themselves a sanctified people, and live so as that you cannot certainly disprove their profession, be used as Saints by you, and leave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgement to God.

               <p>Object. <hi>BVt may not a Profession of the same Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a sufficient Vnity among us, though all be not Saints, and saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerate? Let us first be of one Religion, and then we may come to be sincere in the Practice of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by Degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. For the Churches sake, we are thankful to God, when we see a common concord in Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though most are false in and to the Religion which they profess. Many wayes God doth good to his Church by unfound Professors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Professing the same Faith doth somewhat tye their hands from persecuting it. And of the two, we can better bear Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites then Persecutors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it somewhat tyeth their tongues from reproaching the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48302:120"/>
Faith, and arguing against it, and seducing others from it. And of the two, it would be more hurtful to the Church to have these men open enemies to the truth, and bend their wits and tongues against it, and to have the multitude as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting their neighbours with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and cavils against Religion, then to have them falsly pretend to be Religious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it is a great mercy to the Church, hereby to have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of these mens common parts and interests. When they profess the same Religion with us, though unsoundly, yet it engageth them to stand for the Religion which they profess; and their illumination and conviction may lead them to do much service for the truth. By this means many hands are at work to build up the Church of Christ. And by this means the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faithful Christians are preserved
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48302:121"/>
and their estates much spared. Many have skill in building, that are not true heirs of the house which they build. Many have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts for preaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture, by which the Church may be edified, and the Truth defended against the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, when yet the same men may themselves be destitute of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this truth. The Church hath great cause to be thankful to God for the gifts of many an unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man: Had the Church been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stry and Gifts of all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n except Saints, it would have been confined to a narrower room, and many a soul might have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n unconv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rted, that have been called by the Ministry of unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men. By some such did God work Miracles themselves for the confirmation of the Christian Faith. And in times of war, if the Church had none but Saints to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48302:121"/>
fight for them, it could not stand without a continued Miracle. And if we had not the daily help of others in civil and secular affairs, we should find by the miss of it, what a mercy we undervalued. Were every unregenerate man an open enemy to the Church, we should live as Patridges and such other birds, that must hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from every Passenger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, this Profession of Hypocrites doth much restrain them from many a sin, by which God would be much dishonoured, and the Church more wronged, and the godly more grieved, and the open enemies more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And also it is some honour to the Gospel in the eyes of men, to have a multitude of Professors. Should Christs visible Church be as narrow as the mystical, and should none be Professors of the Faith,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48302:122"/>
but those few that are sanctified Believers, the paucity of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and narrowness of the Church, would be a dishonour to Christ in the eyes of the world, and would hinder the Conversion of many a soul.</p>
               <p>All this I have said, that you may see that we do not despise a Unity in Profession: and that we are not of those that would have all hypocrites and common profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors shut out: Yea that we take our selves bound to be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for the mercy, which he vouchsafeth us by the gifts, and favour, and help, and interest of many such Professors. And such a Unity of Profession we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to our power heartily to promote, as knowing that the Church as visible consisteth of such professours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet for all this, I must come closer to your objection, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48302:122"/>
tell you, that this <hi>Vnity of meer Profession</hi> is <hi>comparatively</hi> so poor a kind of Unity, that this will not, this must not satisfie us and serve the turn, which I desire you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in these discoveries.</p>

This Unity in meer Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>properly no Christian Vnity,</hi> because you are not <hi>properly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> If this be all, it is but in the bark and shell that we are agreed: It is but a <hi>seeming</hi> agreement, from the <hi>teeth</hi> outward: but not an <hi>hearty</hi> agreement to be <hi>Christians.</hi> What! shall we all agree to <hi>say we are Christians?</hi> when with most it <hi>is not so:</hi> For all this Agreement, <hi>you</hi> will still have <hi>one</hi> Father, and <hi>we another.</hi> You will not be United with us in Christ the Head: you will not have the same Holy Spirit, who is the Life of the New crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: You will be contrary to us in Nature or Disposition.

Your very Hearts and ours will still be contrary: You will love the sin that we hate and set our selves against; and you will dis-relish that Holy Heavenly life, which must be our business and delight. Your Affections will go one way, and ours another. You will Live by sense, when we must live by faith; and you will be laying up a treasure
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48302:123"/>
on earth, when we are laying up a treasure in heaven: You will be asking counsel of flesh and blood, when we must advise with God and his holy Word. You will look first to your bodies, when we must look first and principally to our souls. It will be your business to feed those sins, which it is our daily work to kill. You will make and apprehend it to be your Interest to go contrary to us: And what Agreement can there be, where there are contrary Interests? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all your outward Profession, you will still retain a secret enmity and hatred to the life of holiness: and will not have that hearty Love to the Saints, as beseems all those that are members of Christ, and of the holy Catholick Church. So that when you have Communion with the Saints, it will be but an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and superficial communion in some common things; but you
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48302:124"/>
will have no Communion with them in the same Head, and Spirit, and Promise, and Holy Nature, and saving Benefits of the Gospel. And shall this be called <hi>Vnity,</hi> that leaveth you at so sad a distance as this? This is but such a Union as a wooden leg hath to the body; or as the vessels of honour and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour have by being in the same house together. In their highest Professions, the Lord himself saith of unsanctified Professors, that they <hi>are none of Christs, Rom.</hi> 8.9. and that <hi>they cannot be his Disciples, Luke</hi> 14.33. that they <hi>are not Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, though of Israel, nor are they children of God, nor the seed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. and when they plead their highest Priviledges, at last, Christ will tell them that he <hi>knoweth them not, Mat.</hi> 7.23. &amp; 25.12. <hi>Psalm</hi> 1.5, 6. And if in mercy to the Church God cause the Lyon and the Lambs to lie
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48302:124"/>
down together, yet will he not therefore mistake the Lyon for a Lamb. So that you see what a poor kind of Unity, and next to none it is that meer profession maketh. And therefore this will not serve our turn.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, if we have no other Unity, we are <hi>unlike to live in Peace together.</hi> Though it be our duty to endeavour to have peace with all men, yet we can have but little hope of it. As long as there is so much difference and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety as I have mentioned; and as long as there is a secret enmity at the heart, it will be working into dissention, if God for the sake of his Church restrain it not. The godly will be crossing your carnal Interest, and hindering you in the sinful wayes of your commodity, pleasure or vain-glory! They will be calling you to self-denyal, which you cannot endure: and putting
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48302:125"/>
you upon duties of Holiness, Righteousness and Mercy, which your sinful flesh will utterly refuse. If you are scandalous, you will be called to Confession, Repentance, and Reformation, or by Church-censures be cut off from them to your shame: And the Magistrate also must trouble you by the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Law. The very exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a strict and holy living, which are given you by the godly, will displease you, because they are so unlike to your lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witness against your negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ungodliness. So that it is not possible that we should avoid offending you; for our very obedience to God will offend you, and our studying and following the Holy Scripture will offend you, and our diligent labour to save our souls will offend you; and our hateing and avoiding the Poyson of sin will offend you. And how then
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48302:125"/>
should we live in Peace with such? If you yoak a swine and a sheep together, one will be drawing to the wash-tub, when the other would be at grass: and one will be drawing to lie down in the mire, when the other would lie clean: one will be rooting in the earth, and eating dung, which the others nature is against. It is Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, that calleth the wicked by the name of <hi>swine,</hi> and the godly <hi>sheep:</hi> And if you will come no nearer us then this, we are like to have but poor Agreement.</p>
               <p>And as our wayes will displease you, so your galled malicious hearts will manifest the offence, and will be girding, and maligning, if not slandering, deriding, or openly persecuting, as far as you have power, those that thus offend you. And what Unity is this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Reason perswade you not, do but ask experience it self, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48302:126"/>
in all ages, men that Profess the same Religion with zealous godly men, have not been their persecutors, and oft-times more cruel then Infidels themselves? The Arrians that called themselves Christians, were as cruel to the true Believers as the Heathens. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists profess the same Christianity as we, and take the whole Scripture as the Word of God: And yet none of the Heathenish Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do match or come near to their French Massacrees, and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Inquisition, and the cruelty that in <hi>Ireland, England,</hi> and their part of the Christian world, they have exercised upon the sheep of Christ. The many Ministers that were silenced in <hi>Germany,</hi> and some imprisoned, and many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies undone, was by the Lutherans, against men that were Protestants as well as they. And they that cast out so many Learned, holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48302:126"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> and occasioned the expulsion of so many thousand persons fearing God, were Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Protestants as well as we. And that there may not be the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance so much as of a difference in Ceremonies to cover their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, abundance of conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men are troubled and undone as well as others, and they gave out that [<hi>none were worse then the conformable Puritans.</hi>] It was a holy observation of the Lords day, and opposition to the abuse of it by Dancings, and it was hearing Sermons, and instructing mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and praying together, that were the things enquired after, that occasioned our troubles. And (who ever was in the right or wrong) you all know that the late miserable wars among us, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men that professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be of the same Religion, not only as Christians, but as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,

I will give you my assertion in the words of a man that you shall confess did speak impartially, and not out of any intemperance or singularity; who in a Prosperous University, in Peaceable times, being himself in favour, and of that Judgement and of such Learning as was likely to continue him in favour, did yet
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48302:128"/>
write thus concerning persecution: I mean Doctor <hi>Iackson,</hi> in his Book of saving Faith, sect. 2. chap. 4. pag. 185. [<hi>The Ministers of Christ may deny Christ, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their ashamedness of his Gospel, as directly by not laying his Law as closely to the great</hi> Herods <hi>of the world, as</hi> John Baptist <hi>did (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the case be as notorious, and as well known to them) as if they had been afraid to confess him, for fear of being put out of the Synagogues, or said with those other Iews, We know that God spake with</hi> Moses, <hi>and gave authority to Magistrates; but this man we know not whence he is, nor do we care for his Counsels. Yet were</hi> John Baptists <hi>kind of preaching used in many Kingdoms, though by such as profess the same Religion with the Potentates, they should offend with their boldness, I think it would prove matter of Martyrdom in the end. That any age since Christian
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48302:128"/>
Religion was first propagated, hath wanted store of Martyrs, is more to be attributed to the Negligence, Ignorance, and Hypocrisie, or want of courage in Christs Embassadors, or appointed Pastors, then unto the sincerity, mildness or fidelity of the flock; especially of the Bell-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or chief ring-leaders. Or if Satan had not abated the edge of primitive zeal and resolution by that dishonourable peace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christianity and Gentilism, after the settling of</hi> Goths <hi>and</hi> Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals <hi>in these parts of Christendom; had he not utterly benummed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by locking up their spiritual senses in midnight darkness, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their souls in superstition, since the time he himself was let loose:</hi> Rome <hi>Christian had seen more Martyrs, even of such as did not much dissent from her in most opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons held within six hundred years of Christ, in one year, then</hi> Rome
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48302:129"/>
                  <hi>Heathen at any time had known in ten. Even in Churches best Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would be much easier, I think, to find store of just matter of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, then of men fit to make Martyrs. And he that hath lived any long time in these quiet mansions, and seats of Muses, secure from</hi> Mars <hi>his broyls, or external vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, hath great cause either to magnifie the tender mercies of his gracious God, or suspect himself for an Hypocrite, if he have not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered some degrees of Martyrdom: But unto such as have been exercised therein, it bringeth forth the quiet fruit of Righteousness.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Thus you see this Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, though in favour with the Rulers of the age he lived in, did think that a man that would not be an Hypocrite, but faithfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty, was likely to suffer Martyrdom from those of the same Profession with himself, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48302:129"/>
that it must be by very great mercy from God, or by hypocrisie and unfaithfulness in us, if any Minister do scape the hands of the wicked that are of his own Profession. So that you may see that meer Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will make but a poor Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Union among us: Sin will be sin still, and the flesh will rage still after its prey in unmortified Professors; and the Word of God will still disgrace them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, and consequently trouble them and exasperate them; So that if you come no nearer to us then a Profession of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Protestant Religion, you will still be souldiers in the Army of the Devil, and be still flying in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of true Believers, whenever they do but cross you in your sins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider also, What a poor benefit comparatively it is to your selves, to be joyned with the Saints
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48302:130"/>
by a bare Profession, and no more Will it make you happy to see their faces, or live among them? So do the bruit beasts, and so do their Persecutors: Will it make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to be called by the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?

Moreover, these hollow-hearted Christians, that agree with us but in the outside and the name, are capable of dishonouring Christ and the Gospel, much more then if they were open enemies. If a professed Heathen or Infidel live wickedly, this cannot be cast upon the Gospel or the Christian name, nor can Christ and his servants be hit in the teeth with it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by it: But when those that take on them to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and joyn with Christians in their publike worship, shall live like Heathens, or worse then some of them, what greater wrong can be done to Christ? will he not one day take such wretches by the throats, <hi>and (s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And this is one great cause why Christ hath appointed Discipline in his Church to admonish and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or reject the scandalous: And this is the reason (among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others) why faithful Christians, (though they would make no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just divisions and separations) would yet have the Church of Christ kept clean, by use of holy Discipline, as he hath appointed; Because it is from such false-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Professors (usually) that the name of Christ is reproached in the world: These are they for the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48302:135"/>
most part that make Turkes and Jewes and all other enemies say, that Christians are as bad as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because those that <hi>are as bad as others,</hi> do take on them to be Christians. When Drunkards, and Fornicators, and Covetous persons, and profane, do come to the Congregation, and say they are Christians, when in heart and deed they are not, what wonder then if Infidels and Enemies of the Church reproach us and say, You see what Christians are? How could a Papist do the Protestants a cunninger and surer mischief, then to take on him a Protestant, and then commit fornication or other horrid lewdness, or joyn with some abominable Sect, to make men think that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are such as these! And how can you do Christ a greater wrong then to carry the dung of the world into his Church; and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48302:135"/>
all the crimes of Infidels, with the name and garb of Christianity, that it may be said, All these are the crimes of Christians! And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that Christ and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers, though they would have as many as is possible to be saved, yet are not so forward to take in all, as others be: For Christ needeth not servants, but its <hi>they</hi> that need <hi>him</hi>; and he had rather have a few that will honour him by mortifyed holy lives then a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that will but cause his name and Gospel to be reproached. It is certain from Church-history, that the holy life of some one or few persons (as <hi>Gregory Thaumatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Macarius,</hi> and many the like) hath drawn in multitudes and converted Countries to the faith: when the wickedness of whole Towns and Countries of Professed Christians, hath caused many to fall off, and caused the enemie to insult.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48302:136"/>We will not for all this break our Rule, nor presume to search the hearts of men, any further then they appear in outward Evidence. We will still take all Professors of Christianity as Christians, that Null not their own Profession. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> was advised by <hi>Athanasius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to receive the <hi>Arrians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Communion, if they did but disown their former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and subscribe to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and seek the Communion of the Churches. And he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this, though many were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it. But yet we must needs say, that it is better for the Church to have a few that are Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and answer the nature of their holy Calling, then to have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that will but prove our shame, and make the Infidel world believe that Christianity is not what it is. Yea and these are they most commonly too (though they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48302:136"/>
may proceed to a higher professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that are carried about with every wind of doctrine, and that turn to Heresies, and cause and continue the Divisions of the Church: For they that are such, <hi>serve not the Lord Iesus,</hi> when they profess to serve him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. When Heresies do arise, it is such chaff as this that is carried away, that the Approved Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans indeed may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. Abundance of proud unsanctified persons, do us as much good in the Church as fire in our thatch, or as mutinous soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that are but the enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in the Army, to set all the souldiers together by the ears, or discover their Councils, or blow up their magazins. And would you have us contented with such a kind of Agreement and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with you as this, which you and we are like to be so little the

It is not in this that he attaineth the principal ends of his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor seeth the travaile of his Soul. Alas, the blood of Christ is lost to you, and all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and means are lost, and all the labour of Ministers is but lost to you as to any pardon of sin, or life, or Heaven that ever you shall have by them, if you goe no further. And would you have us be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such an Agreement as this?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Lastly, Consider that if we Agree no further then in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession of the Christian faith, alas, it will be but a <hi>short</hi> Agreement. We may be together here a while in the Church, as fishes good and bad in one net; but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48302:137"/>
when it is drawn to the shore, a separation will be made. Here you may sit and kneel among us a while, and go away with the Name of Christians: But alas, it is but a little while till this Agreement will be broken, and a dreadful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting separation must be made. Dreadful to the unsanctified, but joyful to the Saints. And what great good will it do to you or us, to be tyed together a little while, by words and shews, and then to be everlastingly separated, as far as Light from darkness, Heaven from Hell, and the Greatest Joys from the Greatest sorrows. O blame us not if we motion to you, and beg of you, a far neerer Union and Agreement then this.</p>
               <p>I think I have now sufficiently proved, that If we will be indeed of <hi>One Religion,</hi> and ever come to a right Agreement, it is <hi>The Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the sanctifying Spirit</hi> that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48302:138"/>
must do it. It must be a Union and Agreement in true Conversion and Holiness of life, and nothing lower will serve the turn. If God do us any good by the <hi>Profession, Gifts</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> of Hypocrites and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified professors, we'l thank him for it, and take it as a mercy: But it is a higher <hi>Design</hi> that must be in our Hearts; and woe be to them that come no nearer the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholik Church and the Unity of the Spirit and the Communion of Saints, then by an Outward profession and participation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and such like outward Ordinances of Communion.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To be Agreed in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to be Heartily one in the Essentials of Christianity, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding advantage to us in all our disagreements about lesser things. As</p>

You little think what abundance of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48302:139"/>
are at once reconciled in the very hour of a sinners conversion. Before that hour, we differed in Judgement from all wise men, from all the Saints of God, from all the holy Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, as well as from all the Godly about us; and from all men of right Reason, and faith and experience; Yea we differed from the Holy Ghost, from Christ, from God himself; yea from none so much as him. Wicked wretches! you differ from the Godly because they Agree with God; but you differ more from God then from them. When you despise a Holy life, are his thoughts like your thoughts? when you revile his servants, and scorn his yoak and burden as too heavy, are you then of the mind of Christ? O no; Your darkness and his Light, are far more distant then you are able to conceive. Were you but once
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48302:139"/>
Reconciled to God, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sanctifying light, you would at once be Reconciled to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; for in the matters of chief concernment to the soul, they are all of his mind; for he is their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer. And then what a day of healing would that be! Oh what abundance of differences are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the day of true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version? And withal what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of differences would be new made? For now you Agree with the Devil and with your fleshly desires, and with distracted wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and all this Agreement would then be broke: For this friendship with the world is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.4. and such Divisions as these Christ tells us that he came to send, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.51. But you would presently be Agreed with God, with the Holy Scriptures, with all the Apostles and Servants of the Lord, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48302:140"/>
with all men of Spiritual wisdom and experience in the world, in the great and principal matters of your lives. And it is a multitude of particulars that is contained in this Agreement that's made when a sinner is truly sanctified.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Our imperfection of Knowledge
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48302:140"/>
causeth us here to erre and differ in part: But if we are all united in Christ, and agreed in the main, how quickly shall we see that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Light that will reconcile all our controversies! Marvail not to find some contests among the most learned and most godly, unless you'l marvail that Earth is not Heaven; or that in that body we see not the face of God, which is the all-disclosing reconciling light. If we were all here together in the dark, and were of many opinions about the things before us; if one did but come in among us with a candle, it might end all our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in a moment. When we are newly out of this obscuring flesh, and this dark deceitful earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world, O what an unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reconciliation will be made by that blessed Light! <hi>There's</hi> no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending or quarrelling: For there are none of those errors or passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48302:141"/>
that should occasion it. As Imperfect Holiness produceth an answerable Imperfect Unity, so perfect Holiness will prfectly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. And is not this then the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to Unity, which will help us here to what is here attainable, and secure us of eternal perfect concord, in the world that we are passing to? O see that you be once Agreed in the things that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, and then the hour is neer at hand that will end all your differences, and agree you in the rest.</p>

The disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ungodly from God, from Scripture and the Saints, are <hi>mortal</hi> to them, and prove them under the power of darkness and of Satan, that leads them captive at his will, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.) But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of the sanctified, are but as the different complexions or statures of children, or at worst but as their falling out, which will not cause the Father to turn them out of his family; so that as long as Faith, and Love, and Hope and other Graces are kept sound, we shall certainly do well for all our differences. And this is the benefit of Agreeing in Holiness.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, if once we were all Agreed in the Spirit, and in Holiness of Heart and Life, <hi>we should escape all Heresies, or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that effectually subvert the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48302:142"/>
of the Christian faith.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken we might be; but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes we could not be. I stick not upon the bare word, whether smaller errors may be called Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; but taking Heresie as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly its taken, a sanctified person cannot (at least Habitually) be a Heretick. For should a man so hold a point inconsistent with any one Essential point of the Christian faith (at least Habitually and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically hold it,) its as impossible that this man should be then a Christian as that contradictories should be true. And therefore certainly whosoever is a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e from such Heresies. And therefore as, if you are sure a man so holds a Heresie, you have no reason to believe his shews of Holiness; so where you see a great appearance of real Holiness, you must long deliberate and have good evidence, before you judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that man a Heretick: For this is the certain Priviledge of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, that they cannot be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, though they may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors (as <hi>in sensu composito</hi> all confess).</p>
               <p n="5">5. Morover if we were but all Agreed in true Holiness, <hi>we should be freed from most of those scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sins which are the common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of our reproaches and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> It is sin that is the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48302:143"/>
And it is to defend and take part with sin, that they fall out with God and his Word and Servants. Now Holiness is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this sin that troubleth us. Mortification of sin is part of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. If therefore we were Agreed in Holiness, it were as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a way to procure our Peace, as quenching the fire in your thatch, is the ready way to save your house. I know there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny scandals given by the best. But it is commonly but by the weaker worser sort of the best. And it is not a common thing with them neither. And none of them make a trade of sinning, nor have any unmortified reigning sin. If a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,</hi> a <hi>Lot,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> be once scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in all his life, this is not the case of all the godly; and it is not like the case of the ungodly that are either often, or impenitent in it. And therefore though it may
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48302:143"/>
disturbe the Church: yet not so much as the frequent and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent scandals of the ungodly. O could we but all Agree against this make-bate, this great disturber and troubler of the world, what Peace might we enjoy?</p>
               <p n="6">6. And also, if once we could Agree in Holiness, <hi>the matter and occasion of offences, separations and contentions would cease.</hi> What cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Donatists separation of old, but the <hi>scandals</hi> in the Church: and the receiving of such upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance into Communion or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry? And so the Novatian schism also was occasioned. And though the Donatists and Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were too blame to be against the Ordination or reception of such Penitents; yet the prevention of the sin, would have been the prevention of the breach. What hath caused so many to turn sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists in <hi>England,</hi> but seeing so
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48302:144"/>
many ungodly persons in our Churches and Communion? You that are most offended at Schisms and Private Churches, are the common occasions of it your selves. If such ungodly persons were not in our Assemblies, few godly persons would separate from them. Though I do not justifie them, yet I must needs condemn you as the cause. Were it not for you, we should be more of a mind among our selves. But when your rotten ulcers and corrupted lives have raised a stink in our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, this causeth our Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Separatists stop their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and are gone, and will come here no more; and the rest of us think that for your sakes and the Peace of the Church, we should stay as long as well we can, like Patient Surgeons that will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Patient because of a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stinking sore, as long as there
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48302:144"/>
is any hope of cure, or of saving the body, by cutting off the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten member. And thus while some are more patient and charitable towards you, and some are more impatient of your sin, or else afraid of Gods displeasure for having communion with you, here comes our divisions among our selves, for your sakes. And therefore if we were but Agreed in Holiness, all this were ended. There would then be no habituated Drunkard, or worldling, or railer, or swearer, or other ungodly persons in our Churches; and then who could scruple communion with them? and so what should hinder but we might all be one? and yet will you not agree in this?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea if we were united in the Spirit of Holiness, <hi>the very Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unpeaceable Disposition of men would it self be healed, and so we should have Peace.</hi> For an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48302:145"/>
dividing disposition is part of the <hi>old man,</hi> and of that <hi>unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> which we must forsake. And charity and meekness, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able healing temper, is Holiness it self. And therefore this must needs do much to heal and reconcile us. Read but <hi>Iames</hi> 3. throughout, and it will satisfie you of this, if you will be satisfied. Those that pretend to be wiser then the rest of the godly, and to have more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, <hi>if yet they have bitter envying and strife in their hearts, they Glory in vain, and lie against the truth: For this Wisdom descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not from above, but is earthly, sensual and devilish. He that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise and endued with knowledg in the Church, must shew out of a good conversation his works with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Wisdom. For the wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then Peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48302:145"/>
fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrsie. But where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and strife is, there is confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every evil work,</hi> James 3.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. See here what a spirit sanctification doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and whether this be not the only healing way. It is <hi>first</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Pure:</hi> but next it is <hi>Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gentle and easy to be intreated.</hi> They that <hi>cause Divisions and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary to the Doctrine which is taught; do not serve the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, what ever they may pretend or think. Peace and Holiness</hi> must be followed together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. Yea <hi>Peace with all men,</hi> if it be possible, and in our power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. so that by changing the unpeaceable Disposition, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the fountain of our strifes, an Agreement in the Spirit would reconcile us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Moreover, if we would all Agree in the spirit of Holiness, <hi>it
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48302:146"/>
would destroy that Carnal selfish di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition, and that end which is the dividing Interest, and take away the bone of our contentions.</hi> It is <hi>selfishness</hi> that causeth the great Divisions in Church and State, and sets the world together in wars and quarrels: Every unsanctified man is selfish: his <hi>self</hi> and selfish interest is more to him then God and his interest. And such men as these will never live with any man in peace, any longer then they may have their will and way. They will not agree with neighbours if <hi>self</hi> be but toucht by any. They will have the Magistrate when ever he would punish them. They will hate the Pastors of the Church if they faithfully discharge their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, in reproving them, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to Repentance and such Confession as is necessary to their cure. If it were Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a selfish person cannot bear
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48302:146"/>
it, if they go against his <hi>selfish</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. Theres no living at peace with <hi>selfish</hi> men, if you do but cross them in their credit or profit or sensual delights: and this we <hi>must do,</hi> unless we will incur the displeasure of our Lord. We are cast upon an Impossibility of living in Peace with wicked men. For God hath commanded us to <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them plainly, and not to suffer sin upon them.</hi> And if we disobey God to please men, it will cost us dearer then their favour can repay. But if we obey God and do our duty, we are as sure to be hated and reproached with the most, as that the earth is under our feet. Give a wicked selfish sinner as plain Scripture and Reason as can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and you shall not stir him from his selfish interest: If you punish him, or reprove him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or exercise Church-censures on him, or any way touch his carnal
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48302:147"/>
selfish interest, and when you have done go about to satisfie him with Reason, you may as well almost go Reason a hungry dog from his carrion, or Reason a Wolf into the nature of a Lamb, or Reason a Mastiff to be friends with a Bear. Many a tryal I have made; and many a time I have stopt their mouthes, and satisfied them in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that they ought to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and confess and forsake their sins, and yield to God (or made them confess so much at the least) But their selfish minds were no more satisfied, for all that, then if I had never spoken to them. Scripture is no Scripture, nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is no Reason to them; nor God shall be no God to them, if <hi>self</hi> do but contradict it; and that is, when ever he contradicteth <hi>self.</hi> They can no more believe and Like, and Love that doctrine or duty or counsel or course of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48302:147"/>
life that crosseth <hi>self,</hi> and calls them to any great <hi>self-denial,</hi> then a child can love to be corrected. So that <hi>self</hi> being so certain a Peace-breaker and disturber of the world; and yet being the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle in all that are unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, you may easily see that this is the hindrance of our <hi>Vnity and Concord</hi>; and that sanctification must needs be the Principal remedy. For sanctification is the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>selfishness,</hi> and teacheth men <hi>self-denial,</hi> and centreth all men in one Interest which is God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the unsanctified there are as many Ends and Interests as Men: For every one of them hath a <hi>self</hi> to Please: And then what Unity can there be? But the sanctified are <hi>all</hi> United in God, as their common Principle, End and All: and therefore must needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Moreover, if we could but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48302:148"/>
all Agree in the Spirit of Holiness, <hi>We should then overcome that pride and self-conceitedness, that breaks our peace, and raiseth errors, and puts us into dissentions.</hi> What makes us all so hardly to Agree, and to be of so many minds and ways, but that every man naturally is proud and self-conceited, and wise in his own eyes, and confident of every fancy of his own? All his own Reasons seem strong to him: and Gods own Reasons do seem unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to him: And can we ever agree with such men as these, that think themselves wiser then God and Scripture, and dare prefer the very folly of their own muddy brains, before the word and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Maker? Give these men as plain Scripture and Reason as you will, they have more wit (as they think) then to believe you; and what they want in Reason, they have in Pride and Self-conceit; and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48302:148"/>
therefore your wisdom is folly to them. But now when the Spirit of Holiness comes, it takes them down, and abaseth and humbleth the proud and self-conceited, and makes them ashamed of the folly and weakness of their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, so that a man may speak to them now as to men of reason, and have a hearing and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his words. A humble godly man is low in his own eyes; and therefore suspicious of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, in doubtfull things; and therefore is more flexible and yielding to the truth; when others are so stiffened by Pride, that they are readier to deride the wisest that shall contradict them: If therefore we could but all Agree in Holy meekness and humility, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way could there be in the world, to draw to an end of our differences and divisions!</p>
               <p n="10">10. Moreover, if we could but
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48302:149"/>
Agree in Holiness, <hi>it would free us from that uncharitableness that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth our Disagreement in other things; and it would possess us with a special endeared Love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And who knoweth not that Love is a uniting healing thing? Sanctification principally consisteth in Love to God and man, and this the unsanctifyed principally want. Its want of Love that makes men surmise the worst of one another, and make the worst of all that they say &amp; do, and draw matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from that which never gave them Cause. Love would put a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sence upon mens words and deeds, or at least would bear them far more easily. But instead of Love, there is a Natural Enmity in all that are unsanctified to all the servants and the ways of God. And can we ever be agreed with our Natural enemies? why Malice will so pervert their understandings,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48302:149"/>
that all that we say or do will be misconstrued: and as a man that looks through a red glass thinks all things to be red that he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so these men through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper of their malicious minds, will finde matter of quarrelling with all that we can say or do. Ill will never saith well. Our very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law of God, and seeking to save our own souls, will be matter of quarrel, and taken to be our crime. If we will not run into Hell fire with them, and think there is no danger, when we know the contrary, it will be a fault sufficient for their malice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us with: so that if we should Agree with ungodly men, in all our Opinions of Religion; yet if we will not damn our souls, and make no bones of displeasing the great and dreadfull God, there is no Peace to be had with them. They have no Peace with God, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48302:150"/>
they have no solid Peace with themselves (for God hath professed <hi>that there is no peace to the wicked, Isa.</hi> 48.22.) And how then can we expect that they should have peace with us? But Sanctification doth beget that eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctual Love, that is as healing to a divided Church, or to disagreeing persons, as the most precious Balsom or Wound-selve is to bodily wounds. Love will not let you rest in wrath, but will keep you under smart and disquietness, till you are either at Peace, or have done your part to have procured it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Brethren and Sisters do seldomer fall into greater dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then strangers do: And when they do fall out they are easilier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. The Spirit of Grace doth possess unfained Christians, with as dear a love to one another, as is between the nearest Relations. For by our New birth the Saints are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48302:150"/>
Brethren in Christ. If you saw an Army fighting, or a company of people quarrelling and scolding at one another, do you think there could be a readier way to make them all friends and end their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, then to possess them all with a dear and tender love to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If it were in my power to cause all contenders to Love those that they contend with as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, do you think I should not soon agree them? Why, you know, if you know any thing in Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that Sanctification causeth men to Love their Neighbors as themselves, and to Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>a pure heart fervently,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. For <hi>by this we know that we are passed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we love the Brethren: He that loveth not his Brother abideth in death,</hi> Joh. 3, 14. And therefore it is a case exceeding plain, that the readiest way in the world, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48302:151"/>
our lesser differences, is, to be united in the Spirit, and to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon a Holy Life.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Moreover, were we all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Spirit, <hi>We should have all one God, one Master of our Faith, and one Law-giver and Iudge of all our Controversies</hi>: And this would be an exceeding help to unity. The Principal cause of Divisions in the world, are the multitude of Rulers and Masters and Judges. For with unsanctified men, their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and Carnal Interest is their Counsellor and Judge. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the world, that have the power of the sword, and can do them good or hurt in their estates, are the Masters of their Religion, more then God. They will follow this Man or that Man, that best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their fancies and fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; and so will never be of one minde. But Sanctification takes down all other Masters of our Faith,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48302:151"/>
save Christ and those that declare his will. Let flesh and blood say what it will, let all the world say what they will, if God say the contrary, his word shall stand and be a Law to them. And can there be a readier way to Unity, then to bring us all into one School, and subject us all to one Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and to bring us all to refer our differences to one most wise infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge? Though we do not yet understand his will in all things, yet when we understand it in the main, and are resolved to search after the knowledge of the rest, it is a great preparative to our Agreement, when <hi>we all</hi> look but to <hi>one</hi> for the deciding of our controversies. Whereas the unsanctified have as many Judges and Guides, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; For every man is a Guid and Judge to himself.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Moreover, were we but once Agreed in Holiness, <hi>We should all
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48302:152"/>
have one Light for the ending of our differences: and that Light would be the true Infallible Light.</hi> For we should all have the same Holy word of God as the extrinsick Light, which is most True, as coming from the Lord of Truth: And we should all have the Spirit of Truth within, to teach us the meaning of that word without, and to help our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and assist us in the application, and destroy the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that blind us and hinder us from perceiving the Truth: Whereas the unsanctified are all in the Dark: and what wonder, if there they disagree, and are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minds! They be not guided by the word and Spirit, and they are strangers to the Light that must Reconcile us, if ever we be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. Its true, too true, that the godly are illuminated but in part, and therefore as yet they differ in part. But yet this imperfect illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48302:152"/>
doth more to a true and safe Agreement, then all the world can do besides. If you would stop your ears against the flesh, &amp; yield all to the teachings of the word and Spirit, we should be sooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And if we were once Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Spirit and Holiness, <hi>We should all have the use and benefit of all the Reconciling, Healing means and Ordinances of God; which would be an exceeding great advantage to us.</hi> The unsanctified have but the outside, the sound, and shell of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; but it is the Sanctified that have the light and life and fruit of them. Every Chapter that you read, and every Sermon that you hear, will do somewhat towards the healing of our breaches: It will further our Knowledge and our Love. The Communion of the Saints in all holy Duties, especially at the Lords Supper, when they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48302:153"/>
partake of one Christ, will enflame their Love, and humble them for their divisions, and soder and glue their hearts together, as being all one bread and one body: And so they will be all as of one heart and soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 43, 44, 46. When we hear of the tender Love of Christ to his weakest members, how can we choose but love them if we be his Disciples! When we hear how much, and how freely he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us, how can we choose but forgive them! <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.35. When we have Communion with them in holy worship, as servants of the same Lord, as Members of the same body, how can we choose but have the affections of fellow-Members! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. When we joyn with them in Prayer, or holy Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and perceive the fragrant odour of their Graces, and the holy breathings of their souls after
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48302:153"/>
God, we cannot choose but Love Christ in them. As the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment so frequently pressed in the Gospel, is the Law of Love, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.12, 17.) and the New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Saints is a Disposition of Love (for this they are taught of God effectually, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.9.) So the Ordinances do all of them exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise that Love, and engage us to it. We must leave our gift at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and go first and be reconciled to our Brother, if we remember he hath any thing against us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. We must pray for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, but on condition that we do forgive. Differences and Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that make a breach in Christian Charity, are so insufferable among the Saints, that they long for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and smart as the wounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth, till the time of healing; and are pained as a bone out of joynt, till it be set again. And as they cannot bear it themselves

(when they are themselves) so the Church cannot bear it, but is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to watch over them, and to set them in joynt again; so that God hath hedged in his Servants into one holy Society, that they should not straggle from him or from each other, and hath set Pastors over them for this very end, to guide them and keep them in holy Unity, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14. Now all these Uniting Healing Ordinances are effectual upon the Sanctified: for their hearts are open to them, and their New nature is suited to the new Commandment and work: But to others they are in a manner as Food or Physick to the dead: They hate the power of them; they break the holy Enclosure of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and proudly Rebel against their Guides: and say, <hi>Let us break their bands, and cast away their cores from us,</hi> Psal. 2.3. <hi>what must we be Ruled by such and such?</hi> It is but
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48302:154"/>
the outside of Sacraments, Praises and Prayers that they are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with: and these have no such healing force. So that in this you see the great advantage that we should have for full agreement, if we were but once agreed in the main, and United by the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Moreover, if once we were United in the Spirit, and in Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>We should manage all our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in a holy manner, and be awakened and disposed to seek after healing in a healing way.</hi> It would put us upon enquiring after Peace, and studying the meetest terms of Peace, till we had found out the way in which we should accord. The Spirit of Love and Holiness would provoke us, to begin and seek for Peace with those that will not seek to us, and that seem averse to it; and to follow after peace, when it flyeth from us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 14. and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48302:155"/>
even to lie down at the feet of men, and deny our honour and worldly Interest, if it might procure Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and peace. Whereas a proud unsanctifyed heart will scorn to stoop, especially to those that are below them, or have wronged them, and will scorn to ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of those that they have wronged! When you have shewed them the plainest word of God for it, and perswaded them to it with undeniable reasons, you lose your labour, and may almost as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the fire to be cold. If you will stoop and humble your self to <hi>him,</hi> and ask <hi>him</hi> forgiveness, and give <hi>him</hi> the honour, or change your minde and be of <hi>his</hi> opinion, and say as <hi>he</hi> saith, and do as <hi>he</hi> would have you, perhaps you may have some Peace with the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man. But the servants of Christ have a spirit of Meekness and Humility and Self-denyal; and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48302:155"/>
therefore if there be fallings out among them, they can humble themselves and seek for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If there be difference in Judgement about any weighty matters, they will go or send to one another as Brethren, and confer about it in Love and meekness, and search the Scripture, and seek after Truth, and compare their eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Pray together for that Light and Love that must Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them: If they fall out, they can say to one another [<hi>We are Brethren, and must not Live at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor suffer any wounds in our Affections, or any breach of Charity to remain: The Sun must not go down upon our wrath: Come, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t us go together in private, and beg of God that he would repair our Love, and reconcile us, and prevent such breaches for the time to come.</hi>] And thus they can pray themselves friends again. I am perswaded that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48302:156"/>
one quarter of an hours fervent Prayer, would do more to quiet our distempered minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us, if thus we would get together in private, then many hours debates without it. Now the Spirit of holiness, is a Spirit of Prayer; and therefore disposeth the servants of Christ, as meekly and lovingly to search for Truth, so earnestly to pray themselves into Agreement.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Moreover, were we once United in the Spirit, <hi>We should be under the Promise of Divine assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which the unsanctified have no part in.</hi> When we Pray for Light and Peace and Concord, we have a <hi>promise</hi> to be heard and helpt, at least, in the time and measure as shall be fittest; we have a <hi>promise</hi> of the Spirit to be our Teacher, and to lead us into Truth: We have <hi>promises</hi> for the maintaining and repairing of our healing Graces,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48302:156"/>
and our Communion-Graces; our Love to Christ and one another; our Patience and Meekness and the rest. Aud this must needs be a great advantage to Unity and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For God is partly engaged for it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And if we were United in the Spirit and Agreed in the main, <hi>The Great Truths which we are agreed in would very much direct us, to find out the rest which yet we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in.</hi> For these have an influence into all the rest; and the rest are all connext to these, and also linkt and knit together, that we may finde out many by the help of one. All holy Truths do befriend each other; but especially the Great and Master points which the rest depend upon, and flow from: There is no way to a right Agreement in other points, but by agreeing first in these Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Rudiments.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Also, if we were once A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48302:157"/>
in Holiness, <hi>we should have that continually within us and before us, that would much take us off from vain contendings, and from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zealous minding of sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ller things.</hi> We should have so much to do with God in holy Duties, and so much to do with our own hearts in searching them, &amp; watching them, and exciting them, and mending them, reproving and correcting them, supporting and comforting them by the application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that we should have <hi>less time</hi> for quarrelling, and <hi>less minde</hi> of it then the unsanctifyed have. <hi>We</hi> should have so many great and practical Truths to digest and live upon, that lesser and unnecessary matters, which are the common causes of Contention, would find less room: Or at least, we should allow each Truth its due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our study and talk and zeal: and so that lesser would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48302:157"/>
so small a share, and be so exceeding seldom and remissly medled with, that their would be the less danger of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Yea, if once we were united in the Spirit, <hi>the very forethought of an Everlasting Vnion in Heaven, would have a continual influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts, for the healing of our breaches. We should be thinking with our selves [Shall we not short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be all of one mind and heart! and all be perfected with the blessed visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Reconciling Light of the face of God! There will then be no dissention or division, or unbrotherly censures, or separations. And should we now live so unlike our future life! Shall we now be so unlike to what we must be for ever! Shall we now cherish those heart-burnings and dissentions, that must not enter with us into Heaven, but be cast off among the rest of our miseries, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48302:158"/>
shut out with the rest of our enemies, and hated for ever by God and us? Must we there be closed in perfect Love, and be all imployed in the same holy Praise of God and our Redeemer; and does it beseem us now to be censuring, contending and separating from each other?</hi> Thus the belief of the Life to come, will be a more effectual means with the godly for Agreement, then any that unsanctified men can use.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Moreover, they that have the Spirit of Holiness, <hi>have a dear and special Love to Truth as well as unto Peace.</hi> And therefore they have a great advantage for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it in all debates: and consequently they are fairer for a just Agreement. They are friends with the most searching spiritual truths: But the ungodly have at enmity to all that Truth that would shew them their sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and duty, and make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48302:158"/>
and lead them up from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto God. And as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>He that would not know, cannot understand.</hi> When you deal with a wicked graceless heart, you do not set Reason against Reason (for it that were all, we should soon have done) but you set Reason against Will and Passion and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and fleshly Interest: and when you have convinced them, you are little the neerer prevailing with them. You may as well think to satisfie a hungry belly with Reasons, or to tame a wild beast with Reasons, or to humble the Proud, and bring the sensual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to self-denial, by all your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, For they <hi>Love</hi> not the Truth, because they Love not the Duty that it would perswade them to, and because they Love the sin that it would take from them. There are two sorts of Satan in a wicked man that none but God can batter,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48302:159"/>
so as to win them: that is, <hi>A Proud and Ignorant mind,</hi> and <hi>a Hard and sensual Heart.</hi> Many a year have I been battering them by the Word of God, from this place, and yet with many can do no good. But the sanctified heart that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Truth will meet it, and welcome it, and thankfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. <hi>Love</hi> maketh a diligent hearer, and a good schollar, and giveth us hope that informations and debates may be succesful. A godly man is so far from hating truth and flying from it, that he would give all the riches of the world to purchase it: He prayes and reads and studyeth for it: and therefore hath great advantage to attain it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Moreover, if we were all Agreed in Holiness, and united in the Spirit of Christ, <hi>we should Love the Truth in a Practical manner,</hi> and we should know that every
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48302:159"/>
Truth of God hath its proper work to do upon the soul; and therefore we should <hi>Love</hi> the end of each Truth, better then the Truth it self. And therefore we could not pretend the <hi>Truth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Ends of Truth.</hi> And therefore we should see to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of those <hi>ends</hi> in all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and controversies. We should not make havock of the Church of Christ, nor easily be guilty of divisions, nor quench our Love of God and of our Brethren, under pretence of standing for the Truth; which unsanctified men will easily do. <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>for Holiness</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> as its proper end. Ungodly men will tread down Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, or at least disadvantage it and hinder it in the world, for the exalting of their own conceits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of truth. They will cure the Church by cutting it in pieces, or by cutting the throat of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48302:160"/>
it, and are presently dismember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every sore: But with the godly it is not so.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Moreover, the sanctified have a great advantage for Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that <hi>they have hearts that are subject to the Truth, and will be True to it when they understand it.</hi> Did they but know the right way, they would presently walk in it. Nothing is so dear to them that should not be forsaken for it, or sacrificed to it. But the wicked are false to the Truths which they are acquainted with. They hold it or imprison it in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and therefore is wrath revealed against them. <hi>They like not to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; and therefore God doth oft give them up to a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>They receive not the truth in the love of it that they might be saved:</hi> no wonder therefore if <hi>God give them up to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48302:160"/>
strong delusions to believe a lye, that all they might be damned that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.10, 11. <hi>When they know the Iudgement of God, that they that do such things are worthy of death; yet they do them and have pleasure in them that do them, Rom.</hi> 1.32. We may well think that God will sooner reveal his Truth to them that will obey it, then to them that will but bury it in the dunghil of a corrupted heart. And that he will rather hold the candle to his servants that will work by it, then to loyterers that will but play by it; or thieves, or fornicators, that had rather it were put out; or to enemies that would do mischief by it, and will throw away the candlesticks (the Ministers) and put the candle into the thatch. Is there not many an ungodly person that hears me this day, that is convinced in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48302:161"/>
that a holy life is best, and yet <hi>will not</hi> follow it and obey his conscience? Are there not convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at the bottom, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heavenly Christian whom thou reproachest, is in a safer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then thy self? and yet thou wilt not imitate such. Can you expect that God should acquaint such with his truth, that are so false to it?</p>
               <p n="22">22. If we were but all Agreed in true Holiness, <hi>we should have the great advantage of a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, together with an illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mind.</hi> For spiritual wisdom, with tenderness of conscience, is a great part of sanctification. And it is a great advantage in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies and debates, to be wise and tende-conscienced: For wisdom makes men able to discern, and a tender conscience will make them afraid of mistaking and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the truth: and will keep them
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48302:161"/>
from rashness, and unadvisedness, and levity; so that such an one dare not venture so easily upon new conceits, and will be more suspicious of <hi>himself,</hi> and of any thing wherein <hi>himself</hi> is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Especially if he see gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at probabilities against it, or the judgment of the Universal Church, or of many wise and godly men against it, and see that its like to have ill effects; in all such cases a godly man will be tender-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienced, and therefore cautelous. But is it so with the ungodly? no: but clean contrary. None so bold as the blind. <hi>Solomons</hi> words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them exactly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.16. <hi>The fool rageth and is confident.</hi> If he be in an error, or entangled in any evil cause or way, you know not what to say to him for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The less he knows, the more he despiseth knowledge, and sets his face against his Teachers, as if
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48302:162"/>
they were but fools to him, and scorns to be Ruled by such as they whom God hath made his Rulers. Will you go to dispute or debate the case with one of these? why be sure of it, they will put you down and have the day. It would do a man good to dispute with a wise and learned or sober rational man, and to be overcome by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and by Truth: But no man will have so sure a conquest against you, as he that hath the least of sense or reason. He will go away and boast that you could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him: As if a mad man should boast that the Physicians could not all of them cure him. An obstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous proud selfconceited fellow, will never yield to the clearest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor never be put down. We have a Proverb, that <hi>Ther's no gaping against an Oven,</hi> especially if it be hot. If he have passion as well as ignorance, and a tongue,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48302:162"/>
he will have the best. He that speaks nonsence sayth nothing while he seems to speak. These men have the faculty of saying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing an hour or two together in abundance of words. And there's no confuting a man that saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nonsence is unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if there be but enough of it. Who would dispute against a pair of bagpipes, or against a company of boyes that whoote at him! If you will make a match at barking or biteing, a curre will be too hard for you: And if you will try your skil or strength at kicking, a horse will be too hard for you. And if you will contend with multitude of words, or by rage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a fool will be too hard for you (as you may see by <hi>Solomons</hi> descriptions and by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) But if you will dispute by equal sober Reasoning, it is only a wiser man by evidence of Truth
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48302:163"/>
that can overcome you: And to be thus overcome is better then to conquer: For <hi>you</hi> have the <hi>better</hi> if <hi>Truth</hi> overcome you; and <hi>you</hi> have the <hi>worse</hi> if you overcome the truth.</p>
               <p>So that you may easily perceive what an exceeding hindrance to Unity and Peace it is to have to do with ungodly persons, that are blind and proud, and brazen-faced, and of feared consciences, that fear not God, and therefore dare say anything, as if they could out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the truth, and the God of Truth. But the sanctified have Illuminated minds, and therefore are the more capable of further information; and they have tender consciences, and therefore dare not be unadvised and contentious, and strive against the light; and therefore have great advantage for Agreement.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And if all these Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48302:163"/>
should not yet so far prevail as to bring us up to a full Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet if we be but united in the Spirit and a Holy life, <hi>we should be the more easily able to bear with one another under all our lesser dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, until the time of full A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement come.</hi> We should hold our differences (as Brethren their diversity of statures and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or at least as common human frailties) with Love and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and not with hatred and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We should Lovingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult together upon Rules or terms on which we might manage our unavoidable differences, to the least disadvantage to the cause of Christ and to the common Truths that we all maintain, and to the work of God for other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and to the least advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to sin and Satan and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of ungodly men. And I think this is a fair Agreement for Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48302:164"/>
persons, short of Heaven; to have Unity in the Spirit, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in things of greatest weight, and to bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in smaller matters, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage our differences with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and with Peace.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Lastly, If all this be not enough, there is yet more for our encouragement. 1. If we are but once United in the Spirit, and Agree in an Holy heart and life, <hi>we have the infallible promise of God that we shall shortly all arrive in Heaven at the place and state of full perfection, where all our differences will be ended,</hi> and we shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Agreed in mind and will, being One in him that is the only Center of Universal Peace and Concord. And its a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us in our darkness and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, that we are in the sure and ready way to perfect light and Harmony of mind. 2. Yea and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48302:164"/>
till we do come thither, we are still on the mending hand; and if we do but thrive in Holiness, we shall certainly thrive in Concord and in Peace. And its a comfort to a sick man, not only to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a full recovery, but to feel himself daily on the mending hand. 3. And in the mean time God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will bear with all our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though not so far as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or cherish them, yet so far as to own us for his children, though we are too often falling out with one another; and so far as to pitty our frailty and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to pardon us, and deal as a Father with us: And if our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels cause him to use the rod, it is but to keep us in quietness after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; that as we had the taste of the four fruits of our contentions, so we may after have the quiet fruits of righteousness.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given you in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48302:165"/>
four and twenty particular disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, a sufficient Proof, that <hi>A Vnity in the Spirit, and an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Holiness, hath abundant advantages for our further Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in lowers things; and such as all other men are destitute of</hi>; and therefore that there is no way pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a just, a safe, a durable Agreement, but that we all Agree in a Holy life, and be United in the sanctifying Spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>BUt perhaps you will Object; <hi>If all this be so, whence comes it to pass that there are so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences still among those that you call the sanctified? Do we not see that they are more contentious, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into partyes, and make more stir about Religion then any others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the godly, are nothing for
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48302:165"/>
number, or greatness, or weight, in comparison of yours. I have shewed you in my Discourse of the Catholick Church, twenty great and weighty points in which they all agree together, and in which the ungodly agree not with them. What if they agree not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church-Government should be exercised by the Elders only, the flock consenting; or by all the flock, the Pastours Guiding? Or whether One among the Pastours should be of a superior Degree, or of a superior Order, or whether they should only be of the same Degree and Order, though cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to preside and moderate for the time? What if one think that its Necessary to read the publick Prayers out of a Book; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think its necessary to pray without book; and a third more truly thinks it is in it self indifferent whether it be within book or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48302:166"/>
with other suchlike differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as these, which will keep no man out of Heaven. Are these like our differences with ungodly men? Our differences with <hi>you</hi> are, <hi>Whether Heaven or Eath is chiefly to be loved and sought after? Whether Grace and Holiness, or sin and carelesness be the better?</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the more sweet and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, to be heavenly minded and live in the Love and Service of God, and to be much in holy communion with him, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon his Law, and upon the Life to come; or on the contrary, to live to the world and to the flesh? whether it be better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Word of God, and his Ministers that speak it in his name; or obey our fleshly desires and the proud conceits of ignorant minds? In a word, our difference with the ungodly, though they will not confess it and speak out, is plainly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48302:166"/>
this, <hi>whether Heaven or Earth be better? and whether God be God and shall be our God? and whether Christ be Christ and shall be our Christ? and whether the Holy Ghost shall be our sanctifier? or whether we shall live after the flesh and Rule our selves, against the Will and Word of God</hi>? and so in effect, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be God, and man be man? and whether we should live as men or as beasts? and so whether we should choose Salvation or Damnation</hi>? If you could but understand your selves, and the depth of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful hearts, you would see that here lyeth the difference. For though some of the unsanctified have a fair and plausible deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will speak handsomly of the Christian Religion, because they have had ingenuous Christian education; yet all this is indeed but little more then formal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, so far are they from a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48302:167"/>
Heavenly mind and a heart that's truly set on God, as their careless lives, and carnal unsavory confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence sheweth, if not their scorns at a state of Holiness. So that our differences are nothing in comparison of the difference with you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, the servants of God do mind the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more seriously then others do; and therefore their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are brought to light, and made more observable to the world. Their very <hi>heart</hi> is set upon these heavenly things, and therefore they cannot make light of the smallest truth of God; and this may be some occasion of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: Whereas the ungodly differ not about Religion, because they have heartily no Religion to to differ about: They trouble not themselves about these matters, because they do not much regard
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48302:167"/>
them. And is this a Unity and peace to be desired? I had rather have the discord of the Saints, then such a concord of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. They are so careful about their duty that they are afraid of missing it in the least particular; and this (with their Imperfect light) is the reason of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputings about these matters. But you that are careless of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can easily agree upon a way of sin, or take any thing that comes next to hand. They honour the Worship of God so much, that they would not have any thing out of order; but you set so little by it, that you will be of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that the King is of, let it be what it will be: And its easy to agree in such an ungodly careless course. Astronomers have many controversies about the positions and motions of the heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all Philosophers have many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48302:168"/>
about the matter of their Sciences: when ignorant men have none of their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, because they understand not, and therefore regard not the things that the learned differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. And will you think ever the better of Ignorance, or ever the worse of Learning for this? The controversies of Lawyers, of Historians, Chronologers, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapherr, Physicians, and such like, do no never trouble the brains of the ignorant: But for all that, I had rather be in Controversie with the Learned, then without such controversie with you. If you scatter a handful of Gold or Diamonds in the street, perhaps <hi>men</hi> will scramble for them, and fall out about them, when <hi>swine</hi> will trample on them and quietly despise them, because they do not know their worth: will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think that swine are happier
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48302:168"/>
then men? The <hi>Living</hi> are vext with strifes and controversies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout almost all the matters in the world; when the <hi>dead carkasses</hi> in the grave lie still in peace, and are not troubled with any of these differences. And will you say therefore that the dead corps is happyer then the living? Sirs, the case is very plain, if you will see, that thus it is as to the matter in hand. It is a Death in sin, and complyance with the times and carnal Interest, and a disesteem of spiritual holy things, that is the cause of the Agreement of the wicked. But the godly know the worth of the things that you set light by, and therefore make a greater matter of them then you, and therefore no wonder if they have more debates and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies about them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this also is another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the difference. It is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48302:169"/>
of Satan to Divide the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, but to Keep his own in Unity and Peace: and therefore he will do what he can to accomplish it. He knows that a Kingdom divided cannot stand: And therefore he will do his worst to Divide Christs Kingdom, and to keep his own from being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. By a deceitful Peace it is that he keeps his servants to him. And by casting among them the matter of contentions and divisions he hopeth to get Christs followers from him. So that the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is the promoter of your Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Concord, but the destroyer of ours; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if you have fewer differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides, the way that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men go in, is so suited to the common corruption of nature, that it is no wonder if they be all agreed. All the world can agree
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48302:169"/>
to eat and drink and sleep: And therefore all the sensual sinners in the world may easily agree upon an overloving of meat and drink and sleep, and so of riches and honours and pleasures. And as its <hi>easy,</hi> so it is not much desirable; no more then if you should all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to cast your selves headlong into the Sea: when every house is infected with the Plague, there is an Agreement among them: But had you not rather be one of those that, disagree from them? But to Agree in a holy heavenly life, is contrary to corrupted nature; and therfore no marvail if it be more difficult. When a Physician hath an hundred Patients in hand, he may easily get them all to Agree to eat and drink that which they desire: But if he require them to forbear the things that they most Love, because they will hurt them, the <hi>understanding</hi> sort will agree to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48302:170"/>
him, but so will not the rest. In a rotten house, the fall of one bearer may occasion the fall of all the house; because their weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them downward: But if you take up one stone and cast it upward, all the rest of the stones in the heap, will not flie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with it. Its easier to draw others with us down hill, then up the hill.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And it is considerable that the differences among the servants of Christ, are not alwayes from themselves, but from the ungodly enemies that contrive their dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and set them together by the ears, that they may fish in troubled waters, and the better attain their wicked ends. It is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man that soweth these tares while we are asleep, and casteth in this wildfire among us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moreover, one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test causes of the troublesome
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48302:170"/>
breaches and divisions in the Church, is because there are so many unsanctified persons among us, that seem to be of us, and to be truly godly, when it is not so. You think it is the godly that have these divisions, when the most and worst of all our Divisions proceed from the ungodly that have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound and unrenewed heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloak of piety and zeal: For if they were truly gracious persons, they durst not do as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them do. 1. They durst not so rashly and easily venture on novelties as they do, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and reading and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what can be said on the other side. 2. They durst not so easily make a division in the Church of Christ. 3. Nor so easily cast a stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block before the weak; and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproach to our Christian profession before the wicked. 4. Nor durst they so easily reproach
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48302:171"/>
and condemn and cast off the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous faithful Ministers of Christ. 5. Nor durst they so easily censure the universal Church in former ages, as many of them do. 6. Nor durst they sacrifice the success and honour of the Gospel and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acknowledged Truths, and the saving of mens souls thereby, to their private opinions, and ends. 7. Nor durst they make so great a breach in Charity, nor so arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly condemne or slight their brethren, whose piety and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they cannot deny. These with many other evidences, do let us know that ungodly men crept in among us, are the causes of most of our most dangerous divisions. And will you lay the blame of this upon Religion, which the Devil and the secret enemies of Religion do perform? Its your d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shonour and not ours: For these men are of <hi>your</hi> party, though they seem
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:48302:171"/>
to be of us. Satan knows well enough, that if he have not some of his followers to be spies in Christs Army, and to raise muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies there and betray the rest, he is like to be the more unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his attempts, Was <hi>Iudas</hi> more a dishonour to Christ, or to the Devil? He was among the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ indeed; but he told them beforehand of him, that he was a Devil; and he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed Christ till Satan had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Lastly, the Saints themselves are sanctified but in part, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in a low degree; and being Imperfect in Holiness, must needs be as Imperfect in holy Unity and Peace It is not their Holiness that causeth their contentions, but the remnants of their sin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its but small credit to the way of sinners. Were we but perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rid of the vices which <hi>you</hi> che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48302:172"/>
and perfectly separated from the waies that <hi>you</hi> so much delight in, and had we no remnants of <hi>your</hi> disease and sinful nature in us, we should then have perfect Unity and Peace. Do you think that its long of our <hi>Religion,</hi> that we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree? No: if we were but <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Religious</hi> we should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreed. It is because we are Holy in no greater a measure, and not because we are Holy at all. It is not because of the way of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness that we have chosen; but because we walk no faster, and no more carefully in that way. It is our too oft stepping out of it, and not our walking in it, that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Peace with God and man, and our own consciences. Search all the Scripture, and see where you can find, that ever God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his servants to divisions. No: but on the contrary he oft and earnestly cries them down,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48302:172"/>
and warneth all his followers to avoid them, and the causers and fomenters of them. There was never Master so much for Unity as Christ, and never was there a Law or a Religion that did so much condemne Divisions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand brotherly Love, and Peace and concord, and forbearing and forgiving one another, as the Christian Law and Religion doth. And will you yet say that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions are long of our Religion, or of Christ the author of it? You may as wisely say, that eating is the cause of weakness, because that some are weak for all their meat. But you will find that none can live without it. Or you may say as wisely that Physicians are the causes of the diseases of the world, because they do not cure them all. I tell you there is none in all the world that have done so much for Unity and Peace, as
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48302:173"/>
Christ hath done. No: all the world set together have not done half so much for it as he. He hath preached Peace and Unity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and forbearing and Loving one another, yea Loving our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and he hath gone before us in the perfect practice of what he taught. He hath offered himself a Sacrifice to the Justice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by his blood he might reconcile us unto God. He is the great Peacemaker between God and man, between Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, taking away the enmity, and becoming himself the Head of our Unity; and giving us One Spirit, one faith, one baptism, that we might be One in him who is One with the Father. So that to charge the Center of Unity with our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and the Prince of Peace himself with our Discords, or his holy Word or waies with our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements, is all one as to charge
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48302:173"/>
the Sun with Darkness, and to say that our Law-givers and Laws are the causes of theft and murder and Adultery, which condemne them to death that are proved guilty of them. The cause of all our disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements and divisions, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are <hi>no more Holy</hi> then we are, and because we are no more Religious. So that I may leave it now as a Proved Truth that we must Unite in the Spirit, and Agree in Holiness of Heart and life, if ever we will have true Unity and Agreement.</p>
               <p>AND now Sirs, you have seen the only way of Unity ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you: Its plain and past all doubt before you. If yet you will divide from God and his servants, and if yet you will be numbered with the straglers or quarrellers,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48302:174"/>
do not say but Peace was opened and offered to you. Do not say, <hi>You could not have Peace,</hi> but that <hi>you would not.</hi> Do not say any more hereafter, that there were so many Religions and so many waies that you could not tell which to joyn with! Never more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the differences of the godly as a cloak for your ungodliness. I have opened the nakedness of such pretences. You shall not be able when your lives are scan'd, to look God in the face with such an unreasonable impudent pretence. Your consciences and the world shall then be witnesses of your shame; that while you cryed out of Sects and heresies, and were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the Divisions of the Church, it was your selves that were the cause of it: It was you and such as you that were the great Dividers; and that obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately proceeded in your Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48302:174"/>
when the way of Peace was opened to you; and would not be United in the Spirit to Christ, nor would not Agree in Holiness with his Church, when you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that there was no other way to Peace. Would you but have joyned in a firm and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Covenant to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as your on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creator, Redeemer and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer, as members of the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and have lived in the Communion of the Saints, you should have received the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, the Resurrection of the just, and Everlasting Life: But in <hi>refusing,</hi> and <hi>obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing</hi> these, you <hi>refused</hi> all your hopes of <hi>Blessedness,</hi> and wilfully cast your selves on the wrath of God: and therefore must endure it for ever.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:48302:175"/>
               <p>THE last Advice that I have to give, upon the ground of this Doctrine, is, To all that are United in the Spirit, and Agreed upon an Holy life. I mean to say but little to you now; but briefly to tender you these two requests.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I beseech you Christians but to live as Christians, in that holy Unity as your principles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession do engage you to. Hath true Christianity and Holiness such abundance of advantages against division, and yet will you be guilty of it? Against all these bonds and healing principles and helps, will you be dividers? Doth it not grieve you and even break your hearts, to hear ungodly persons say that Professors are of so many minds and partyes, that they know not which of them to follow? and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48302:175"/>
that we had never concord since you bore sway? O do not seek by your contentious wayes, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade people that Holiness is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding thing, and that Religion doth but tend to set the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the eares. Is it not a precious mercy to us of this place, that we have among us but one Church, and one Religion, and and have not Church against Church, and Christian against Christian! I charge you from the Lord that you be thankful for this benefit; and that you look upon divided places, and compare their case with yours, that if ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders come amongst you, the sense of your felicity in this blessed Unity may cause you to reject them; and that you do not suffer any <hi>Dalilah</hi> to rob you of your strength and glory. Were you but once here in pieces among your selves, what a scorn would you be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48302:176"/>
to all the ungodly? what sport would it be to them, to hear you disputing against one another, and reproaching and condemning one another, as bitterly as the wicked do reproach you all? Do you not pitty those places where divisions have made Religion to be a scorn, and the tender Love and Unity of the Saints is turned into unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table censures and separations? Take warning then that you come not to the like. If you should, you would be as unexcusable as any People in the world, because you have tryed and tasted so much of the sweetness and benefits of Unity as you have done: shew men by your lives, that Holiness is the most certain way to Unity, as ever you desire either to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Holiness, or to have any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it in your selves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Judge by this undoubted truth, of any doctrine that shall
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48302:176"/>
be offered you, and of the wayes of men and of your selves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suspect that doctrine that tendeth to divisions in the Church. If it be not for Unity, it is not of God, <hi>Rom,</hi> 16.17. Christ came to heal and reconcile, and is the Prince of Peace; and therefore sendeth not his servants on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary errand. He will justifie your dividing from the unbelieving world; but he hateth dividing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his servants. He that's for Church-division, is not (in that) for Christ or you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What ever holiness they may pretend to, adhere not to those men, and think not too highly of them that are for Divisions among the Churches, or servants of the Lord. You'l see them repent, or come to shame and confusion at the last. You flie from Christ, if you flie from Unity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Think not that you have any
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48302:177"/>
more of the Spirit or of Holiness, than you have of Love to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Saints. It is the spirit of Satan and not of Christ that leadeth you to Church-divisions: It is a counterfeit Holiness that maketh you not desirous of Unity with all the Saints. If you be not first pure and then peaceable, your wisdom is not from above. As you would all take that man to be an enemy to Holiness, that is an enemy to Chastity, Temperance or common honesty; So have you reason to think of him that is an enemy to the Churches Unity and Peace. Shew that you have the Spirit by the Unity of the Spirit: and shew that you are Holy by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Union and Communion of the Saints.</p>

               <p>I Have already proved to you in the foregoing Discourse. 1. That the true Unity of the Church of Christ is a Unity of the Spirit, and that the unsanctified are the causes of our Divisions. 2. That a Unity in meer Profession, is but a low and miserable Unity, which will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie nor serve the turn. 3. That a Unity in the Spirit of Holiness, is a great advantage for the healing of all our lesser differences, or that we may do well for all those differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if we are truly sanctified.

The Points in which the weakness of these persons is said to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, are, 1. In their abstaining from flesh, and eating herbs, 2. In their observation of certain days as Holy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The thing commanded is, that these persons for all their weakness <hi>be Received,</hi> that is, 1. Into bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly internal Charity. 2. Into Christian external Communion. For it seems, that by reason of this their weakness, there grew Divisions in the Church. The weak were so self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, as to censure the strong, because they did not observe their
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48302:179"/>
Ceremonies. And the strong were too contemptuous of the weak, and made light of them as a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious people, unfit for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: <hi>Paul</hi> chides them both: the weak for censuring the strong, and the strong for contemning the weak: and commandeth that for the future, the weak forbear his <hi>judging,</hi> and the strong <hi>Receive</hi> the weak whom they contemned, and so that they joyn in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Love, and external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And he addeth this caution, for the manner of their reception and behaviour, that it must not be [<hi>to doubtfull Disputations</hi>] either to the censuring of one another, or to unseasonable uncharitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings and disputes, about these smaller things. Three things <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to suppose in the matter of their controversie. 1. That they were matter of some Indifferency.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48302:179"/>
2. That they were small, and of lowest consideration in Religion. 3. That to the weak they were so dark and doubtfull, as to be the matter of Disputes. But for all these, he would have no breach in their Charity or Communion.</p>

                  </gap>or the understanding of this you must observe, 1. That there is a great difference between Circumcision, and the Ceremonies here spoken of. 2. And between the outward act of Circumcision, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Circumcision as appointed by God. 3. And there is a great difference between the using it as necessary to Justification, and the using the outward part only for some lawfull end. 4. And between the time when the Gospel was but newly revealed, and the time when it was oft and fully declared to the world. 5. And between those that are ignorant for want of full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and those that are obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate after long instruction. 6. And between those that scruple the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of such Ceremonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and those that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude them as necessary upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48302:180"/>
Observing these distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you may see the difficulty plainly resolved, as followeth, 1. In this Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not of Circumcision, but of meats and days only. For Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision engaged men further to <hi>Moses</hi> Law, then these single Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. 2. When <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he was afraid of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their observation of days and weeks, and moneths, he means because they still adhered to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated Law, after so long and plain Instruction. 3. And though he circumcised <hi>Timothy, Acts</hi> 16.3. and yet speak against it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. the difference of the Cases is exceeding great. For 1. It was but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumcision of the flesh that he used with <hi>Timothy</hi> (as with one that did not intend by it any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to <hi>Moses,</hi> or necessity of it to Justification.) But it was the entire Sacrament of Circumcision
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48302:181"/>
which was pretended to continue necessary, by the false Teachers, and which he exhorted the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> to refuse. And Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Sacrament, doth signifie two principal things. 1. An Engagement to and profession of Faith in the Promised Seed, as promised and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. An Engagement to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> Law (for this use it had after the Law was given.) Now when Christ was come, that man that would still be Circumcised into, and profess to expect a <hi>Messiah</hi> yet to come, and that would engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to that Law, which contained the Types of a future <hi>Messiah,</hi> and was but a School-master to lead to Christ, I say that person that was thus Circumcised (as all were that received it according to the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) did plainly deny, that Christ was come, and therefore Christ could profit them nothing. But yet a man that used but the outward
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48302:181"/>
sign to avoid an impediment to the Gospel (as <hi>Paul</hi> did in the case of <hi>Timothy</hi>;) or if it were errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously as a meer Custom, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassines now do, might yet be saved by Christ nevertheless. 2. And when <hi>Paul</hi> used it, it was as an indifferent thing: but he condemned it as supposed necessary. 3. When he used it, it was in the beginning of the publication of the Gospel, that (as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks) he might give the Ceremonies an honourable bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial: But when he condemned it, it was after the full Publication of the abolition of the Law, against those that would have raked it out of the grave again. 4. He bore with it in the weak; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it in the wilfull. 5. He bore with it in those that scrupled the forsaking it as they were Jews: but he condemned it in those that would have laid this yoke as necessary on the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:48302:182"/>Object. <hi>But it seems here that</hi> Paul <hi>is against the necessary observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, when he is for esteeming all days alike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If you understand the subject of the debate, you will understand his speech. It is only Jewish Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days that was the matter in Question, and therefore of these only is he to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. As for the Lords day, its plain in the New Testament, that Christ did not only rise upon it, and appear to his Disciples on it, and send down the Holy Ghost upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the Disciples presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christs Resurrection, began their Religious Assemblies on it, and so continued them, by the guidance of the Holy Ghost; and so setled that day for the use of the Holy Assemblies of the Church, calling it the Lords day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.19, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. &amp; 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. And it is past all
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48302:182"/>
doubt in the History of the Church, that since the Apostles days till now, the Church hath constantly kept this day as thus established, by the name of the Lords day: which the Fathers called the Christian Sabbath, as they applyed the name of an Altar to the Table, and of a Sacrifice to the Supper of the Lord: so that he that will reject the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords day, must take on him to be wiser then the Holy Ghost in the Apostles, and then all the Catholick Church of Christ, from the beginning, till these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious persons did arise.</p>
               <p>The Text being thus explained, the Doctrine before mentioned is plain in it before us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctrine. <hi>IT is the will of God that the Vnity of the Church should not be laid upon indifferent, small, and doubtfull points: but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48302:183"/>
that true Believers who differ in such things should notwithstanding have inward Charity and outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with one another, not Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring, nor despising, nor divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from each other upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling this point I shall briefly shew you, 1. What I mean by <hi>things indifferent</hi>; 2. What I mean by [smaller matters] 3. What by [doubtfull things or disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons] And then I shall give you the Reasons of it, and then Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Explication, 1. By [<hi>things indifferent</hi>] I do not mean [things <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> indifferent in the use] but [things that are not ordinarily in themselves either commanded as Duties, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as sins, but left as Lawfull or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different by the Scriptures, unless as some accident or circumstance
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48302:183"/>
may make them to be good or evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By [<hi>smaller matters</hi>] its none of my intent to perswade you that any thing that is but an appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to Faith or Piety is <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely small:</hi> But they are <hi>small</hi> in comparison of the far greater things, and so small that many are saved without them, and they are not of flat necessity to salvation; and the Greater matters must be preferred before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By [<hi>things doubtfull</hi>] I do not mean such as are not certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture, nor yet such as perverse Heretical men do raise doubts about when they are plain in themselves: But I mean such points as are revealed certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but more darkly then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter points, and therefore cannot be so clearly known; so that the sum is this, 1. <hi>Indifferent</hi> things must not be taken to be <hi>Necessary,</hi> or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48302:184"/>
                  <hi>sinful,</hi> but to be <hi>indifferent</hi>: 2. <hi>Lower</hi> and <hi>Lesser</hi> points must not be taken to be <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Weightier</hi> then they are. 3. Points of <hi>less certainty</hi> that are more <hi>darkly revealed</hi>; must not be taken to be more <hi>clear and certain</hi> to us, then they are. 4. And it is not on such darker smaller matters that God hath laid our salvation; or that the Churches U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Peace dependeth.</p>
               <p n="2">II. FOr the fuller Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, let these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be observed. 1. If our Unity were laid on these smaller matters, the <hi>multitude</hi> of them is such, that we should never Agree in all. The <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christianity are so few that all men may well be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to learn and know and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them. But the <hi>smaller</hi> points are so many that there is no hope
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48302:184"/>
of an universal Agreement in them all. You know in the Body of man or Beast, the great Master veins that are the stock of all the rest, are but a few; but follow them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you shall have so many Divisions, and sub-divisions, till you find them to be many hundreds or thousands. So is it with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and with the Nerves. The Body of a Tree is but one, and the first division perhaps is but into two or three parts; but follow it to the very ends of the branches, and you may find many thousands. So is it in Divinity: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if none should be in Unity with the Church, but those that understand every branch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian verity, what hope of Union could there be?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover the smaller points are far less discernable then the greater be: and therefore there is the less hope that ever the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48302:185"/>
Church should have Unity in these. The great armes of a Tree are easily discerned, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the branches are very small. The trunks of the master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veins are great and easily seen, but the points and capillar veins are so small, as hardly to be perceived. So God in mercy hath made very plain those few essential points of faith that salvation lyeth on: but if you follow on these generals to all the particulars and appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you shall find them run so small as well as so many, as that it is impossible that Unity should consist in these.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Furthermore, if our Unity were laid on these, Religion would be for none but the learned, and (as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ordinarily argue against the Heathens that cavilled at the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Scripture) God should be then Partial, and should make a way to Heaven that poor men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48302:185"/>
go. For the poor cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly attain to so much Learning, and spend so much of their lives in study, as may bring them to the knowledge of all these lower dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult points.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea if our Unity or Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lay on these, it is certain it would shut us out all, both from Unity and Salvation: so that there would no two be at Unity in all the world, and no One be saved. For all men on earth are Ignorant in many lesser truths, even such as are revealed to us in the Scripture, and we should endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. What man dare affirm that he understandeth every word of the Holy Scripture? Did the Pope himself think that he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this Infallibility, he would ere this have written us an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commentary. If the best must say with <hi>Paul</hi> himself, <hi>we know but in part,</hi> then sure those smaller
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48302:186"/>
doubtful things which all the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sanctified know not, are not the matter of the Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I have shewed in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Catholick Church, that to shut out all from the Church and our Communion that differ from us in such lower things, is utterly against the design of Christ, and the tenour of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and very dishonourable to him and to his Church: God hath more mercy then to shut out the weak: and will you dishonour him so far as to perswade the world, that he hath no such mercy. The design of the Gospel is Grace and Love! How tender was Christ even of his little ones that believe in him? How compassionate is he to them in their infirmities? And would you go about to perswade the world that he hath so little of this compassion, as that he will
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48302:186"/>
admit none to Heaven, or to the Communion of his Church but those that attain to Knowledge and Agreement in all these lesser doubtful Controversies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things? The Church is small enough already; but if you would cut off all, that do not Agree in every circumstance, you would make it small indeed. This is no better, then under pretence of Faith and Unity, to un-Church the Church, and damn your selves, and all the world.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Arguments in the Text are very forcible, verse 3. [<hi>For God hath received him</hi>] As if he should say, Dare you despise or cast out him that <hi>God receiveth</hi>? ver. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another mans servant</hi>? ver. 10. <hi>Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? we shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ?</hi> The
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48302:187"/>
Church doth not censure men for small or doubtful things: nor must we condemn those that God doth not condemn.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The laying such stress on smaller things, doth <hi>multiply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,</hi> and fill the minds of men with scruples, and ensnare their consciences, and engage men in parties against each other to the certain breach of Charity, and ruine of the Peace of the Church, and of their souls. The fire of Contention will never go out for want of fewel, if unnecessary things be made necessary, and small things pretended to be great, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain things pretended to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Abundance of vice will be daily set and kept at work, upon this borrowed stock.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And what a world of <hi>precious Time will be wasted</hi> by this means, while men are Studying and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to maintain their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48302:187"/>
and when they must waste their hours when they are together, in Conferences and wrangling-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, to the discomposing of their own and others minds, and certain troubling the Church of God! Oh what use have we for those precious hours, for surer, greater, and more needful things?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The things that our salvation and the Churches Peace are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> laid upon, are so <hi>great,</hi> so <hi>necessary,</hi> so <hi>pleasant,</hi> and so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> that it leaveth us the more without excuse, to waste our time in things unnecessary. We have our great Creator to know and honour: we have the mysterie of Redemption to search into and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire: we have the Nature, and Life, and Death, and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Ascension, and Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intercession of Christ to study and believe; and all the Love and Wisdom of God, the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48302:188"/>
Mercy, and the Holiness, and Justice that was revealed in him: we have Judgment to prepare for; &amp; all the Graces of the Spirit of Christ to be received, or cherished, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and exercised in our Souls. We have a Hell to scape, and a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to obtain, and the foreseen glory of it to feed upon, for the strengthning and delighting of our Souls: we have many particular duties of Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to attend: And in the midst of all this great employment, should we make more work and trouble to our selves, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout unnecessary things?</p>
               <p n="10">10. These unnecessary or lower things, when once they are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above their ranck, do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and wrong the greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which they pretended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend. They divert the thoughts and speeches from them, and take up the affections, and will not be
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48302:188"/>
contented with their due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but are, as the Proverb is, like a Begger on horse-back, that will never light. If men be but set upon Ceremonies, or private opinions of their own, they are upon it in all companies; and you shall sometimes have almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else from them. And that's not all; but the Interest of their unnecessary, or lower points, is ordinarily set up against the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of that Body of Christian Verities which we are all agreed in; so that they can be contented that Christianity lose much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the greater points, that their cause may be advantaged. If this were not so, we should not have had ceremonies &amp; formalities have cast out such abundance of excellent Preachers heretofore: Nor private Opinions have set so many against the labours of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers, as, to our grief and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48302:189"/>
shame, we have lately seen: And the mischief is, that unnecessary things made <hi>necessary,</hi> do so involve the Imposers interest with their own, that they think they are Necessitated to drive them on, and see their Impositions obeyed, or else their wisdom or authority is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And thus they directly lead men to <hi>persecution,</hi> and occasion those that must needs have their wills, to Lord it over Gods heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.) when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of being the Churches God, hath prevailed so far with any of its members, as to set them upon a course of Law-giving and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, and bringing others into a conformity to their wills; they look upon all men as sinners that disobey them, and think that their power will warrant them to force <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to deprive the Church of her
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48302:189"/>
Pastors. Many a Congregation have I known change Preachers for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; when as if Gods Will and Word in <hi>Necessary</hi> things to mens <hi>Salvation,</hi> had but been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the will and word of the Bishops, about things called <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> by themselves, the case had been altered; and they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have let the ignorant have been without a Ceremony then a Sermon. It is the unhappy fate of almost all that are set upon unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that others should have the liberty of differing from them. It is not enough to them to enjoy the freedom of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, about meats, or holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, or gestures or vestures, or other formalities, unless all others be compelled to do as they do. When they are but moved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with others, though plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48302:190"/>
Cathilick Church be justly alledged for it, yet it moveth them little or nothing. But if others will not comply with them, they cry out against them as enemies to Unity and Peace; and say, It is not fit to suffer men to be of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minds and waies. That is, It is fit all should be compelled to do as they would have them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And another mischief that followeth the making unnecessary things to be Necessary, is, that it openeth a gap to so many more of the same kind, that no man knows how to stop it, nor when we have Ceremonies and inventions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: But upon the same ground that these are brought in to day, the next Pope or Bishop thinks he may bring another tomorrow; and so we can never tell when we have all, nor when will be an end.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And then in the <hi>multitude</hi> of things <hi>unnecessary,</hi> we shall be
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48302:190"/>
in danger of losing the things that are <hi>necessary,</hi> they will be so buryed or obscured in the crowd: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will scarce be perceived for the ceremony.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And me thinks it is such height of Pride for mortal men to arrogate such a power, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavour such a thing, that I wonder how they dare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. I mean to make universal or unnecessary Laws for the Church in the matters of faith or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Can a man that hath one spark of humility left in him, desire that his will may be a Law to all others, in doubtful or indifferent things? and proceed so far as to desire that none may have Liberty in the Church that are not of his opinion, or will not be ruled by him, in things indifferent or of no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Surely a man of any humility would think with himself, <hi>Am not I also imperfect in knowledge? and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48302:191"/>
may I not be mistaken? what is my judgement that it should be a Law to the Church, and that I should be so highly conceited and confident of it, as to turn out godly Ministers or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Church or worship of God, for not conforming themselves to my opinion in things of such a low indifferent nature</hi>! He that would be the Law-giver to the Church, and suffer none but those of his own opinion in such points, would be the Lord of the Church, which can know the voice of none but Christ, and owneth no other Lord but him.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And the sin is the greater because they have so little Interest or pretence to lead them to these usurpations: They must have their will though it get them nothing. Who made them Law-givers to the Church of Christ? Cannot they allow Christ this part of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to make Laws for his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48302:191"/>
Church? And cannot they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a Ministerial power, to proclaim and promote the Laws of Christ, and according to these to guide his Church?</p>
               <p n="16">16. And hereby men are drawn to a humane kind of Religion: And they do more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, obey and worship these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers then Jesus Christ: when they must fetch the very matter of their Religion, not from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Canons or Decrees of men, their conscience, obedience and reward will be according thereunto.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And hereby the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church have occasion to insult over us, and think our Differences to be more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are. When the Unity of the Church is laid upon things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different or of smalest moment, there will presently be disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and these will be the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48302:192"/>
matter of reproach. It is this that makes the Papists tell us of our differences among our selves, because we have made them seem something to them, when they are next to nothing. <hi>O</hi> say they, <hi>where is your Church of England now</hi>? why! what's the matter? Is the Church of <hi>England</hi> dead? Or is any thing taken down that was es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to the Church of <hi>England</hi>! was a Prelacy ruling by a lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor over many hundred Parishes, chosen and Governing without the body of the Clergy, Essential to the Church of <hi>England</hi>? I am confident the most of the sober godly Ministers in <hi>England,</hi> are for the Apostolical primitive Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy still. Was the Book of Canons, or the Book of Common Prayer, or the Ceremonies Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Church of <hi>England</hi>? Sure they were not; And if so, its living still. But if any say that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48302:192"/>
these <hi>were</hi> Essential to it, we may thank them for the <hi>death</hi> of it, that made it of such a <hi>humane mortal</hi> frame, which any Prince might spurn down at his pleasure. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church or Churches of Christ in <hi>England,</hi> are of a more heavenly durable frame, that may be persecuted, but hardly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while the men are living, of whom it doth consist.</p>
               <p>Hence also it is that the Papists tell us that we have changed all our worship. And wherein? why we have not the same Baptism that we had; nor the same administration of the Lords Supper, nor the same publick Prayer, nor the same way of Marrying, Churching, Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what's the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Is it that we say not at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time the very same words? why so you may as well say, that <hi>Paul</hi> was mutable, because he wrot not the same words in every one of his
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48302:193"/>
Epistles, nor spoke not the same words in all his Prayers, no not in publick. And so both you and we are mutable, because we preach not the same words every day in our Sermons. God hath bid us Pray; but he hath prescribed us no necessary form of words, but the Lords Prayer. If the difference be that we use not the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Book; doth that make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sort of worship? Is it not the same sort of worship if we say the same words, or words to the same sence, either on the Book or off it? If once men lay the Nature of worship and the Unity of the Church upon things unnecessary, then what changes will seem to be in our worship, when indeed theres none? Then the Papists may tell us of our divisions in worship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one man sitteth at the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Psalms and another stands; and one readeth with spectacles
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48302:193"/>
and another without; and one weareth a cap, and another wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none; and one preacheth on one Text and another upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But be it known to all the Papists in the world, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not changed at all: Our worship is the same whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Book or without. Our Prayers are the same for matter with those in the Common Prayer Book. And if I should one day use the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer Book, and another day forbear it, I should not change the worship of God. To <hi>pray</hi> is part of his worship: but whether it be <hi>on</hi> a Book or <hi>off</hi> it, is no part at all, but only a <hi>mode,</hi> or <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> which may be altered as occasion serveth. I doubt not but a Book is fittest for some; but not for all. And do they think that we know not what adding and chopping and changing they have made with their Mass Book? Who
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48302:194"/>
is it then that hath changed <hi>their</hi> worship? Is it like the same Book that it was before the changes made by <hi>Gregory</hi> the great? It was so ordinary a thing to change the manner and forms of worshp, that private Bishops did it without any Synods: whence else had the world the forms that are now in use? Tell us how many of those in the <hi>Biblioth. Patrum</hi> were made by Apostle, or General Council, if you can. When <hi>Basil</hi> the great had set up a new way of singing to God, and made some other changes in worship, the Clergy of <hi>Neocesarea</hi> were offended with him for the novelty, and told him that none of that was used in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s dayes: To whom he answers that neither was their own Letany known in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s dayes, (who yet had lived not 140 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was the famous founder of their Church by miracles.)
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48302:194"/>
                  <hi>Basil</hi> Epist. 63. And <hi>Basil</hi> added to the Clergie of <hi>Neocesara. [But how can you tell that these things were not in use in Gregories daies, when you have kept nothing unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged which he was used to?</hi>] And that you may see his mind in this, he adds [<hi>But I pardon all these things, (though God will examine all:) Only let the principal things be kept safe.</hi>] If we had changed the Sacraments as the Papists have done, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Commemorative</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice into a <hi>Real</hi> Sacrifice of Christ himself; the <hi>Sacramental</hi> Body and blood of Christ into the <hi>Real</hi> Body and blood; the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of it in <hi>both kinds,</hi> into <hi>one kind</hi> alone, defrauding the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the cup; the <hi>Communion</hi> into a <hi>private Mass,</hi> the people only looking on the Priest, when he receiveth alone himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, had we made such changes as these, they might have called us
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48302:195"/>
changelings indeed, and have told us of novelties in the worship of God.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Moreover this laying so much upon lower or unnecessary things, doth impoverish the soul, and make it low and empty and formal, according to the matter that it hath to work upon. As the great unquestionable Truths of God, are they that sanctifie and elevate the soul, and leave their Image on it; so will contending about private opinions, or laying out our zeal in ceremonies and shaddows, depress the soul and famish it, and turn our Religion into a shaddow. We find by sad experience that people are so prone to turn all Religion into meer words and shews and customary formalityes, that when we have done our best, we cannot cure them of this mortal sin: <hi>God is a Spirit, and will have such worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48302:195"/>
as worship him in spirit and in truth,</hi> John 4.23. We have little need to cherish this disease of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie &amp; seeming histrionical out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Religiousness, when we see so many perish by it after all that we can do for their deliverance.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And this making a Religion of unnecessary things, or laying the Churches Unity thereon, is a dangerous snare to delude the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ungodly, and make them believe that they are godly people, and in the way to Heaven as well as others. I use not this or any Argument against the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use of any forms in order to the understanding of the matter; nor against the due circumstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the worship of God: But if profitable forms, and Gods own Ordinances are somwhat lyable to this abuse, we cannot devise how to increase the danger, and quite enthral these miserable souls more
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48302:196"/>
certainly then by multiplying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary formalityes, and placing Religion and Unity in them. For they that are most ignorant, and empty of the Love and fear of God, and the bitterest enemies to a Heavenly life, will presently set in with these formalities, and make themselves a Religion of these; and then they will take themselves as godly as the best. You shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make them believe that they are ungodly. They think the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lyeth but in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of serving God: <hi>You</hi> serve him <hi>one way,</hi> and <hi>they another</hi>; but yet they <hi>serve him</hi> as well as you: Yea they will <hi>overdo</hi> in these <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> things, that they may make up that which is wanting in true godliness; and then they will think that they are better and righter then you. Thus did the Heathens cry out against the ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with a <hi>Tollite impios, away
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48302:196"/>
with the ungodly</hi>; and killed them and cast them to wild beast to be torn by them, because they would not worship their Idols. And so many ungodly wretches now that will not be perswaded to a Holy life, will yet cry dow others as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious because they observe not all the Ceremonies which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. When we have used all the means we can to bring them to the study of the Scripture, and to meditate in the Law of the Lord, and to holy conference, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer; to hatred of sin, the contempt of the world, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the flesh, to the Love of God above all, to a thankful admiration of the Love of Christ, and the great mystery of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, to the believing, delightful forethoughts of everlasting life, and preparation for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, when we have done all to bring them to this which is godlyness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48302:197"/>
we lose our labour, and leave them as we find them. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with so precise a life: But yet a Religion they will have <hi>instead</hi> of it, to deceive their souls, and quiet them in the way to Hell. For instance, I must speak it with grief of heart, that I meet with no small number among us that know not who Christ is; some say he is God and not man; some say, he is man and not God; some say he was made both God and man at once: some say he is neither God nor man, but a Spirit: some say, he is not God, but the Son of God, and hath the power of God given him: Abundance say that he is God only and not man, now he is in Heaven, though he was both on earth: and very many know not what Christianity is, nor wherein the Christian Religion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. And yet all these persons, that are Heathens rather then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48302:197"/>
are the most zealous Keepers of <hi>Christmass</hi> (as it is called,) and the bitterest condemners of those that do not; and so do make themselves believe that they are Christians as well as others. The same persons that know not who Christ is, nor what it is to be a Christian, are so much for kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the taking of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they dare not be so unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent as to sit or stand; but will ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her never receive at all: (nor are they fit till they change in a greater matter then the gesture:) And yet, poor souls, they think themselves to be very Religious, and more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent then others, and that here lyeth the difference between them. It would grieve the heart of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate man, to see a multitude of miserable sinners, to live in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, in cursing, swearing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, filthiness, neglect of God and a holy life, drowned in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedness,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48302:198"/>
and as regardless of the life to come as if they thought they should die like the beasts: and even hating those that will not be ungodly as well as they; and yet as hot for Ceremonies, and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Common-prayer-Book, as if they were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout then others and it seems they have made themselves believe in good earnest that they are true Christians and Godly men, because in the depth of their ungodliness they can make a stir against those that will not be of their mind, and use these Ceremonies as well as they.</p>
               <p>If any of you say, that I am now speaking against your opinions or Ceremonies themselves, as if I could not give you leave to use them, you will but shew your selves mistaking hearers, and false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters. No, it is the laying too
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48302:198"/>
much stress on these matters, and making <hi>Indifferent</hi> things seem <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> as if Gods Worship, or the Unity of the Church lay on them, which I speak against: And therefore I must needs say, that both sides may be guilty of this sin: Principally the <hi>Imposers</hi> of them, that would have all men forc't to do as they do; and next them there may be too much guilt in those that make indifferent things seem <hi>evil,</hi> or lesser evils to be much greater then they are, and so would make a Religion of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what others make it their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to observe. And whether your Religion lie in being <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> these points in question (such as the Apostle speaks of in my Text) is no great difference: For the Religion of both will prove but a meer shadow: yea an over hot opposing of such Middle things, doth teach those that are for them
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48302:199"/>
to believe that they are matters of very great moment, or else they think you would not make so great a matter of them. And then when <hi>you</hi> have taught them by your fierce opposition, to make a <hi>Great matter</hi> of them; and <hi>custom</hi> and their party hath taught them to think their way is best; both these set together do delude their souls, and make them think that because of their Formalities, they are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, in the depths of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ungodliness and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Lastly, observe how we sin against the sad experience of the Church in all Ages, by laying our Religion or Unity upon these smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or unnecessary things. What hath distracted the Church so much as contendings about their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Orders, and preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and superiority! Heresies I know have done their part (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48302:199"/>
the <hi>Arrians:</hi>) but smaller matters have had two great a hand in it: what plentifull evidence could I give you of this? The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable divisions of the Christian world about <hi>Easter</hi> day, which the first General Council was fain to meet about and decide, is too sad an Instance. But, alas, the present Age it self hath given us too sad and plenteous proofs of it. By a heap of Ceremonies, and unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath almost drownd both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worship and Discipline of Christ, and miserably torn the Church in pieces, and so continues to do. And what work this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake hath made in <hi>England,</hi> I have no minde to tell you, while our smart and sufferings tell you of it more plainly then is fit for me to do. Indifferent things have shut out that which was better then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Consider well these
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48302:200"/>
twenty Reasons, and then judge whether <hi>the Religion or Vnity</hi> of the Church should be placed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary things. The imposing of them I shall speak of by it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> FRom the Text and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine explained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, we may see these following Consectaries arise.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we see the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to them that are sincere in the Faith, though weak. If their understandings be dark, and their judgements in lesser things mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and their Consciences therein erroneous; yet if they be but true Believers, and right in the main, and willing to know the mind of God and to obey it, God would not have them excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with charity and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48302:200"/>
and would have the stranger bear with their infirmities (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1.) He will not himself reject them; and therefore he would not have them rejected or despised by his Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Hence also we may see, that God will bear more, and so must his Church, with smaller Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, then with the uncharitable or dividing management of those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Though men should erre about meats or days or such like matters, we must yet receive them and love them as Believers: But yet if they will hereupon despise, or censure one another to the breach of Charity, and trouble of the Church, for this they must be sharply rebuked, as <hi>Paul</hi> here doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. Hence also you may learn, How far men should desire
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48302:201"/>
and enjoy a Liberty in matters of Religion, and how far the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate should interpose with force, and how far not. A liberty to live in sin, or to subvert the Gospel, and the souls of others, the Magistrate should give to none: But a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in things of a lower nature, that hazardeth not mens souls, nor the Unity of the Church, should be granted to the weak. Can we be bound with Charity to receive them, and yet to provoke the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to punish them, and deal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verelyer with them then we! This may not be desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4. Hence also you may see what an enemy Popery is to the Unity of the Church, and how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is that the Church should have Unity upon their terms: when they have composed a Religion of so many Ceremonies, and unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things, and new devised Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 5. To conclude, I advise all that are unfeigned friends to the Unity of the Church, to practise the wholsom Doctrine of this Text. If you have Zeal, there's sin enough in your selves and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

much as weak Believers, and <hi>seem</hi> not Saints at least of the lower form, receive not these into your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but leave them under your common compassionate cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If you can prove that God receiveth them not, then do not you Receive them. But as you are Christians, take heed of cutting off or despising the Members of Christ; and of giving a Bill of divorce to any soul that is truly espoused to him: You have Drunkards, and Railers, and notorious ungodly ones enough to exercise all your Zeal, if you joyn both head and heart and hand against them: And can you find in your hearts to fall upon one another for indifferent things, or smaller matters, which the Unity of the Church doth not consist in? I speak to both sides impartially; and I beseech you so understand me. What if thy weak
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48302:202"/>
Brother <hi>pray upon a Book,</hi> darest thou therefore <hi>despise</hi> him? and what if thy Brother <hi>pray without Book,</hi> darest thou therefore judge him? Nay darest thou desire that none but such should have liberty to Preach or Worship in the Church? What if thy weak Brother dare not receive the Sacrament unless he Kneel in the act of receiving it? darest thou therefore despise him? And what if thy Brother on the other side, do rather take it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gesture, because he is sure that Christ and his Apostles sinned not in so doing, and because he finds that our Kneeling is contrary to the practice of the ancient Church (yea <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I may say) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to General Councils, yea to the last Canon of the first General Council it self, which even the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists say that no Provincial Council, or Bishops can repeal
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48302:203"/>
(with many other reasons;) dare you therefore judge him, because he dare not imitate you rather then Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Church for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years? If any imagine that I go against this necessary Toleration my self, because all here receive the Sacrament sitting; I answer, Let them prove that ever I refused one person meerly because they would take it Kneeling, if they can. If you say, Why then are not all admitted to take it Kneeling? I answer, Soft and fair; There are greater matters then Kneeling in the way. Do but first let go your vicious courses, and agree with us in a holy life, &amp; turn unfeignedly to God, and live in the Church Order that he hath plainly commanded; and then, if I cannot give you satisfaction, you shall have liberty to take it in the gesture that you desire, so be it you will

grant me my liberty as I grant you yours.</p>

I am perswaded it may prevent a great deal of sin, that many of you on both sides may be guilty of. Is it not a wonder that after so large and plain a decision by the Holy Ghost, as here you find, there should yet be any controversie among us about this Case? Do you take the word of God for your Rule or not? If you do, why then doth it not Rule you, and end the difference? Do you not read the Apostl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But nothing will serve some men, but their own wills. Dare you on the one side, despise your weak Brother now for esteeming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hese days above the rest? Why perhaps it is to God that he esteemeth it: and the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custom of the Church, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of many godly persons, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him that it is right: And dare you on the other side con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or reproach them that make not this difference of days as you do? If we are contented that you have your Liberty (which truly I would not deprive you of, if it were in my power) cannot you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that we have ours? There are three opinions about these Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48302:204"/>
days. 1. Some think the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them a necessary Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duty. 2. Some think the very outward observance to be an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable sin. 3. Some know that both these extreams are erroneous, and therefore they take the thing in it self to be indifferent, but as circumstances or accidents may make it Good or Evil: And these are in the right. They that are in the Middle can bear with others, but the other cannot bear with them, nor with each other. There is no proof that ever I saw, that the Church observed any of these days, of many hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ. For the <hi>Clement,</hi> the <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the <hi>Cyprian</hi> that are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it, are known to be spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And it is unlikely that none of these would have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as the Lords day, if they had been then observed, when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48302:205"/>
there was so much ado about the time of <hi>Easter</hi> day. Yea it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that of divers hundred years after Christ, it was not agreed on, which was the day of Christs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; some thought it was on <hi>Ianuary</hi> 6. and therefore called it the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or Appearance: And of old both the birth day and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of Christ were supposed to be on that same day, that is, on the sixth of <hi>Ianuary.

                  <hi>Romans</hi> had perswaded the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to change the day to <hi>December</hi> 25. And yet the Countryes about <hi>Ierusalem</hi> held to the 6. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> as <hi>Causabon</hi> hath shewed, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 170, 171. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 186, 187. Yea indeed the Day of Christs Nativity is <hi>yet</hi> unknown, as if God had kept us ignorant of purpose: Many very learned men, as <hi>Broughton, Helvicus, Scaliger, Beroaldus,</hi> think that the day was about <hi>Autumn</hi> in the beginning of <hi>October: Calvisius, Paraeus,</hi> and many more are for other times then <hi>December</hi> 25. and <hi>Iac. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> and many others still go the old way for <hi>Ianuary</hi> 6. And <hi>Th. Lydiat</hi> out of <hi>Clem. Alexandr.</hi> is for <hi>May</hi> 20. <hi>Scultetus, Clopen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgius</hi> and many others do shew that indeed the time is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. And no wonder if the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48302:206"/>
day be uncertain when the very <hi>year</hi> is so uncertain, that there is no probability of ever comeing to a full agreement about it among the Learned in Chronologie till the last comeing of Christ agree them. Our late most Learned Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (Bishop <hi>Vsher)</hi> was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we were about four years too late in our common account, as in his Annals may be seen. And what man can reveal the things that God hath purposely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? For my part, I dare not judge men for keeping or not keeping such daies as these. But if any will make it a <hi>necessary</hi> thing to the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> Church, I must resist that usurpation; as <hi>Paul</hi> that had Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> did cry down cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision when some would have obtruded it as a necessary thing. And for this I have an Argument that sustaineth my Religion it self
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48302:206"/>
even the sufficiency of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. If this be not the Law of God, then farewel Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: If it be his Law, it is sufficient in its kind, and to its ends, which is 1. To determine of all things that were then fit to be determined of: 2. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of all that the Universal Church in all times after must be bound to. There is no Universal Law-giver but Christ. If this day be of Necessity, it <hi>was</hi> so <hi>then</hi> as well as <hi>now,</hi> and it <hi>is</hi> so to <hi>one</hi> Country as well as <hi>another</hi>: for there is the same reason for it in one age and place as in another. And therefore if Scripture be not a sufficient Rule for Universal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, then we are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly at a loss; and as Popery will come first in, so Infidelity is likely to come next.

And sure I am that the one day in seven, even the Lords-day, of his own appointment, which the Universal Church hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly observed, is a Festival for the commemoration of the <hi>whole work
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48302:207"/>
of Redemption,</hi> and therefore of the <hi>Birth</hi> of Christ, though espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Resurrection</hi>: And therefore we are not without a Day for this use.</p>
               <p>I speak not all this to condemne any that use these daies; but to excuse those that use them not, and by telling you a few of those many reasons which they have to give for themselves, to perswade you both to lay by the opinion of Necessity, and to forbear condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those that differ from you, and be content that <hi>they</hi> have <hi>their</hi> liberty, as we are freely content that you have yours; and Lay not the <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church upon such things as these, when the Holy Ghost hath so plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the case. And I could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish that the Lords own day were not most wilfully neglected
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48302:208"/>
by many that are most forward for other Holy-daies. Its a fearful self-delusion of ungodly people that no means can bring them to a New, a Holy and Heavenly life; and yet they will make themselves believe that they are Religious, by pleading for forms, and dayes and ceremonies. Alass poor soul, if thy eyes were but opened, thou wouldst see that thou hast other kind of matters first to look after! It would grieve one to hear a man contending for Kneeling and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and Prayer-books, that is in a state of unregeneracy, and a stranger to sanctification, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of his sins, and under the curse and wrath of God. Get first a new and holy Nature; make sure of the pardon of sin, and of Peace with God, and then the discourse of lower matters will be more seasonable and more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:48302:208"/>Is it not a shameful self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to keep Holy-dayes for the dead Saints, and to hate and rail against the Living? Do you know what kind of men those were that are called <hi>Saints,</hi> and Holy-dayes were kept in remembrance of them? They were such as those that now are hated by the world, and took the course in a holy and diligent care of their salvation, as these do, and therefore were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the world, as the godly now are; and when wicked men had put them to death, the godly that survived would keep a day in remembrance of their Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to encourage others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy for Christ. And also because the unruly multitude were so set upon their pleasure, that they kept the Idols festivals for their sport sake; therefore some Pastors of the Church did think it better to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48302:209"/>
let them have Festivals for the Saints to take their pleasure in, to turn them off from the Idols fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals. So <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> tells us of <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> in his Oration of his life, that he made Holy-dayes for his neighbours of <hi>Neocesarea,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> fury had Martyred many; and he used this as a pious wile to draw the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious Vulgar from the Idols fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals, by letting them play on the Martyrs dayes, till they could be drawn up to a holy observation of them. Whether the course were right or wrong, by this you may see the Original of such dayes. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the great of <hi>Rome,</hi> would for this very end, have all the Heathens Festivals turned into Christian Festivals. But if any of you will hate a Saint, and refuse the Communion of Saints, and will not imitate them in Holiness,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48302:209"/>
and yet will keep Holy-dayes for them that are dead, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath given you your doom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.29, 30, 31, 32, 33. which I desire you to read.</p>
               <p>Well Sirs, I have said enough, if enough will serve, to prove that the Unity of the Church must not be laid on things Indifferent, nor upon low or doubtful points; but it must be a Unity in the Spirit of Sanctification. It is in the few, the great, the certain and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary points, that we must all agree in if ever we will agree, and compassionately tolerate the differences that are tolerable.</p>
               <p>If after all this, there be any so Proud, and selfish, and ungodly, and unmerciful, that they will set up their own Conceits and Wills against the plain Commands of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:48302:210"/>
God, the long and sad experience of the world, and against the Peace of their Brethren, and the Unity of the Church, and will have no Agreement unless all others will be conformed to their Wills, I shall now say no more to such, but that These are not the sons of Peace, nor the living compassionate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, but self-ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers that God is engaged to pull down: And it is not by such as these that the Church must be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and repaired: But it is by them that are sensible of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and compassionate to others, that are of a Christian Catholick Spirit, and have Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Principles and Affections, and see such a beauty in the Image of Christ, that they can heartily Love a gracious person, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his many tolerable infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and think themselves more
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48302:210"/>
unworthy to be tolerated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then such as I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be tolerated by them.</p>
