            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Could hardly compose my thoughts, touching the presentation of these my unworthy endevors, to one so worthy, and truly noble as your Lordship, having no excuse but your goodnesse, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of those who are truly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="tcp:12998:5"/>
of your vertues: Among which number I desire to be knowne. I have nothing to plead for my <hi>Muse,</hi> but that the Subject with the Title, do agree: And that the fruit she beares, is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, though soure. That which fals with shaking, is not worth taking up. I know I shall undergoe the censure of some, that can Judge of nothing but what they see; having narrow spirits, only roome for sense at the worst. In respect of such, my <hi>Muse</hi> was safer walking by Night; than now by Day. But if it shall please your Lordship to support her with your hand, and looke upon that little good which may appeare through a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glasse, and extenuate the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Envy her selfe will keep at a distance; and shee shall passe with freedome, gayning commendations from your Honours Approbation. She's so farre adorned with modesty amongst her Opposites, that she will

not bespeak a glance from your eye, but when you be retir'd from more weighty occasions. If I should write but what high-borne Fame speakes of your worth, and call your noble Vertues by their names, I should make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance so pleasing-large, that the Reader would there take up his rest. But it shall be satisfaction to me, that she's grac'd with your name: which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her from living graves.

            <p>(I Name thee as I would find thee) having had thoughts which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten press'd mee to the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this neglected subject, (not as sinfull, but neglected in the discovery) I could not chuse but give entertainment (at last) to so reasonable a motion: yet not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make a work of it, but only to give a few hints for warning, and Characters to know those devouring locusts, who strive to spoile all the green plants of the land.</p>
            <p>But as I pursued some of them in the chace, I started more of the brood; and the further I went, the more I found, till at last, I saw neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
<pb facs="tcp:12998:7"/>
of adding resolution and courage to my purpose; and to search them out for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which some have done for pleasure. I found many fearfull exploits amongst them, which being but abridged, made these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers swell into such a thicknesse. Those that are resolved to follow their lusts, regarding nothing, or spoke or writ, let them not passe the front of this Book, lest they be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented before their time: and suck poyson till they burst. I know some like snarling Curres will bite the Chaine, though they breake their teeth; and baule at what they understand not; quarrell with their owne shadowes, or bark at the man in the Moon. The painted doxies, and the musk-powd'red Curtizans will be as angry with me, as <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> was with the Mice, for haunting her lamp, and gnawing her caule: and others will cast out smoke and lightning, as <hi>Saturnus</hi> did among the Armies of the Frogs and Mice: but I would wish them (as a friend) to say little, what e're they think, lest they bespeake a smarter whip for themselves.

Censure on the rest. The sharpnesse of it is qualified, where advice takes place, and there are none that read but may gaine, or delight, or profit, more or lesse, if they stand not in their own light. I have used their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in some places to set out their folly. Though every Phrase or Sentence be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of real truth, yet there is a probability or morality of truth in all. I need not shew how a Metaphoricall, Analogicall, or an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall speech retaines truth; or how the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures lead to the substance; or of the liberty of speech that Poetry affords: In this I had rather learne than teach. I have not us'd knotty words, nor rocky expressions in the prosecution of it; but in as sutable termes, as my slender wit, with so little art, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Perhaps, the best may find more than they expect; and the worst more than they desire. My <hi>Muse</hi> hath kept her selfe from infection, notwithstanding the many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, occasions, provocations that she hath met withall in her search. I suppose.

gestures, speeches, fawning, alluring, &amp;c. before he had any practicall experience of them. But if any aske why must I undertake such a work? I answer; why should not any man use the gifts that he hath received to profit himselfe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? especially if delight put him upon it? or if his occasions impose not a necessiy of other imployments upon him? I was never so bound to any but I could purchase some time to raise my <hi>Genius</hi> above these earthly contents below. For the verses, I have kept to one number and measure, only the <hi>Epitaphs</hi> are woven stanza's: In a continued subject, it is not proper to vary the verse.</p>
            <p>I have laboured to make the lines so smooth as I could, in placing the breathing accents where they may fall with most advantage, (except those which run cleane without them) nor have I broke the first, or last foot of the verse, which might make it run harsh, nor straind the coupling accents above what is required in the harmony: nor fallen too low in the descent, which might give the verse an unnaturall sound, where the concords should cheifly meet.</p>
            <p>If you find any verse a syllable too short in the number, then compare the measure with it;
<pb facs="tcp:12998:8"/>
for if there be a monosyllable that sounds long uppon the letter[r] it will answer to a Spondey, or a Trochey, consisting of two syllables; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the breathing or the coupling accents. If any seem too long, observe but the cadence, which may fall a syllable longer in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, yet answer with a true sound: or cls it may fall low, that a Dactyle which consists of three syllables, beares but the sound of two: and many words consisting of two, three, foure, or five syllables, do naturally fall a syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable shorter in the pronunciation; or being cut short by Apostrophes, 'twill resolve the doubt. I commit my <hi>Muse</hi> to your care; her colour's black and white, you may trust her: she has been purg'd in the <hi>Search,</hi> and prest for revealing secrets; she'll both give and take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by it, and wisheth the Reader to do the like.</p>

               <l>I could not call it day, nor was it night:</l>
               <l>But being refresht, the notions of my braine</l>
               <l>Somewhat reviv'd, homeward I came againe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I heard a cry, and as I pass'd along</l>
               <l>With listning found it was a womans tongue:</l>
               <l>A man replying (made the noise much more)</l>
               <l>With rayling words, Out of my sight you whore,</l>
               <l>Ile travell far enough; What, cannot I</l>
               <l>Accompany my friends, but presently</l>
               <l>Thou must controule me? go thou dirty hag.</l>
               <l>Ile bang thy sides, and make thee work, or beg.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The womans answer modest was, and milde;</l>
               <l>Alas, you know that I am big with childe;</l>
               <l>I've little ones beside, I am afraid</l>
               <l>If you mend not, they'll be through want destroid:</l>
               <l>You care not for us, nor provide us meat,</l>
               <l>We often sit and have no bread to eat:</l>
               <l>You spend what ere you get upon a whore,</l>
               <l>And now you will be gone to vex me more:</l>
               <l>What case am I now in? oh! if you leave me,</l>
               <l>I wish the grave more kinde, and to receive me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then coming to'em, she exprest her griefe</l>
               <l>To me at large (I gave her some reliefe)</l>
               <l>But he with fury rayl'd, till at the last</l>
               <l>A Constable did make him cry as fast;</l>
               <l>Who coming, knew the case, where he did dwell;</l>
               <l>And to the Iustice neere to new Bridewell</l>
               <l>He had bin brought, but that I made request</l>
               <l>For him; he promist to forsake the nest</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:12998:29"/>Of bawdy strumpets, and to end the strife</l>
               <l>He did confesse his faults, and cleare his wife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet afterwards this vassall was as bad</l>
               <l>As bad might be; which made his wife run mad,</l>
               <l>And so she still remaines: this gave more strength</l>
               <l>Vnto my purpose; then my Muse at length</l>
               <l>Possest with fury, prest with thoughts, grew bold</l>

               <l>It is the sin she strikes at, 'tis her end</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Her meaning is, in making sharp her pen,</l>
               <l>To drive ill spirits out, and save the men.</l>
               <l>She feares not envie, <hi>Ignoramus</hi> least;</l>
               <l>One's curst, but weak, and bayard's but a beast.</l>
               <l>If thou dost meet her, use her well (she's free)</l>
               <l>Or else she may unlookt for meet with thee.</l>
               <l>She smiles, yet grieves, to heare how some will roare,</l>
               <l>Although they purchase hell to get a whore.</l>
               <l>Thy night is come; go, quickly call the watch;</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THe true borne Poet, that doth bend his quill</l>
                  <l>To scan the world, and finding out the ill,</l>
                  <l>Provides a cure; and still it is his care</l>
                  <l>To launce the sore, that others may beware:</l>
                  <l>He's temperate, wise, and modest, he will sit</l>
                  <l>In company to pollish ore the wit.</l>
                  <l>He's harmlesse in his life; no person, place</l>
                  <l>Are hid from his conceits: he shewes that face.</l>
                  <l>That's most obscur'd: his <hi>Genius</hi> and his pen</l>
                  <l>May make you think his spirit lives in men.</l>
                  <l>He's like a little world; for all things there</l>
                  <l>Obtaine a being in their proper spheare.</l>
                  <l>All men do meet in him; his searching Art</l>
                  <l>Sucks in the sweet, and creame of every part,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:12998:30"/>Gull, knave, or foole, before he'll let him passe,</l>
                  <l>He'll learne the true character of an asse.</l>
                  <l>He sets out sin (most lively) black as hell,</l>
                  <l>To fright men from the bait; he can as well</l>
                  <l>Display't in parts, or grosse, or both, or either,</l>
                  <l>(Though sin and he were never bred together)</l>
                  <l>As well as any curious painter can</l>
                  <l>The fashion of a landskip or a man.</l>
                  <l>The guilty man may read his sin, his shame,</l>
                  <l>And call it his, although there's not his name:</l>
                  <l>But vertue in her beauty he hath knowne,</l>
                  <l>He makes all sure, and takes her for his owne:</l>
                  <l>Then spreads her beauty, that the world may see</l>
                  <l>Shee's lovely in herselfe; and all may be</l>
                  <l>Corivals in this match; for she will do</l>
                  <l>Favours to men, and yet be modest too.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He is a maker, not alone of verse,</l>
                  <l>But of the matter too; he doth rehearse</l>
                  <l>Much substance in a word: he can compose</l>
                  <l>His lofty fancies, or in verse, or prose:</l>
                  <l>But if in verse, how smoothly doth it glide</l>
                  <l>Into the heart? the memory beside</l>
                  <l>Retaines it best: his raptures do translate</l>
                  <l>The mindes of some into a happy state.</l>
                  <l>His numbers with his measures do agree;</l>
                  <l>The accents meet with such sweet harmony:</l>
                  <l>The emphasis is raised with such grace,</l>
                  <l>That all concurs to keep both time and place.</l>
                  <l>Good language in his lines he doth expresse,</l>
                  <l>His couplings joyne with sense; he is no lesse</l>
                  <l>Than heire to <hi>Parnassus:</hi> h'had such a draught</l>
                  <l>At <hi>Helicon,</hi> that he is rightly taught</l>
                  <l>To speake the native tone of all the nine;</l>

                  <l>Iambique like, or if Pentameters,</l>
                  <l>Or double meeters, or Hexameters;</l>
                  <l>Or if he pitch upon Heroick straines:</l>
                  <l>'Twill speak his praise, because his season'd braines</l>
                  <l>Cast out no drosse; he's modest in his line,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>True profit and delight do meet together</l>
                  <l>In his conceits: although the foole findes neither.</l>
                  <l>His lines are stor'd with witty usefull pleasure;</l>
                  <l>Though idiots sleight, wise men will prize his treasure.</l>
                  <l>His company is sweet to those that know</l>
                  <l>How to make use on't: but he'll seldome throw</l>
                  <l>His breath away upon a scornfull asse,</l>
                  <l>A brute he came, and so he'll let him passe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He takes nor fables, nor conceited dreams,</l>
                  <l>Nor idle fictions to make up his theames;</l>
                  <l>Yet he will use them, onely to allude</l>
                  <l>To good, or ill, to shame the multitude.</l>
                  <l>If melancholy, then he's wise, and grave,</l>
                  <l>Griefe, sorrow, death, are subjects he will have</l>
                  <l>To work upon; he gives his words by weight;</l>
                  <l>With vaine delights he's quite out of conceit.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If he be pleasant, all his writings tend</l>
                  <l>To take men with delight: he will commend</l>
                  <l>A little good, to make'em love the rest:</l>
                  <l>He's sad'mongst bad men, merry with the best.</l>
                  <l>He'll dash an evill out of favour, then</l>
                  <l>He'll let it blood, but comfort up the men.</l>
                  <l>He slights the world, nor will he ever be</l>
                  <l>A favorite to prodigalitie.</l>
                  <l>He's free to all, regarding not his store,</l>
                  <l>And that's the reason he is often poore.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:12998:31"/>He hates lascivious rimes, he'll not applaud</l>

                  <l>T'had better bin undone; for time will staine</l>

                  <l>New fancies as he goes; the spring within</l>
                  <l>Runs alwayes fresh: he doth not trade abroad</l>

                  <l>Persons, and things of worth: and still his bent</l>
                  <l>Is how to shame the vile, and give content</l>

                  <l>And lustre of a poem: and from thence</l>

                  <l>Come, come, my old acquaintance! gentle Bawd!</l>
                  <l>Thy constant service I must needs applaud:</l>
                  <l>The Queene of hell salutes thee; Dost thou smile?</l>
                  <l>To think thou hast bin absent all this while?</l>

                  <l>Thou serv'd it me young; when that way did not hold,</l>
                  <l>Thou did'st me better service being old:</l>
                  <l>In harboring those that have a minde to play</l>
                  <l>Their lands, their time, their soules and all away.</l>
                  <l>I put much trust in thee, and thou art true</l>
                  <l>Still to my kingdome; honour is thy due,</l>
                  <l>Preheminence is thine: come downe to me,</l>
                  <l>Thou dost not know how welcome thou shalt be!</l>
                  <l>But hinder not thy bus'nesse: let me know</l>
                  <l>A day or two before! but we below</l>
                  <l>Are ne're unfurnish'd; we can entertaine</l>
                  <l>(In hellish pompe) thy selfe, and all thy traine.</l>
                  <l>Thy house is like to mine, but that 'tis lesse,</l>
                  <l>Lightet and cooler too; but thou maist guesse,</l>
                  <l>How well our guests doe sute: untill thy tombe</l>
                  <l>Doth close thee up, take thou the chiefest roome.</l>

                  <l>Thy will I do accept, thou spend'st thy store</l>
                  <l>To honor sin: what can a man do more?</l>
                  <l>Thou shalt not want, thou need'st not to repent,</l>
                  <l>I have more ways (when all thy store is spent)</l>
                  <l>To raise thee up: I make no doubt ere long,</l>
                  <l>Thou wilt be fit to grapple in the throng,</l>
                  <l>For this high place of honor: then I will</l>
                  <l>Praise thy endevors, and applaud thy skill.</l>

                  <l>In honor, reputation, 'twas thy care</l>

                  <l>Nor art thou cowardly, but bold, and brave</l>

                  <l>Pray, Sir, come in, a friend that loves you here</l>
                  <l>Would see your face, and drink a cup of beere,</l>

                  <l>He hearing this, stopt; and his thoughts began</l>
                  <l>To rove, not thinking who should be the man;</l>
                  <l>He thus reply'd at last:</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Teige</hi> searcht his pocket; he was freely willing,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>But comming downe, the Bawd enquiry made,</l>
                  <l>How he was pleas'd? what match was drove? what trade?</l>
                  <l>What he had gin her? further asking when,</l>
                  <l>He did intend to visit her agen?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He told the Bawd how they their time did passe,</l>
                  <l>How they agreed, how bountifull he was,</l>
                  <l>To give her six-pence. Then the Bawd call'd out,</l>
                  <l>Why <hi>Nancie, Nancie,</hi> come, resolve the doubt,</l>
                  <l>What this man had? what thou hadst of this man?</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Nancie</hi> cry'd, anan (forsooth, anan.)</l>
                  <l>What had this man I aske? forsooth I gave</l>
                  <l>Him his desire, he did but aske and have:</l>
                  <l>Embraces by the grosse, a curious song,</l>
                  <l>A large Coranto; kisses mixt among;</l>
                  <l>We did in all things very well agree</l>
                  <l>But this; I had but six-pence for my fee.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How wench! but six-pence? who shall pay the rest?</l>
                  <l>I thought h'had been an open-handed guest:</l>
                  <l>Coranto's are not sold at such a rate,</l>
                  <l>Nor will I lose my money, though't be late.</l>
                  <l>Give me five shillings (truly, Sir, 'tis true)</l>
                  <l>I cannot 'bate a penny of my due.</l>
                  <l>An Angell is indeed my usuall price,</l>
                  <l>Where once a Crowne, I have an Angell twice.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then <hi>Teige</hi> dives downe into his slops, there found</l>
                  <l>But just so much that freed him: turning round,</l>
                  <l>Away ran he most nimbly; for his cash,</l>
                  <l>Was for his learning, chopt away for trash.</l>
                  <l>He was asham'd to come in's Masters sight,</l>
                  <l>His heart being heavie, and his purse so light.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Some swellings, where ghesse you: and then his mind,</l>
                  <l>Being charg'd with griefe, complain'd, &amp; thus he said:</l>

                  <l>(Being very dark) he did a woman meet;</l>
                  <l>And heard her mutt'ring as she went along,</l>
                  <l>Complaining of her husband; and the wrong</l>
                  <l>That she receiv'd: how she was much abus'd,</l>
                  <l>Turn'd out of doores, and how her friends were us'd,</l>
                  <l>This lustfull Ape, thinks he has got a prey,</l>
                  <l>Pities her case, and thus to her did say:</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Faire mistresse, walk with me, and you shall have</l>

                  <l>And when he had beheld her in the light,</l>
                  <l>Found her exceeding faire: oh! how her sight</l>
                  <l>Did ravish him! both in a bed they lay,</l>
                  <l>Where they did spend some time: but when the day</l>
                  <l>Broke in upon them, all delights were past:</l>
                  <l>(He turn'd about) for she had breath'd her last:</l>

                  <l>The sentence of the Law; death was her paine:</l>

                  <hi>SECT. 20.</hi> How a subtile Queane fained herselfe to be with childe by a man of qualitie; of her lying in, and how the plot was found out.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>WAlking alone; about the evening tide,</l>
                  <l>I heard a voyce: turning about, I spi'd</l>
                  <l>Two walking hand in hand; and as they went,</l>
                  <l>They whisp'red out their shame; 'twas their intent</l>
                  <l>To sin in secret. First, the man did wooe,</l>
                  <l>And soone the female gave consent unto</l>
                  <l>What he desir'd: a place then they descri'd,</l>
                  <l>Which they did think would all their folly hide.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But what is hid from that all-seeing eye,</l>
                  <l>That's done in hell, or on the earth? the skie</l>
                  <l>Is fixed full of eyes to finde out sin,</l>
                  <l>And every creature must give verdict in,</l>
                  <l>Against the sinfull world: but all this while,</l>
                  <l>Those witlesse Imps are striving to be guile</l>
                  <l>Their soules of peace; and having had their ends,</l>
                  <l>They part for that time, (seeming loving friends.)</l>
                  <l>But pointed when, and where to meet againe:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He breaking promise (for it seemes his braine</l>
                  <l>Grew addle after this) she sent to know</l>
                  <l>Where all this time he did himselfe bestow,</l>
                  <l>Desiring him to visit her; for shee</l>
                  <l>Must shew to him her haplesse miserie.</l>
                  <l>He told his name, his place, that he was rich,</l>
                  <l>Vnto this whore: and now her fingers itch</l>
                  <l>To handle some of's gold: she rubs her neyes,</l>
                  <l>Hangs downe her head, and blubbers out, and cryes,</l>
                  <l>She's halfe undone; her belly now doth swell,</l>
                  <l>For she's with child by him: she loves him well,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:12998:69"/>And would not have him sham'd; give her reliefe,</l>
                  <l>She'd free him on't, and still conceale her griefe.</l>
                  <l>Against her lying in, he must provide</l>
                  <l>A nurse, and linnen; divers things beside</l>
                  <l>Which she must have; then, had you heard him curse</l>
                  <l>This whore, his fate, their meeting ('cause his purse</l>
                  <l>Grew emptie by this meanes) you would have thought</l>
                  <l>The Devill spoke by him, what's worse than nought.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He tries with care, and cost, to hide his sin:</l>
                  <l>For now the time is come, and she lyes in,</l>
                  <l>So neat, and sine; he goes to see her then,</l>
                  <l>And to supply her wants; and goes agen,</l>
                  <l>And findes her weake: the child i'th' cradle by,</l>
                  <l>The bawdy Nurse was rocking: presently</l>
                  <l>She takes it up; oh, here's th'owne fathers child;</l>
                  <l>Your eyes, your nose, your picture is not spoyl'd</l>
                  <l>In joyning up; while this babe doth survive,</l>
                  <l>He'll keep your image, and your name alive:</l>
                  <l>D'yee see your fore-head, eye-brows, double chin,</l>
                  <l>Your little mouth? just as your lips are thin,</l>
                  <l>So are the child's: his fingers long and small;</l>
                  <l>He's quiet too; that sutes you best of all.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This gives him no content, away he flings,</l>
                  <l>And leaves his image; but the Nurse she fings</l>
                  <l>A Lullaby; the woman that lyes in,</l>
                  <l>Is rais'd with gold, to strike the merry pin.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He meets a man whom he well knew before,</l>
                  <l>Reveales the passages 'twixt him and's whore:</l>
                  <l>And how much goldsh'had had, and os the shame</l>
                  <l>That he did feare would light upon his name.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>His friend (if so you call him) heard the case,</l>
                  <l>Took his fit time, and went unto that place,</l>
                  <l>Pretending shamefull mirth; but she seem'd ill,</l>
                  <l>And would not once submit unto his will;</l>
                  <l>Being subtill in her trade, she told him how</l>
                  <l>The case did stand: he must not touch her now.</l>

                  <l>Away goes he, acquaints a Magistrate,</l>
                  <l>How such a man was made unfortunate,</l>
                  <l>By dealing with a whore: he brings him to him,</l>
                  <l>Who promis'd them much kindnesse he would do him,</l>
                  <l>To set him free: unto the house they went,</l>
                  <l>Where he had been, and had his money spent.</l>
                  <l>They coming in, the Trull seem'd very weake;</l>
                  <l>The Nurse being rocking, she began to speake,</l>
                  <l>But feare restrain'd her: for the man, they knew,</l>
                  <l>Did use to give such birds of night their due.</l>
                  <l>He taking up the child (but he mistook)</l>
                  <l>Was quite agreed it had the fathers look;</l>
                  <l>I am perswaded in this heart of mine,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With violence this child began to cry;</l>
                  <l>A woman chatg'd with fury, suddenly</l>
                  <l>Rusht in upon'em, What d'yee meane to doe?</l>
                  <l>Borrowing my child, pray do not murther't too!</l>
                  <l>I will not trust you (Bawds and Whores are vilde)</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>By this the plot was found; the Whore, the Nurse</l>

                  <l>The Nurse must go before the month be out,</l>

                  <l>(Her gossipping is spoyl'd) there she must stay,</l>

                  <l>It was to draw the tawnie from her skin:</l>
                  <l>And make the wrinkles smooth, aud colour fresh</l>
                  <l>Her corps decay'd; which was like parboyl'd flesh.</l>

                  <l>As clad in mourning: but she's bare below.</l>
                  <l>This sight compar'd with the unsavoury stench,</l>

                  <l>Me thought it had a savour of the slime;</l>
                  <l>An earthy show! and stunk before its time.</l>

                  <l>And pull the parches off; and rince her skin:</l>
                  <l>Then let me see if any blood's within;</l>
                  <l>Set her the glasse, that she may dresse her head,</l>

                  <l>How every one might come to take her turne.</l>
                  <l>She kept a hot-house (which did bring her gold)</l>
                  <l>Vnder pretence; but 'twas too hot to hold.</l>
                  <l>One of her creatures being prov'd with child,</l>

                  <l>Her head is almost bald, her teeth are thinne:</l>
                  <l>She, like a changeling, slobbers down her chinne;</l>
                  <l>Her hands are brawny, and her fingers are</l>

                  <l>Her body's grosse, her legs do keep asunder,</l>

                  <l>Search narrowly; blind Ale-houses may be</l>
                  <l>A cover-slut; let not the hornes go free.</l>
                  <l>Then go to <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> and common places</l>
                  <l>Where varlets dwell, and vermine hide their faces.</l>
                  <l>From thence to <hi>Islington,</hi> and seek about</l>

                  <l>I'll speak but that which prating Fame hath told:</l>
                  <l>A Gentleman well bred (for by relation,</l>
                  <l>His friends were famous for their reputation)</l>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:12998:81"/>Brought up to learning, never sparing cost;</l>
                  <l>But yet it was but charge, and labour lost.</l>
                  <l>For why? his lewdnesse hurri'd on his fate,</l>
                  <l>He follow'd whores, so was unfortunate.</l>
                  <l>What e're he got, 'twas spent, and all his care,</l>
                  <l>Was to grow carelesse; he would never spare,</l>
                  <l>But laid it on; for this, who can but see,</l>
                  <l>That whores are knowne the costli'st beasts that bee?</l>
                  <l>Much thus he spent, and oft he was suppli'd;</l>
                  <l>But of his will he was at last deni'd.</l>
                  <l>His father found all was but throwne away,</l>
                  <l>The more he had, the more he went astray.</l>

                  <l>It chang'd him not, but put his minde to torture.</l>
                  <l>Advice, instructions, promises to wooe him,</l>
                  <l>The likely danger put he oft unto him;</l>
                  <l>Then threatning him, that for his fowle demerit,</l>
                  <l>He'd cast him off, and would him disinherit.</l>
                  <l>All would not serve, he is so far from mending,</l>
                  <l>That he's more vile, though not so much in spending.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But tender-hearted parents needs must love</l>
                  <l>The childe, though bad; their bowels still'did move.</l>
                  <l>Though he was shamelesse (sin did never grieve him)</l>
                  <l>Yet still his father could not but relieve him.</l>
                  <l>He'd often cry out, This unhappy Boy</l>
                  <l>Hath sham'd my glory, and o'rethrowne my joy:</l>
                  <l>I am in doubt, if I his part should take,</l>
                  <l>I shall be deem'd as guiltie for his sake:</l>
                  <l>If I neglect him, though he be so vilde,</l>
                  <l>I shall be censur'd too; he is my childe.</l>

                  <l>For like a gallant of great <hi>Pluto's</hi> Court,</l>

                  <l>Although he be a bird fit for a cage,</l>
                  <l>Yet, if he can but parrat on the stage,</l>

                  <l>Give him the wall, or else he'll draw, or stab,</l>
                  <l>He's made an Vsher to a painted Drab.</l>
                  <l>His wealth hangs on his back (let's have no mocks)</l>
                  <l>His riches lye in his Tobacco-box.</l>
                  <l>He's valiant! pitie 'tis he wants a sword,</l>
                  <l>The Gentleman must buy, or passe his word</l>
                  <l>To furnish him: and then he'll brag and boast,</l>
                  <l>And hack and hew, as mad <hi>Tom</hi> did the post.</l>
                  <l>His clothes are all put into Taylors books,</l>
                  <l>He'll hardly pay, I ghesse it by his looks:</l>

                  <l>His sword doth hang so neatly by his side,</l>

                  <l>The wine did work, which stirr'd up angry words,</l>

                  <hi>SECT. 28.</hi> Of an old man, wooing, and marrying of a yong girle; how they disagreed, and how she turn'd a whore.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>THere liv'd a man, (but where I need not tell)</l>
                  <l>For credit, worth, esteem'd of all so well,</l>
                  <l>That fame began to prate on't: for his life,</l>
                  <l>To make it sweet, he wanted but a wife:</l>
                  <l>Death rob'd him of his first; she's in her tombe,</l>
                  <l>Had he another to supply her roome,</l>
                  <l>How happy he should be! for being old,</l>
                  <l>He must have one, to keep him from the cold.</l>
                  <l>Wealth's not sufficient, to cheere his age:</l>
                  <l>He's newly entring on the seventh stage,</l>
                  <l>Of bald swift time; his haire with snow was mixt,</l>
                  <l>But 'twas at odds, for there were pathes betwixt,</l>
                  <l>The hoary-frost, had seiz'd upon his beard,</l>
                  <l>His face was pale, and wrinkled: you have heard,</l>
                  <l>How Northerne <hi>Boreas,</hi> from the pole doth glide,</l>
                  <l>To shake his treasure, or'e the Westerne bride.</l>
                  <l>The plants do tremble, Winter is his guest,</l>
                  <l>Of all the months, December suits him best,</l>
                  <l>So is his flesh grown chill, his bones do quiver,</l>
                  <l>Some yong one that is warme, must him deliver;</l>
                  <l>From his cold palsy: O! how faine he'd find</l>
                  <l>One qualified agreeing to his mind!</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:12998:84"/>He sought a while, but 'twas his hap at last</l>
                  <l>To spy a Virgin, as the stroets he past;</l>
                  <l>And as he lookt, his heart began to melt,</l>
                  <l>His colour's chang'd; the passion that he felt,</l>
                  <l>Did warme his blood: his shaking fit grow's more,</l>
                  <l>But alter'd quite; not cold, as 'twas before.</l>
                  <l>Has Winters <hi>Sun</hi> now got such power here?</l>
                  <l>Or will it be thus warme, but once a yeare?</l>

                  <l>The ayre is cold, the alteration's strange;</l>
                  <l>Nor was there signe of fire, how comes this frost</l>
                  <l>Dissolv'd so soon? 'twas by a walking ghost.</l>
                  <l>Sh'had made him yong again, if she had staid:</l>
                  <l>But now he'l ne're be well, till she be laid.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This old man bends his mind, t'obtaine his ends,</l>
                  <l>H'has hope to have her, 'cause he knows her friends,</l>
                  <l>He'l go to try; if he be welcome to her,</l>
                  <l>He's mad for ever; but his gold must woe her.</l>
                  <l>He wants a face, he feares she will abhorre him;</l>
                  <l>But yet he hopes, his wealth will do it for him.</l>
                  <l>Wealth is a Lady; no one will dispise her:</l>
                  <l>But if she doth, he knows, her friends are wiser.</l>
                  <l>He's gone to try; I wish him good successe:</l>
                  <l>And all that know the man, can do no lesse.</l>
                  <l>He speaks but little; that is best at first;</l>
                  <l>The sight of her's enough to quench his thirst:</l>
                  <l>Yet he must kisse her; had you seen them play,</l>
                  <l>You would have laught: she cri'd, old man, away.</l>
                  <l>He must imbrace her: O, this pretious pearle!</l>
                  <l>Fie, fio, said she, an old man kisse a girle?</l>
                  <l>Her friends approv'd on't; he has hope to speed,</l>
                  <l>He thinks in time the girle would be agreed.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Home he returnes; but ere he goes againe,</l>
                  <l>He'l change his visage: though his habit's plaine</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:12998:85"/>He'l have it alter'd; though his beard be made</l>
                  <l>To grow so broad, and squared like a spade,</l>
                  <l>It must be shav'd away; and it must be</l>
                  <l>Turn'd up, and sharp'c just like a Roman T:</l>
                  <l>His cloak bag, breeches too, shall be cut lesse,</l>
                  <l>He will be suted, in a comely dresse.</l>
                  <l>To sute the rest, he weares his second Ruffe,</l>
                  <l>'Twas made of Cambrick, or some dainty stuffe.</l>
                  <l>His hat's cut narrower, and 'tis nearly drest:</l>
                  <l>(Good husbandry.) He meanes to keep his best,</l>
                  <l>Vntill the wedding: Lovely he had bin,</l>
                  <l>To look upon, had he but chang'd his skin.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He's gone without his staffe; he wants no prop,</l>
                  <l>The worst thing is, (being cold) his nose doth drop.</l>
                  <l>He courts this lovely lasse, with great delight,</l>
                  <l>She finds his drift, and then she loath'd his sight.</l>
                  <l>At last he broke his mind to her, and said;</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I have a suit to thee: I am a fraid,</l>
                  <l>Thou wilt deny me: this is all I crave,</l>
                  <l>Thy love, thy love, O! that's the thing I'd have:</l>
                  <l>Sweet hony, grant me this, and I will prove,</l>
                  <l>So kind to thee, that I'le deserve thy love.</l>
                  <l>I've wealth enough, I'le make it all thine own:</l>
                  <l>If I can have from thee this favourshown,</l>
                  <l>I shall be blest; am I too old for thee?</l>
                  <l>I'me not so old though as I seem to bee.</l>
                  <l>What's forty yeares? my wife death tooke away;</l>
                  <l>I griev'd so much, that made my haire turne gray.</l>
                  <l>Thou'lt find me yong, and active, never feare;</l>
                  <l>Be thou but kind; this Diamond-ring, my deare,</l>
                  <l>Take as a pledge: come, never blush, but speak</l>
                  <l>Thy mind in love; or els my heart will break!</l>
                  <l>Yong men are fickle, care lesse of their wives,</l>
                  <l>Men that are stai'd, do love them as their lives.</l>

                  <l>In policy you have these words exprest</l>
                  <l>To try my wit: I take it but in jest.</l>
                  <l>Love's out of date with you; 'tis rather meet,</l>
                  <l>You buy you coffin, and your winding sheet.</l>
                  <l>I thank you for your love; your wealth, your gold</l>
                  <l>Provokes me not: if I may be so bold,</l>

                  <l>If needs you'l wive, then take a marron grave;</l>
                  <l>Decrepid age, with wealth might comfort have.</l>
                  <l>Cease, cease your suit; judge, is't a fitting thing</l>
                  <l>To match cold Winter, to the wanton Spring?</l>
                  <l>My blood's now rising, yours is in the fall,</l>
                  <l>You'ld do me wrong, your selfe no good at all.</l>
                  <l>What good wilt be to you to do me harme?</l>
                  <l>You'ld have a yong one, now, to keep you warme.</l>
                  <l>I cannot think my friends will give consent</l>
                  <l>To sell me to a living punishment.</l>
                  <l>Farewell old Father; age might make you know,</l>

                  <l>A sum of money by't; he did not crave</l>
                  <l>A portion, but her love he aym'd at most:</l>
                  <l>She in his riches; he in her would boast:</l>

                  <l>She being rais'd, she might preferre her friends,</l>
                  <l>They use perswasions, arguments to move her,</l>
                  <l>With promises; and how the man would love her.</l>
                  <l>But threatning was the burden of the song;</l>
                  <l>She blusht, she wept, and yet she held her tongue.</l>
                  <l>But discontented, to her selfe she said:</l>

                  <l>In what a case am I! I am afraid</l>
                  <l>I shall be lost for ever. I had rather</l>
                  <l>Displease my selfe, than move, and vexe my father.</l>
                  <l>One I must do; I shall be counted vilde,</l>
                  <l>If he refuse to own me for his childe.</l>

                  <l>My old acquaintance, as I walke the street,</l>
                  <l>Without a blush? his wrinkled flesh, his breath,</l>

                  <hi>SECT. 29.</hi> Of a proud, stately Harlot raised by her sin; how she rain'd divers; and of many passages in the prosecution of it.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>THe gallant whore, who goes in rich aray,</l>
                  <l>Turns day to night; the night she'll turn to day:</l>
                  <l>Although at first her breeding was but base,</l>
                  <l>Sprouts as a branch from some Imformers race.</l>
                  <l>Being somewhat handsome in her blushing prime,</l>
                  <l>She thinks it best, to make use of her time.</l>
                  <l>Some braying Asse that can but use his tongue,</l>
                  <l>He'll complement: they being both but young,</l>
                  <l>Are soone be witcht with one anothers faces;</l>
                  <l>Then for their ends they have their meeting places,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Till at the last this Asse had shed his coat,</l>
                  <l>His braying alters to a mourning note.</l>
                  <l>The Sergeants, Bailiffs, do encrease his feares,</l>
                  <l>Poore Asse at last doth prick, or shake his eares,</l>
                  <l>And thinks his heelcs are better than his hands,</l>
                  <l>He whips away into the Netherlands.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This Queane adornes her like a modest Maid:</l>
                  <l>Alas! another is by her betray'd!</l>
                  <l>Now she being cunning, will not serve his lust;</l>
                  <l>His fire burnes, and marrie her he must:</l>
                  <l>A little while they do in pleasure swim;</l>
                  <l>At last he findes she made an Oxe of him,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:12998:90"/>
                  <l>He then complain'd: Alas! what did I meane,</l>
                  <l>To marrie thus an over-ridden queane?</l>
                  <l>His way of trading he doth quite neglect,</l>
                  <l>His Creditors will give him no respect.</l>
                  <l>His stock's confirm'd, his credit all is lost:</l>
                  <l>Poore simple man! he with this whore is crost!</l>
                  <l>She layes it on, and spends (while it remaines)</l>
                  <l>On such that promise to allow her gaines.</l>
                  <l>At last, when he had run so far in debt,</l>
                  <l>He'd buy some wit, but 'tis too late: he'll fret:</l>
                  <l>His wit and money parted are away,</l>
                  <l>Now he must run, he can no longer stay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The time is come this whore did wish to have,</l>
                  <l>She'll have more freedome with a perjur'd knave:</l>
                  <l>She'll trim her selfe, and paint her face anew:</l>
                  <l>She's brave! her face looks of another hew.</l>
                  <l>Come now who will, this block is far remov'd:</l>
                  <l>You are the man that I have ever lov'd.</l>
                  <l>Then she will sweare that she'll be constant to him;</l>
                  <l>She works him in, but quickly she'll undo him.</l>
                  <l>He must maintaine her at a loftie rate;</l>
                  <l>She goes in pomp; at last her whorish state</l>
                  <l>Does bring him low; his house he keeps no longer,</l>
                  <l>He is convey'd to one that is far stronger.</l>
                  <l>Then he bewailes his lamentable crosse;</l>
                  <l>And does relate their passages; his losse</l>
                  <l>('Tis evident, poore man! he must abide it)</l>
                  <l>Breaks out the more, the more he strives to hide it.</l>
                  <l>Now when this whore does want a man of worth</l>
                  <l>To keepe her brave, she'll send her Pander forth.</l>
                  <l>(Pray call him Captaine) she must beare his charge;</l>
                  <l>Her streames are low, expences have been large.</l>
                  <l>Well, out he goes, being hinder'd by no weather;</l>
                  <l>His money's spent, but he will shake his feather:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:12998:91"/>He findes the Spark, he tels him of a Lasse,</l>
                  <l>That doth for beautie all the rest surpasse.</l>
                  <l>If he'd but go, he shall be welcome to her,</l>
                  <l>She's somewhat coy; but he will help to wooe her.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>These joviall blades must make a merrie day,</l>
                  <l>To talk more on't: the reckoning call'd to pay,</l>
                  <l>Pimps purse is emptie; but's Tobacco-box</l>
                  <l>To all is free (they'd best beware of pox)</l>
                  <l>In open glasses they must drink the round,</l>
                  <l>Then suck the weed of eighteene pence a pound.</l>
                  <l>Now Whisk in brings this joviall gallant up,</l>
                  <l>A place appointed where they all must sup:</l>
                  <l>And for their sauce, they have this painted lade</l>
                  <l>Brought in; he sees her, scone the match is made:</l>
                  <l>They vow then to be constant to each other:</l>
                  <l>She is his sister, he must be her brother:</l>
                  <l>And while he lives, he never will for sake her:</l>
                  <l>But for his wife, he'll bid, The Devill take her.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now for his whore; her back and belly cheere,</l>
                  <l>Do cost him full five hundred pounds a yeere:</l>
                  <l>Maintaines the Pimp that brought him to this thrall:</l>
                  <l>No other Bawd; she's Whore and Bawd and all.</l>
                  <l>Now farewell Freeze, h'has got to grace this harlot,</l>
                  <l>A Stammell sute; but you must call it Scarlet.</l>
                  <l>In habit like a Citizen she'll be;</l>
                  <l>Sometimes no Lady is more fine than she.</l>
                  <l>A house for winter, she must have to stand</l>
                  <l>About the Citie, with a brave command:</l>
                  <l>Her Summer-house neere to the flowing tide,</l>
                  <l>Rich furniture, gain'd by her whorish pride.</l>
                  <l>Now when this Spark is from his Fondling gone,</l>
                  <l>If none come to her, then she'll send for one;</l>
                  <l>Bring her but money, she will use her trade,</l>
                  <l>And truck with any, like a Hackney lade.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:12998:91"/>When he returnes, she'l wipe her mouth, and say,</l>
                  <l>Why did my sweeting stay so long away?</l>
                  <l>He must imbrace her, kisse, and call her hony;</l>
                  <l>She'l quickly search to see what store of money</l>
                  <l>He'has brought her home; if little, then she'l frown,</l>
                  <l>She wants a sattin, or a tabby-gown.</l>
                  <l>Vp he must take it on the Mercers score,</l>
                  <l>And glad he is that he can please this whore:</l>
                  <l>And of the Gold-smith jewels, diamond-rings:</l>
                  <l>When this is done, still she wants other things.</l>
                  <l>His state consumes, his friends give councell to him</l>
                  <l>With griefe: and pleade, this whore will soon undo him.</l>
                  <l>All will not serve, but he will still adore her.</l>
                  <l>His wife now sees a queene preferr'd before her,</l>
                  <l>With heavy heart do's to her husband cry:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Forsake this whore, or I with grief shall dye!</l>
                  <l>With teares she praies, as she before him stands,</l>
                  <l>You have an heire, then morgage not your lands.</l>
                  <l>Alas! you know, 'twill be a living shame,</l>
                  <l>When he is an heire only but in name!</l>
                  <l>These infants, they must beg, or els do worse,</l>
                  <l>You on your children strive to bring a curse:</l>
                  <l>Shall it be said, this was his fathers place?</l>
                  <l>He kept a whore, and sold it with disgrace?</l>
                  <l>Your of-spring-too shal ever beare this slaine,</l>
                  <l>You rais'd them up, and threw them down again,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Think on that vow you did in marriage make,</l>
                  <l>With that injunction; which was, then to take</l>
                  <l>None but my selfe; you know I am your wife:</l>
                  <l>This Harlot now has gain'd your love; sow'd strife</l>
                  <l>Betwixt us two: what is love gone for ever?</l>
                  <l>Which once I thought, that none but death could sever?</l>
                  <l>My selfe, my love was constant still and true;</l>
                  <l>My friends I did forsake for love of you;</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If to my suit you will not bend your cares,</l>

                  <l>When thirsty time hath drank up all my store,</l>
                  <l>Then take me death: for I can weep no more;</l>
                  <l>And let me now a second favour find,</l>
                  <l>My children take, which I shall leave behind.</l>
                  <l>And for my husband, let all honest men</l>
                  <l>Lay out some teares; he'l one day pay'em agen.</l>
                  <l>Vntill that time, I wish, that babling Fame,</l>
                  <l>Be silenc't that he never spread his name.</l>
                  <l>This one thing more (my passion is so strong:)</l>
                  <l>And then for ever I will hold my tongue:</l>
                  <l>Some Poet he will write upon your grave,</l>
                  <l>He kept a whore who us'd him as a slave,</l>
                  <l>To maintaine her, he did both sell and borrow;</l>
                  <l>His children beg, his wife she dy'd with sorrow.</l>
                  <l>Let time and age with men record his fall:</l>
                  <l>Be warn'd by him; his whore and he spent all.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This plaint moves not; nor infants moanes about her</l>
                  <l>He's vext at her, and sometimes he doth flour her;</l>
                  <l>Then he relates this story to his drab,</l>
                  <l>Who answer'd thus; what, hath she eat a Crab?</l>
                  <l>What, doth she prate? a stinking durty slut!</l>
                  <l>Is she too full? I vow I'le pinch her gut,</l>
                  <l>And make her glad to eat a piece of bread;</l>
                  <l>What will she dye, except she may be head?</l>
                  <l>I'le keep her bare and make her speak me faire;</l>
                  <l>You must be tutor'd too about your heire.</l>

                  <l>Pack out the rest: and let this ugly lade</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>A Home-bred Clowne, that had a good estate</l>
                  <l>Left by his friends: but over-rul'd by fate,</l>
                  <l>Which wrought his woe; but well he did deserve it.</l>
                  <l>Read but the story, then you may observe it.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This silly Clunch did love a handsome Lasse,</l>
                  <l>Love, did I say? no, but to let that passe,</l>
                  <l>'Twas but in shew; as afterwards appear'd;</l>
                  <l>Or lov'd in jest; in earnest he was jear'd.</l>
                  <l>She's confident on's love, though fancie tremble,</l>
                  <l>She learnes to love, and he how to dissemble.</l>
                  <l>This Maid had beautie, honestie, and wit,</l>
                  <l>And portion that might well become, and fit</l>
                  <l>A better man: none of the former three</l>
                  <l>Had heat all; so true a Clowne was he.</l>
                  <l>Her love exceeds; alas! 'tis out of season!</l>
                  <l>When love gets head; it is not rul'd by reason.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:12998:103"/>The match goes on, in time they have agreed it,</l>
                  <l>All men conclude, the heavens have decreed it.</l>
                  <l>And then the day of marriage is prefixt;</l>
                  <l>Her love's intire, but his with falshood mixt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Why she lov'd him, l'elsay the best I can,</l>
                  <l>Because the did; or that he was a man;</l>
                  <l>And he had cause to love this lovely Maid;</l>
                  <l>But fooles want reason: so this foole's betrai'd.</l>
                  <l>The Sun had looked on him with his power,</l>
                  <l>And tann'd his skin: his countenance was sower.</l>
                  <l>His goggle eyes, and rich enamel'd snout,</l>
                  <l>His brawny cheeks, his lips, or what's about</l>
                  <l>This trunk of treasure, I will not discover:</l>
                  <l>But how he woo'd in's progresse, how this lover</l>
                  <l>Obtain'd's desire; and how he was deceiv'd,</l>
                  <l>And how he was of all his friends bereav'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>By accident he came into a place,</l>
                  <l>A man of note did shew him there such grace,</l>
                  <l>He was transported; for he knew not how,</l>
                  <l>To carry' himselfe, save onely at the plow.</l>
                  <l>He was not guiltie of a jot of breeding,</l>
                  <l>But full of flesh; and that he got by seeding.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He saw an Imp there, (and her face was painted)</l>
                  <l>Who was a whore; and for a whore was tainted:</l>
                  <l>She was his prospect, and did glut his eyes,</l>
                  <l>His minde with surfets did both fall and rise.</l>
                  <l>Sometimes he'll blush, and sometimes have no colour,</l>
                  <l>Sometimes he's quick, as quickly he growes duller.</l>
                  <l>He walks about, and then sits downe and muses,</l>
                  <l>Then speaks his minde, but clownish as he uses.</l>

                  <l>Does take effect: she being grown so stale,</l>

                  <l>Is quite ecclip'st before the day be done.</l>
                  <l>Her eyes being bright, (the beames with shame returne)</l>

                  <l>He never told (in this he much did faile)</l>
                  <l>Her body was too heavy for her taile.</l>
                  <l>Nor of her painting on her wrinkled face,</l>
                  <l>Nor how she was to all her sex disgrace.</l>
                  <l>Nor of her living, which was worse than bad,</l>
                  <l>Her trading brought in all the meanes she had.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then he unfolds this matter to the whore,</l>

                  <l>But then the spokesman vomited his mind:</l>
                  <l>Though he's a Clown, yet thou maist find him kind:</l>
                  <l>He'l dote upon thee, let thee take thine ease,</l>
                  <l>And go, and come, and do what ere thou please.</l>
                  <l>He'l not be jealous, he has not the wit:</l>
                  <l>But thou must rule him, and thy humors fit.</l>
                  <l>He's rich, and thou shalt always keep his treasure:</l>
                  <l>Thou'art wise enough to use it at thy pleasure.</l>
                  <l>Come, be not coy, seeing fortune gives a call,</l>
                  <l>And for his faults, know, gold will cover all.</l>
                  <l>Take something certaine; thou know'st what to do,</l>
                  <l>Please but this foole, and keep thy trading too.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When he was silent, thus the quean began:</l>

                  <l>To make a husband, ere he will be fit</l>

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:12998:105"/>To know himselfe; and such as are above him,</l>
                  <l>He is so clownish, I shall never love him.</l>
                  <l>But if i could be married to his land,</l>
                  <l>And leave his person, then I'de give my hand,</l>
                  <l>And strike the match, with heart and free consent:</l>
                  <l>I live at pleasure, and have full content</l>
                  <l>Without controule: if he should marry mee,</l>
                  <l>He'd mue me up: with those that come to see</l>
                  <l>My chang'd condition (how socre I sped)</l>
                  <l>I quickly should grasthorne upon his head.</l>
                  <l>Your love I tender; but the Clown I hate,</l>
                  <l>And think it scorne that he should be my mate.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With that the bawd grew angry, looking fierce,</l>
                  <l>Begins to speak, but cannot well rehearse</l>
                  <l>Her mind in words: but when the storme was past,</l>
                  <l>Her tongue broke loose, and thus she spoke at last:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What do'st thou flight what love to thee doth proffer?</l>
                  <l>Art thou so curious to refuse an offer</l>

                  <l>I'le not relate it, 'tis too long a story:</l>
                  <l>Blame not my Muse, she's not a grave for glory.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But having din'd, he said his fathers grace,</l>
                  <l>And pray'd the Sun to drive away apace,</l>
                  <l>And whip the steeds with fury to the West,</l>
                  <l>For in his sight but halfe could he be blest.</l>
                  <l>His spirits mov'd him <hi>Morpheus</hi> to invite</l>
                  <l>To spread his cloud, and haste to bring on night.</l>
                  <l>Black night being come, he went with's Bride to bed;</l>
                  <l>He had his wish, but not her maiden-head.</l>
                  <l>My Muse left them, t'enjoy what from love sprung,</l>
                  <l>For she was modest, and she lost her tongue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Their nightly pleasures smoothly glide away,</l>
                  <l>And night is forc'd to give place to the day.</l>
                  <l>Her tongue's restor'd to shew their griefe o'th'morrow,</l>
                  <l>Exchang'd with joy, unto the Bride-grooms sorrow!</l>
                  <l>What he took up on ticket, or the score,</l>
                  <l>For this great feast, and what he ow'd before,</l>
                  <l>Must now be paid; he cannot well deny it;</l>
                  <l>His marriage coine, he can as ill come by it;</l>
                  <l>Yet safe enough, for it is out at use;</l>
                  <l>(So forawhile this was his chiefe excuse)</l>
                  <l>Where, no mans knowes, nor when it shall be paid,</l>
                  <l>The bond is cancell'd, or it is mis-laid.</l>
                  <l>He was deferr'd, (it was a cruell spight)</l>
                  <l>Vntill Dooms-day, at six a clock at night.</l>

                  <l>Doe haunt him still, nor is he like to thrive;</l>
                  <l>His costly mistris keeps him low and bare,</l>
                  <l>Which makes this clown run almost mad with care.</l>
                  <l>His spokes-mate, or the pander doth finde out</l>
                  <l>Where's money to be lent; 'tis brought about</l>
                  <l>That he shall have it; for it, all are bound,</l>

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:12998:108"/>But when us paid, he onely can be found:</l>
                  <l>The other are Non-Residents; their trust</l>
                  <l>Is to deceive. But pay it in he must;</l>
                  <l>For they'l be gone (for this they must have fees)</l>

                  <l>Downe in the Countrey they do haste away,</l>
                  <l>'Tis time, for here it is too hot to stay.</l>
                  <l>They take their leaves; the farewell of this whore,</l>
                  <l>Made him an Oxe, that was an Asse before.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Away they went; their welcome was but small,</l>
                  <l>Their comfort cold, as good as none at all.</l>
                  <l>His friends had heard how he cast off the Maid</l>
                  <l>That lov'd him and was by a whore betrai'd;</l>
                  <l>How he had spent his meanes, and was in debt,</l>

                  <l>How 'twas deferr'd, and how he bore the charge</l>
                  <l>Of all their feasts: his mother first 'twas spi'd them:</l>
                  <l>Course entertainment! she began to chide them!</l>
                  <l>What hast thou done? thou foole! hast sold for nought</l>

                  <l>I'll never harbour her: if thou canst see,</l>

                  <l>Her eyes did light and pierce the clouded aire.</l>
                  <l>To whom this fore-man, thus begins to prate:</l>
                  <l>'Save you faire Lady! walk you here so late?</l>
                  <l>I'm mov'd with pitty, who can chuse but moane</l>
                  <l>Your sad condition, walking here alone?</l>

                  <l>You by the way, if I but walke along.</l>
                  <l>I am a Gentleman, and 'tis my use</l>
                  <l>Thus to preserve faire Ladies from abuse.</l>
                  <l>Grant me this favour, cast a smi'e on me;</l>
                  <l>Had I your love, how happy should I be!</l>

                  <l>Your kindnesse: to requite you I'le devise.</l>
                  <l>I was by sriends invited to a feast;</l>
                  <l>(Although, I say't, I was the chiefest guest)</l>
                  <l>They were so over joyed with my sight,</l>
                  <l>We could not part till twelve a clock at night.</l>
                  <l>My husband's gone from home; if he should know</l>
                  <l>That I was out so late, he'ld snuffe and throw.</l>
                  <l>Much like a Mad-man; if you did him sec,</l>

                  <l>Home I must go, if he's at home before,</l>
                  <l>He'l brawl, and fight, and kick me out of dore.</l>
                  <l>'Pon small occasions, he will raise up strife,</l>
                  <l>He's still unkind. I live a weary life!</l>

                  <l>They hearing this, did think it was the lasse</l>
                  <l>That they did seek for, many words did passe</l>
                  <l>Amongst them all; her words did give them strength,</l>
                  <l>And drew them on: with one consent at length,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Sweet mistris, never feare, for you shall find</l>
                  <l>True friends of us; soloving, and so kind,</l>
                  <l>As ever Lady did; our lives, and all</l>
                  <l>Shall lie at stake: to free you srom this thrall.</l>
                  <l>The churle shall know that we will take your part,</l>
                  <l>And rub his gils: and when he feeles the smart,</l>
                  <l>He'l grow more tame: pish, hang this froward foole,</l>
                  <l>We'l find a trick to make his fury coole.</l>
                  <l>A jealous coxcombe! we may hit the veine,</l>

                  <l>But 'twill not serve, (yet she is vext at that.)</l>
                  <l>Then she is stript out of her silken gown;</l>
                  <l>Had you but heard her sweare, and seen her frown,</l>
                  <l>You would have thought her mad; she curst the man.</l>

                  <l>Had been so good t' have help'd her to a whipping,</l>
                  <l>Sh'had had her due. I doe not speak with fainting,</l>
                  <l>The stripes had lasted longer than her painting.</l>
                  <l>But in the morne, when day began to dawn,</l>
                  <l>She went with money to redeeme her pawn:</l>

                  <l>They say 'tis good to helpe in stormy weather,)</l>
                  <l>But if her taile brings in no better prizes,</l>

                  <l>And tipt with non-sense; but his fiddle fail'd</l>
                  <l>To bring him in his vailes (which mov'd his ire)</l>
                  <l>Being strung too low, nor could he raise it higher.</l>
                  <l>He's out of sorts, but seeking for reliefe,</l>
                  <l>His melancholy fiddle tun'd his griefe.</l>

                  <l>Faine he'd go home, but then his empty purse</l>
                  <l>Restrain'd his purpose, and his brains did nurse</l>
                  <l>A poore conceit of home; to helpe his need</l>
                  <l>His fiddle's better strung; it is agreed</l>
                  <l>That he should search the house, perhaps he might</l>
                  <l>(To help his day) speed better in the night.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But comming to a room where he did finde</l>
                  <l>Some company, but not to shoot his minde,</l>
                  <l>He prest upon them, would take no deniall,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>A man that was sore vexed with a wife,</l>
                  <l>(A wife? a whore she was that bred the strife)</l>
                  <l>That he was weary of his life, yet had</l>
                  <l>No hope to turne her, though she were so bad;</l>
                  <l>Which did increase his griefe, and break his sleep:</l>
                  <l>And waking, sought out corners where to weep.</l>
                  <l>She slighted him; nay, when she saw him vex't,</l>
                  <l>She'd jeare him still, which made him werse perplex't,</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>At last in secret, full of discontent,</l>
                  <l>His griefe broke out, and thus he did lament.</l>
                  <l>Alas! alas! I am undone for ever!</l>
                  <l>Delights adiew! but griefe will leave me never,</l>
                  <l>For angry Fate hath all my fortunes cro'st,</l>
                  <l>My shame appeares, but I my selfe am lost:</l>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:12998:140"/>I'm forc'd to yeeld, and so I must abide it,</l>
                  <l>My shame breakes out; alas! I cannot hide it.</l>
                  <l>I thought I had been happie; but I see</l>
                  <l>That scene is done: this acts my miserie!</l>
                  <l>Fate is a Tyrant, else he'd never bring</l>
                  <l>Shame on the guiltlesse; but the guiltie sting.</l>

                  <l>Say, who'l be quit, or who's the guiltie man?</l>
                  <l>I have corrivals; should not they be blam'd,</l>
                  <l>And suffer for't? but I, alas, am sham'd!</l>
                  <l>They act the sin in climbing to my bed;</l>
                  <l>Yet I for that must weare horns on my head.</l>

                  <l>Let <hi>Morpheus</hi> hide me with his cole-black shade,</l>
                  <l>I may no more a laughing stock be made!</l>

                  <l>She fear'd his minde was chang'd, because he stay'd;</l>

                  <l>(Some think because he did the Courtiers trust</l>

                  <l>That men admired; and he had a wife,</l>
                  <l>For diet, and apparell was at strife</l>
                  <l>T'exceed her betters: she must have a fanne,</l>
                  <l>Her gownes of silk, her costly rings, her man</l>
                  <l>To wait upon her: in this lofty straine</l>
                  <l>She laid it on, nor did she mind the maine.</l>
                  <l>Of alteration she did never think,</l>
                  <l>She'd have her will, her purse still full of chink.</l>
                  <l>She had a beauty, she too well did know it,</l>

                  <l>Vnto the world: and some for gold may use it.</l>
                  <l>Should she be nigardly, she must abuse it</l>
                  <l>(As she conceives) she keeps her private trading,</l>
                  <l>To help at need; her husbands trade is fading.</l>
                  <l>Nature (she thinks) is faine to take direction,</l>

                  <l>And for her need, she'd use a theiving trade:</l>
                  <l>She scap't a while, but vengeance did assault her,</l>
                  <l>Brought her at last i'th' compas of an halter.</l>
                  <l>Her life was vile; shame forc'd her to confesse it,</l>
                  <l>Guilt broke the way, and thus she did expresse it:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When I was yong (my bringing up was rude)</l>
                  <l>My friends did think, that which the multitude</l>
                  <l>Did most approve of, that must needs be best;</l>
                  <l>I had my will, and so liv'd like a beast.</l>
                  <l>I mock't at goodnesse; though my father spide it,</l>
                  <l>He'd fawn, and laugh; my mother too would hide it.</l>

                  <l>Ill company at last causd me to prove</l>
                  <l>A prostitute: good nature mixt with love</l>
                  <l>'Twasnam'd with us; the father from the sonne</l>
                  <l>I didintice, till both were quite undonne.</l>
                  <l>I often rob'd the father of his child,</l>
                  <l>And curst the mother, though she was most mild.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I drew the husband from his loving wife:</l>

                  <l>And servants from their Masters I did keep;</l>
                  <l>We spent their goods whil'st they were fast a sleep:</l>

                  <l>I never car'd; or any man that came</l>
                  <l>Which brought but money, I nere ask't his name,</l>
                  <l>Nor what he was, his life, nor where he dwelt:</l>
                  <l>He had his will when I his money felt.</l>

                  <l>I'de pick his pockets; money, or a watch,</l>
                  <l>Or any thing of worth that I could catch,</l>
                  <l>Was ali mine owne: but he would ne're reveale ir,</l>
                  <l>(For feare of shame) though he knew I did steale it.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If any one had spent on me his stock,</l>
                  <l>Forrecompence, I paid him with a mock:</l>
                  <l>And curst him too; then with a rayling scoffe</l>
                  <l>I sent him packing: thus I cast him off.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When trading fail'd, I had a trick as ill,</l>

                  <l>In all those wayes: at last the fowle disease</l>
                  <l>Had brought me low, and I could find no ease.</l>
                  <l>It griev'd my heart, I could no longer sin.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet I resolv'd to take what e're was brought</l>
                  <l>By high-way theives, or cut-purses: I taught</l>

                  <l>Who e're was most expert, was my chiefe guest.</l>
                  <l>The cheating crew, did make me their receiver,</l>
                  <l>For whoredome, theft, and for a false deceiver</l>
                  <l>None went beyond me. I am brought this day</l>
                  <l>To suffer for't, and I my life must pay.</l>
               </lg>
