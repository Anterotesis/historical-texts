            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Dedicatory Epistle
TO
Mr. HENRY CONYERS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen Poets dedicate to Great Men, their
servile Genius stoops to Flattery: They
write not their just sentiments, but what they
think will please their Patrons: So, to make them
great, they debase themselves, and become Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
of Images, gilded by their own praise. As
well may the Carver adore his Statues, the Painter
his Pictures, which are their own handyworks.
To shew my dislike of this Custom, I chose to
expose this Tragedy to the publick with no other
ornament than your name. But let not the world
mistake me; for you have Virtues that render you
more valuable than Titles. They that know you
love you, for you will not let the least of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb facs="tcp:60148:3"/>
go unobliged whenever you can find
opportunity to show your generous temper. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, Sir, I esteem your friendship, and the
name of Friend is preferrable to any title that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
by Birth, or what Monarchs can confer; the
first comes without desert, the latter oftner by Chance
than Merit. Let other Poets then boast Patrons
of Quality, whilst I, more happy I, enjoy my Friend,
I am my Friend and my Friend is Me. Oh he is
absent yet, but when he comes, the chearful Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
shall tune our souls to as high a rapture, as if
we were met at the Harmonions Feast of Great
<hi>Cecilia.</hi> Haste then, thou worthy man, and chear
the hearts of all your Friends. None in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
more devoutly wishes your return, than</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

               <pb facs="tcp:60148:4"/>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you: A Play is not call'd a Farce from any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Acts, but from the lowness of the Subject and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
which are not true Characters in Nature, nor just
representations of humane actions (as Comedy is or should be)
but from the oddness and extravagancy of the Characters and
Subject: Which, tho not natural, yet not always against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and tho not true, yet diverting, and foolishly delightful.
A Farce is like a <hi>Dutch</hi> piece of Painting, or a Grotesque Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
extravagant and pleasant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>In my judgment it is so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crit.</speaker>
               <p>Well, we'll pass over that point. But why do you
make a Tragedy but three Acts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>O, that's customary in other Countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I have observ'd that many Plays of late are all talk and
no business; others have some business, but so much talk,
that the business is almost lost in the multiplicity of words,
and the Plays lag and grow tedions. Therefore, to avoid
this, I have now laid the business so close, that every Scene
may seem necessary to carry on the design and story of the
Play, and with as few words as I cou'd suppose sufficient;
therefore I confine my self to three Acts, which gives me also
opportunity to introduce some Musical Entertainments, and
those seeming natural to the Play; which few Poets have yet
observ'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Crit.</speaker>
               <p>I confess they bring in their Musick by head and
shoulders, and may serve in one Play as well as another. But
the main objection against your Play is, Your Lady, or chief
Character in your Play, being of Quality, and a marry'd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
sees a young Lord, hearkens to his Love, and gives up
her Honour in the first Act, without much ceremony or coutt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
How will the Boxes like this, Sir? There you are lost.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Peregrine,</hi> you have been a Traveller, and are a
fit Judge: In the first place, I say this great Lady and her
Lover were not strangers to each other, courtship had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
past betwixt them, they were contracted by Vows; but
being separated before they could be joined in Marriage, and
<pb facs="tcp:60148:4"/>
despairing ever to see one another again, the Lady is marry'd.
By ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ident they see each other, have opportunity of discourse,
their Love renews, the Gallant presses, the Lady is frail, and
they agreed upon the present moment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>Where lies the Scene?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>In <hi>Italy;</hi> you know it is not there as in <hi>England,</hi> where
we have easie access, and freedom of conversation, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Courtship. An opportunity there once lost, is
not to be recovered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>Right, therefore, there if the Gentleman likes the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the Lady the Gentleman, they presently come to the
point. An <hi>Italian</hi> Dame wou'd think you a very dull, heavy,
phlegmatick Lover, if you shou'd waste time in idle Ceremony
and Compliments. When Love is the Banquet, they fall to
without saying Grace, I can tell you.</p>

               <p>It is not the design of my Play to expose a Lady's frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so much as to raise her up to virtue when fallen. I intend
her fall not an example for vice. The great design being to
bring a guilty person to be pity'd in her circumstances. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Plays have made the Vertuous in misfortunes to be pity'd,
but the Guilty never yet, as I remember.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Very well: That design indeed is new, I like it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>And lastly, Sir, to show what evils may follow one ill
action, tho repented on as soon as done. And let the Moral
of the Play show, that one error brings more fatal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
than many virtuous actions can remedy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
tho it is good to repent of ill, 'tis better not to do ill:</p>

            <byline>Spoke by Mr. <hi>Bowman,</hi> mimicking a Beau.</byline>

               <hi>LOaded</hi> with Muffe, and Nose adorn'd with Snush,</l>
            <l>Eclips'd <hi>in Wig,</hi> like Owl in Ivey-Bush.</l>
            <l>With dangling Shoulder-knot o're Arm a kimbo,</l>
            <l>In fine embroyder'd Coat <hi>Just out of Limbo.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With all the Rhethorick of DOUX YEUX, I come</l>
            <l>To mitigate our trembling Author's doom;</l>
            <l>Who bid me beg your Smiles, (the Poets <hi>Alms,</hi>)</l>
            <l>In words as moving as the <hi>Singing Psalms.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Not doubting my success, because he knows,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Fair Sex</hi> must be obliging to the Beaux,</l>
            <l>For while those Gallants, who had Brains to spare,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Honor</hi> ran Campaigning every year,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Love! Love!</hi> The nobler Province of the two,</l>
            <l>Kept peaceful <hi>Beau</hi> at home to dye for you:</l>
            <l>Not that he fear'd the Wars, but some chance blow</l>
            <l>Might beat out his <hi>Fine Teeth,</hi> and then you know,</l>
            <l>Tho he, (the <hi>Man</hi>) were sav'd, that kills the Beau.</l>
            <l>Whose Courage might, no doubt, successful prove,</l>
