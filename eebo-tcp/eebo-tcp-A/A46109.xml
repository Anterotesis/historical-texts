            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>YOU are not miſtaken in taking it for granted, that I have read the ſeveral late <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to His Majeſty, for being the Subject of the chief diverſion of the Town, I ſhould have been unfit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, had I not ſo far conſulted them, as to be able, as well as others, to make them the matter of diſcourſe and entertainment among my Friends. But whereas you are further pleaſed to require my inward and ſerious thoughts concerning them, I muſt crave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tell you, That notwithſtanding all your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, and Authority over me, you ſhould never have been able to have extorted from me what you deſire, did not the Service which I owe His Majeſty, and the Government, command more at my hands, than the friendſhip and deference which I pay you, could have obliged me unto. So that you are to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my compliance with your requeſt, to its falling in with the Fealty and Allegiance which I render my Prince. And the more Freedom, and leſs Reſerve, you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94131:3"/>
find me to uſe upon this Subject, you are intirely to reſolve it into the Love and Compaſſion which I bear for the King, who I fear, is not only induſtriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, but wofully betrayed, by the judgment which ſome about him pretend to make of the ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People from theſe Addreſſes.</p>

               <p>For no Applications of this nature to the <hi>Regnant</hi> perſon are to be eſteem'd of any great weight or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy, if you do but conſider the Reſult of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Addreſſes Three and twenty year ago to <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> and how they only ſerved to render him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure till he was undermined and ſupplanted.

               <p>It is aſtoniſhing as well as ſurpriſing, that when <hi>Petitions</hi> had been not only diſcountenanced but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Proclamation, <hi>Addreſſes</hi> ſhould ſo ſoon after be encouraged and promoted! And our amaſement is greatly heightned, when we conſider that the <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were in reference to matters which every body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and in relation to ſuch things wherein the Law juſtified the Petitioners; whereas the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> reſpect matters which very few underſtand, and which the Law noways authoriſeth private men to meddle with, and which none ſave a Parliament have Power or Ability to decide and determine. For tho' men are to be eſteem'd capable of knowing their own wants, fears and dangers, and ought to be juſtified in begging thoſe means of Relief and Redreſs which the Law hath provided for them; yet every one is not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficiently qualified to determine concerning the Reaſonableneſs and Legality of Parliamentary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Reſolves; nor is any number of men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, empowered to Umpire differences between His Majeſty and His great Council.

               <p>Nor doth it appear to conſidering Perſons, that any advantage can arrive to the King or Government by them; whereas the miſchiefs and inconveniencies which do attend them, are obvious to every one. For what elſe do they tend unto, or can they be ſuppoſed calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for, but to divide the Nation into factions and parties, and to foment thoſe heats and animoſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong His Majeſties Liege people, Which are already too great to need to be farther heightned and enflamed. 'Tis His Majeſties deſire, as well as his intereſt and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be equally eſteemed the Father and Defender of all his people; but theſe Addreſſers would poſſeſs the Nation, that they only are to be accounted His Loyal Subjects; and that all His favours are only due, and ought to be confined to them: And by threatning the generality of people, that they have forfeited His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties affection and care, by refuſing to act as they do; they inſenſibly leſſen the love which His Majeſty ought to have in the hearts of all His Subjects, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abate the zeal which they would otherwiſe have for his Service. Nor can any ſay that Petitions have the ſame Effects, ſeeing amongſt Perſons in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſome may repreſent their wants and grievances, without prejudicing or giving offence to thoſe who chuſe ſilently to undergo them. And who knows, but that whil'ſt ſome think they are to ſeek their Relief by humble Applications unto, and fervent Importunities of their Prince; there may be others who hope, that their Soveraign may from the ſenſe which he hath of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94131:4"/>
their Calamities, afford them, at laſt, all the ſuccour he can, without the ſolicitation of their cries? But the nature of theſe Addreſſes being to commend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the preſent poſture of affairs, and to juſtify moſt of the ſteps and councels by which we have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into this doleful condition; they do in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare every one to be peeviſh and clamorous, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acquieſce and rejoice in this ſtate of things under which we groan and labour. And as they hereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all thoſe enemies unto them, whoſe ſafety and happineſs they are conceived, not only to abandon, but deſtroy; ſo the very Government, through the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Grace and Favour which it placeth upon their Applications, runs a hazard of loſing much of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration.</p>

               <p>And beſides this and many other miſchiefs, which they do naturally involve the Government and the Kingdom under; they will be found prejudicial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to the King, in the tendency which they have to deceive and abuſe him. For whereas they are deſigned to perſwade His Majeſty, that what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and ſuggeſt, is the common and univerſal ſenſe of his people, and that he may accordingly take his meaſures; it is both evident in it ſelf, and will be found ſo in the iſſue, that they contain and expreſs only the ſentiments of a few perſons of little intereſt, and moſt of them of a very ſmall and mean figure in the Nation. For if Elections of Members to ſerve in Parliament, be the beſt ſtandard to judge the diſpoſition of the Kingdom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94131:5"/>
by, it is not ſo long ſince we had an opportunity of feeling the Pulſe of the Nation; but that we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that all other things remaining as they did, the temper and complexion of the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, is alſo much the ſame. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever His Majeſty ſhall either find himſelf obliged from the neceſſity of His Affairs, or from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of His Inclinations be pleaſed, to call a Parliament, How little will he, upon a diſappointment of what he is made to believe and expect, judge himſelf indebted to thoſe who have ſo induſtriouſly deluded him?</p>

               <p>And as they are no ways ſubſervient to His Majeſties profit or ſervice; ſo neither will they in the event prove ſo uſeful either to a Popiſh or Arbitrary Deſign as ſome do apprehend. Not that any think the King knows of ſuch a Deſign promoted by them; but there are thoſe who may have ends in this, as in the <hi>Dutch</hi>-War and <hi>Black-Heath</hi>-Army, which His Majeſty was not aware of. But tho' ſome little creatures may have ultimately aim'd at ſome ſuch thing, by promoting of them; yet ſuch villanous deſigns are, in charity, to be ſuppoſed far from the intentions of moſt that have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them. And accordingly, when divers of the moſt zealous Actors in the carrying them on, have been calmly told what were the natural and ill tendencies of them, they have ſolemnly profeſſed, that they would ſooner be hanged at their own dores, than be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally acceſſory to the eſtabliſhing a Deſpotical Rule over the Nation, or the enſlaving the Kingdom to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94131:5"/>
again. Nay, it is to be hoped, that ſhould either or both theſe, at any time hereafter, more neerly and viſibly threaten <hi>England,</hi> that many of the preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers will, in their lawful ſtations, be amongſt the moſt forward and zealous to withſtand them. Nor will they in ſuch a caſe find any way to expiate their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, and attone for their preſent folly, but by thus demonſtrating, that it was no part of their intention hereby to contribute to theſe things. And ſhould any in the Liſt of the late <hi>Thanksgivers,</hi> be hereafter found to have promoted Addreſſes with a proſpect of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing either Tyranny or the Papal worſhip, the names and pretences of Law and the Proteſtant Religion, which they have not only flouriſhed their Papers with, but made His Majeſties promiſe of preſerving them the ground of their acknowledgments, and the foundation of the Tenders which they have made of their Lives and Fortunes, will entail an everlaſting infamy upon them, and render them the objects of all mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indignation. And in the mean time, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and fears which ſome are ſaid to have conceived of a Popiſh and Arbitrary deſign at the bottom of the Addreſſes, do by quickning the watchfulneſs of the Nation, ſerve not only to countermine, but to give them a total diſapointment therein.</p>

               <p>Nor yet in the next place, is the number of the Subſcribers ſo conſiderable, as to bear any proportion to thoſe who are againſt them. For tho' a few buſie people have made a great noiſe and buz in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of the Kingdom, yet all of them put together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make not ſo great a number as we have ſeen not long ſince to one Petition for a Parliamant. So that it is matter of wonder, that the Government for its own reputation hath not in ſome publick way prohibited and forbid them, and eſpecially when it finds, that after all the neglect and ſcorn which the Addreſſers are expoſed unto for their paucity and fewneſs, yet they have not the diſcretion to forbear and deſiſt. Sir, you muſt needs have obſerved by reading the <hi>Gazett's,</hi> where you have the Inventory of them, that almoſt all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the moſt principal Cities, ſuch as <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and the chiefeſt <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore and declined preſenting any. And I may add, that even where they have been obtained, not <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Ten,</hi> and in ſome places not <hi>One</hi> in a <hi>Hundred</hi> had any hand in, or gave concurrence to them. For if it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in juſtice as well as modeſty it ought, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever have either avoided or refuſed ſubſcribing, are as truely to be judged againſt them, as they who have poſitively withſtood, or directly oppoſed them, then the <hi>Tale</hi> of the Addreſſers will make but a very ſmall ſhow and appearance in the muſter Roll of the Nation.</p>

And whereſoever there is either a little bankrupt Tradeſman, a ſcandalous and diſgrac'd Attorney, one whoſe neceſſity expoſeth him to be biaſed by Cruſts of Bread and Pots of Ale, any whoſe folly makes them pragmatical and impertinent, or whoſe prodigality and ambition forceth them to look for preferment beyond their merit, theſe are infallibly in the front of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, and the unwearied and induſtrious procurers of thanks to His Majeſty for Diſſolving Parliaments. So that for many of them, their manners are ſuch, that did the King but truly underſtand what Character they paſs

               <p>Having thus far acquainted you with my freeſt and moſt Natural thoughts in General about them, it is time now that we more neerly inſpect and paſs our Judgment upon the matter of them: And if I miſtake not, the Preſuming to give His Majeſty Thanks for <hi>his Promiſing to Govern by Law,</hi> is no leſs than a Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and groſs Reflection upon him. For will not ſome men hereupon think that he hath Adminiſtered ſome juſt ground of fear or Belief, as if he intended to govern Arbitrarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or doth it not inſinuate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confin'd, that if he pleaſe he may do ſo? Or may we not ſay, that it plainly Intimates, that the beſt ſecurity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94131:8"/>
which we have to rely upon why he will not, is His Royal Word in his Late Declaration? It doth unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Engliſh Subjects to thank their Prince for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to Govern by Law, ſeeing as he never did, ſo he cannot do otherwiſe. His Miniſters may act illegally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are Lyable to anſwer for it; but he can do nothing but what the Law Directs and Juſtifies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor is he only bound to this by his Coronation Oath, which is however a more Sacred and Solemn tye than a Promiſe in a Declaration; but his own Greatneſs, and his very Prerogative, as having their own Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the Law, oblige him to it. For as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſays, <hi>Rex habet ſuperiorem Legem per quam factus eſt Rex,</hi> Lib. 3. de Action. Cap. 9. Sect. 3. And therefore that <hi>Lex froenum eſt Regis potentiae,</hi> The Law bounds and limits the King's Power. Nor can he, ſays <hi>Forteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue</hi> De Leg.

               <p>And whereas by all the Addreſſes they teſtifie with what approbation they have received His Majeſties late Declaration; it is too plain, that thereby they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate their Satisfaction in the Diſſolution of ſo many Parliaments.

                  <hi>unanimous conſent and delight therein.</hi> And others return His Majeſty <hi>ſolemn thanks for giving his two laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuch timely Diſſolutions.</hi> Had theſe people the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion and modeſty which might become them, they would have eſteem'd themſelves very improper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Judges of the prudentialneſs of that exerciſe of Royal Power. And this is the firſt preſident that ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw, of any Commoners giving His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty thanks for diſmiſſing Parliaments. For tho' ſome of our former Kings have, upon Miſunderſtandings ariſen between them and their Parliaments, abruptly Diſſolved them, and Publiſhed very weighty Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94131:10"/>
in Juſtification of what they did; yet whatever Submiſſion the people yielded to what theſe Princes had done, or how ſeaſonable and juſtifiable ſoever they in their own minds believed it, they never Addreſſed theſe Monarchs in a way of Thanks for doing of it. And tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poſſibly the laſt Long Parliament, was through its long Sitting, eſteemed a great grievance to the Nation, and too many of its Members judged eaſily manageable for betraying the liberty of the Subject, had they been powerfully tempted thereunto, and tho' His Majeſties Diſſolving them was entertained with an Univerſal joy, yet none had the folly to thank him for it, as knowing of what fatal conſequence ſuch an action might afterwards prove. And whether the many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments which ſome have returned the King for Diſſolving Two ſuch Parliaments, that for what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Printed <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Debates,</hi> were filled with Men of as great integrity and ability, as well as Gentlemen of as great Eſtates, as have in any age met together in the great Councel and Senate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; do become thoſe that are well-wiſhers to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion either at home or abroad, or ſuch as have duly conſidered the preſent ſtate of the Nation, and the many dangers with which it is encompaſſed, may be worthy of their moſt ſerious thoughts, when they are at leaſure to look back upon, and examine what they have done. Surely thoſe men, who at the ſame time thank the King for promiſing to Govern by Law, never conſidered that it is both a fundamental Law of the Kingdom, and much of the ſoul and life of all our Laws, not only to have frequent Parliaments, but have them permitted to ſit to diſpatch the affairs of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94131:10"/>
the Nation. Nor can they be ſuppoſed to have ſeriouſly weighed how when the Kingdom ſeems in ſo much danger from an aſpiring and formidable Neighbour, our Religion and Lives ſo greatly in hazard by the helliſh conſpiracies of the Papiſts, our Allies in ſo much need of countenance and aſſiſtance, that the King, tho' never ſo well inclined, as we will always believe His Majeſty to be, cannot without the concurrence, aid and advice of a Parliament, do any thing that may effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe weighty, importunate and loud calls. For what can His Majeſty be conceived able to do in ſuch circumſtances, when he hath neither power over the Purſes of his people, nor can ſo much as command the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Nation to march out of their reſpective Counties? But that which theſe Addreſſes imply, which is yet of more dangerous importance, is that the very Being of Parliaments doth wholly depend upon the will &amp; pleaſure of the King. Whereas ſuch a ſuppoſal is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the conſtitution of the Kingdom, does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way comport with the ends of our Government, and might prove very dangerous to the ſafety and happineſs of the Nation, in caſe we ſhould hereafter have a King void of compaſſion to, and regardleſs of the intereſt of his people. For tho' it be left to the Wiſdom of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign where he will have Parliaments to Aſſemble, and belongs to His Prerogative to call them when his own Princely occaſions, or the neceſſities of his people do require; yet the Law which His Majeſty is ſworn to obſerve, it being a part of His Coronation Oath, <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Leges &amp; conſuetudines Regni,</hi> doth both provide that<note place="margin">4 Ed. 3. cap. 14. 36.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94131:11"/>
doth at leaſt imply ſomething of their continuing to ſit till thoſe affairs be accompliſhed, and the ſaid ends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed and obtained. Nor will His Majeſty be ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe that he can be thought to Govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, without calling Parliaments whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the diſtreſſes and grievances of His people beſpeak and require them. Neither is it to be imagined that he ſhould long harbour any ſuch thought in His Royal breaſt, That he can anſwer the directions and ends of the Law, without permitting Parliaments to ſit ſuch a convenient ſeaſon, as that they may in conjunction with His Majeſty, relieve the people from their manifold fears, redreſs the numerous and ſore grievances of the Nation, and provide for the ſafety, ſtrength, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Kingdom.</p>

For it is more than probable, that nothing ſo much influenced the bringing and preſſing the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> as a regard to the Preſervation of the Monarchy; which ſome of the beſt, wiſeſt, and moſt Loyal of His Majeſty's Subjects think the coming to have a Popiſh King may ſhake and endanger; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering what this Nation felt from the laſt Papiſt that poſſeſt the Throne; and how it hath been of late, and ſtill is threatned by the Bloody Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party. Beſides, it had not been amiſs, if our late Addreſſers had owned, that the King, Lords and Commons have a Power to diſpoſe of the Succeſſion; as they ſhall judge moſt conducible to the Safety, Intereſt and Happineſs of the Kingdom; and that he is His Majeſties Heir and Succeſſor, upon whom the whole Legiſlative Power ſhall think meet to ſettle the Inheritance of the Crown. Nor would it have misbecome men profeſſing the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and tender of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, to have recommended to His Majeſties ſecond Thoughts and maturer Advice, what three ſeveral Parliaments have with ſo much ſtrength of Reaſon inſiſted upon, and with ſo much

earneſtneſs purſued and deſired. And I wiſh they were able to tell us what they mean, when at the ſame time that they engage to defend the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, they vow, <hi>to the laſt drop of their Blood, to ſtand by the next Succeſſor;</hi> And the rather, becauſe there is ſome reaſon to believe, that many of them will not be over-forward to dye Martyrs.

And if the King's hitherto governing by Law, hath not been ſufficient to diſcourage our Popiſh Enemies from Conſpiring our Deſtruction; Can it be apprehended, That His Majeſties <hi>adherence to the Laws</hi> for the future,

will remove the Jealouſies, and allay the Fears which we have of the Papiſts?

Our dreadful Apprehenſions do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any ill Opinion which we have of the King, but from the implacable Hatred which the Romiſh Faction bear as well againſt Him, as His Proteſtant Subjects; and from the Corruption of thoſe Officers of Juſtice, who do either abuſe or pervert the Law to baſe Ends, or hinder its due and Legal Execution. Nor is it our having good Laws, but their being truely executed, that will advantage and relieve us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to be pardoned tho' we profeſs our ſelves doubtful of our ſecurity by them, whilſt ſome that have been entruſted with the adminiſtration of them, are ſuffered to eſcape the puniſhments which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for obſtructing their courſe, and for perverting of them. And what if we ſhould with all thankfulneſs acknowledg, that we are in ſome ſecurity during His Majeſties Life, will the Laws which we have, without ſome farther and more effectual proviſion before His Majeſties Death, contribute much to our ſafety, when we ſhall hereafter have a Popiſh King to Reign over us? But can theſe men be ſuppoſed in earneſt, when they tell us that the Nation is in no danger, while the Papiſts continue ſo active to extirpate the <hi>Northern Hereſie,</hi> and are in a more hopeful way to effect it than ever? Alas! the Popiſh Plot, inſtead of being defeated, is not ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94131:13"/>
much as yet throughly detected: And inſtead of the Papiſts being diſmay'd by that diſcovery which hath been made, or by the juſtice which hath been inflicted upon ſome of the Criminals, they are only enflam'd to proſecute their diveliſh conſpiracy with the greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and to execute what they intend with more bloody rage. Can any man that is not void of common ſenſe believe, that we are ſafe and out of danger, when every true Proteſtant is in daily hazard through their Sham-plots, and by their hiring and ſuborning vile and execrable Villains to Swear Treaſon againſt thoſe that have any zeal for our Religion and Civil Liberties? How can we be ſuppoſed arrived at any meaſure of Safety, when there are an Hundred things abſolutely neceſſary to be done towards our preſervation, wherein the King tho' fully diſpoſed <hi>to adhere to the Laws,</hi> is in no capacity to meddle, without the aſſiſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his Parliament? And therefore if men will after all that they have ſeen, felt, heard and read of a damnable Popiſh Plot to deſtroy the perſon of the King, overthrow the eſtabliſhed Religion, and enſlave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an Antichriſtian forraign Power, flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a bare Declaration, that His Majeſty will <hi>Govern by Law,</hi> that thereupon all is ſafe and ſecure, they muſt not take it ill if they be thought acceſſary to their own and the Kingdoms ruine through their dull and blockiſh incredulity, to ſay no worſe.</p>

               <p>Another ill tendency of moſt, if not all the Addreſſes, is the reviving the memory of the late unhappy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94131:14"/>
which is the intereſt both of His Majeſty and the whole Kingdom to have buried in perpetual oblivion. For the mentioning of that War with reflection and bitterneſs, ſerves only to make men remember three haſty Diſſolutions of Parliaments, and Twelve years want of one, with ſome other things which fell out in that ſpace, all which both preceded and had too great an influence towards the cauſing of it. Beſides, there was a Maſſacre of the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts there, and a bloody War commenced for the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Engliſh Government in that Kingdom; which as it too much exaſperated the minds of men towards that unhappy War which begun here, ſo I fear the upbraiding men too much with their concern in thoſe troubles, will not prove very uſeful to the party that appears moſt forward in it. Nor is it eaſie to be imagined how the mention of the late War comes to be brought upon the Stage at this time of day, ſeeing moſt that were believed either the firſt fomenters of, or proved afterwards Actors in it, are dead and gone; and for their Children (witneſs many of the moſt violent and high flown Clergy) they are commonly found to be of Principles directly contrary to what they were. Nay, that which renders all reproachful Diſcourſe of that War at this juncture ſtill more ſtrange, is that the ignominy and <hi>odium</hi> of it is deſigned to fall upon many of the chiefeſt of thoſe that ſerved under the Banners of the late King, or upon ſuch who ſprung from them that did, and have their Fathers loyalty mixed with their blood. And to deal plainly, I know nothing that can ſo plauſibly juſtifie the Parliaments Cauſe in that War, as the telling the World that there was little or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94131:14"/>
no difference betwixt their Principles and the Principles of thoſe that ſet in the Two laſt Parliaments, whoſe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Addreſſers do with ſo much indecency brand and aſperſe. And the language that is dayly beſtowed upon the Members of theſe late Parliaments, as being men of the ſame complexion that they of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Forty one were, will, inſtead of leaving any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon them on whom it is intended to be faſtned, beget a better opinion of thoſe to whom they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, than the Addreſſers would be willing that they of this Age ſhould find reaſon to entertain. I may add, that none have lived more peaceably, and with better ſubmiſſion, under His Majeſties Government, than they who were engaged on the Parliaments ſide in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War; and therefore it doth not ſeem an act of any great prudence to diſcourage them in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by upbraiding them with that, which the Law hath not only pardoned, but which they have expiated by their loyalty ſince. Nor do I think that when the Parliament, after the Kings Reſtauration, made the Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> wherein among other things enacted which they judged neceſſary towards the Settlement of the Nation, they prohibited, under a Penalty, one man's reproaching another with his being concerned in that War, during the ſpace of three years after the date of the ſaid Act, that ever they intended, that men ſhould afterwards with the greateſt Licenciouſneſs and Scurrility upbraid one another with it. Nay, they hop'd, that if the Spirits and Tongues of men were ſo long bridled and reſtrain'd, their Animoſities would be wholy extinguiſhed before the expiration of that time. And none but men of very implacable Spirits would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94131:15"/>
call over, and with ſo much <hi>Satyr</hi> aſperſe men for theſe things; eſpecially when there hath not been the leaſt cauſe adminiſtred for it: unleſs it be, that ſuch have a greater tenderneſs and value for the Proteſtant Religion and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, than to deſire they ſhould come to lye at the diſcretion of a Popiſh Prince, as the Addreſſers plainly wiſh they may.</p>

               <p>As our Affairs are now circumſtanced, and as the ſtate of the Proteſtant Religion ſtands at preſent in <hi>England,</hi> the Addreſſes carry another ill Deſign in them, which is, to enflame differences further among our ſelves, and thereby betray us into the hands of Popiſh Adverſaries. For as if the principal thing we were to aim at, were not the preſerving our Religion againſt the Conſpiracies of the Papiſts, and as if the united ſtrength of all Proteſtants were not little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to effect and obtain it; no leſs will ſerve moſt, if not all of the late Addreſſers, than the Executing the Laws with the utmoſt Severity againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters. And as if there very thinking of a Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick had made them <hi>delirous,</hi> they will not allow the Parliament to make the leaſt abatement in the terms of Conformity, or to give Indulgence in, or diſpenſe with one Ceremony; though all the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Form of Worſhip,</hi> and the very <hi>Hierarchy</hi> it ſelf, can plead no other Authority by which they are enjoined, or by which the Subjects of this Land are bound to comply with and ſubmit to them, but ſome Acts of Parliament. Nay, ſo little do the perſons, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94131:15"/>
have Subſcibed the Addreſſes, underſtand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, as now by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that they would not have an Act to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which may under a Popiſh Prince, and in caſe Popery come to be ſet up, prove as fatal and miſchivous to them that are at this time the Conformable Clergy, as it will to the Diſſenters; tho' at preſent it do only reach and be applied to the latter. And that I may not ſeem to impoſe upon them, Is not all this the full and plain import of their joining <hi>Popiſh Recuſants</hi> and <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>

And as if this were not ſufficient to declare what they mean, they not only take upon them to thank His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>For not paſſing Limitations or Nullifications of ſuch wholeſome Acts as were deſigned for Preſervation of the Reformed Religion, eſpecially the 35th of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and for not ſuffering that Law, and others made againſt Conventicles to be Repealed: but they humbly pray His Majeſty, that thoſe Laws now in force, may vigorouſly, ſpeedily and equally be put in Execution againſt all Papiſts and Proteſtant Diſſenters;</hi> And particularly, <hi>that the Statutes of the third of King</hi> James, <hi>and the five and thirtieth of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>may be put and continued in their due Execution.</hi> It is ſomething ſtrange to find a company of men ſo zealous for the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when divers of them are the Diſgrace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of any Religion which they take upon them to profeſs. But can we believe that they are Proteſtants, or at leaſt that they underſtand the Proteſtant Intereſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94131:16"/>
who repreſent Diſſenters as equally dangerous to the Government &amp; Eſtabliſhed Religion, as the Papiſts are? It would adminiſter a ground of too ill an Opinion of our Supreme Rulers and Publick Miniſters, ſhould they allow and approve what theſe men have ſuggeſted. For are there any among the Diſſenters, that have ſworn Obedience to a <hi>Forreign</hi> Power, that they ſhould be thus put into the ſame Liſt of dangerous perſons to the Government with the Papiſts? Or is there any Security that the Legiſlative Power can require of them for their Peaceableneſs, that they are not willing and ready to give? Yea, Is not the Religion of the Diſſenters eſtabliſhed by Law, as well as that of the Conformiſts, tho' there be ſome things Ordained, as the Accoutrements and Modes of the National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which the Non-Conformiſts cannot ſubmit unto? For as the only Foundation upon which the Diſſenters go, is that their Faith and Worſhip are agreeable and according to the Scripture, which is the alone Rule of the mind of God to all his People, in what they are to believe and perform: So from the Authority which the Scripture hath allowed unto it by the Law of this Land, and by the Conſonancy of their Doctrine to the Eſtabliſh'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Articles of Faith, they humbly conceive that they have the countenance and warranty of the Law for their Religion. Nor doth the Law diſallow or forbid any thing which they profeſs; it only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns ſome further things, which they cannot come up to. And as the Diſſenters do not oppoſe any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo they blame and judge no man for the Canonical Obedience that they promiſe to the Biſhops, or their Conformity to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94131:16"/>
the Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but merely beg that themſelves may be excuſed. And ſhould they be gratified as to all which in our preſent circumſtances they do deſire, it would amount only to this, That they may Preach the Goſpel without being liable to Impriſonment, Fines, and Baniſhment. Nor do they covet Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, or Parochial Maintainance; tho' were it not for ſome things, which are made the <hi>Teſts</hi> to thoſe Places and Advantages, and which without any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency might be laid aſide, there are many of them that are as worthy of them as others. Neither can that which is ſtiled the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer any diminution in the number of its Members by an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Proteſtant Diſſenters, having both <hi>this will I give thee,</hi> and thus <hi>ſaith the Migiſtrate</hi> on their ſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Clergy ſhould fall ſhort in Abilities for their Function, and in having <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi> to plead for them. But how dare theſe perſons, who have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Addreſſes, aſſume the confidence to cenſure Parliaments, for going about to repeal Laws, which by woful Experience have been found not only uſeleſs, but inconvenient, both to the Proteſtant Religion, and the Safety of the Kingdom? For as Parliaments have Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Enact Laws, ſo they have the ſame Power to Aboliſh them, whenſoever they find, that inſtead of anſwering the Ends which they were made for, they have proved prejudicial to the Common Good. And ſurely one may humbly ſay, and that without the leaſt Reflection upon the Grace and Favour with which the Addreſſes have been received, that two Parliaments, ſo fairly and unanimoſly choſen, and conſiſting of Gentlemen of the Chiefeſt Quality, beſt Parts, greateſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94131:17"/>
Wiſdom, moſt plentiful Eſtates, and firmeſt Integrity to the Intereſt of Religion and the Nation, and all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a very few, Zealous Sons of the Church, and unfained Defenders of the preſent Hierarchy, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Forms and Rites of Worſhip; were in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability as able and likely to know what will let in or keep out Popery, what will preſerve us from, or betray us into the hands and power of the Papiſts, as Twenty or Thirty perſons in a County or Corporation, moſt of whom are not worth Forty Shillings Freehold a year, and many of them not able to ſpeak Ten words of ſenſe together. But it is eaſie to conjecture who in divers places ſet theſe Addreſſers at work, and who put that in reference to Proteſtant Diſſenters into ſo many Addreſſes, namely, either perſons Popiſhly inclined, that they might thereby continue and heighten our differences, and make us the more eaſily a prey to <hi>Rome;</hi> or ſome ignorant Clergy-men, who beſides their enmity at Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, have little elſe to recommend them to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a common and civil reſpect, but their <hi>Caſſock</hi> and their <hi>Surplice.</hi>

The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts being charged with a Helliſh conſpiracy againſt the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94131:18"/>
perſon of the King, our Religion, Government, and the lives of all His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects; and this being proved againſt them to the ſatisfaction of all the rational part of mankind, as well by their own Papers, as by the Teſtimonies of many unqueſtionable Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and finding that neither their impudent denying it, nor their falſely ſcandalizing ſome, and endeavouring to debauch and corrupt others of the Kings Evidence, could either bring them off from the Scandal of this Plot, or free them from the Puniſhment, which were a Parliament permitted to Sit, more of them muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo; they retreat to this as their laſt refuge, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the amuſing the Nation with the Buz of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> and <hi>Phanatick</hi> Plot, carried on to overthrow the Government, and deſtroy the Monarchy, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of proſecuting a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Conſpiracy. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining credit to this, they not only form'd the <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the <hi>Meal-Tnb,</hi> but invented the Shams of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi>'s murdering himſelf, and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s penning <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Libel; which tho' they have ſhamefully redounded upon themſelves, yet having no other game to play, they are ſtill labouring, partly by ſuborning Witneſſes, and hiring impudent Raſcals to ſwear Treaſon againſt Proteſtants, and partly by a groundleſs and impudent clamour, to infect unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heedleſs perſons with the perſwaſion of ſuch a deſign. And it is from the Papiſts that weak and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous people have taken the ſcent of a Presbyterian Plot, <hi>and aſcribe it to His Majeſties Wiſdom and Soveraign</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Addr. from <hi>Eye</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>authority, that we are not relapſing into the miſeries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Tyranny and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, by the ſubtile artifice and cunning contrivances of the old enemies of the Monarchy and the Church, who by the inſinuations of Religion, Liberty and Property, prevail, upon weak and unwary men to make</hi>

                  <hi>them ſubſervient to their factious and ambitious deſigns.</hi> Surely, theſe men never conſidered what a notorious ſcandal they have hereby endeavoured to faſten, not only upon many of His Majeſties peaceable, beſt and moſt loyal Subjects, but what a vile aſperſion they have caſt upon the whole Kingdom, which greatly ſuffers in its honour, by ſtanding repreſented in the face of all the World, as broken and divided with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, and ſinking back again into all confuſion: Nor have they duly weighed what a Reflection they lodge upon the Kings Government and Conduct, that He who was ſo lately Reſtored by the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and with the univerſal Joy of all his People, ſhould in ſo few years have loſt the Love and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſo great a number of His Subjects, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here to be be accuſed. Can there be any thing vented to the diminiſhing His Majeſties Reputation more abroad, and for diſcouraging Forreign Princes and States from entring into thoſe Alliances which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good, as well of His Majeſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as of Chriſtendom, and for the leſſening the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and confidence which thoſe with whom we are in League, ought to remain poſſeſt with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to anſwer the ends of them, than this account which theſe men preſent His Majeſty with, of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Nation, and temper of his People, and which our <hi>Gazettes</hi> have diffuſed into all Countries? And doth not this alſo directly tend to the filling His Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects with Jealouſies one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, thereby to take them off from their watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over, and to weaken their endeavours againſt the Papiſts, who labour no leſs to deſtroy the Diſſenters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thoſe that Conform to the National Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to the Eſtabliſhed Diſcipline and Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94131:19"/>
and for the withſtanding of whoſe Bloody Deſigns, and ſaving our Religion and the Nation from the effects of their malicious and deſperate Conſpiracies, the united Hearts and Hands of all true Proteſtants will be found little enough? And will not this Character, which the Addreſſes are pleaſed to give of the ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> wonderfully embolden that aſpiring Monarch, the <hi>French</hi> King, to proceed in his encroachments upon the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his Neighbours, as judging himſelf ſecure from any check which the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> can give him? For as His Majeſty can be in no capacity to diſcourage him from further Attempts againſt the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> or to hinder his Conqueſt, but by being great in the Hearts of all his own People, and in a happy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and Conjunction with his Parliament; ſo we have reaſon to fear, that they who endeavour to beget Miſunderſtandings betwixt His Majeſty and his Subjects, and to create in them mutual Diſtruſts each of other, are either Penſioners to <hi>France,</hi> or under the Conduct and Influence of them that are.</p>

Whereas theſe excellent perſons, of which the two laſt Houſes of Commons conſiſted, had many of them ventured their Lives, and loſt their Eſtates for the Monarchy; and all of them were ſuch, as upon Principles of Reaſon and from Inclination are true Lovers of it. They not only had too late and ſad Experience of a Commonwealth, to be fond of returning to it again; but they know, that no other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can agree with the Genius of the People, and ſuit the ballance of the Nation, but a well-Regulated Monarchy, ſuch as ours is by the Laws of our Conſtitution.

It is no marvel that ſuch thirſt after War, who have little to live upon in Time of Peace, and who may expect to be Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Troubles: But His Majeſty, who beſides the care He is to to have of the Lives and Eſtates of all his Subjects, hath more to loſe Himſelf alone, than all his People, will not, I judge, be prevailed upon to hearken to raſh and heady Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.

               <p>The laſt thing I would obſerve concerning the Addreſſes, is their making ſmall numbers of men without previous advice had with each other, and without being authoriſed or entruſted, to judge of the State of the Kingdom. For tho' it be lawful for any one man, and much more for any number of men, to repreſent to His Majeſty their own wants and dangers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly beg redreſs and relief; yet to declare the State of the Nation, belongs to no number of private perſons whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but appertains only to the Parliament, as being the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the whole Kingdom. And therefore the Addreſſers, by aſſuming to themſelves a Right and Authority to determine about the State of the Nation, and to judge concerning thoſe things which the <hi>Truſtees</hi> of all the people met in the great Councel, are only proper and by Law allowed to meddle with, have in my apprehenſion made too near an approach to the altering the whole Government. And as they muſt expect that the judgment which they have paſſed upon perſons and things will at one time or another come under a review; ſo matters which have either been miſrepreſented by them, or in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to which Parliaments have been arraigned, may before then, come to be ſo well underſtood by His Majeſty, and all things ſo well adjuſted between him and his people, that the Addreſſers may neither find themſelves able to decline, nor be in a condition to controll the jurisdiction of the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which we ſhall at preſent leave them.</p>
