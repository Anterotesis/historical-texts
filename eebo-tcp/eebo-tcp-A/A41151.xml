            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of the Definition and cauſe of Combuſtions or
Burnings.</head>
            <p>ALthough Combuſtions be very well knowne
from other effects, yet for the better explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Doctrine, before wee enter any
further, we will thus deſcribe it.</p>
            <p>Combuſtion is the ſolution of continuity of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermis
or the outward skin of the body, ſometimes
of <hi>Cutis</hi> or the true skin, and oftentimes of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi>
Fleſh, Veynes, Arteries, Nerves, &amp;c. marked
with the ſtrength of the Fire; Now there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after this Combuſtion vehement paine, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
puſtels, &amp;c. and if the Combuſtion be deep,
the body will be foule, and will eaſily produce a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and malignant Vlcer, for as ſoone as ever the fire
or the firy ſubſtance hath touched the skin, the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
moyſture is preſently dryed from the part; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the skin waxeth hard, and is drawn together. The
reſt of the Humour which remaineth within the skin
and the parts adjacent, becommeth very hot, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the nature of the Fire: Furthermore, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the skin which the parts circumjacent have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54589:4"/>
drawne together, as alſo the Ebullution of Humours
and ſolution of Continuity do raiſe intollerable pain,
which draweth unto it many humours from the parts
adjacent, which (if the Combuſtion be but light) doth
run together under the upper skin, and hardneth the
ſame, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the Fire; and not
admitting tranſpiration they are lifted up, and hereby
come puſtels; but if the Combuſtion be great, ſo
that the true skin be alſo hurt, it will be hardned unto
an Eſcarre, then the Humours which are ingendred
and whatſoever elſe is retained and impriſoned under
that hard skin will ſtill flow thither by reaſon of the
paine, whereby not onely the heat which they have
received of the Fire is increaſed; but alſo what blood
or Humours ſover doth flow from the body and the
parts adjacent, do alſo wax hot and burning, and doe
get a certaine ſharpe and biting quality: Hereby it
commeth to paſſe, that the Humours doe crode and
knaw the place affected, and doe cauſe a great Vlcer.</p>
            <p>Furthermore it is to be noted, that as there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things with the which the Fire doth imprint his
ſtrength and quality, which as they doe differ in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſo one much more vehemently burneth then
the other; therfore how much hard or ſolid the wood
or mettle is, ſo much the more ardent heat is retained
therein: Alſo the heat of Oyle, Fat, waxe, pitch, new
wine boyled unto the third part, as hereafter we will
declare by an example; and thoſe which doe lightly
ſticke are much mor hotter then hot water; For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
teacheth that Lead will be diſſolved in hot
Oyle, which will never be done in water, although it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54589:4"/>
be in the height of heat. When Lyme is quenched
then it is ſo heated, that not onely it exulcerateth and
burneth the skin and the fleſh, but alſo it moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
draweth together the skin, nervs, and junctures.
But the moſt vehement and dangerous Fire of all, is
Heavenly Fire, or Lightning, for it containeth ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
Faculties, as hereafser in order ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. The Degree and diſtribution of Combuſtions declared
in three particulars, as alſo from whence the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
curative are to be taken.</head>
            <p>ALthough Combuſtions be made of divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as with mettels and liquors, as wee have
afore declared, yet that little or nothing profiteth to
the cure; for even as Combuſtions made with red
hot Iron is like unto Combuſtions made with Gold
or Silver being hot, ſo alſo Cembuſtions whether
they be made with hot Oyle, wax, pitch, &amp;c. among
themſelves (according to their ſnbſtance) doe not
differ, neither do they require a particular Method in
curing; Even as that moſt worthy D. D. <hi>Laurentius
Faubertus,</hi> a ſingular man, and well practiſed in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery,
doth teſtifie. Now as the Cure may bee
rightly inſtituted, we will divide all Combuſtions, of
what fiery matter ſoever they are made, into 3. diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to wit, into a Small, Indifferent, and Great;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54589:5"/>
For if the thing which burneth doth not long ſtick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the body, or be but light as ſtraw, flax, hemp, or any
kind of light or dry wood, or any thing which quickly
falleth off, they are but only puſtels raiſed, and this is
the firſt degree or particular: <hi>But if the ſubſtance doe
ſomething longer ſtick, or ſhall be induced with a more
violent heat, then not only the Puſtels are raiſed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the true skin is made deſtitute of Radicall moyſture
from the part, and it is ſomething dryed and drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but not as yet any Eſcar made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the fiery matter do ſtick very long, and
doth contain in it a moſt violent heat, then not onely
the true skinn, but alſo the fleſh, veins, arteirs, Nerves
&amp;c. are burned, drawn together, and dryed into an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skar,
becauſe the naturall moyſture is conſumed, with
the ſtrength of the fire: wherfore there are Medicines
which are to be changed and applyed, according to
theſe differences, as hereafter is declared. <hi>The ſecond
Iudication is taken from the part affected, for not one
and the ſame Medicine doth agree with the Eye Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
generative, nerves, Iunctures, muſculous, fleſh, &amp;c.</hi>
Alſo women and children, who are endued with an
exquiſite ſence, do require more gentle Medicines, but
contrary thoſe of a hard and ruſtique fleſh, and which
are ſtrong men, require more ſtronger Remedies, as
<hi>Galen</hi> rightly admoniſheth.</p>
            <p>From this deſcription, and diſtribution of Combuſtions
the Method of curing eaſily appeareth, which wee (God
willing) will declare in three Chapters, like as wee have
diſtributed Combuſtions in three Species or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">

            <head>CHAP. III. The Signes by the which thoſe three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Combuſtions may be knowne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</head>
            <p>SEeing that wee have divided Combuſtions
into three degrees or ſpecies, and further,
have preſcribed a proper remedy unto every
particular, it is neceſſary to declare how they are
diſtinguiſhed by ſignes and notes; Therefore the
ſignes of the firſt particular or ſmall Combuſtion
are theſe, redneſſe of the skin, a ſharpe and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pain, like as though the skin were rubbed with
Nettle-ſced; by and by (except there be fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
applyed) the place is inflamed, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
doe ariſe, in the which is contained cleere
and white water, as alſo the upper skin is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
A light combuſtion is knowne by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
to wit, that the firy ſubſtance was
gentle, as Straw, Flaxe, Hempe, and the like; or
that did fall off, as hot water: or that the part
touched it but a little moment of time, on the
contrary in the other ſpecies, the firy ſubſtance did
touch the part a longer time, or it retained ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54589:6"/>
greater heat in it, as hot iron, or any liquid mettle
hard wood, Pitch, Oyle, Wax, and the like: From
hence it commeth, that the place doth preſently
inflame, waxeth red, painfull and burneth, and in
the very ſame moment puſtels are elevated, in
which are contained thin water, and waxeth yellow
and is ſore by reaſon of the ſtretching of the skin,
which is ſtretched and drawne together by the
ſtanch of the fire. Now in the laſt Species, even
in the ſame moment when the firy ſubſtance doth
ſticke to the body, there are puſtels elevated, but
preſently they fall again, and chiefly in ſame place
where the Combuſtion is great and vehement, and
the under skinne ſeemeth blacke and wanne, and
hardly feeleth, though it bee pricked with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,
for there is a hard and dry cruſt, which when
it falleth off, there remaineth a deep and profound
Vlcer, from the nature of the firy matter, and the
ſpace how long it hath ſtucke unto the body, a
great Combuſtion may be knowne. Furthermore
Combuſtions doth ſpeedily require a Surgeon, and
let him inquire to what Species it is to be referred
To wit, whether it be light, indifferent or great, if
it be light, let it be holpen with the remedies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the 6. Chap. leaſt puſtels bee raiſed; if
indifferent, then tune unto the 7. Chap. but if it
be vehement and great, poceed; as we have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the 8. Chapter.</p>

            <p>A Light Combuſtion, where the the skin is
only hurt, although it be ſomething pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
yet it may eaſily, and in a ſhort time
be cured, and there will ſcarce any ſcarre be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
if the cure be rightly inſtituted, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Art: But contrary, a great Combuſtion
is hard to be healed, which alſo leaveth behinde it
a filthy and withered ſcarre, by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and contraction of the skin, if puſtils do not
appeare in the beginning. The many humours do
concurre together unto the offended part, which
do putrifie and get a kind of a ſharpe and knawing
quality, ſo that they doe deeply crode the skin and
fleſh, and do cauſe a rotten ulcer and naughty Scar:
Therefore the puſtels are preſently to be cut, that
the ſharp and hot water may flow forth.</p>
            <p>In wholſome and well-tempered bodies Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions
is healed with a little labour: Contrary
in foule and plethorique bodies, it is hardly cured,
and doth eaſily grow to a putred ulcer.</p>
            <p>For paine doth continually draw unto it Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and blood from the Body, hereby the part
affected, waxeth hot, and it flamed, and divers and
naughty Symtomes doe follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54589:7"/>
Combuſtions of the head and face do leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them ſmooth ſcarres, for the skin is ſo dryed
and contracted with the fire, and the pores ſo ſhut,
that the haire will never after come forth, nor
grow.</p>
            <p>Combuſtions of the Eyes and the Eye-browes,
and of the members Adnata and Cornea although
they be light, yet are they dangerous, and there
may eaſily follow a deprivation of ſight, or at the
leaſt a great imbicility, and the eye-lids may bee
turned inwards.</p>
            <p>Alſo Combuſtions of the Groyne are very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and hard to be cured, for theſe Members
neere unto the privie parts are moiſt, weake, and
eaſily hurt by flux of humours.</p>
            <p>Combuſtions of the Belly is alwayes dangerous
and hard to be cured, for the muſcels of <hi>Abdomen</hi>
are in perpetuall motion, by reaſon of inſpiration
expiration and extention, which is mad with meat
and drinke, excretion of excrement, laughing, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as I have obſerved in my Country of <hi>Hildane</hi>
in a certaine Childe of three yeares old, for hee
being affected with a dangerous burne in the belly
procured us much buſineſſe the ſpace of eight
months.</p>
            <p>But if an inteſtine or gut in any part be burnt, it
is mortall, as alſo the burning of Lightning is
mortall, as it is declared in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Combuſtion of the great veſſels of the Arteries
and Veynes are dangerous, chiefly if it be deepe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54589:7"/>
for the heat contracteth and ſhutteth thoſe veſſels
whereby the ſpirits and blood cannot flow to give
life and nouriſhment, and then followeth <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grena</hi>
and <hi>Atrophia,</hi> as wee have ſhewed in our
Tract <hi>De Gangrena &amp; Sphacelo.</hi> Burning alſo of
the Nerves and Articuls doe eaſily draw together
the junctures: Therefore it is needfull that the
Surgeon doe uſe great diligence in theſe kinde of
Burnings, and that he ſtudy preſently from the
beginning to ſoften the hardneſſe and roughneſſe
of the skin with fit medicines, and to draw away
and diſperſe the violent heat of the fire.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Of a two-fold Method of curing Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</head>
            <p>ALthough there be an infinite number of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
in uſe both among Practitioners and
the vulger ſort of people for burnings, whether
they be Plaiſters or Ointments, juices, or diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
water; nevertheleſſe, that all doe tend to the
ſame end, to wit, that they doe either choke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
or diſſipate the corrupt matter or heat, which
is left in the part, now the ſuffocating or choking
of corrupt matter is done, either with cold and
moiſt mndicines, as with the juices and waters of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54589:8"/>
Houſlike, Lettice, Henbane, Nightſhad, and the
like, or elſe with cold and dry things, ſuch as are
<hi>bale armeni Terra ſigillat,</hi> Ceruſe, Potters Clay,
and ſuch like plaiſters, which doe ſhut the pores,
ſo that the outward heat which is left by the fire,
may be choaked and quenched like unto fire, which
is ſhut into a cloſe place.</p>
            <p>The other way of quenching hot humours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in this, that the outward heate and ſharpe
humours be reſolved and ſcattered, even as we ſee
coles to be quenched if they bee ſcattered hither
and thither, which is done by hot Medicines, as
we will ſhew in the next Chapter, it ſhall not bee
needfull to enquire what Method is to be uſed.</p>
            <p>They which doe follow the firſt Method, doe
think themſelvs to be ſufficiently authorized with
this generall rule of <hi>Hipocrates.</hi> Contrary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are made of contrary things.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing Combuſtions is a hot accident, wee
ought to cure it with his contrary, which is with
cold things, which may extinguiſh the hot &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
humours left by the fire: I do confeſſe thoſe
ſentences of Phyſitians to be very true, but in my
opinion refrigeration in Camb. ought to be done
by abating: for it is fitly rejected from the firſt
Method of curing, ſeeing there do many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
divers Symtomes, as hereafter we will ſhew,
for it doth not ſuffice only to prevent corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but chiefly many other accidents, as griefe,
retraction and roughneſſe of the skin, and inviron
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54589:8"/>
of the pores, which doe all require hot remedies.
But that theſe things bee well underſtood, let us
looke unto the properties of heat, the which <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
doth thus deſcribe, heate is biting in Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
hardneth the skin, cauſeth intollerable paine,
it ingendreth vehement feares, Convulſions, and
diſtentions. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that the ſubſtance
proper to draw together and thicken, is alwayes
proper to cold, which is knowne to be in oyle, fat,
and other things which by their coldneſſe doe
thicken and harden; in which it is ſhewn, that cold
things are plainly adverſaries to Combuſtions, and
do cauſe divers and naughty accidents, for the skin
being contracted and hardned by the fire, by the
much uſe of cold Medicines is hardned, and paine
is increaſed; hereby humours do gather together
which are not onely retained under the hard skin,
but by the uſe of cold Medicines is forced down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and there they doe more heat, hereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
inflammation, impoſtimation, and divers
times Gangrene, for the humour included, becauſe
it wanteth breathing, it preſently putrifieth, as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
witneſſeth; or becauſe the heat which chanced
whilſt it is included in the affected part, hath dryed
up the radicall moiſture, in which the naturall
heat conſiſteth, as we have ſhewed in our Tract of
<hi>Gangrena;</hi> For this cauſe <hi>Hipocrates</hi> admoniſheth
that it is not good to turn <hi>Eriſipilas</hi> from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts unto the inward, and there oftentimes
doth follow (if great burnings be dreſſed with cold
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54589:9"/>
Medicines) Herpes or knawing wilde-fire for
the Humour being included under the Skinne
doth breed a certaine ſharpeneſſe and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<hi>Anno</hi> 1594. there came unto mee a
certaine young man from <hi>Colin</hi> whom Hirpes or
wild fire had invaded his whole legge from the
foot unto the thigh, by reaſon of a ſimple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion:
By what method, and with what Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
wee cured the ſame the Reader may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by my obſervations Chirurgicall.</p>
            <p>Therefore when I did conſider, that as coales
when they are carefully covered under the aſhes
doe retaine their heat a long time; ſo corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which in Combuſtions doe flow to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
place, are by the uſe of cold medicines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
I have therefore more rather choſen to my
ſelfe another Method, which hitherto I have uſed
with great benefit to the Patient; For even as
coals doe quickly ſquench if they are ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
ſo hot Medicines doe quickly coole (yet
by evacution) by diſcuſſing and extracting corrupt
humours, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth.</p>
            <p>For as heat (as <hi>Hipocrates</hi> witneſſeth) foftneth
the skin, extenuateth, eaſeth paine, mittigateth
Convulſions, and bringeth Vlcers to ſupperation:
So ſuch kind of Medicines are applyed to thoſe
parts which are moleſted with blood, (but they
muſt be thoſe which doe moderately heat) to make
thin the humours, and to dilate the paſſages and
pores: The ſame <hi>Galen</hi> alſo writeth, for cold</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54589:9"/>
But that there might be a right and Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
curation of Combuſtions inſtituted, all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and accidents of burnings are to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined and looked unto, ſo that remedies
may be changed and applyed and according to
their natures; but firſt of all, becauſe paine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
by reaſon of the ſolution of continuity
and ſudden mutation which violently draweth
humours and blood from the body. It is neceſſary
to uſe repellent Medicines, to wit, defenſives, and
clouts wet in Vinegar and water leſt ſuch like hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and blood do follow to the offended place:
Then let there be uſed and obſerved, dyet, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
blood-letting, cupping, and other revulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the humours and blood may be drawne
and evacuated to the other part, as appertaining to
Topicks; in the firſt ſpecies of Combuſtions, if
puſtels be not riſen, let the corrupt and ſharpe
humours be drawn forth with an Ointment made
of Onions and the like, but if the skin be drawne
together and hardned, wee ought to uſe all dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that it be ſoftned and made red, which
ought to be done with Medicines which are hot
and moiſt, as the Chapters following we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
at length.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. The Curations of the firſt degree of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions.</head>
            <p>THe firſt and chiefe worke which is required
in Combuſtions, is, that the Chirugion doe
prevent the riſing of puſtels; for if he can do that
the Patient need not feare any further moleſtion;
Therefore if any one be burnt with fire, water, hot
Oyle, or any ſuch like thing: If the Combuſtion
be light, preſently let the place be madified with
water or ſpettle, and then held to fire as long as
may be ſuffered, or let the burnt place be dipped
in hot water, or if that will not be conveniently
done, let a ſponge or clout be wrung out in hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and applyed to the place, for that outward heat
doth draw unto it <hi>Empyruma,</hi> that is, heat left by
the fire in the burned part, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
teacheth; for as a Scorpion being applyed
to the bite of a Scorpion doth draw to it his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
poyſon; ſo doth heat draw heat: hereby
Onions being mixed in a morter with a little Salt
and applyed to the burnt place, doth draw forth
the corrupt humours, and ſuffereth not the puſtels
to ariſe, it may be ſpread on little pleggets and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54589:10"/>
untill the whole burnt place bee covered.
Alſo this following Oyntment doth violently
draw forth corrupt humours, and will not ſuffer
the puſtels to ariſe.</p>

<hi>Anno</hi> 1604. as my beloved wife was boyling of
New Wine in a great skellet, and ſtirring it with

even unto the very height and thickneſſe, whereby
there preſently aroſe a vehement paine, not onely
in the hand, but alſo in the whole arme, the wine
being waſhed away with hot water, wee applyed
the Oyntment lately preſcribed (which as then
was moſt fitteſt unto my hand) I anointed the
whole arme with Oile of Roſes, and rowled about
Rowlers dipped in water and Vinegar, and did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes

of ſo great a Combuſtion there followed no ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

proceed according to the cure of Gangrena.</p>
            <p>But becauſe theſe kinds of Combuſtions, of the
which we have ſpoken, doe oftentimes grow to a
Gangrene, therefore they ought to be carefully

ought to be applyed, which may reſiſt corruption,
In Children divers times doe happen Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the hands and feet, in the which the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

In theſe, great diligence is to bee uſed, that that
which is ſo burnt may be quickly ſeparated, leſt
the corruption doe invade the ſound parts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the fleſh and the bone be ſo burnt, that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54589:17"/>
joynt may be ſaved, the bone in the ſame joynt is
to be ſeparated with a Raizor, not with cizors, as

every other day, for the Milke quickly turneth

we have preſcribed in other burnings, as Lye, brine
&amp;c. are not be applyed to burnes in the face, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifactive
Medicines are to be reſiſted as much as
poſſible may be, except great paine be preſent, for
they (by reaſon of their great coldneſſe) do thicken
the Humours and viſible ſpirits of the eyes; but if
the skin ſhall be hardned to the eyes, it may bee
ſoftned and made ſupple with the foreſaid Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

paine; In the meane time whilſt the skin is mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with the aforeſaid Ointments and Oyles, let
the Colery be dropped in, and the Cataplaſme be
applyed, as we have already ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Generally let the Patient uſe a ſparing dyet, let
him abſtaine from all hot things, ſalt things, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Pepper, Cloves, Garlicke, Onyons, Radiſhes,
and the like: And alſo from all things that are
hard of Digeſtion, alſo Wine and ſtrong Ale doth
much hurt, let his drinke be phtiſan, in the which
Coriander ſeeds prepared, and Anniſeeds have bin
boyled; If the Patient by reaſon of his age can
not abſtaine from Wine, let him drink white win
that is not very ſtrong; In his pottage let thoſe
herbes bee boyled which doe coole, and that doe
purge Choller, as are theſe, Sorrill, Borage, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory,
Chernill, the Roots of Parſely, Fennel
Mariory, Roſemary, and Eye-bright: Let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
take a little Syrup Cydonior, Symplex or old

and flow to the eyes, may be dryed and
drawne backwards, likewiſe the eyes are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
leſt they ſuſtaine a fluxe.</p>
            <p>There are three things to be obſerved in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of dyet, to wit, the quantity, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the uſe; For firſt all exceſſe, as well of
meat as of drinke is to be avoided; Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the flux of the Eyes is alwayes cauſed by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
of humours. The third thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
is, that the Patient never eate, except the
meat be firſt well concocted, that he have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
appetite thereto, and that he doe avoid multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of meats at one meale, which differ in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and in quality, let his bread be of the beſt
wheat well boyled and levened, let him abſtaine
from ſalt meat, and that which is dryed, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from Hogs Fleſh; the Fleſh of young
Bullocks, Capons, and of Birds that live in woods
is profitable for him; alſo boyle with his meate
and other pottages, Hiſope, Mariorum, Sage,
Roſemary, Eye-bright, the Roots of Parſley,
Pimpernill, and the like: But if the fluxe bee
cauſed of thin and ſharpe humours, then boyle
with his meate and pottage, and other warme
things Borage, Bugloſſe, Sorrill, Chernill, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendine,
Eyebright, Fennell, and Purſlow ſeedes,
with many other things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54589:25"/>
Other pottages are alſo very hurtfull, as thoſe
of Letrices, Purſlow, Colworts, as alſo of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Onions, Leekes, Garlike, Muſterd-ſeed, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes;
as alſo Pepper, Ginger, Cloves, peaſe,
and white meats inſtead of Butter, all which are
naught for Fluxes of the eyes.</p>
            <p>Strong wine and ſtrong Ale doe alſo hurt, let
him uſe Ale that is not very ſtrong, but well boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
or elſe Pthiſan drinke, wherein Agrimony,
Eye-bright and Pruens have beene boyled, then let
it be a little ſweetned with Sugar and ſpiced with
Cinamon; but if the Patient cannot abſtaine from
wine, by reaſon of Age or Imbecility of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
let him chooſe old white wine which is not
very ſtrong: Sleepe and reſt are very convenient
in Diſeaſes of the eyes, but watching and ſtudy is
very hurtfull, eſpecially preſently after meat, to
which may be added <hi>Venus</hi> Sports.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let the hurtfull humour which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the eyes, be digeſted, prepared and evacuated
and if the flux be cauſed by a hot and ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
let it bee digeſted with this following Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip:

            <p>THe chief cauſes of the deformity of ſcarres, after
the cure of Combuſtions, are firſt, that the skin,
fleſh, veynes, &amp;c. are drawne together and hardned
with the force of the fire; Secondly, becauſe that the
radicall moyſture (by whoſe benefit all Vlcers are
cicatriſed) is by the force of the fire dryed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
whereby it commeth to paſſe, that even as
dry and barren ground bringeth forth weeds, Cockel,
and all other imperfect things; but on the contrary
the fat and moiſt ground bringeth forth all things
perfect; ſo alſo by the defect of the naturall heat and
radicall moiſture, there commeth filthy ſcarres; alſo
the uſe of cold Medicines cauſeth naughty ſcarres, as
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth in theſe words, <hi>Cold things

            <p>E. Noteth henges; in the firſt Figure with the which
the ring is opened and ſhut; therefore the ring being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and the legge being placed in the Casket, ye ſhall
fit the ring about the knee, and defend it with pleagets
and linnen clothes, then haſpe it cloſe with thoſe haſpes
and holes which are noted with DDD. Furthermore,
it hath two Buckels noted thus FFFF. and two thongs
ſignified with GGGG. by whoſe benefit the legge is
bound into the Casket: therfore the skiew being turned
from the right hand towards the left, the ring and the
knee are drawed towards the Casket, and the legge may
be extended as much as the Chirurgion ſhall ſee fitting:
Furthermore, that the skrew may eaſily turne about in
the ring, it is neceſſary, that it have a knobe which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with H.</p>
            <p>1. Is an iron plate which is annexed to the Casket, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the Thumbe of the right hand, which by a Combuſtion
were drawne and conglutinated to the back of the hand,
which kind of cure, although we have already touched in

his ſon, which was of the age of 14. months, who at the
age of ſixe months, fell with his right hand into the burning
coales, whereby his fore-finger, middle-finger, ring-finger, and
little finger, were ſo burnt together with the back of the hand,
that the fingers fell downe even unto the firſt articulation; but
becauſe his Father did commit the Cure to unskilfull people, all
his fingers except his thumbe were compact together with the
skin of the backe of his hand, as it were in the forme of a Globe
as is ſeene by this following Figure:</p>

After ſeven months, when the cure was perfectly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
the parents of the fore-ſaid Child brought him
unto me, pittifully deſired my helpe, wherefore when I
had parged his body with Manna, being given him in his
broth, I did prepare Chirurgicall Medicines, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
Firſt I uſed this following Decoction and Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for certaine dayes together:
<list>
                  <item>℞ Radic. althaee cum toto Radic. Bryon. Lilior alb. ana. ℥ <hi>i.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
Let them be boyled in the broth of the head and feet of a
Weather for a fomentation, then anoint the whole hand
and arme with this following Oyntment:
<list>
                  <item>℞ Vngunt dialtheos ℥ <hi>i.</hi> Auxungue humane Gallinarum</item>

               </list>
Mix them and make an Oyntment, then rowle the hand
in a plaiſter of Mufilage, when the Nerves and the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity
of the wrinkled skin of the backe of the hand, and
of the fingers, were with theſe things ſufficiently mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;
I cut away that hard skin between the backe of
the hand and the fingers, with an inciſion knife; and I
alſo ſeparated the fingers, then I ſtrewed thereon my
powder, to ſtanch blood, and I appleed theron the whits
of Egges mixed with the waters of Roſes and Plantaine
and Oile of Roſes; alſo I layed a defenſive to the wriſt,
the next day I applyed this following digeſtive with ſoft
plegets upon the inciſions, as before with Oyles.</p>

            <p>The 5 day I uſed this following Inſtrument, and I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
by little and little to bring the fingers to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
order:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54589:31"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>A is a Splint of the breadth of three fingers, ſo long,
that it may reach almoſt from the wriſt to the elbow.</p>
            <p>B is a round ſticke of the thickneſſe of the thumbe,
which is fixed to the Splint, and in the middle of this
ſticke are foure wodden pins, noted with CCCC.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54589:32"/>
Alſo the ſplint hath two Buckels noted with DD. and
two thongs ſignified by EE. by whoſe benefit the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
is bound to the arme: Therefore when the
Inſtrument was well bound to, and every where well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
lſtered with linnen clothes, I had in readines finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls
made of Leather, which put upon the tops of the
Fingers, and with the ſtrings that hangeth to them. I
drawed the Fingers downwards, and bound them to the
pins noted with CCCC. and every day I tyed them
ſtraighter.</p>
            <p>Which that it might the eaſier be done, I anointed the
arme with the aforeſaid Oyntment, as often as I dreſſed
the wound, and leſt that the Fingers ſhould againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate,
I put between them leaden plates, and ſo by
little and little the Fingers were reduced to their proper
functions; In the meane time I conſolidated and cicatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the wounds, but not with thoſe things which doe
greatly dry, but thoſe which have alſo an emolent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with ſuch Medicines as we have ſhewed, and ſo by
Gods helpe we reſtored the hand to his proper uſe.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Lightning, and how thoſe which are ſtricken
with it, are to be ſuccoured.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe that of all Fires, the Fire from Heaven is
moſt vehement and dangerous, and containeth in it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54589:32"/>
certaine ſupernaturall faculties, with which a man may
ſoone be deſtroyed; therfore I will make no long ſtay
to what ſhould be done therein: For this cauſe I have
thought good (for the benefit of the Reader) briefly to
ſhew how thoſe who are ſtricken with Lightning are to
be handled and I doe admoniſh all Chyrurgions, that if
they poſſible may, they take a Phyſitian with them to
ſuch kinde of Patients.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing this heavenly Fire (as experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
containeth in it certaine ſupernaturall qualities, we
may alſo perceive it to have an adjunct quality and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
very hurtfull and venomous, which is eaſily percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by that horrible ſtincke and peſtiferous odour which
commeth as well from men as from other creatures that
are ſtricken with Lightning: Hence it is, (as divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men doe teſtifie) that Beares, Foxes, Conies, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures uſing ſuch places, which are ſtricken with
Lightning, by reaſon of the filthy ſmell they cannot ſtay
in their dens; and dogges alſo will not eate of the Fleſh
that hath been ſtricken with Lightning.</p>
            <p>By theſe things we may perceive how dangerous it is
to uſe hearbs which grow in ſuch places: and the Earth
(as <hi>Oulaus</hi> witneſſeth) is perceived as it were to beſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Brimſtone, wherefore it is no marvell, that men
do without any manifeſt cauſe fall downe dead.</p>
            <p>Now this Fire, as <hi>Seneca</hi> witneſſeth, is ſubtill; hence
it commeth, that inanimate creatures, as Trees, and the
like, are alſo hurt; Alſo beſides that ſubtilty it hath in
it a moſt dry ſubſtance, and earthy; hereby it commeth
to paſſe, that it penitrateth and hurteth the ſoft parts of
the body, but thoſe which are more hard it breaketh,
which I have obſerved not onely to chance to animate
creatures, but alſo to thoſe which, are inanimate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54589:33"/>
If there be any puſtels, wounds, or ſpots, then apply onions
mixed with ſalt, or the leaves of rue powned with Treacle, and
alſo apply Cupping-glaſſes and Leaches, the Bladders being firſt
cut; thoſe things which doe cauſe putrifaction and the falling of
the ſcar, in this cauſe are not to be uſed; therefore cut off the
Eſcarre with a paire of cizors, and then apply this following
mundifying Oyntment:
<list>
                  <item>℞ Mellis Roſacei ℥ ij. Futuerisradic. vincet &amp; Angeli. ana,</item>

               </list>
Make thereof a Mundicative, when the Ulcers are mundified
then ſtrew on this following powder:
<list>

               </list>
Make them all into a ſmall powder, with the which with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity of the juice of Sanicle or of peares, make thereof
Trochicqus and dry them in the ſhade, then make it into powder</p>
            <p>If any bones be broken, they are to be reduced, but the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ought to have a great care that he apply not ſuch aftringent
and cooling plaiſters, as he uſeth to do in other fractures. for they
doe hinder the expiration of the venome; wherefore apply this
following Cataplaſme:
<list>
                  <item>℞ Farinae Fabar. Lupinor, ana. ℥ i. <abbr>ss</abbr>. Pul. radic. vincitexici &amp;</item>

               </list>
Boyle them with <hi>Oximel.</hi> unto the forme of a powltiee, then mix
therwith or Triacle or Mithridate z i. and let fracture be once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day new bound up, and let the powltice be renewed, but
firſt waſh the member with wine in the which the roots of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica
hath been boyled, and a little Triacle diſſolved in vinegar
of Roſes, which ought to be done preſently whilſt the feare of
the venome is preſent; alſo apply a Defenſive about the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the palme of the hand, about the fracture, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the venome may be turned from the noble parts:</p>
            <p>Ye ought alſo to looke, that the belly be kept ſoluble, which if
it be not ſo by narure, then uſe Suppoſitories and Cliſters, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
from purging and blood letting, except there be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
occaſion to the contrary, in the which take the counſell
of a Phyſitian.</p>
