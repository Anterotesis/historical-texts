            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Bodily leprosie is from the corrupt and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned humors in the body: Spirituall is from the corruption and poyson of the soule.

This disease being so loathsome, so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the Lord chargeth all Israel, with speciall care, both to discerne it, to preuent it, and (if it were possible) to cure it. They must discerne it by sundry marks, both for the certaintie and curablenesse. First, for the certaintie; Wee neede not halfe so much caution or curiositie to be perswaded of our spirituall leprosie, which is too too apparent: Onely those many ceremonies put vs in minde how much more requisite our diligence ought to bee in finding out and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our speciall sinnes.</p>
            <p>The speciall markes which we read of, to shew whether the bodily leprosie be <hi>curable</hi> or no, are these: First; If, rubbing the place of <note place="margin">Rules of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition:</note> the leprosie, it grow not red, it is held incurable. <note place="margin">1.</note> So if sinners, being rubbed and admonished, blush not, nor be ashamed of their sinne, there is little hope of their amendment. Secondly; If <note place="margin">2.</note> pricking the place with an Instrument, there come out still a corrupt moysture, there is little hope of cure: So if after the preaching of the law, and pricking the conscience of the sinner, the corrupt issues of sinne still preuaile, there is lesse hope of the sound cure of such a sinner. Thirdly; If after pricking with a needle there <note place="margin">3.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:18743:4"/>
come foorth bloud, it is a signe it is curable: So if sinners, pricked with the needle of the law, cry out of the paine of their sinnes, and see the need of the bloud of Christ, and lay hold of it for saluation, their spirituall leprosie is in the way of full cure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when it is discerned, the Lord <note place="margin">Rules of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</note> takes order to preuent it from others: first, They must vncouer their heads, that men might not mistake them, and in token also that God had thus humbled them: for that ceremony was a signe of humilitie. Secondly; They must couer their lippes, that by their breath they might not infect others. Thirdly; They must haue a rod put into their hands, that men might auoide them, as children doe the rod. Fourthly; They must proclaime themselues <hi>vncleane,</hi> and giue warning to others. Fiftly; They must bee shut vp many daies, and excluded the host vtterly if they be vncurable, as King <hi>Ozias, 2. King. 15.</hi> A notable type of the suspension and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of impenitent and desperate sinners, shutting them out of the Congregation of God, lest they infect and poyson others with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of their sinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, after discerning they must speedily <note place="margin">Rules of cure.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:18743:4"/>
attempt the cure, wherein the Lord enioyneth them, first, To goe to the Priest, signifying, that Iesus Christ the High Priest of our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is the onely Phisician of this leprosie of sin. Secondly; They must rent their garments; a signe of great sorrow for sinne, and of casting off their owne raggs, that they may bee couered with <hi>a wedding garment,</hi> euen the garment of saluation. Thirdly; There must bee a vessell of water, which must be sprinkled on the party, and of oyle with which he must be suppled. This vessell is the heart, the water signifieth the bloud of Christ, the lauer of the Church, the sprinkling of this water noteth the washing of the conscience from dead works: and the oyle signifieth the glad tidings of the Gospell: all which the Lord vseth in this great cure. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; There is required the shauing of all the haire of the Leprous, that no infection any way cleaue to him: which noteth the purging away, and daily paring of lusts and superfluities, by the grace of sanctification, which are to the soule, as excrements are to the body. And this is the law of the Leprosie. This one <hi>Psalme</hi> presenteth in one view the whole truth of this excellent type, wherein holy <hi>DAVID</hi> cleerely
<pb facs="tcp:18743:5"/>
discouereth the foule leprosie of his soule, which is so odious in his eyes, as hee pronounceth him the onely happie man that hath got a couer and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. 2.</note> cure. Loth he was for shame, according to the <note place="margin">3.</note> law, to proclaime himselfe vncleane, he would hide his vncleannesse, and hold his tongue as <note place="margin">4.</note> long as hee could; but all this while there was no hope of cure: for being let alone, it ate vp his marrow, consumed his bones, and dryed and drunke vp his moysture as in the drought of <note place="margin">5.</note> Summer. Now when there was no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, he goes to the high Priest, confesseth his vncleannesse against himselfe, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered him as that leper, <hi>Mar. 1. 42. I will, be thou cleane.</hi> And as that leper could not hide his ioy, but no sooner was he gone then he began to publish the matter: so this leper no sooner was cured, but hee calleth euery one, to <note place="margin">6.</note> teach them in the like estate how they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the like remedie. And then according to <note place="margin">7.</note> the precept of Christ to the leper, he offereth the gift which <hi>MOSES</hi> commanded, euen the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">8. 9.</note> of prayer and praise: and exciteth others <note place="margin">10. 11.</note> by sundry arguments to doe the same.</p>
            <p>These Meditations I haue presumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to your <hi>Lordship:</hi> first, For the seruice
<pb facs="tcp:18743:5"/>
I owe vnto Your <hi>Lordship,</hi> as one who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to fauour as a soules Physician, whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to preuent or stop vp the loth some issue of this disease, which hath ouer-spred euery mans nature, so as no man can say, <hi>My heart is cleane:</hi> neither are great Men freer from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of the soule then of the body.

Thirdly; To put Your <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>Honour</hi> in minde, that as the world hath made you almost as happy as it can, raysing you, first, out of an ancient, Noble, and religious Stocke: secondly, vnto a goodly Inheritance: thirdly, into the grace &amp; fauor of your Prince: fourthly, vnto the most Honourable place and seruice, with such late accesse of Honours, as few of Your Noble Ranke are afore You: So
<pb facs="tcp:18743:6"/>
Your <hi>Lordships</hi> care be to annexe that Honor which is from aboue, from which there can be no fall: whereas daily experience sheweth how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable the world sometimes leaueth her greatest fauorites. Fourthly; To prouoke and pray your <hi>Honour,</hi> that imitating the gracious footsteps of your Noble Father, and following your owne religious beginnings, you proceed with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart to cleaue to the truth of God, and with heartie and earnest affection continue to embrace the true Church of Christ, which the Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> oppugneth and oppresseth, yea, and with vnweariable endeuours to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in the practice of that holy faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you haue professed and loued, which is the one and onely faith learned of God and his holy Scriptures; the onely Catholike and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith; the onely ancient, because the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Propheticall and Apostolicall faith; the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Christian faith, which the <hi>Truth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath taught, and ratified by his precious bloud, euen the bloud of the Couenant; the faith not onely preached and written by the ancient Fathers, but professed and practised by all the faithfull in all ages. As for that Popish faith, falsly called Catholike, wee are sufficiently able
<pb facs="tcp:18743:6"/>
(through God) to prooue it a new Samaritanisme, patched vp of Iudaisme and Gentilisme, thrust vpon the blind side &amp; part of the world, vnder the title of Christianisme. And yet in these our so perillous and last times, what great numbers and persons are daily carryed away from the faith of Christ, into that Apostacie and Idolatry of that great Antichrist? I wish other parts of the Land could not bring in euidence to this bill of complaint as well as ours.</p>
            <p>Thus humbly crauing pardon for my boldnesse, I beseech God to strengthen your <hi>Lordships</hi> heart and hands to withstand by all your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, this Gangrene, and long to continue you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His Maiestie by your faithfull Counsell a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment to the decayed estate of our Church, an ornament of the Common-wealth, a prop of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a pillar of Iustice, a father of Wards and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes, and a comforter of comfortlesse Widdowes, the Noble Leiftenant of our Country, and high Steward of our Corporation. And the same God preserue you vnblamable in your spirit, soule, and body, vntill the day of his appearing.</p>

Many of his enterprizes against vs I will conceale, and, as one iealous ouer you with an holy iealousie, I thought fit to note vnto you an ancient stratageme of his, plotted against you, to draw you (if it were possible) from the simplicitie and sinceritie of the Gospell receiued: which you must so much the more vigilantly watch against, as hee confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hopeth to cause you to fall by it. Satan sees the curiositie, sicklenesse, and inconstancie of mans nature, that it is not content with ancient necessarie truthes, and that good things please vs not long, but new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and doctrines like vs wel: and therefore he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in all Churches to mingle and blend with Gods receiued Truth, humane conceits and nouel opinions;
<pb facs="tcp:18743:7"/>
by which practice hee soone brought the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> to reuolt to <hi>another Gospell.</hi> Or if Satan cannot <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6.</note> doe the great mischiefe which hee would, quite to cast the faith of Beleeuers from off the foundation, he will doe the lesse which he can, he wil surely disturbe them, and trouble their mindes with impertinent and vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to call them from more necessary and pertinent truths; and hinder their edification whilest he holdeth them in a kind of suspence and doubt of maine points, which should haue bin long since as fast fixed in their hearts, as <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Iacim,</hi> the two Pillars set vp in the porch of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple.</p>
            <p>I will, passing by all other conceits wherewith you haue beene encombred, fasten at this time vpon that straggling deuice of Vniuersall Election and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reach vnto you such helpe as my selfe haue beene led out of this Labyrinth withall; that you may also bee able to put foolish men to silence. I may not suffer my Epistle to grow into a Volume or Treatise, and therefore, referring you to other learned Treatises for the Doctrine, I wil stand here as your Defendant, to answere such maine, or rather vaine, obiections as you haue or may be troubled withall.</p>
            <p>Those who would haue vs beleeue, that euery sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular man is elected and redeemed, lay this sandie for a sound ground. <hi>Obiect.</hi> First, Euery man is bound to beleeue hee is elected, and therefore he is elected. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man is bound to beleeue hee is redeemed, and therefore he is redeemed. Euery man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Christ dyed for him, and therefore CHRIST dyed for euery singular man. <hi>Answ.</hi> Master <hi>Perkins</hi> in his book of Predestination answering to this sophisme,
<pb facs="tcp:18743:8"/>
findeth iust fault with the manner of reasoning, which is wholly vicious, neyther can it be concluded in any true forme of Syllogisme. And it may bee easie in this kind of sophisme to conclude any thing, be it neuer so absurd. As for example: That which God commands a man to doe (as well as beleeue) is true: But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands euery man to keep the whole Law: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that euery man keepes the whole Law, is true. Euery man is bound to beleeue his owne saluation: Therefore it is true euery man shall be saued. Let them loose these knots by one and the same answere. For they are parallel. But, leauing the manner of the reason, we wil a little examin the matter in both the parts of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> (say they) <hi>which God commands a man to beleeue,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>is true, or else God commands a man to beleeue a Lye, and condemnes a man for not beleeuing a Lye. Answ.</hi> Fie vpon such Pamphlets vnworthy Christian eyes or eares, which blindly and blasphemously cry out vpon God as a Lyar, a Teacher of Lyes, a Deluder and Tenderer of Lyes and Falsehood, if they cannot obtaine Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes strange to Diuinitie, and turne the truth of God into a Lye. But in a word, their Proposition is euer true in respect of Gods intent of binding them, but not of the euent of their beleeuing. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Why doth God command men to beleeue this or that, and not intend that they should doe so in the euent? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no absurditie neyther in Commandements of faith nor of obedience, to command that in precept, which in the euent hee intendeth not.

Secondly; The same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of beleeuing to diuers persons is true, but in a diuers maner, and so diuersly bindeth: It bindeth the Elect to beleeue, that by beleeuing hee might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne saluation: It biddeth the Wicked also beleeue, but, to the end, that by not beleeuing, hee should bee made inexcusable. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But in this latter sort doth not the Commaundement of God plainely fight with his decree, when he commandeth that which he would not haue done? <hi>Answ.</hi> Gods reuealed Will is neuer contrarie to his Decree or good pleasure, but often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, both in the manner of propounding, and in the meanes of proceeding, and in the euents, as appeareth in the retrait of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> sentence, <hi>Thou shalt dye and not liue:</hi> For promises are vnderstood with condition of faith, and threats with exception of repentance.

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But is not this to delude men, to command them to beleeue who cannot beleeue? And would not a man thinke him a mocker, that should say to a stone, <hi>Beleeue,</hi> which he knowes cannot? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, that the world cannot beleeue, is voluntary, and imbred in vs, God is no cause of it, and therefore deserues no excuse. 2. God hath most glorious ends of propounding the obiect of faith, that is, Christ and his merits generally to all, and not to delude men: as first, to manifest the riches of his grace, who <hi>would haue none to perish, but rather come to the knowledge of his truth.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to glorifie his truth, setting it in the light, as the Sunne in the heauens to be seene of all eyes. Thirdly, to rebuke the wickednes of the world, and conuince it of sin, by setting vp a publike ministerie, by which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers might be made inexcusable, and iustly perish by their owne fault, who will not receiue saluation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. So much of the former Proposition. Now to the second, or assumption.</p>
            <q>But euery one is bound to beleeue his owne election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <note place="margin">2. Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </q>
            <p>This Proposition is to bee vnderstood with two cautions: 1. A man is bound to beleeue his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and saluation, not primarily, but secondarily: namely, he must first become a beleeuer, a member of Iesus Christ, and a penitent sinner, and then beleeue his election and saluation. For he must beleeue it as a true Proposition, and not as a thing vtterly false. 2. He
<pb facs="tcp:18743:9"/>
is bound to beleeue his own Redemption, vnlesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe put a barre or hinderance in his owne way, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wicked man doth. The reason of this is, because hee must onely beleeue his owne saluation to whom God hath promised it: for what is it to beleeue, but to lay hold vpon the promise? But what hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to any wicked man so persisting? All the threats and curses of the Law are his portion. Againe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of eternall life is made first to Christ, and then by consequent to all that beleeue in him, &amp; are members of his body, and to no other. And surely, I take this to be a great feeder of this error, because men consider not the difference betweene the Commandement and Promise of God, the former being more generall then this latter; for the Commandement is to all, beleeuers and vnbeleeuers; but the Promise is only to beleeuers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Promise is generall, and Christ is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and preached a common Sauiour to all men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Promise is generall in propounding it, as is meet, first, because the elect are mingled with the wicked: and secondly, because hereby the wicked shall be made inexcusable, seeing they cannot plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or want of meanes. But one thing is vniuersall in respect of the meanes, another in respect of efficacie: for the promise of the Gospell is not effectuall to all persons, but to all sorts of persons. Secondly; One thing it is to bee promiscuously expounded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to all; another to bee certainly receiued and perceiued of seuerall beleeuers.</p>
            <p>So much of the first obiection, from the necessitie of beleeuing euery mans particular redemption.</p>
            <p>The second obiection is taken from the vniuersali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:18743:10"/>
of Gods election, thus framed: Whosoeuer are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by God, are redeemed by Christ: But all, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular man is elected: And therefore euery particular man is redeemed. The proposition, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the reason being true, wee put them to the proofe of the assumption, namely, that euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man is elected; Which they thus attempt. Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God loueth, him he hath elected: But God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all, and euery particular man; For a speciall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Answ.</hi> God loueth all men, but not alike: for wee must distinguish of Gods loue vnto man, which is twofold: 1. Vniuersall or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, by which he loues men as his creatures. 2. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and particular, whereby hee loues them as new creatures. By this speciall kinde of loue he loues onely his elect, and no wicked men, who yet as his creatures are loued of him, but not in such effects of loue as the elect are.</p>
            <p>The third obiection is taken from the generalitie of the death of Christ: Christ (say they) died for all men; and therefore all men are redeemed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ dyed for all men; that is, all kinds and degrees of men, but not for euery seuerall and indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall person: for then could there bee no place left ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for election or reprobation, seeing, where all are taken, none are either chosen or left. 2. The reason of the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> was, because he must saue <hi>his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> from their sinnes. And the Euangelist saith, he shed his bloud (not for all, but) <hi>for many</hi> for the remission of sinne, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. Yea, himselfe affirmeth, <hi>He gaue his life onely for his sheepe, Ioh.</hi> 10. and that hee prayeth not for <hi>the world;</hi> that is, the wicked of the world, and
<pb facs="tcp:18743:10"/>
much lesse dyeth for them: To which purpose well <note place="margin">

Thou hast beene slaine, and redeemed <hi>vs</hi> vnto God by thy bloud <hi>out of euery Tribe, Language, People, and Nation:</hi> She saith not, Thou hast redeemed euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man in euery Nation, but out of euery Nation, and Language some. 4. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> himselfe prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the instinct of the Spirit (as another <hi>Balaam)</hi> said, that Christ must dye, to gather into one (not all the sons of men, but) <hi>all the sonnes of God</hi> dispersed. But the wicked are not <hi>the sonnes of God;</hi> and therefore Christ was not to dye for them.</p>
            <p>The fourth obiection is taken from the validitie of the merit of Christ: If Christ (say they) payd a price of infinite value, sufficient for the sinnes of the whole world, and euery singular man, then he hath redeemed the whole world, and euery singular man. But he hath paid such a price: therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The price which Christ payd, was for the efficacie infinite, as being the bloud of a Person that was God: but this efficacie is twofold: 1. <hi>Potentiall,</hi> by which it was in it selfe sufficient for euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar person in the world, or in a thousand worlds, if we suppose so many. 2. <hi>Actuall,</hi> and this is only where it is applied. In which latter respect it was decreed by God, and purposed by Christ, to be paid onely for the elect, and such as are predestinate to eternall life: for he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed not to be a satisfaction to any, to whom he is not sanctification, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. but no wicked man is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. Neither did hee purpose to die for any, for whom hee purposed not to rise againe, or, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb facs="tcp:18743:11"/>
he sustained not both in his death &amp; resurrection, and to whom the vertue of both is not applied, and at one time or other apparent in their death to sin, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to newnesse of life. In a word, If Christ purposed effectually to die for wicked men, then he failed of his purpose, both in the matter of his Redemption, as also in the effect of it. <hi>The former,</hi> because wheras the whole Redemption of Christ, wrought by his death, standeth of two parts: 1. A freedome from sin, in respect of the power of condemning, and 2. In respect of the power of raigning; he failed of both the essentiall parts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in such as they say he redeemed. A strange redemption (I trow) must that be, where is no freedom from sin, neither in the guilt nor in the raigne of it. <hi>The latter,</hi> in that parties who (they say) are redeemed, must yet be condemned for those sinnes from vnder which Christ is risen, &amp; so was actually absolued from them: then which an higher indignity cannot bee ascribed to the Sonne of God, or the merite of <hi>his</hi> suffering, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p>The fifth obiection is taken from the vniuersality of Christs calling; he calleth all vnto him, and therfore he died for all. <hi>Answ.</hi> The antecedent is false: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue liued, who neuer heard of the Name of Christ, as the Gentiles before Christ, &amp; now many barbarous parts of the world want the very mention of him, as our Trauellers haue found. But to the consequent, that also is as false: for howsoeuer Christ call all vnto him within the bosome of the Church, yet not al in the like manner. For calling is twofold, either <hi>common</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the meanes, or <hi>speciall,</hi> in respect of effectuall working: By the former all are promiscuously called;
<pb facs="tcp:18743:11"/>
by the latter only the godly. Secondly, consider Christ himselfe in calling two waies: 1. As he is one Cod with the Father, and holy Ghost, and thus he calleth good and bad. 2. As the head of his Church and Mediator, and thus he effectually calleth the elect onely, who are members of his body, &amp; embraced in a singular loue.</p>
            <p>The sixt obiection is taken from the generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in the nature of Christ, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ tooke euery mans flesh, and therefore euery man hath part in that worke of Redemption in that flesh performed. <hi>Answ.</hi> In the great worke of mans Redemption, two things must be considered: first, the Instrument, and <note place="margin">A commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae ad <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
               </note> that is the flesh of Christ: secondly, the principall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which is the Spirit and power which herein puts forth itselfe. If we looke vpon the former in it selfe, our Sauiour himselfe saith, <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing</hi> further then it is ioyned with the Spirit &amp; life of Christ, which wicked men want, and therefore notwithstanding the former, can haue no part in this Redemption.</p>
            <p>The seuenth obiection is taken from the latitude or extent of the grace in <hi>the second Adam,</hi> which (say they) must not bee short or inferior to the guilt in <hi>the first Adam:</hi> But all, and euery particular man is made a sinner in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore all, and euery particular man is made righteous (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently redeemed) in the second. <hi>Answ.</hi> The grace brought in by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is to bee considered two waies: first, in the weight of it; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the number <hi>of such</hi> as partake in it. In respect of the weight and excellencie of it selfe, it is not lesse to the sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> for there is far more power requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the putting away of many sins, yea, innumerable
<pb facs="tcp:18743:12"/>
sins, of all the elect by iustification, then to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate one sin vnto all by natural pollution. Whence the Apostle notably preferreth Christs power aboue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, Rom.</hi> 5. 16. who not onely abolished one sinne brought in by him, but infinite more <hi>But not as the sin so was the gift.</hi> And the reason is, because that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Adami</hi> came in by nature <hi>in singulos,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Christi</hi> comes not but by speciall grace. But now in respect of the number redeemed, the benefit of Christ is lesse, and so the gift is not so large as <hi>Adams</hi> fall: for then all should be vessels of mercy, which is most false. Against which if that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. be obiected; <hi>As the offence of one came vpon all to condemnation, so the benefit aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all to the iustification of life:</hi> The answere is easie; for the Apostle in the very next verse shewes who hee meanes by <hi>all,</hi> namely, <hi>many:</hi> So by the obedience of one shall <hi>many</hi> be made righteous. 2. That word <hi>all</hi> is not absolutely to be taken, neither is by the Apostle, but with reference vnto the limitation of the 17. verse immediately going before; namely, to all them <hi>which receiue the abundance of grace, and the gift of righteousnes,</hi> which words are an elegant Periphrasis of beleeuers, who alone <hi>raigne in life through One, who is Iesus Christ.</hi> 3. Whereas <hi>all</hi> is opposed to <hi>all,</hi> as by the first all, is meant all <hi>Adams</hi> seede by nature; so by the second all must be meant all Christs seede by grace, that is, onely the Elect: and thus the opposition is truely and aptly reconciled.</p>
            <p>And thus farre haue I waded for your sakes in this deepe and graue question, whom as in all other truths I wish firmely stablished against the foolish whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of vaine, conceited, and vnsettled persons; who
<pb facs="tcp:18743:12"/>
when they haue run thorow all their schismaticall, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therane, and Libertine opinions, shall goe neere (with many of their Leaders) to end in plaine Atheisme. To these I onely wish at this time, humilitie and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>The former</hi> would not permit them then onely to thinke themselues somewhat, when they can cut out to their Teachers their taske, (as their worke to their Apprentises) and define to them what doctrines are fit for them to teach, and which (because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues cannot taste them) are vnfit for them to meddle in. <hi>The latter</hi> would fashion them to the practice of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie according to wholsome doctrine, and not suffer them to lose themselues in fond conceits farre aboue their owne apprehensions.</p>
            <p>As for you who haue giuen your selues to God, and vs your Ministers, bee encouraged in your godly course, as such who haue your hopes in your eye: feare not the reproch of men, or rather of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>but stand fast and vnmoueable in the worke of the Lord, as knowing your labour shall not be in vaine. Walke wisely, redeeming the time;</hi> you haue many eyes watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for your falls, especially the eye of God, and your owne conscience obseruing you. Account it your true honour, to honour God and your honourable Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by keeping the Doctrine receiued, euen the Truth of Christ as it is in Christ, and shewing your selues copies and patternes, yea the very models of it by your good conuersation in Christ. Practise that great and new Commaundement, the badge of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by louing one another, retaining those strong sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Christian societie, Meekenesse and Mercy. Consider the confusion comming vpon an house diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:18743:13"/>
against it selfe, and how strong the consent of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is in things both of God and of men. Be much and often in thankfulnesse to God for the libertie and peace of the Gospell, and that you liue in the daies of such meanes and protection of them Reiect not wheat for some tares. Pray to God (which is all you haue to doe) in things which might be better, and praise him that they bee no worse. Thinke the Churches peace next precious to the peace of your owne consciences. And onely magnifie Truth aboue Peace, because God hath magnified it <hi>aboue all things.</hi> Frequent the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie as Gods arme stretched out for your saluation: Affect the Word, not for persons, but for truth; not for knowledge, but for conscience; not for speech, but for practice: so as your holy obedience comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, you may set a Crowne vpon the heads of your Teachers, who watch ouer you, as they that must giue account. Beware of this euill world, let the holy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse after the best things eate out the hungry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of it. Account godlinesse the onely gaine; the best wealth, to be rich in God; and the best reuenue, to be abundant in good works. As for the euils of the times, O complaine of them to God, as yee be sure the world be not the worse for you, but the better, as they that are going to a better world: In which journey I wish you all good speed, cheerefulnesse and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and in the end of it, the hoped and happy rest of Gods people, purchased by the bloud of the Lambe: in whom I euer rest,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nscriptions are as keyes to open a doore into the Psalmes. This Title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Psalme. For it is the chiefe wisdome and learning of the Church, to know how to come to be happy, as this Psalme teacheth, which in the inscription is commended: First, From the matter. Secondly, The Author. First, The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18743:16"/>
matter, that it was <hi>Dauids</hi> learning, and penned to teach the vnlearned: for it is not the will of God, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned should want knowledge. Yea such a learning as is not euery-where to be had, but onely is to be drawne out of the Word of God. For nature and humane reason teacheth it not, nor can vnderstand it, no nor can endure to heare, that God should not respect any worthinesse or merit of man, but freely forgiue sinne to make a soule truely happy. Secondly, The Author was <hi>Dauid,</hi> here named, that we might know, that this chiefe doctrine of all other was not framed or deliuered to the Church from an obscure and vnknowne Author, but proceeded from the holy Ghost, who guided the Pen-men of Scripture: and by this Pen-man commended also to the vse of the Church, that so our faith might be more certaine: for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can the heart bee stable in any doctrine, which it is not perswaded to bee an Oracle of God. Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.</p>
            <p>First, That as all the Scripture is profitable for doctrine, instruction, and comfort, so more especially the booke of <note place="margin">Obserue.</note> Psalmes, being inspired by God to this purpose, and <note place="margin">All vse of Psalmes must edific.</note> therefore must all of them in publike or priuate vse tend to our edification. First, In the publike vse of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. I will sing with the Spirit, but with vnderstanding also, and 26. When yee come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as any hath a Psalme, let all bee done to edifying. Secondly, In priuate; either in the family, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. speaking and admonishing your selues with Psalmes, &amp;c. or apart alone. <hi>I am.</hi> 5. 13. Is any merry? let him sing: prosperitie must not force vs to forget God, but remember his louing kindnesse. Hence haue we the examples of the Disciples of our Lord, singing a Psalme after the receiuing of the Sacrament together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 26. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in prison sung to God, <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. 25.</p>
            <p>To confute such as set out filthy, amorous, and lewd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18743:16"/>
Ballads and Songs, Fictions, Loue-bookes, &amp;c. which tend to the corrupting of men and youth especially. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> songs tended to instruction in the highest point of heauenly wisedome, and the vse of these would bring the other out of request: and it should teach Parents, that would not haue their Childrens bodies poysoned, to be much more carefull their mindes bee not herewith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their sinne is iustly condemned, who either in publike or more priuate meetings sit like cyphers or mutes, when Psalmes are sung; who neither sing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues nor attend to those that doe, nor haue any care to helpe their vnderstanding or their affections, but are as senselesse as the seats they sit vpon: these highly take the name of God in vaine; or else they runne out at the Psalme, as not concerning them: hath the Lord fitted the Psalmes forthy instruction, and darest thou despise that high learning offred in them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those who in singing onely respect the storie of the Psalme, as they doe other Scriptures, not instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, comforting, or admonishing themselues by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter to their hearts, but sing without all grace in their hearts: and lastly, those that respect in these songs musick more then matter, that are led away by sound, not by sense; by the eare, not by the heart; that are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with vanitie, not with the Spirit, and sing to man, not to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly note, that <hi>Dauid,</hi> though furnished with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of learning, accounteth none learning but this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obseru.</hi> 2.</note> indeed a speciall knowledge to be instructed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct <note place="margin">No learning to <hi>Dauids</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> others in. He calleth all conditions of men to learne this doctrine, which so neerely concerneth all, and is of such speciall vse, as without it, euery thing increaseth a mans miserie, and hauing it, he is onely happy. Hence is this knowledge called <hi>wisdomes,</hi> or <hi>knowledges, Prou.</hi> 9. 1. as though it contayned all comfortable knowledge in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18743:17"/>
And indeed if we measure knowledge by the vse, that must needs be the best that makes vs best, and brings in best profit; but that doth this learning: for how vaine are the deepest Philosophers in all their knowledge? What are they but lyars, while without this they dispute of truth? Vicious persons, while they entreat of vertue? Ignorant, while they dispute of knowledge? and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures, while without it they grope at true bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse?</p>
            <p>What were a man better, if he were able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the frame of the World, measure the parts of the Earth, to discourse of the course and motions of the Starres, if the sense of vnpardoned sinne proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a damned wretch, and a guiltie conscience tell him to his face, that Heauen is ashamed of him, the Earth is weary of him, and his owne sinnefull burthen beares him downe to Hell?</p>
            <p>What profit were it to be able to discerne all diseases, and all remedies, and attayne all the skill of physicke to cure the body, when a mans owne soule is wounded to death without remedie?</p>
            <p>What helpeth it to bee wise in worldly matters, and skilfull in cases of Law, to auoid vniust sentences and wrongs, when a man is condemned in himselfe, by the comfortlesse accusing of his owne conscience?</p>
            <p>See the vanitie of rich and worldly men, that spend their dayes in gathering perishing riches, and drop into <note place="margin">Vse.</note> the graue before euer they thinke of this <hi>Learning:</hi> and the folly and madnesse of the most, that count nothing worthy to be knowne but these earthly learnings; spend all their time and studies in them as the Heathens did, till they become almost as heathenish.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The shame it is of many profound Scholers, who in their ministrie seeke to be approued for other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in Tongues, Fathers, Arts, &amp;c. (which in their places are excellent gifts:) but this onely skill, this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nids</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:18743:17"/>
               <hi>learning,</hi> how to direct a troubled conscience to his peace, and a miserable soule to his happinesse, is not their aime; they haue no skill nor will this way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And hearers who would bee taught in any learning but this, admire any teaching but this, whereas onely this can make them wise to saluation, and only this knowledge hath life eternall accompanying it: that is, a learned tongue, that studieth out cases of conscience, and speaketh a word in due season. This is the learning and instruction of this Psalme, and therefore is worthy all our attention and diligence to carry away the seuerall instructions of it. So much of the Inscription.</p>

               <p>And that sinne is such a burthen, it further appeareth by these reasons following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18743:18"/>
First, because it presseth downe impenitent sinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> Hell, and there for euer holdeth them vnder condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; nay, the weight of it pressed the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from heauen, who are now held vnder chaines of blacke darkenesse for euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it bringeth such a burden with it as all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not stand vnder, namely the wrath of God, which makes sinne so heauie, the which being laid vpon Christ himselfe, hee felt such a loade as made him sweat water and bloud.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is attended with the burden of conscience, which it burdeneth with terrors, feares, accusation and guiltinesse; the weight of which is so heauie, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, A wounded conscience or spirit who can beare? all other infirmities the spirit of man can sustaine, but this is impossible.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it burdeneth the sinner, first, with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Gods word, which are the curses and threats of the Law; and secondly, with the burden of Gods hand, which are the load of affliction and executions vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Verse</hi> 9. by which he breaketh the wicked, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his children towards their dutie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as a burden it keepes vnder the sinner, that he cannot bestir himselfe in good duties, nor walke in Gods wayes. But with this difference: the wicked moue not at all, the godly but weakely; they feele it not nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, these grone and sigh and cry out, <hi>Oh who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me? the good I would doe I cannot: the euill I hate, I doe.</hi> And if the sinnes of the godly repented of be so heauie, what are the sinnes of impenitent sinners?</p>
               <p>There is no libertie in sinne, but bondage; it bindeth to the curse, to guiltinesse, horrors, shame and sorrow: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> none are such slaues as sinners, and yet they thinke there can be no freedome, but when they may doe what they list, and are indeed the sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> that is, men law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, or without yoke: but by such Libertine courses
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18743:19"/>
they lay the most heauy yokes vpon themselues; all the Mountaines in the world wil be nothing to their burden.</p>
               <p>Labour to feele this burden, which is heauier then all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> the grauell on the Earth, and sand in the Sea. Neuer a one here present, but we are laid vnder the burden of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> transgression, vnder the weight of our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, originall and actuall sinne, vnder the burden of the wrath of God, of accusing consciences, of Gods curses threatned and executed, bound hand and foote as men ready to be pressed to death; are wee senselesse and feele none of this weight?</p>
               <p>If a man lay vnder an hundred or six hundred weight, and neuer felt it, nor groned, nor struggled, to get from vnder it, he is a dead man; so hee that carries the burden of his sinnes, and feeles no danger, no bondage, grones not vnder the Law of his members, is senselesse of his imperfections and corruptions, this man is dead while he liueth, as <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of widdowes laden with lusts, and liuing in pleasure; so this man abides vnder death till this houre.</p>
               <p>What is the reason then, that the most men neuer feele <note place="margin">Quest.</note> this burden? neuer felt doubting nor trouble of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? nor torment of heart? they loued God euer, they haue grace at will, they serue God as well as the best, they beleeue strongly, they want no oyle in their lamps; they would be sorry to be tempted as some are, to bee so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and pensiue; they haue peace in their consciences.</p>
               <p>The reasons are: First, because they are dead without <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the life of God and grace, without sense and feeling of <note place="margin">Why men feele not such an heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as sin is.</note> this heauy burden, which is felt onely by grace, not by corruption; and according to the measure of grace is the measure of this sense: the lesse sinne is felt, the lesse grace; and so mayest thou accordingly iudge of thy selfe. What is the reason that men can cry out of the stone in the reines, but neuer or seldome of the stone of the heart, but because they haue naturall life, which affects them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18743:19"/>
with the sense of the one, but want supernaturall life, which should strike them with the sense and paine of the other? A spirituall burden, no maruaile if it bee not felt of them, that are all flesh, destitute of the spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they see not their sinnes in a right glasse, but in a false glasse, which lets them see them onely in the profit or pleasure; or as in one of those trunke optick glasses, which make great things very small, and things at hand as if they were farre off: whereas if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold sinne in the true glasse of the Law, and of the curse of God, of the eternall damnation of sinners, and of Christs death for sinners, they would not account any sinne small, nor the iudgement of them farre off. This sight and view of sin makes the godly cry out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bewaile the captiuity they are in, as <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did, who was aliue without the Law, but the Law strucke him downe, and made him cry out of himselfe as a miserable man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, most men neuer meditate of their owne estate, nor consider of their owne condition, to apply the Law to their liues, to see their crookednesse and faylings, as they doe who are in the way to happinesse; they want will or skill, time or conscience; if it hap well, so it is. The godly meditate of their owne estate, and apply the Law to their owne sinnes, which made <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 38. 5. cry out, that his sinnes were too heauy a burden for him to beare: so, could men try their owne strength with the burden of their owne sinnes, they would come to a little more quicke sense of their estate; and with holy <hi>Dauid</hi> here pronounce him a happy man that is eased.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the strong man is gone away with all, and hence comes in this vnfeelingnesse and peace, and he luls men asleepe in false perswasions, wherein they goe on vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. What say many miscreants? Hell is not so hot, nor sinne so heauy, nor the Deuill so blacke, nor God so vnmercifull, as the Preachers say: or if all this were so,

they are not alone, others haue as heauy burdens as they, they shall haue company whatsoeuer become of them: and though they heare the burden of the Word of the Lord daily, and see the burden of his hand lie heauy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, yea and often vpon themselues, yet are they as senselesse as dead men, vpon whom if you lay all the weight of the earth, they feele nothing.</p>
               <p>O beware of this fearefull iudgement, which is a great part of this burden, the which the lesse it is felt, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is, and know that there is no man, that shall not feele the burden of his sinne one time or other, though the wicked doe neuer, till it be too late. Shall the Lord himselfe be pressed vnder the burden of thy sinnes, as a Cart laden with sheaues, and art not thou? <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. shall all other dumbe and senselesse creatures grone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of thy sinne, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. and art thou thy selfe more senselesse then they?</p>
               <p>Feeling this burden, seeke meanes to be deliuered and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> disburdened; and this will he doe, that findes this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pressing and oppressing him. The meanes is, to come to Christ as he calleth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come vnto mee, all yee that are weary and laden, &amp;c.</hi> Come, not with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and feet, but with, first, Repentance: secondly, Faith.</p>
               <p>First, come in confession of sinne and godly sorrow, <note place="margin">Meanes to be disburdened of sinne.</note> come groning and bewayling thy sinne and estate, come creeping to God with thy burden on thy backe; confesse thy sinne and forsake it, this is the way to finde mercy: thus <hi>Dauid</hi> found ease, <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, come in Faith, hungring and thirsting after righteousnesse; lay hold on Gods mercy and Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which are as two shoulders to beare it quite away. Feare not, but, as the people said to <hi>Bartimeus, Be of good comfort, he calleth thee.</hi> He calleth thee in the Word, he giueth a gracious promise, <hi>Come to me, I will ease you;</hi> he sealeth vp his promise by the Sacrament, in which thou shalt finde him ready to giue thee ease, that longest and

gronest after him. Doth any sinne oppresse thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? thou hearest and seest in the Word and Sacrament, how he was made sinne, that is, a Sacrifice for sinne for thee. Doth any burden of misery or crosse, inward or outward presse thee? hee offereth himselfe to ease the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to pacifie the perplexed conscience, to strengthen the heart, and to remoue or mitigate all our burdens for vs; according to the prophesie, <hi>Isay</hi> 53. 4. 11. He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrowes: the word is <hi>sebalon</hi> of <hi>sabal,</hi> to carry as a Porter doth a burden, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in both places.</p>
               <p>But alas! euery man must carry his owne burden: <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> how then can Christ?</p>
               <p>Legally euery man must carry his owne, the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <note place="margin">Answ.</note> personall obedience and satisfaction: but Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically Christ our suretie beares them, and therefore come to him in the Word and Sacrament, with Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p>Once finding ease of this burden, lode thy selfe no <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> more: Christ hauing cured the blinde man, and eased him of that burden, bids him, Goe thy wayes, and sinne no more, lest a worse thing befall thee. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <note place="margin">

               <p>If a man be to deale with a great burden, he will once or twice try his strength with it; if it bee too heauy for him, he will let it alone. Hast thou euer felt the ouer-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of sinne, euen the least: (with which, haddest thou the strength of all Men and Angels, thou couldest not encounter, nor stand vnder it) and wilt thou againe meddle with it? Besides, hast thou not, when thou art at the lightest, sufficient burden of that originall sinne, of which <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. Euill is present with me? it <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> lies euery-where vpon thee: and of actuall sinnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number? that still in stead of disburdening thy selfe, and lightning thy lode daily, thou addest to the heape,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18743:21"/>
and it is neuer big enough, as though all thy sinnes had no weight at all?</p>
               <p>O, but this is nothing, a small sinne, an oath, an idle <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> word, rash and hasty anger, to play the good fellow, to drinke with my friend, lose my time, credit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If thou couldest bring me an instance of any one sinne <note place="margin">Answ.</note> that had no weight, thou shouldest haue good leaue to wed thy selfe to it, neuer to depart: but no sinne is so small, but hath such a weight as will presse to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomelesse pit; bring me any sinne the wage of which is not death; an idle word, for which thou must not giue account; any tricke of youth, for which thou shalt not be brought to iudgement. Sand, euen euery little sand hath his weight, and, though small in quantity, yet if great in number, will drowne the ship of the greatest burden: but what if all the sands of the Sea-shore were in one ship? must it not sinke? and are not thy sinnes for weight and number, like the sands of the Sea-shore?</p>
               <p>If sinne be such a burden, then helpe thy brother from vnder this burden: the Law of God enioynes thee to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note> helpe and pitty the beast of thine enemy, if thou see it faint vnder a burden, and, a mercifull man is pittifull to his beast; and oughtest not thou to helpe much more, and pitty, and ease to thy power, the burdened soule of thy brother? hast thou more sense of the groning of a beast, then of thy brother? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2.

Secondly, put vnder thy shoulders to helpe to beare their necessities: another part of the burden of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. Thirdly, helpe his burden of sinne from off him, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing, reprouing, exhorting, and praying. <hi>Thou shalt plainely reprone thy brother, and suffer not sin vpon him.</hi> Oh, how vnmercifull are they, that make but a iest of mens sinnes? Would wee laugh, to see a man pulling a

mill-stone vpon himselfe, and crushing himselfe all to pieces? <hi>Iude</hi> wisheth vs to pull others out of the fire, and not to throw them in. Others there are that force men to sinne, as to drinke more then one can beare; and so he doth indeed, hee drinkes the poysoned cup of Gods wrath. Doest thou reioyce to draw thy friend to drinke a cup of poyson? thou art a murtherer of his soule and body. Masters that force their seruants to breake the Sabbath, whereas they ought to helpe them from vnder their burdens, they lay heauier lodes on them.</p>
               <p>If sinne be such a burden, take knowledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 6.</note> loue of God and Christ, who hath taken vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe all thy burden, and be thankefull.</p>
               <p>How? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, By becomming Gods seruant, and taking his <note place="margin">Answ.</note> yoke on thee, that is sweet and easie: will any mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant suffer another man then his Master, to lay burdens and oppresse him, and make him his drudge? Doest thou professe seruice to God, and yet let Sinne and Satan toile thee with such infinite burdens, vnder which thou canst not stand? yeeld thy selfe to Gods Will and Word, and this will ease thee of those burdens. Secondly, walke as a man released of thy heauy burden, and now at ease and liberty: How thankfull was <hi>Dauid</hi> when he escaped the burden of one sinne? 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 22. <hi>Blessed be the Lord, and blessed be thy counsaile, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from shedding innocent bloud:</hi> and as <hi>Peter</hi> was rauished with ioy, when the Angell vnburdened him of his bolts, and set him free out of prison, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. so must thou admire the goodnesse of God in this thy release from a far more miserable burden and bondage. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because thou hast still some burden of corruption, which incumbreth the best, thou must be still lesning it, and see that it bee in continuall consumption. Fourthly and lastly, desire Christs comming, when all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of sinne, all the guiltinesse, the filthinesse, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18743:22"/>
and corruption of it shall be abolished, and thy selfe set into the perfect liberty of Gods sonnes, to enioy the fullnesse and highest degree of that blessednesse, which our Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> here pronounceth vpon all them that are loosed and eased, from vnder the burden of their sinnes.</p>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>And whose sinne is couered:]</head>
                  <p>THe second phrase followeth, by which the remission of sinnes is set forth.</p>
                  <p>How can sinne bee couered, since God seeth it, and <note place="margin">Quest.</note> cannot but know all things, past, present, and to come?</p>
                  <p>God is al an eye, and nothing can shut his eyes against <note place="margin">Answ.</note> his will; but then sinnes are said to bee couered, first, When they come not into account. Secondly, When <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tum tecta pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata dicuntur, cum Deus nolit punire,</hi> August.</note> God doth not punish them. Thirdly, When Christs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, actiue and passiue, is as a vaile or couer, so hiding them as though they were not at all. To this purpose, the Lord promising to his people free remission of sinne, vseth this phrase, <hi>I haue put away thy transgression like a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isa</hi> 44. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>cloud, and thy sinnes as a mist:</hi> that looke as the Sunne or Winde disperseth darke clouds, and makes the heauens as faire as if they were neuer clouded: so the grace of God disperseth the sinnes of his people, which as a cloud couered and hid his face from them.</p>
                  <p>This phrase of <hi>couering sinne,</hi> implyeth two things: First, that sinne is a most odious thing in the eyes of God. Secondly, that euery man, that would be happy, must haue something to <hi>couer</hi> and hide it from his eyes.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Sinne is an odious thing.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because of the filthinesse of it, signified, first, in <note place="margin">Sinne a most odious thing.</note> the legall washings, lauers, purifications of garments, vessells, persons, &amp;c. Secondly, in the comparisons, wherein it is likened to leprosie, to filthy clouts, to the Leopards spots, and to the Black-Moores skin. Thirdly,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18743:22"/>
in those many Petitions; Wash me, clense me, purge me with hysope, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, looke what way a man can, it is filthinesse; first, in respect of God, whose Law is violated and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Secondly, of the sinner himselfe, whose soule and conscience is defiled, and euery thing that he toucheth, till his sinnes be pardoned, as the Leper in the Law was till he was clensed. Thirdly, in respect of others; by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing scandall, and occasioning vncleannesse, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in others, by example and imitation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is odious; because it is a shamefull naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vvhich it euer carryeth with it. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their sinne were naked, but not ashamed; presently sinne makes them see, and shame in their nakednesse, and sew Fig-leaues to couer them.</p>
                  <p>The Israelites making the Calfe, vvere <hi>naked;</hi> that is, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</note> destitute of that holinesse, which should haue beene in Gods people, and of the protection and fauour of God: the nakednes of their soules made them naked to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

And adde hereunto the daily and diligent vse of all the meanes of sanctification; get thee to the cleane vvaters; first, of Faith, which <hi>purifies the heart.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the Word of God: <hi>Yee are cleane by the word which</hi>

                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> seruant of sinne: this is the Apostles reason, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>What fruit had you in those things, whereof yee are now asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?</hi> Beware of boldnesse in sinne, be not impudent in it, but ashamed of the nakednesse of it.

                  <p>Yet it is not euery shame, which is commendable. <hi>Caine</hi> was ashamed, but repented not; <hi>A thiefe is found and ashamed, but abides a thiefe still,</hi> saith the Prophet. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Euery man that must be happy, must haue something to</hi>

                     <hi>hide and couer his sinnes from Gods eyes;</hi> and nothing in the World can doe it, but Christ and his righteousnesse, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified <note place="margin">Euery one must get a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for his sin.</note> in the Arke of the couenant, vvhose couer was of gold, and called a propitiatorie, that looke as that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Tables, that vvere vvithin the Arke; so God couers our sinnes against those Tables: so in the cloud couering the Israelites in the wildernesse, signifying God couering vs from the danger of our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Hence Christ is called a garment, and wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18743:23"/>
First, to buy this garment, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell thee to buy of me gold and rayment:</hi> that is, doe as men doe in buying of the commodities they want: First, see thy vvant of it, by viewing thine owne nakednesse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, esteeme it in the iust value of it: and thirdly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change all thy sinnes for this righteousnesse. Then, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to put it on, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. that is, by Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <note place="margin">2.</note> and vvith Christ to put on the graces of his Spirit. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. Put on tender mercies, kindnes, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, &amp;c. We must buckle Christ to vs, and neuer put him off againe.</p>
                  <p>This garment, first, hides our nakednesse: Secondly, protects vs from the iniurie of weather and Gods wrath. Thirdly, it gets a blessing for vs, as <hi>Iaacob</hi> did in <hi>Esaus</hi> garments.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth vs how to iudge our selues, namely, so <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> farre as we are not found in Christs righteousnesse, to be most vnhappy and lothsome creatures, yea the vilest of all, the Deuill and the Damned excepted. Our sinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers vs, and turnes vs naked into Gods wrath: if once hee fixe his eye vpon it, it makes him destroy his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it couers vs with shame and confusion.</p>
                  <p>But how farre are men from seeing their estate? how miserable in not seeing their miserie? neuer perceiuing how naked and vncouered they be. Were it not thus, how durst they prouoke the eyes of Gods glorie? <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Doubtlesse Ierusalem is fallen, and Iudah is fallen downe, because their tongue and workes are against the Lord, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the eyes of his glory.</hi> They durst not sinne as <hi>Zimri</hi> in the sight of God, and of Gods people, in the sight of the Sunne, and in the cleere day; by horrible vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, drunkennesse, thefts, blasphemies, and the highest contempts of God, as they doe. But blindnesse in sinne makes sinners so bold and impudent, that they shame not in most flagitious courses.</p>
                  <p>But farther off are they from happinesse, that iustifie,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18743:24"/>
defend, and glory in their sinnes. A good man cannot abide the shape of his owne sinnes: for he seeth himselfe a mishapen creature by them, whereupon he daily seeks a couer for his deformity, and thinketh no couer suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: But many wretches are senselesse and shamelesse, and glory in nothing but in their shame, and shame at nothing, but that which should be their glory.</p>
                  <p>If thou wouldest be happy, neuer be at rest till thou <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> hast obtayned some sound assurance, that thy sinnes are couered.</p>
                  <p>Here many deceiue themselues, and shrowde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in false couers. First, some if they can couer them before men, and hide them from mans eyes, if no man remember them thereof, all is well, they forget them and the danger is past: but a good man would rather haue his sinne put out of Gods sight, then all the worlds; hee stands not, nor falls to men, but to his owne Lord. Oh looke to thy cleanenesse, or vncleanenesse before God, discouer the matter to the Physitian, be sure that no man sinnes without witnesses, at least God and his conscience seeth him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, some thinke a ciuill life a good couer, if they liue honestly and neighbourly, and doe no harme, though they sinne, God will spare them. This is a false couer of simple men, like <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaues: God can and doth see many a wicked heart through a ciuill life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, others labour to couer their sinnes by cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; they giue almes, say some prayers, doe some good deeds when they die, &amp;c. but all this is as thin a couer as the former.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, he speakes not in regard of God, but of Men, against whom he had beene tyrannicall, to whom hee counsells him to make some satisfaction, by this

meanes to manifest the truth of his repentance, but not that he could satisfie God. Neither can Saints, Angels, Merits, or humane Satisfaction, couer sinne, which is the Popish couer. The sound couer we speake of, is aboue all that Man or Angell can bestow on vs. <hi>I counsell thee to buy of me gold, and rayment, to couer thy filthy nakednesse.</hi>

                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 18.</note> Meanes to get thy sinne couered, are these.</p>
                  <p>First, labour to see thy sinnes in the numberlesse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and horrible nature of them, and what a fearefull <note place="margin">Meane to get sinne couered.</note> thing it is to haue God beholding them: for no Leper can bee so vile and lothsome in thine eyes, as thou art in his, while thou art in thy sinnes vncouered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, vncouer them often to God by humble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; the more thou vncouerest them to him, the more thou couerest them, and the more will hee couer them: and withall haue them often in thine owne eyes, if thou wouldest not haue them in Gods; for both these are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as helpes one to the other. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>My sinnes are euer in mine eyes;</hi> and then followes; <hi>Against thee, against thee haue I sinned:</hi> thus iudge thy selfe, if thou wouldest escape Gods iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the whole life of a Christian is a way to blessednesse, euery one must euery day bee carefull in couering somewhat: daily corruptions shew a necessitie of daily couerings, the best of Gods Saints, after that they had a couer, still prayed to be couered, and Christ those, who haue God to their Father, to pray for forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes. <hi>Dauid,</hi> after sinne pardoned, still prayed, that the Lord would couer the sinnes of his youth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee that would haue God couer his sinnes, must couer his brothers sinnes so much as he can. Men haue nimble eyes to rip other mens sinnes to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, whereas loue would couer a multitude of sinnes. Can we looke for a Sea of mercy from God, and will not let one drop fall on our brethren?</p>

                  <bibl>VERSE 2.</bibl>
                  <q>To whom the Lord imputeth not sinne:]</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the third phrase, wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet setteth down free remission of sinne. In the words are two things; first, what must not bee imputed; <hi>Sinne.</hi> Secondly, who must not impute it; <hi>the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before wee enter into the phrase, one question may be mooued.</p>
               <p>Why doth the Prophet vse such variety of phrases, as, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> easing, couering, not imputing of sinne? any one see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med enough to expresse his minde.</p>
               <p>For sundrie weighty reasons: as, First, to shake, if it <note place="margin">Answ.</note> were possible, the drowsinesse and deadnesse of men, who are without sense of this doctrine: for the most haue cast their conscience on a sleepe or slumber; and while they turne away from the iudgements of God, or fauour their owne lusts, are farre from seeing the danger of sinne; and their vnfeelingnesse causeth them to sing peace to themselues: therefore the Prophet implying sinne to be, first, an vnsupportable burden: secondly, a lothsome nakednesse and filthinesse: and thirdly, a desperate and infinite debt, would driue out the lazie to seeke peace with God, and neuer hold such peace with their sinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to shew how hardly a troubled conscience receiueth comfort in this perswasion, that his sinnes are forgiuen, and therefore needeth more force and perfwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; whence it is, that as needing a speciall prop, in the Lords prayer, that Petition is backed with a reason, <hi>Forgiue as we doe for giue:</hi> and secondly, we haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods promises for this Article as for others, but his oath also: for hee hath sworne to put away our sinnes, though he cannot lie, that wee might haue strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that by all these formes of speech we might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18743:25"/>
conceiue a plenaric pardon and full remission of all sin, guilt and punishment, temporall, and eternall. If we be eased, then the punishment is forgiuen as well as the fault; else were there little ease. If God see it not, hee seekes out no rods for it. If the sinne be couered, so are we also from punishment. If the Lord impute not sinne, how can he iustly punish it? only guilt bindes to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but here is no guilt; it is forgiuen, it is couered, it is not imputed. Besides, remission and satisfaction are opposite; that is not remitted, which is punished.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Apostle addeth, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 14. that the bill or bond is cancelled: if the hand-writing be cancelled, there remaines no action. Fourthly, to note the persons to whom, and the degrees by which this happinesse is attayned. The persons are such as are weary, laden, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and broken-hearted; those, not who lye snorting and sleeping in sinfull pleasures, nor such as swell in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their wealth and righteousnesse, are puffed with an opinion of felicitie; but such as see their pouertie, and inabilitie to discharge their debt; such as who by the stirring of their conscience and spirit of bondage, haue beene driuen out to seeke happinesse in Christ, and out of sorrow gayned their ioy.</p>
               <p>Now, the staires to rise to this blessednesse are in these three wordes: First, being pursued by the wrath of God to the sacrifice of Christ, that by faith apprehended, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him of his burthen: Secondly, the bloud of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant purgeth him from an euill conscience, and the robe of Christs righteousnesse couers the corruption of his nature, so as God with a cleere countenance can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him: and thirdly, because he is still subiect to sinne and pressed as with a weight, the Lord imputes not his weaknesses to him, but makes them as if they were not, and thus giues him heauen before heauen: by these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he iustifieth the vngodly.</p>
               <p>Now to the phrase it selfe. The word <hi>imputation</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18743:26"/>
properly an accounting, reckoning, and allowing some thing to another of fauour, as marchants, who when they will forgiue a debt, doe not put it into the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and so doe not impute it. Here it is vsed meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically; and not to impute sinne is an action of God, whereby he putteth out of his booke and reckoning the sinnes and transgressions of beleeuers, and by imputing to them the righteousnesse of Christ to become theirs, makes all their vnrighteousnesse as if it had neuer beene; as contrarily, when he requireth the sinne, and inflicteth the penaltie, he is said to impute it.</p>
               <p>How can God account of sinne as no sinne? or if hee <note place="margin">Quest.</note> doe, how can he be iust?</p>
               <p>It is proper to God to account of things that are not, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> as if they were, yet without any violence or impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his iustice: for though hee impute not the sinne to the beleeuing sinner himselfe, yet he doth to his surety Iesus Christ, of whom he exacteth his whole debt.</p>
               <p>One cannot be wise by the wisedome of another, nor <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> learned by the learning of another, and therfore it seemes one cannot stand righteous by the righteousnesse of another.</p>
               <p>Christ and the beleeuing Christian are one, as two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie <note place="margin">Answ.</note> men cannot be: and therefore the righteousnesse of Christ, imputed to the beleeuer, is the beleeuers owne righteousnesse, by reason of that vnion which is between Christ the head and the members.</p>
               <p>But the same soule that sinneth, shall die. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This must be vnderstood with these exceptions: first, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> if he continue in his sinne without repentance. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he become not a beleeuer in Christ.</p>
               <p>But there is no man but abideth a sinner, so long as he <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> carryeth the body of flesh about him.</p>
               <p>So soone as a man is iustified, hee is vnguilty before <note place="margin">Answ.</note> God; and further, that sinne, which is present with him, is in-dwelling sinne, but not raigning, so as he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:18743:26"/>
But euery man doth daily fall from his righteousnesse, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> both by reason of inherent corruption, and of actuall sinnes which passe from him; and therefore faileth of the former imputed righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>No, the couenant of God is an euerlasting couenant, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> more stable then the Mountaynes, and no vnfaithfulnesse of man can make God vnfaithfull. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 10. <hi>The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes shall remoue, and the Hills shall fall downe, but my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shall not depart from thee, neither shall the couenant of my peace fall away, saith the Lord, that hath compassion on thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The phrase of not imputing sinne, implyeth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <note place="margin">Doctrin.</note> that <hi>Sinne is a debt:</hi> and often the word (debt) is put for sinne: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. in the Lords prayer, <hi>Forgiue vs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sinne an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite debt.</note> 
                  <hi>our debts:</hi> what <hi>Matthew</hi> calls debts, <hi>Luke</hi> calls sinnes. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 24. In the Parable; the King begun to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon with one that owed him a thousand talents. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. 47. Of the sinfull woman; many debts are forgiuen her, <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> therefore shee loued much. <hi>Luc.</hi> 13. 4. Thinke yee that those, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, were greater debters then the rest?</p>
               <p>Now we may not thinke, that sinnes are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led debts, because we owe them to God, to whom wee owe all loue, feare, obedience, and duetie, but by simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> and resemblance from ciuill debts: for first, euery debt ariseth of some contract betweene the creditor and <note place="margin">1.</note> the debter: so God is the great creditor, Man is the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose debt ariseth out of the contract and first coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, Doe this and liue. Secondly, euery cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor hath a bill, bond, or booke, wherein the debt stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">2.</note> to be seene, and there remaynes vn-cancelled and vn-crost, till the debt be satisfied. The bill or bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man, is his Law, which shewes the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of this debt, and how it riseth: it shewes the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the totall summe, whereto the sinner is bound to satisfie.</p>
               <p>The Morall Law is Gods bond against vs, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18743:27"/>
of ordinances which is against vs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. and contrarie to vs.</p>
               <p>The Law shewes the parcels of this debt; namely, that we are bound.</p>
               <p>First, to the obedience of the whole Law, in perfect loue to GOD, and our neighbour; whence <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. loue is called a debt to our neighbour; this debt wee still owe notwithstanding our transgression.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Law sheweth that sinne is a debt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the corruption which accompanieth the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and the blot which the sinne committed lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the offender, which is attended with an aptnesse either to the same, or any other sinne, by reason of the former act. That this is a debt, appeares because the Law requires perfect puritie and sanctimonie, which we owe vnto God, though the hearts of vs all be full of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vnholinesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Law sheweth the forfeit, which is the guilt, binding ouer the sinner to punishment both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall. This curse of the Law by reason of transgression wee are indebted to vndergoe, we owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods iustice, by reason of sinne, eternall death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Gods iustice cannot be satisfied.</p>
               <p>4. The Law sheweth how, and wherein we wrong our neighbor, &amp; bindeth vs straightly (besides the satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God) to a recompence of the wrong done vnto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, sinne is a debt, because it brings a man euery way into the seate of a debter. First, it argues and brings <note place="margin">3.</note> a man into a weake state, which is very comfortlesse: what a grieuous burden is debt aboue a mans abilitie? Secondly it makes a man hide his head for shame. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee loseth his libertie, that he dares not goe abroad. Fourthly, he feares the Sergeant and the Iayler continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: and fiftly, at length hee is catcht and clapt vp in prison, and thence comes not out, till hee hath payed the vttermost farthing, but there is laid in bonds and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18743:27"/>
chaines of darknesse for euer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, because till sinne be discharged and satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">4.</note> for, the sinner hath all these sinnes vpon him: but as a debter once satisfying the debt by himself or a surety, and compounding with the creditor, is as free as if hee had neuer come in debt; so for sinne once discharged, the sinner is neuer charged with it any more.</p>
               <p>Now sinne is discharged two wayes: First, when the debter himselfe satisfies in his owne person, according to the strict letter of the Law. Thus the damned men and Angels discharge their debt to God, who because they are able to pay, are kept in perpetuall prison, and damned euerlastingly, as a man dying in prison satisfies all: But no liuing man can thus satisfie Gods iustice, if God shal straitly mark what is done amisse. <hi>When we haue done all we can, we are vnprofitable;</hi> there is not a clause in the bond, which we haue not forfeited a thousand times ouer, &amp; so haue we broken in anfinite Law, sinned against an infinite God, deserued an infinite punishment, which no finite creature can sustaine, neither man nor Angell.</p>
               <p>The second vvay of discharging this debt is Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; namely, when another satisfies for the debter: and thus the debts of beleeuers are discharged, through the satisfaction of Christ, who hath payed the vttermost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Elect. And this is the not imputing of sin here meant, which is all one with the free remission and forgiuenesse of it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 26. the seruant said; <hi>Master, haue pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                  <hi>with mee, and I will pay thee all:</hi> therefore wee our selues may pay our owne debts.</p>
               <p>First, it is a Parable, and this is not the maine scope. <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, feare forced the seruant to promise more then he was able to performe. But if no seruant bee able to pay one talent, much lesse is he able to pay 10000. yea the Parable teacheth, that hee that ought but 50. pence, was as vnable to pay it, as he that ought 500. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18743:28"/>
But is this not to impute sinne, to iudge a sinner as no sinner? not to require the sinne, not to inflict the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> how will this stand with Gods Iustice?</p>
               <p>It is proper to God to account of things, that are not, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> as if they were; so also of things, that are, as if they were not, without any violation of iustice, it beeing an Euangelicall imputation, not Legall (for that vvould not stand with iustice) whereby GOD accepts Christs satisfaction in full payment.</p>
               <p>But is this no imputing of sinne, seeing wee pay the <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> whole debt in our surety? is this a forgiuenesse of a debt, to exact it wholly?</p>
               <p>It is a free forgiuenesse, and no imputing to vs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this grace, we conferre nothing to it, it cost vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Answ.</note> but good acceptance. God the Father saw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs, why he should not impute our sinne, but giue vs so free redemption. God the Sonne saw nothing that wee could returne to gratifie him againe in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: so in regard of God and vs, it is a free forgiuenesse and no imputation to vs, though it bee not so to Christ.</p>
               <p>If sinne be a debt, then note the misery of sinners, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> our wofull estate before God by reason of sinne, being no better then desperate banquerupts, laden with debt and danger, &amp; vnable to satisfie the least farthing. What remaines, but either the mercy of the Creditor, or perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prison?</p>
               <p>Thou that canst say, thou owest not all the world a penny, I challenge thee, and arrest thee of an infinite summe, and the forfeite of a bond aboue all thy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if thou hadst the Kingdomes of the earth at thy dispose, &amp; wert the god of the world. I ask no more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses then thy own conscience, First, to proue the debt: and therefore it is time to bestirre thee, and looke about thee to procure thy libertie. If thou hast paide all thy debts to men, thinke of Gods debt at length, for this must bee satisfied, and thou shalt know that delay is no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18743:28"/>
payment. Thou that wouldst neuer come into bonds for any man, thou hast not kept thee out of bonds, which wil cast thee into euerlasting bands, if thou lookest not the better and timelier to thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, see the carelesnesse of most men, that runne <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> on still in sinne and increase their debts, which endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger them to Gods iustice and wrath, like prodigall ding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts that neuer regard how much they runne vpon the score, and neuer think that a day of reckoning and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will come. If wee see a man, who is a borrower of euery man, and takes no care to pay any man, wee vvill conclude he must needs breake one day. And many vvho scorne &amp; shame at such courses with men, are bold with the Lord, and runne in with him still: but let the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor care for his debts, they will not torment themselues with them. Many deceiue themselues and thinke GOD respects not their sinnes, especially if they bee small ones: but small or great, they be vvritten vp and stand in Gods debt-booke or inuentorie, till they bee wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: the least debt imputed casts thee into perpetuall prison. Besides, seest thou not what a fearefull debt one sinne of ADAM hath brought vpon vs all? Secondly, considerest thou not, how the LORD enquires to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sinne in the third and fourth generation, euen as the fathers debt is required of his sonne and posteritie? Thirdly, thou that owest the least, doest thou not owe too much already? and if thou summe vp thy Debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke, thou shalt see thou hadst neede runne in no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for thou art so farre in as thou must be sold for it, or else CHRIST must for thee. Fourthly, thou that thinkest sinne a small thing, and a trifling or dribbling debt, consider of the blood of Christ and the merit of it, which must wash away small sinnes as well as great. Consider the forfeit in the exquisitenesse and eternitie of the torments of hell, and then tell me how small a mote sinne is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:18743:29"/>
Thirdly, seek to come out of debt, and that is, by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon of our debt, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Agree with thine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>while thou art in the way.</hi> The aduersarie is the Lord, who will prosecute and put his bond in suite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs (and the greater the Creditor, the more heauie is the debt:) it will be our wisedome to agree with him in the way, whilest hee friendly reasoneth with vs in the Ministrie, lest Death the Lords Sergeant arrest vs and we be cast into perpetuall prison, into hell, neuer to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased. Pray and intreat him (as Christ hath taught) to remit our debts, not to impute, not to require them, not to exact our forfeits, not to sue our bond, nor cast vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison, but to pardon our faults and punishment, and accept of Christs satisfaction, whereby hee hath cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that handwriting, which was to bee layed against vs, and by fasting it to his crosse, did crosse out all our rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning; and seeing he must be satisfied, pray him to take it out of his Sonnes coffers, who is become suretie for vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, acknowledge a wonderfull mercie of God to forgiue and not impute so great a debt; for a rich <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3.</note> man to forgiue a poore man a debt of a pound or two, would be thankefully taken: our God rich in mercie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues our debt not by pieces, and not because he cannot get it from vs, but freely and fully forgiues the whole debt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>Did not I forgiue thee all?</hi> yes, the good Samaritane will discharge all for vs.</p>
               <p>Now, in way of thankefulnesse what remaines for vs to doe, but; First, beware of running into further debt? A man that hath felt the burden of debt and hath bin in bonds, will make hard shift to keepe out: and doe not thou heape vp wrath against thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though we shall daily by corruption runne vpon scores, yet wee must take heed our debts stand not too long in Gods Booke vnraysed, but daily renew our repentance and so wipe them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:18743:29"/>
As they be daily written, let them bee daily blotted out, let them not bee like the sinnes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> written with a penne of iron, and with the point of a Diamond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thy Creditor forgiue thee all, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. goe thou and doe the like, bee mercifull as thy heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is mercifull. In wrongs and iniuries offered, abstaine from malice and reuenge; count the wrong and iniurie as if it were not, impute it not; for thus thy heauenly Father doth with thee, and thus thou desirest hee should doe for thee. Wouldest thou haue an Ocean of mercie fall vpon thee? and wilt not thou let a drop fall on thy brother? Thus shalt thou testifie thy thankefulnesse, and thus as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. our <hi>vnrighteousnesse shall commend the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and glory of God,</hi> which is not in the nature of our sinne so to doe; for our sinne rather rewards him with shamefull contempt and dishonour; but, First, both in respect of his admirable goodnesse in pardoning so great sinnes: Secondly, and our thankefull acknowledging of that grace in walking answerable and worthie of it.</p>
               <p>The second thing in this phrase is,</p>
               <p>The person that must not impute sinne, is the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25. <hi>I, euen I am he, that putteth away thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy sinnes.</hi> So Chap. 48. 9. 11. <hi>For my Names sake will I deferre my wrath, and for my prayse will I refraine it from thee, that I cut thee not off: For mine owne sake, for mine owne sake will I doe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, first, not all the Angels and Saints in the World, <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> whether in Heauen or Earth, can forgiue the least sinne, because they cannot satisfie the debt, nor cancell the bond.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Scribes and Pharises saw cleerly (though blind in many other things) that none but GOD could forgiue sinnes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord is the father of mercies and the God of all comfort, whereas there is no comfort without pardon of sinne. And <hi>with thee is mercie, Psal.</hi> 130. 3. that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18743:30"/>
is, with thee alone, to whom it is proper to say, <hi>I will forgiue sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, who can forgiue sinne but he? who is a God like thee, that passest by the iniquitie of thy people? who can remit a debt, but he to whom it is due? If another doe it, he abuseth both the Creditor and debtor.</p>
               <p>Whose sinnes yee remit, they shalbe remitted: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Ministers can remit sinne and not God alone.</p>
               <p>God onely remits sinne by his proper authoritie and power, which is here meant; the Minister onely ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> declaring that which God doth. Can Ministers remooue burdens, giue a couer large enough, and remit anothers debt?</p>
               <p>Is my sinne against a Priest or against the Pope of Rome, that he must bestow pardon on me?</p>
               <p>Shall I hide me vnder the Saints wings? or what bond of theirs haue I broken, which they can release mee of? Nay rather, say, First, Against thee, against thee haue I sinned, and prayeth for mercie onely from him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If I owe a man nothing, I care not for his forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and forbearance. Thirdly, There mercie is a poore mercy, I need a rich mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. God rich in mercy, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. who of his great mercy hath begot vs. Theirs is too strait a mercy, I need those large mercies, of which <hi>Dauid</hi> speakes, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 156. <hi>Thy compassions are very large.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now hauing spoken of the person, whose sinne is thus freely remitted, wee come to speake of the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse promised vnto him.</p>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>Blessed.</head>
                  <p>NOw we are to enquire, First, what is meant by the blessednesse pronounced on such a man as hath this ease, couer, and acquittance from his sinnes. Secondly, the instructions to be learned.</p>
                  <p>By blessednesse is meant an effect of iustification, namely, that happy state and condition of a man, arising
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18743:30"/>
from all those heauenly blessings in Christ, which are chained together, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 29. 30. as from Gods prescience, predestination, vocation, iustification, sanctification and glorification. This blessednesse of a man in Christ hath two degrees. First, in this life, which may bee called a blessednesse of grace. Secondly, in the life to come, which is a blessednesse of glorie. The former, is heere principally meant, which may be reached in this life, and necessarily draweth after it the other, as he that draweth one linke of a chaine, draweth the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pardon of sinne is such a gift as makes a man fully happy:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> for the Text cleareth it thus. <note place="margin">Pardon of sin maketh an happie man.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that which remoueth all miserie and burden, maketh a man happy; such as are the curse of God due to sinne in this life and the life to come, the guiltinesse <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> of conscience, horrour of soule and expectation of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <note place="margin">1.</note> which is hell before hell, &amp;c. But this doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne, it is the ease of our burden.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which brings into fauour with GOD <note place="margin">2.</note> otherwise an enemie, so as God and man can now walke together as friends, God can looke with a cleare coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on man, and man looke vp with sweet comfort in his God. This makes a man a happy man; the light of Gods countenance is better then life: But this doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinne, which couereth all our nakednesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that wherein we are iustified before God, is <note place="margin">3.</note> our blessednesse; but in not imputing of sinnes is our iustification, as the Apostle from this place proueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. 7. Hence is it that <hi>Zachary</hi> in his Song, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 77. sayth, that God by remission of sinne teacheth the knowledge of saluation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and lastly, euen nature will draw this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">4.</note> from the worst, that the best to be happy need par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that if God straitly mark what is done amisse, none could abide, and that euery man by the Law is accursed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18743:31"/>
Secondly, and much more doth the Scripture teach, that before God haue begunne his grace with a man, his whole life is hatefull, his mind and conscience polluted; yea and after, euery thing is imperfect, so as the best workes need pardon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and most of all the experience of the godly confirmeth this truth. Neuer did any man feele the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of sinne, and Gods wrath in his soule for it, but hee could say, his happinesse was to be eased. Neuer did any see the ougly face of his sinne, and Gods angry face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding it out of Heauen as a consuming fire, but hee would proclaime him happy, whose sinne is couered. Neuer did any feele Gods Tribunall set vp in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and God and his conscience casting him for his insufficiencie, but he did place his peace and happinesse in Gods not imputing his sinne vnto him.</p>
                  <p>If blessednesse stand in the pardon of sinne and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> of righteousnesse, then not in merits and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This vse the Apostle draweth out of this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. If righteousnesse stand in the hiding of sin, then not in meriting it. Besides, there are but two wayes of discharging debts, eyther forgiuenesse or payment; If I pay, it is not forgiuen.</p>
                  <p>Popish doctrine standeth here against the light of the Scripture, in the Campes of naturall reason, which sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth, that something must bee done by a man to his owne iustification, as the young man, <hi>What good thing shall I doe to be saued?</hi> And the Papists neuer asking God what they should doe, set themselues on workes satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie, which hee neuer enioyned, as Donations to Churches, Pilgrimages, Fastings, Pater-nosters, Aueës, Creeds, Inuocations, Visitations, &amp; Oblations to Saints, keeping and kissing, yea, praying to Reliques, Merits of Saints, Workes supererogatory, Purgatory, Vowes, Vigils, Masse-chantings, Iubileës, martes of pardon, and a thousand such Symoniacall trickes, to make a sale
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18743:31"/>
of remission of sinnes, all which wage battell and warre to this learning of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Of all these in generall will one day bee said, Who required these things at your hands? these things so derogatorie to the bloud of Iesus Christ, which cleanseth vs from all sinne. Secondly, to the nature of iustification, which is the full absolution of a sinner before God, by reason of Christ who is made our righteousnesse by imputation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, so derogatory to the truth of the doctrine concerning good Workes, which are farre from iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or meriting. I speake of good Workes, euen of grace, which, first, are imperfect in <hi>number:</hi> secondly, in <hi>degree;</hi> not being done with all due intents, nor the whole heart and strength, neither can be, because the heart is partly spirituall, partly fleshly; the best workes therefore haue flesh and corruption in them, and whatsoeuer is defiled, performeth not the Law, needeth a couer, and cannot in it selfe be accepted. Thirdly, they are imperfect in the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> No good worke can proceede from any but a good worker, and a iustified person: first, make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good also: therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iustifie, seeing the person is already iustified. And the <note place="margin">Sequuntur iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatum, non praecedunt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificandum.</note> iustified person, when he doth the best, is vnprofitable, he cannot answere one of a thousand: and if the Lord should marke what is done amisse, who could stand? The best worke hath matter of humiliation, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all our reioycing. <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing by himselfe, but had practised workes of grace many, yet saith, he was not thereby iustified.</p>
                  <p>But they say, God hath promised a reward of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> to good workes.</p>
                  <p>Let them shew a place, where it is promised to the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> worke, but to the worker, being a beleeuer, to whom Christs righteousnesse is imputed, in which regards all such rewards are meere mercy.</p>
                  <p>But Christ hath merited, that our good works should <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2.</note> merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18743:32"/>
That is false: for then Christ merited, that our good <note place="margin">Answ.</note> workes should fulfill the iustice of the Law, which they cannot, being stayned with sinne, and that they are dyed in the bloud of Christ, maketh them not meritorious of eternall life, but that they bring not eternall death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 3. to bee iudged according to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3.</note> his righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Righteousnesse is either of the <hi>cause,</hi> or of the <hi>person:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> here speaketh of the former; for hee had a good cause and conscience, though <hi>Saul</hi> pursued him to the death: but he speaketh not of the righteousnesse of his person before God, of which <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, when hee saith, that if hee should <hi>iustifie himselfe,</hi> namely, before God, his owne clothes would defile him.</p>
                  <p>The last iudgement is by workes, and therefore iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are diuers workes of God: in the first, namely, in the iustification of a sinner, he doth accept and make <note place="margin">Answ.</note> a sinner iust, and this is onely by Christs righteousnesse; in the latter hee declares him iust: and this may bee by workes; so Saint <hi>Iames, Let me see thy faith by thy workes;</hi> thus they iustifie before men, not before God.</p>
                  <p>A man is condemned for euill workes, and therefore saued for good workes. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a good worke were as perfectly good, as an euill is perfectly euill, he should; but not being so, we are saued <note place="margin">Answ.</note> by Christs good workes, which were perfect. Let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test therefore that doctrine, that misleadeth vs out of the plaine path to saluation, and cast downe our selues at Gods feet, confesse our sinne, pray for pardon, and plead not <hi>merit,</hi> but <hi>mercy.</hi> Let vs flie forth of our selues to Christ our head, life, and saluation, hee is the carcasse whereunto we must resort; let vs with <hi>Paul</hi> account our best workes but dung, and much more all Popish deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He hath nothing in Christ, who hath any thing in himselfe, and he that will not rest in that righteousnesse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18743:32"/>
restored by Christ, hath no part of blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be a blessed estate to haue sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then must a man certainely beleeue the pardon of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> his sinnes: for this blessednesse is to bee enioyed in this life (as we noted) and no man can hold and enioy that he hath not. The Church of Rome teacheth, that to doubt is a vertue, and so with-holdeth a man from the sense of this happinesse.</p>
                  <p>Their reasons are these. We must worke out our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obie ct.</hi> 1.</note> with feare and trembling.</p>
                  <p>This feare is not in regard of Gods mercy and our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but feare of sinne and his displeasure: and this is <note place="margin">Answ.</note> not contrary, but stands with assurance of forgiuenesse of sinnes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. <hi>Mercy is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is presumption to beleeue so. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is obedience to Gods Commandement. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>This is his commandement, that we beleeue in the name of his Sonne:</hi> now, to beleeue in his name, is more then that he dyed for sinners; else doe the Deuills beleeue as much as we, but they cannot beleeue that Christ dyed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                  <p>None knowes Gods minde concerning him, and so <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3.</note> can haue no assurance, but may only hope well.</p>
                  <p>No man knowes the secret will of God, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed <note place="margin">Answ.</note> will he may know, namely, that whosoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, shall be saued; the application of which draweth necessarily this conclusion, Therefore I shall bee saued, being a beleeuer: which is infallible.</p>
                  <p>Experience sheweth, that the most faithfull and best <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4.</note> are full of doubtings; therefore, there is no certayne beliefe.</p>
                  <p>Doubting and Faith may stand, and will dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; else would not Christ haue said, <hi>O thou of little</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>faith, why doubtedst thou?</hi> euery Christian consists of Flesh and Spirit, therefore Faith will bee assayled with doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18743:33"/>
and yet in the end triumph.</p>
                  <p>Hence we see, as vve are to labour for pardon of sinne, so also for assurance of pardon, else can wee haue little peace in our selues, and a comfortlesse happinesse. Am I the richer, because I know many other be? or fuller, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many eate? I must take comfort in my own wealth, strength by my owne foode, and ioy in my owne pardon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, vvee must euery one herein place our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> euen in Gods mercy pardoning sinne, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly set our hearts and affections vpon it, longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this assurance aboue all things in the world. If a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor were condemned, and at the place of execution, what is it that would make him happy? What wisheth hee aboue the vvorld? onely a pardon from his Prince; gold and siluer, lands and honors, can doe him no good; only a pardon is the most welcome thing in the World. This is euery mans case, we are Traytors and Rebells to God, our sins haue proclaymed vs Rebells through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, the Law hath condemned vs, we are going on to execution, and euery day neerer then other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in then ought wee to place our happinesse, if wee well weighed our estate, but in a gracious and free pardon? We would striue for pardon as for life and death. Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men they be, that place their felicitie in any thing else. For consider, that notwithstanding, first, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of men place their happinesse in wealth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, honor; and these carry all their hearts: yet this is an earthly and sensuall, and farre from Christian happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which cannot leaue a man vnhappy in the end, as all these doe. Secondly, the most wicked ones that the world hath had, haue enioyed the greatest outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie. Thirdly, the most deare seruants of God haue beene strangers in the world, and met with the strangest entertaynement. Fourthly, those whose portion hath beene outwardly most prosperous, yet neuer thought themselues happy out of Gods mercy pardoning sinne;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18743:33"/>
an example in <hi>Dauid;</hi> he had riches, honor, pleasu re, a crowne, kingdome, subiects, treasures; but did he place his fclicitie in these things? No, but in the forgiuenesse and couering of sinnes; in whose steps wee must tread. Fifthly, he that would build a firme house, must lay a sure foundation; and wilt thou lay the foundation of thy happinesse in the dust? Lay it in wealth, they haue wings; and when they fly away, so doth thy happinesse: why doest thou trust a fugitiue seruant? Lay it in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, it will end in sorrow; and the Apostle saith, It makes a man as a corps liuing, dead while he liueth. Lay it in honor; what a vanishing thing is that, like the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of a ship in the Sea, carried with a strong gale? Yea, lay it any where but in God and his assured mercies, it will proue a tottering happinesse, and the fall of such an happy man shall be great.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others thinke themselues most happy in the committing of sinne, and practice of their iniquity; and these are most miserable captiues to the Deuill, so farre from thinking their happinesse to stand in the pardon of sinne, as that they place it in the practice of it. Hence is it that Monsters of men, Deuills incarnate, professe to sweare, quarrell, drinke, riot, whore, and take them the greatest enemies to their happinesse, that would helpe to pull them out of the snares of the Deuill. I would know what other happinesse the Deuill hath, then incessantly to sinne against God, and draw so many as he can into his owne damnation; which expresse image hee hath stamped on numbers, marked to destruction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let vs checke our hearts, that can find so <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> much ioy in these earthly things, and so little in these heauenly gifts of Gods loue, such as are election, voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iustification, adoption, sanctification, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>pleasures of Gods house,</hi> and they blessed that enioy them: and surely well may they suspect themselues to be as yet vnpurged, that finde not a ioyfull sense of it.</p>
                  <p>

Alas, will the beleeuer say, I finde little comfort of this doctrine, I finde my heart much more affected to earthly things, I finde not this ioy of my saluation, the sense of Gods fauour in pardoning my sinne, warmeth my heart but a little; what may I thinke of my selfe? may not I hope my sinnes are pardoned?</p>
                  <p>It is true ordinarily, that a reconciled soule possesseth <note place="margin">Answ.</note> felicitie with great ioy, and the heart seazed of Gods loue, holdeth the consolation of it; yet these rules must be held to vphold the weake Christian.</p>
                  <p>First, the gift of pardon and loue, is giuen often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Rules to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the weak Christian not feeling his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</note> the comfort and ioy of it: when grace is as it were in the seede, and men in the beginnings of conuersion, begin to haue right in the tree of life, and to bee adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is not so soone discerned to come vp to a ioyfull haruest, but first is a blade, then an eare, then corne in the eare. And a time there is, when a soule which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of true grace, is busied and taken vp rather with sense of sinne, desires of grace, and seeking of helps and proppes to beleeue, then with the ioy of any thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. True desire argues the presence of the things desired, and yet argues not the feeling of it: and that a man may haue that gift, which is not felt, appeareth in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who by <hi>Nathan</hi> was told, that his sinne was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and yet long after, he prayeth for the forgiuenes of it, that is, for a more full sense of the forgiuenesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the gift of Gods free grace is not giuen (in respect of vs) all at once, nor in the same measure; and therefore the comfort of it is not all alike, or at once: for the righteousnesse of God is reuealed <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> and so iustification and reconciliation, are in the meanes more and more reuealed, and the comfort is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the gift. Thou hast not such strong comfort of thy estate as some other, or as thou desirest; thy gift of knowledge and vnderstanding of Gods loue perhaps, is lesser then his; comfort thy selfe, stirre vp thy selfe in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18743:34"/>
meanes to inlarge the gift, and thy comfort shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. Hence is it, that the Apostle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 1. 18. praied, that they whose faith and loue he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, might haue their eyes opened to see the hope of their calling by the Spirit of reuelation. Get further knowledge of thy estate, and so thou shalt attaine fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the state of a Christian soule is not all alike, there is a Christian combate, wherein sometime faith preuailes, sometime doubting; sometime grace hath the better, sometime corrupt nature. When faith is foiled of infidelitie, or kept vnder, sense of reconciliation faileth with it. The light of the minde is often eclipsed, as in <hi>Ionah, I am cast from the sight of God;</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> said <note place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Psalm.</hi> 116. 11.</p>
                     </note> once, <hi>all men were liars.</hi> Now the eye of the soule being so dimme, the comforts of God must needs bee ouercast and clouded: but as the Sunne breakes from vnder a cloud, so doth light to the troubled soule: and comfort growes often to a confident glorying, and a ioyfull tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, as <hi>Dauid, Returne, O my soule, to thy rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as the carriages of a mans conuersation bee diuers, so be the apprehensions of his comfort: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is more attended, and carried more purely; sometimes care is remitted, and the course more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. Common infirmities hinder not so much the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of saluation, as great sinnes doe, as appeares in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> adultery, <hi>Restore me the ioyes of thy saluation.</hi> If thy comforts be small, it is likely thy corruptions are the greater: here looke to thy former graces, feelings and workes. Bee diligent in awaking thy soule, shake off worldly delightes, which bring it on sleepe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull shew of righteousnes, which bewitcheth it: set thy selfe before God, and thy dulnesse before thy selfe; say, Oh, what haue I done all this while?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Christian is an happy man, whatsoeuer his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note> outward estates be; else hath <hi>Dauid</hi> misplaced happines.</p>

And herein is their happinesse, that they are in fauour with God, and can neuer be cast out of fauour againe: all happy men are in a sure estate which cannot be lost. This happinesse of grace is surer then that of nature, which <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency; that was lost, because in his owne keeping: this is seated in the fauour of God, which is vnchangeable; vnto which we are <hi>preserued also by the power of God.</hi> True it is, the godly may haue many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</note> and haue, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iaacob, Dauid, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> but none of them, neither inward nor outward, can hinder their happinesse, nay, they shall all further it, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 8. <hi>all things turne to the best.</hi> The worldlings folly is palpable, he thinkes himselfe most happy, when his corne, wine and oyle is increased; as for this light of Gods countenance, it is in the last of his accounts. As for the godly, they count them of all men most simple, and most miserable: and indeede if a man had no other eyes then of his body, no eye of faith, he could not think such blessed, whom the world hates, whom the earth casts off, whom their Country scarce acknowledgeth, their owne kinsfolke will not know, whom their friends forsake, enemies kill; who are made meate for the sword, fewell for the fire, and seldome haue liberty to enioy fire and water, or the commonest benefits of nature in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. They onely are in mens account happy, whom all men flatter, vvho bathe, yea, drovvne themselues in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall delight, vvho can tumble in their gold and siluer, vvhose mouth runnes ouer vvith laughter, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But these, vvho are entred into Gods teaching, can hold against their ovvne reason and sense, that they are blessed, that <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after rightcousnesse, that <hi>mourne</hi> novv, that <hi>suffer persecution for righteousnesse</hi> sake, those of vvhom <hi>men speake all manner of ill</hi> for Christs cause and Gospell.

Their felicitie is not outward, but inward, not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but heauenly; it depends not on man, but on Gods fauour, who hath forgiuen their sinnes for his names sake.</p>
                  <p>Iudge therefore of thy selfe and others with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement: if heauen approoue thee, care not if earth cast thee out? if God iustifie, who can condemne? if Christ will confesse thee, let thy friends deny thee? Thou hast a sure word and promise of God, by which thou mayest apprehend in sorrow, ioy; in trouble, peace; in nothing, all things; in death it selfe, life eternall. Get faith, and thou shalt clearely behold thy happinesse, if al the world should set it selfe to make thee miserable. Get faith, and thou shalt thinke him only happy, whom God so esteemes, although the worlds miserie is, to place hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse onely in miserie. Get faith; and thou shalt see not onely Christ himselfe, the blessed Son of God, when he was reiected of the world, and lifted on the Crosse: but euen his members then happy in Gods fauour, when the World most frowneth vpon them. Faith in the heart onely giueth a rellish to this of our Prophet, <hi>Blessed is the man, whose sinne is forgiuen.</hi>

                  <p>HEere is an inseparable fruite of a iustified person, and a note of a blessed man. First, by <hi>spirit,</hi> referred to man, is sometime meant the mindes, or vnderstanding part of the soule, with the most inward cogitations of it: so 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>that your whole spirit, soule and body, &amp;c.</hi> and in all places, where spirit and soule are mentioned together. Secondly, sometimes for the heart and inward affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>whom I serue in my spirit.</hi> Thirdly, sometimes for the soule it selfe, God inspired into <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>liuing spirt, Genes.</hi> 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. He preached to the <hi>spirits</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:18743:36"/>
                     <hi>in prison,</hi> that is, soules. So here it is to be taken with the vnderstanding, heart, will, conscience, affections, and the rest of the faculties: and the soule is called by this name, to shew the nature of it, that it is a spirit, as the Angels, nay God himselfe is; farre more excellent then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and yet much more neglected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by <hi>guile</hi> is meant three things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: First, in <hi>words</hi> and promises, deceit and false-hood, when one thing is spoken, another meant. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>in whose mouth was found no guile.</hi> Secondly, in <hi>actions</hi> and practice, when one thing is done, another preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Lay aside all guile and dissimulation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in <hi>thoughts</hi> and purposes, when the reasonings and inward frame of the heart is vnfound and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>This last is here meant: for the better vnderstanding of which, we must enquire: First, what it is: secondly, some seuerall practice of it: thirdly, the vses.</p>
                  <p>First, the guile of the spirit is an inward corruption in the soule of man, whereby he dealeth deceitfully vvith himselfe <note place="margin">Description of guile of spirit.</note> before God in the matter of saluation. I say, it is an <hi>inward corruption in the soule,</hi> which sheweth both the kinde and seate of it. First, for the kinde; it is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deceit, and opposite to inward sinceritie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse: Secondly, the seate of it is the soule and heart, which since the fall is deceitfull and wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, <hi>Iere.</hi> 17. 9. hence <hi>Iames</hi> calleth sinners double-minded, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 8. and hypocrites are described by two hearts.</p>
                  <p>And this may sufficiently cast downe proud flesh, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this guile hath taken the chiefe holds; euery mans soule hath in it the seeds of all sinne against the first and second Table, none excepted. Whosoeuer comes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> hath all <hi>Adams</hi> corruptions, whereof this guile is compact, so that if a man looke onely at himselfe, hee that is to day a Protestant, may to morrow be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18743:36"/>
to day a Christian, to morrow a Diuell; were it not for the promise and power of God, that preferues his to saluation. And in that this deceit lyeth, at the roote of the heart, it is more fearefull, both in that it hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen a secret hold, and scarcely can be discerned, as also is in place secretly to infect and poyson whatsoeuer can proceede from that roote, as indeede it doth. Yet few or none complaine of this deadly disease, or will bee knowne to bee annoyed with it: the nature of which is, that the more raging and killing it is, the lesse it is felt. Further, I say, by this guile a man dealeth <hi>deceitfully with himfelfe</hi> in the <hi>matter of saluation.</hi> For there is a guile betweene man and man, but this is more sinfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, both because it is a deceiuing of himselfe by the lying and slattering of his owne heart; as also that it is <hi>before God,</hi> as if hee would deceiue him too; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in regard of the subiects, in the matter of saluation.</p>
                  <p>To deceiue one selfe of his goods, lands, or outward profit, is an ouer-sight, but nothing to the losse of his soule, heauen, and happinesse: and this is that our Text aimeth at: if these words looke to the former, hee is a blessed man, that hath pardon of sinne, and is not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the guile of his heart in this point, plainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that there is such guile in a mans heart, about this perswasion of the pardon of sinne, that not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but himselfe also may bee deceiued in his owne estate, and so kept from feeling or seeking his blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Gods fauour.</p>
                  <p>Many are pittifully beguiled and thinke surely to be saued, and cry, Lord, Lord, but are sent away with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquitie; GOD knowes them not. The Church of Laodicea beguiles her selfe with conceit and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in her owne sufficiencie, being but poore, naked, and miserable: and such is the power of this corruption, in the heart of a naturall man, that when his sin is found hatefull, hee flattereth himselfe in his owne eyes, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18743:37"/>
hath pretences and colours to turne off vprightnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 2.</p>
                  <p>The particular practices hereof wee will referre to foure heads: the first, in respect of a mans estate <hi>before God:</hi> secondly, in respect <hi>of sinne:</hi> thirdly, of <hi>vertue</hi> and grace: and fourthly, in respect of the worke of <hi>the word</hi> and Spirit. That wee may better know the nature here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we will cast eye vpon some notable parts of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which in all this regard it sendeth out in the most, from the which in some degree the best are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.</p>
                  <p>First, when a man is a vile and wicked person, in Gods <note place="margin">1. Guile of spirit in respect of God.</note> eyes, this guile makes him thinke himselfe highly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. The Iewes bragged they vvere the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when Christ told them they were of their father the Diuell. The Pharise could say, Lord, I am not as this Publicane, when hee was a limbe of the Diuell. And this guile is fed by sundry other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions: As first, by a conceit of righteousnesse; while men measure themselues with themselues or with some <note place="margin">1.</note> great sinners; so did the Pharise: or by the crooked rule of ciuill righteousnesse; he looked at extortioners, vniust, adulterers and the Publicane: the common speech is, now I am no swearer, no theefe, no drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard; no I would not for all the world bee so bad as some of these professors, so couetous, contentious, such a dissembler. So for outward righteousnesse, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise looked at the Law, hee paid tithe of all, and dealt iustly, these pay tithes and dues truely, giue euery man his owne, keep their words, are good to their neighbors, and good to the poore, keepe good hospitalitie; but all this while <hi>are aliue</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>without the Law,</hi> not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.</note> considering what righteousnesse God there requires, and not seeing the corruptions of their hearts, neglect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lusts, rising vp against God and his Law. Whence onely it is, that poore men, who liue in the breach of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18743:37"/>
all Gods Lawes, despise the Word, neglect Prayer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabboth, sweare without sense or touch, and serue their lusts, yet can carry all with this conceit they meane no harme; whereas if God euer open their eyes to see their faces in a true glasse, they shall see how sinne deceiued them, and shall pronounce the sentence of death against themselues, and the flower of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this deceit is fed by the bounty, fauour, and <note place="margin">2.</note> blessing of God, who prospereth them in their labours, houses, in themselues &amp; others. O if I were not in Gods fauour, he would not prosper me so long and so sundry wayes! Thus they wil know loue or hatred by the things afore them. This is the guile of rich men, whose houses being peaceable without feare, pride compasseth them; but little know they the end of their fat pastures, or of their lifting vp, <hi>vt lapsu grauiore ruant,</hi> that they may catch the greater fall. These seeke not their peace in the pardon of sinne, but haue set vp themselues a-fatting till the day of their destruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what way soeuer God deale, the heart <note place="margin">3.</note> vvill deceiue it selfe: For let God change his hand, and bring crosses and tryalls on a man, which should shake him vp from drowsinesse and securitie, yet hence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further ground many will presume of Gods loue: for why? doth not the Lord loue those whom he chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? and I hope I haue my punishment here; vvhen indeede the Lord doth curse them in their counsels and attempts. And thus men throw poyson into the Lords cup; wheras were these signes of loue, amendment would accompany it, sorrow for sinne, feare of offending, and diligence in good duties; in a word, their security would rise of the pardon of sinne, and not of punishment of them.</p>
                  <p>The second guile is in respect of sinne: the worke of <note place="margin">2. Guile of spirit in respect of sinne.</note> it is manifold; and that, eyther before the sinne be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18743:38"/>
Before the sinne; First, it flatters a man and tolles him on many wayes. <note place="margin">Before sinne.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it beares him in hand, that great sinnes are but small and veniall, which the sinner easily beleeues, for he <note place="margin">1.</note> would haue them none at all. Hence charge men with swearing, rayling, drinking, gaming away the Sabboth, their answere will bee, I would I had neuer done worse! &amp;c. Grosse sinnes with them are but infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that if it be greater, yet GOD will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">2.</note> it, conceiuing of God as an idle Essence, that had shaken off his power of iudging the World. <hi>The foole,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1.</note> that is, euery naturall man <hi>sayth in his heart there is no God,</hi> to see or require: such frozen persons that say God will doe neyther good nor euill, <hi>Zephanie</hi> threatens, that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zepha.</hi> 1. 12.</note> God will visit them as with lights, lest any thing escape him, and will teare them and none shall rescue them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when men shake hands with hell and death, absoluing themselues from guilt, while they fauour <note place="margin">3.</note> themselues in their lusts: though the Lord say, Sword, goe thorow the Land, yet it shall passe ouer them; such as blesse themselues, when the Lord pronounceth the words of the curse, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 20. <hi>The Lord will not bee mercifull to that man.</hi> Yet, what a number of Ruffians, Contemners and Prophaners of the Lords Ordinances, Scorners of Religion, Out-facers of godlinesse, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Adulterers and Swearers, whom the Lord hath shut Heauen against, goe on in a gracelesse and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous presumption, by this guile kept from seeking peace in season with God; though the Lord say, hel was made for them, they say, I shall escape hell. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these words shall stand?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they thinke nothing more easie then repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: this sinne if I doe it, is not vnpardonable, I shall <note place="margin">4.</note> repent and find forgiuenesse hereafter, GOD cals at all houres: so he neglecteth all counsell; those exhortations come not neere him; <hi>Seeke the Lord while he may be found;</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:18743:38"/>
                     <hi>to day if ye will heare his voyce, &amp;c. I gaue her a time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but shee repented not.</hi> The Lord would haue purged <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 21.</note> them, but they would not bee purged; till his seueritie sudenly cut them off as vnprofitable Trees, to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Would a man bee so carelesse of his bodie, as to suffer a disease to preuaile by weekes, and moneths together; because, so long as there is life, hee may seeke helpe and recouer? no, he will seeke present helpe, be hee neuer so young: but for the soule, men put off care from age to age, and because they can repent hereafter, they will doe that whereof they may repent: and whereof indeed they shall repent though too late.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, after sinne, the guile of the soule is not <note place="margin">After sinne.</note> sleeping, though the conscience often bee: for whereas after bodily harmes men are for the most part wiser, here they are more foolish, vnlesse the deceit be more timely discouered. They can warily abstaine from whatsoeuer hath bred them sorrow or sicknesse: but here the deceite of the heart, first nourisheth and hideth, yea, maketh <note place="margin">1.</note> cloakes and vizards for sinne, to which it is more prone after euery new practice. The truth is, if euery sinne might be seene in it owne colours, it would be as blacke as a Deuill; but that sinne might goe downe the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and stay in the bowels, the heart ioynes with Satan in the varnishing and colouring of it. Hence is it, that Cut-throat couetousnesse goes masked vnder the habit of good husbandry, fornication but a tricke of youth, scarce an ouersight, ryot and excesse is counted liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, drunkennesse but good-fellowship, pride but come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse or ornament at most, and blacke vices are growne neere of kinne to the most beautifull vertues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, after sinne committed, the wiced heart can <note place="margin">2.</note> defend it; all <hi>Eues</hi> brood suckt this from her. When God came to her, the Serpent gaue her to eate; when he comes to <hi>Adam,</hi> his wife gaue him to eat, it seemed but reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18743:39"/>
when he comes to <hi>Cain,</hi> Who made him his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeper? Come to the couetous man, hee hath Scripture for himselfe, He that prouides not for his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is worse then an Infidell. Come to the Drunkard; why? was not <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> drunke, and many good men besides? Come to the Swearer, hee is safe, so long as hee sweares nothing but truth, and by that which is good, be it bread or fire or salt, &amp;c. Come to an Athiest that neuer kept Sabboth in all his life, so that with him there is but little difference betweene it and another day of the six; why? was not the Sabboth made for man, and not man for the Sabboth? hee can serue GOD on his horsebacke, none but he and his horse together: another laden with all vnrighteousnesse tels vs, how the best sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth seuen times a day. Thus is sinne growne wittie, and strong within the wals of a false heart, and feares no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours nor forces.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If any sinne hap to make any gash or skarre in the conscience, that it troubles a little the sinner; the <note place="margin">3.</note> heart is not backward to seeke to apply remedies, in which are as little helpe, more danger: for it seekes to stoppe the mouth of the conscience, and to choake and stifle the voyce of it: First, by calling in other distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to take him from such melancholy; it sets <hi>Cain</hi> on building a Citie, and <hi>Saul</hi> to fetch in Musicke: so it calls in company, gaming, merriments and other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, like water to a dropsie. Little is the ease of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that paine, the cause of which remaineth; it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly returne againe. Secondly, by contenting a man with some short humiliation, and as vnsound as short, to flatter God withall, onely forced by feare and selfe-loue. The Iewes confessed their sinnes, and promised to doe so no more: but they dissembled with their double hearts, and their goodnesse was like the morning dew. How many such flashes made <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> how many sickemen on their beds haue in their affliction sought God? but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18743:39"/>
it was onely for ease, and to get out of his hands, or for feare, because they saw no way to get out, affecting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, not repentance, nor seeking sound reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace, but a truce; for no sooner recouered, but they are out in the field with God againe, al the time of their straitenesse being quite forgotten. And let soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Protestants, that at some Sermons can melt with great motion to teares, and yet afterward make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no conscience of their waies, but yeeld libertie to their lustes, thinke vpon this point, and consider how the deceit of spirit ouer-reacheth them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by satisfying with some outward ceremonie and formall seruice, which when they haue done, they shall find, that God is not friends with them. Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne committed, and accusing them, by saying or framing a prayer, though without heart-breaking, faith, or the spirit, draw a skinne ouer their heart, and there is peace for a time: others, whose whole life was spent in oppression, and euery penny worse got then other, if about the time of their death, or after, they giue a little money to the poore, or bee liberall for a guilding Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they haue peace without any satisfaction or resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution according to the law of repentance. What they haue wickedly got, they leaue to their heires, who are made happy by their fathers going to the deuill, as the prouerbe saith. They neuer loosed their bonds of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and now are chained in the bonds of blacke darknesse for euer.</p>
                  <p>The third guile of the heart, is in respect of vertue <note place="margin">3 Guile of spirit in respect of grace.</note> and grace, whereby the vnsound heart doth rest it selfe vpon counterfeit vertues: for the wickednesse of euerie mans heart by nature is such, that let it be neuer so vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it will counterfeit any vertue.</p>
                  <p>First, it will make a man outwardly seeme a true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper <note place="margin">1</note> of God, it will bring the body, and frame it to <note place="margin">Out ward.</note> reuerence, when there is none within; it will make the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18743:40"/>
lips draw neere, when the heart is farre remooued; it makes Congregations and people sit before God, when their hearts are gone after their couetousnesse. Idols in Churches are put downe, but idols in mens hearts are set vp: and this is the reason why the Word and Prayer are so forcelesse; wee haue mens bodies now and then when they list, but seldome or neuer their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it will make a man outwardly seeme <note place="margin">2.</note> a good Christian, when inwardly he is a <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> an vnsound heart will make a man professe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but vtterly neglect the work of it, the forme of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse contents him without the power; so he haue a lampe of profession, he cares not for oyle in it: it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him to get knowledge, and rests in that without conscience; it suffereth him to pray, but publikely more then priuately, and to neither ioyneth watching to his prayer; yea, he can shew the shell of any duty, but neuer cares for the kernell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, inwardly it can counterfeit the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Inward.</note> graces; as, first, <hi>faith,</hi> when it hath neuer a iot; it wil presume of Gods mercy, and thinks this presumption <note place="margin">1.</note> faith. What man saith not, hee beleeues, that hee shal be saued? but <hi>all men haue not faith,</hi> saith the Apostle: therefore it is a shaddow without substance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>repentance:</hi> a man in sicknesse will cry out of himselfe and his sinnes; he will promise if he liue, to <note place="margin">2.</note> become a new man, and practise godlinesse: but when God hath restored him, his wicked heart carries him as farre backe as euer hee was: here was a shew of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but it was counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>loue,</hi> where is nothing but deuillish malice: two neighbours are fallen out, and are at deadly hatred; <note place="margin">3.</note> at the time of the Sacrament, both of them dissemble loue and charitie: but after it, they are as malicious and mischieuous as euer they were before.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>strength</hi> in temptation where is none. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:18743:40"/>
while he was with Christ, would die with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would deny him: but when the maide daunted him, he saw that that was but a flourish, and that he was not so well acquainted with the wiles of his heart as he should haue been. And so of the rest of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>A fourth guile of the heart, is in respect of the worke of the Word and Spirit; when the deceitfull heart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">4. Guile of spirit in respect of the worke of
<p>

                        </p>
                     </note> the sinner to rest in the restraining of some corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in stead of renewing grace: for example; the Word by a common worke of the Spirit, planteth some kinde of vertues, as temporary faith, ioy in the word, reuerence to Preachers, loue to Professors, releeuing them, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for them, and helping them euery way; and yet such are not cleansed from their filthinesse, all their hearts are corrupt, all is ioyned with deepe hypocrisie. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, reuerenced him, tooke him for a good man, and did many things: but his heart was right in nothing, for it claue to that speciall sinne of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his brothers wife.</p>
                  <p>And as the heart is, so is euery action, so is the ioy, loue and labour; some sinister respect it hath, and doth not good purely, and for it selfe. Thus our Sauiour wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that the good and bad hearers are both in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance fruitfull, and for a time: but the one is purely affected in bringing fruit, so is not the other.</p>
                  <p>But doe not the best finde such deceit in doing good, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> as that they haue great cause to bewaile it?</p>
                  <p>Yea, but although reliques of natural hypocrisie mixe themselues into their actions, yet they sway not the hart, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> but are striuen against; and the maine motion of the heart is sincere, and chooseth good for goodnesse sake, as in the other it is not. Now when a wicked heart fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in it selfe knowledge, consent, confession and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the word, al which were in <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, hee rests in this as sauing knowledge; whereas it is a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18743:41"/>
common gift, whereby the Lord will haue his truth witnessed by the enemies of it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when a guileful heart comes to a sight of sin, to feare it, to terror of conscience, griefe and vexation for sinne, it rests in that as a sound feare of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is a seruile feare like that of the deuils, and the vexation is not for sinne, but for the punishment of it: it is a common worke of the Word and Spirit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the wicked to iust damnation.</p>
                  <p>Further, when a guilefull heart sees many corruptions cast out, many sinnes broken off, many things reformed; it rests it selfe as in a worke of regeneration: whereas this is a common worke of the Spirit incident to the wicked, whom if God should not represse, there were no liuing for the godly on earth. <hi>Haman did refraine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from Mordecai;</hi> most sinnes seemed to be mortified in <hi>Iudas,</hi> but yet he was possessed by the deuill. Infidels liue honestly and ciuilly, abstaine from wrongs, violent lusts, &amp;c. But here is no renuing grace, which mortifieth all corruptions, and reformeth euery thing; and thus was it not in <hi>Herod, Iudas,</hi> and the wicked. Besides, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, the whole childe is borne compleate in all parts; so doth the Spirit begin his worke at the roote of the heart, and within, and not without, as in Infidels, and workes not onely in suppressing and restraining sinne, but also in oppressing it, and renewing the heart and life.</p>
                  <p>And here it shall not be amisse to adde some further notes of restraining grace, not renewing. And first, in <note place="margin">1 Notes of grace restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing.</note> respect of sinne it selfe.</p>
                  <p>A conceit that grosse sinnes be but infirmities, though they liue and lye in them, bearing themselues vpon this, that <hi>the iust man falleth seuentimes a day, and riseth againe: Prou.</hi> 24. 16. falsely vnderstood.</p>
                  <p>Thus many approue not the excesse of sinne, as vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to sweare the greatest oaths, insatiable griping and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18743:41"/>
gaping after the world: but why hate they not all oaths, all couetousnesse which is idolatry: but because there is not a spirit renewing the heart, which mortifieth all deedes of the flesh, all oaths, all lyes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of their affection toward sinne, <note place="margin">2.</note> namely, a pretence of hatred of sinne, when it is but a rash anger. For example: Of all sinnes, which the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie is taxed for of the common people, there is none so noted and exclamed against, as their hardnesse, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, gathering of goods together; and the sinne is so seuerely obserued aboue all other, as that an honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented man can scarce be free from this imputation. But now, though the fault bee hainous and too common, what is the reason the multitude so exclames vpon it? is it because they hate the sinne? surely no: for their owne feete are as deepely sunke in the same mire, and they care not for plucking them out. Angry they are, that another out-gathers them; but if they hated the sinne, themselues would not gather so fast.</p>
                  <p>Further, many seeme to hate some of their sinnes, and sometimes trouble their sinnes and grosse corruptions, and wish it otherwise and accuse themselues. Many are offended at some errors of Popery, some vaine inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, idle and hurtfull traditions, but others are iustified. Here is a shew of hatred of sinne, of error, but it is onely a rash anger: for</p>
                  <p>First, he that hates one sinne or error, because it is so, will hate all which he knowes so to be: hatred is against kinds, we hate all serpents, all poysons, all enemies: so said <hi>Dauid, I hate all vaine inuentions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, one or two euils may be disliked of him, that hates no sinne, and the sinne hated but not as sinne, as <hi>Absolom</hi> hated <hi>Amnon</hi> for his incest, but himselfe more incestuous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thou diddest hate these sinnes and errors as enemies, why doest thou not raise thy power against
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18743:42"/>
them? crie for Christs crucifying power against them: a perfit hatred will neuer be satisfied without death or diuorcement. If thou hatest her in thine heart, why doest not thou put her away? If thou hatedst thy sinnes, thou wouldest forsake them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly note, in respect of the word; when men taste the good word and the powers of the life to come, they <note place="margin">3</note> take this to be the Spirit of adoption, and a sound affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But obserue the difference and falsehood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Gods children all their affections be affected with it, and they feede on it vnto eternall life, in these it affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth their ioy onely, and that for a time. Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren loue it, beleeue it, reioyce to meditate of it, rest on it by the confidence of their hearts, long for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the promise, grieue when they doe any thing to hinder that accomplishment, and hate all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine against it; whereas the bad ground onely is said to <hi>ioy</hi> in it as in a nouelty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly note, in respect of Gods children; namely, when men loue them onely so farre, as may serue their <note place="margin">4</note> owne turne, for some by-respect or other.</p>
                  <p>Rules to know our loue to be restraining grace, not renewing.</p>
                  <p>First, euery reuerence of a good man or child of God <note place="margin">Vnfailing marks of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue.</note> is not loue. <hi>Herod</hi> neuer loued <hi>Iohn,</hi> but reuerenced him; for he saw that in him, which strucke him, that to haue spoken against him, had been to barke against the Sunne. God will haue the innocency and grace of his children to be iustified by his enemies, and theirs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, one or more good men may be fauoured of those, that loue no good man. Why did <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> fauour <hi>Ieremie?</hi> because he loued good men? No, but because he had foretold the victorie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euery good speech in defence of good men, is not a fruit of loue in the speaker. <hi>Pilat</hi> loued not Christ, but yet seeing his innocency, asked what euill hee had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18743:42"/>
done, washed his hands, and was willing to deliuer him. Some good words are drawne out of the desert of good men, not out of the speakers affection. Some out of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, not out of loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when men force a friendship, and will speake well, when inwardly they enuie the meate they eate, and the clothes they weare.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that is no loue of good men, which is not a loue of their goodnesse. Oh, such a man were a good man, but he is too strict; I could loue him, if he were not so plaine with me, if hee would let mine eyes alone, and not meddle with my lusts: he were a sufficient man, if he were a little wiser: what need he lose his friends? thus subtle are men to disclaime goodnesse, vnder pretence of louing good men.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thou canst not loue goodnesse in one, vnlesse thou doest loue it in euery one; hee that scorneth and disgraceth by wicked termes, the persons of most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, loues not indeed the goodnesse of any one, let his pretence bee what it will. The loue of the Spirit is from Christ in God, and for God.</p>
                  <p>First, to let many poore ignorant soules see their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> they say, they are not book-learned, and know not so much, nor can speak much as other men can: but they meane well, and haue good hearts to God: but is not this to iustifie a heart full of deceite? Oh, but I see no such thing in my selfe. No matter; that is thy deceit, who art so bewitched with an enemy, who while hee laughes in thy face, priuily stabs thee, and wounds thee to death. No, no, thou art neuer right, till thou beest at warre with thy owne heart, and till thou canst say, and see that thou carriest the greatest enemy thou hast in thy bosome; a deceitfull heart is at bed and boord with thee, lyeth downe, and riseth vp, walkes abroad, and staies at home with thee. And as it is the most enemie to thee, so must thou be to it. <hi>Paul</hi> was neuer right, till he found this rebel in himselfe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18743:43"/>
and that many yeeres after his conuersion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, knowing that the spirit is so guilefull, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> the heart so deceitfull, suspect it in euery thing, watch it the better; deale with it as with an vntrusty fellow, in whom thou hast found some notable trickes of deceit; worke out thy saluation with feare and trembling: Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man that feareth alwaies.</p>
                  <p>Say not with thy selfe, I see not this sinne in my selfe; therefore it is not: or, I see not wherein I haue failed in this or that; for all that, thou mayest, seeing the heart is deceitfull aboue all things: and who can see it? carry an holy ielousie of thy selfe, and suspect thy selfe, as <hi>Iob</hi> did his sonnes; It may be, my sonnes, my selfe haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; offer sacrifice, or rather, apply Christ to thy soule for thy failing in the best actions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, seeing the hart is thus deceitful, it teacheth vs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 3.</note> not to insult ouer others in their falles, seeing our owne hearts may play false with vs. Let no man say, that he wil neuer doe this and this, as he seeth others do, but suspect his heart, lest it carry him to worse things then they. <hi>Peter</hi> said, he would rather die, then deny his Master: but the deceitfulnesse of his heart would not let him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his purpose, which deceit he knew not before; for then he would not haue taken it so ill, when Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him of it. <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue thought scorne the day before his fall, that any should haue told him, that he should lie wallowing in so foule sinnes, as he did the day after. <hi>Hazael</hi> was farre from the sight of that guile which lay hid in his owne spirit, when being told by the Prophet, what monstrous wickednesse should bee done by him; he asked, <hi>Am I a dogges head, that I should doe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>this?</hi> Let vs therfore make this vse of other mens weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, Oh, if such haue so dangerously fallen, in whose hearts I neuer saw such foule things, as I see in mine owne, why should I be high-minded, and not rather feare? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18743:43"/>
Fourthly, labour for a sincere heart void of guile. Here consider three things: First, the notes or markes of it: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> secondly, the benefit of it: thirdly, reasons to labour for it. First, the notes.</p>
                  <p>First, in duties: It hath an vpright endeuour, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <note place="margin">1. Notes of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart.</note> desire to approue it selfe to God in all things; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a guilefull heart lookes more at men in good duties, then at God, more at mens commandements, then Gods, at mens approbation, more then Gods. <hi>Wee seeke not to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>pleasemen,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, but God who seeth the heart:</hi> We care not to bee iudged by men, but stand or fall to our owne Lord; whereas <hi>Saul</hi> knowing himselfe in disgrace with God, would haue <hi>Samuel</hi> to honour him before the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of sinne: A sincere heart hateth <hi>all</hi> sinne wheresoeuer, euen small and secret; especially it <note place="margin">2.</note> is more seuere against his owne lusts then any other, he hates his sinnes <hi>past,</hi> and bewaileth them, his <hi>present</hi> sins to break them off, he hates that he doth, he hates sinnes <hi>to come,</hi> to preuent them, and watch against them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a guilefull heart can hate euen motes in his brothers eye, but not his owne beames; auoides open sinnes, not secret; smaller hee makes small account of, if hee can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide greater, which make greater noise, and bring greater shame. This man can reioyce in memorie of sin past, and bragge of it as a mad pranke, which should be as a dagger to his heart: whereas <hi>Dauids</hi> heart smote him for cutting off <hi>Sauls</hi> lap, and as soone as he had numbred the people: and <hi>Peters,</hi> as soone as he had deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ. This man can reioyce in conceit of a future sinne, whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> and the Saints vow and sweare to keepe the commandements. He hath his present darting sinnes, which hee will continue in, and not let goe, let God and man say what they will.</p>
                  <p>But is no heart sincere, but that which is without <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> sinne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:18743:44"/>
It is not the committing of one sinne, or presence of more, that makes an euill heart (for then none should be <note place="margin">Answ.</note> vpright:) but the habite and custome of sinning: and this is, when, first in his <hi>vnderstanding</hi> he is wise to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but knowes not to doe well: Secondly, when he still <hi>wills</hi> that which is euill: Thirdly, when his <hi>affections</hi> still mooue vnto it: Fourthly, when he <hi>walkes</hi> in euill, as a seruant of sinne, at the command of it. So is it not with the godly, with whom power is often wanting, but to will, desire and endeuour is present.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a sincere heart professeth religion for it selfe, and delighteth in good men and good things, as the <note place="margin">3</note> Word, Sacraments, and godly company, because they are so, and because they see some part of Gods image in them. Whereas a guilefull heart, not hauing denied it selfe, professeth for by respects and worldly causes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted vnto, not called out of the world; it loueth good men, not for their goodnesse, but for the respect they haue in the world, or some other occasion respecting themselues.</p>
                  <p>If then thou wouldest know, whether thou hast a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart or no; first, obserue thy actions both in their nature and ende: first, in their nature, if they be single <note place="margin">1</note> and pure, so is thy heart: as is the fountaine and the root, such are the streames and the fruit. Secondly, in their end: an honest heart euer aimes at Gods glory direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas a guilefull heart euer propoundeth bad ends of good actions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obserue whether thou makest conscience secretly of all sinne, yea most seriously of those, to which <note place="margin">2</note> thou art most inclined, whether thou hast condemned thy selfe in dust and ashes, whether thou hast resisted and preuailed, or else liest still vnder the power of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider whether thou daily renuest thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of not sinning against God, as thou renewest thy <note place="margin">3</note>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:18743:44"/>
daies, and whether thou watchest ouer thine owne hart with an holy suspition, and wilt for Gods will breake thine owne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, marke whether thou louest God in his image, ordinances and children, euen then when the <note place="margin">4</note> world scornes and hates all these: here is a good note indeed of a sincere heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>benefits</hi> of it. First, this sincere heart <note place="margin">1 Benefits of sinceritie.</note> brings the person into acceptance with God: for whom doth he approue, but such as walke before him vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>Abraham, Noah, Enoch, Zacharie, Iob,</hi> and these are his delight: <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. 20. Secondly, whatsoeuer worke <note place="margin">2</note> hath such a ground, is acceptable, yea, and called perfect in the Scripture. And indeed sinceritie is all our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: sincere persons are called perfect in the way: <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. 1. All true worship must be done in spirit and truth: <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24. as,</p>
                  <p>First, prayer must be a lifting vp of the heart, and a powring out of the soule. If I regard wickednesse in my heart, God will not heare me. Prayer proceeding from fained lippes, is abominable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we come to heare the Word, our hearts must not goe after couetousnesse: <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if wee come to receiue the Sacraments, wee must haue speciall eie to our hearts: for what was <hi>Iudas</hi> the better to sit downe with Christ at the Passeouer, when his heart was on his money?</p>
                  <p>And if the inside be not cleane, but the heart bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, all actions and words must be sutable. Hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the graces we haue, must proceed from a pure heart, or else are not accepted. Faith must be <hi>vnfained,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. wisedome without <hi>dissimulation, Iam.</hi> 5. 17. loue <hi>vnfained</hi> in deed and truth: 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. repentance an <hi>vnfained rending</hi> of the heart, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. else all our labour is lost.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the promises of God are made hereunto. <note place="margin">3</note>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:18743:45"/>
Of protection: <hi>He is a shield to all them that walke vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Prou.</hi> 2. 7. Of direction: <hi>The vprightnesse of the iust shall guide them: Prou.</hi> 11. 3. Of deliuerance from euill, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. <hi>The righteousnesse of the iust shall deliuer him.</hi> Of supply of good: <hi>He will giue grace and glory, and no good thing shall bee wanting to them that walke vprightly: Psalm.</hi> 84. Of peace and ioy of conscience: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>This is our reioycing, &amp;c.</hi> Of perseuerance: <hi>Colours and shewes cannot bee stable, but they that are in and of the Church, shall abide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, reasons to labour for a sincere heart. <note place="margin">Motiues to sinceritie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Gods commandement, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17. <hi>Walke before me, and be thou vpright. Psalm.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Behold, thou louest</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>truth in the inward affections.</hi> Conformity of manners must goe with reformation of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a part of Gods image, who is most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <note place="margin">2.</note> and true; and the beautie of the Church, is to be all glorious within: herein she is conformable to her head, in whose mouth was found no guile, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. Euery sonne of the Church must be a <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> in whom is no guile: <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 47. and a true Israelite, euen pure of hart: <hi>Psalme</hi> 73. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our text affoords a sound reason, in that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of heart is ioyned with forgiuenesse of sinnes, <note place="margin">3.</note> and is a forerunner to blessednesse, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 1. <hi>Blessed are the perfect in the way.</hi> It is a fruit and marke of faith. Sinceritie is a vaile to couer all sinne; because of this, God couers and cures all our iniquities, as 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15. 14 <hi>They put not downe the high places,</hi> (which was a great sin) <hi>neuerthelesse, Asa's heart was vpright with the Lord all his daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if wee would be distinguished from hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, we must labour for sinceritie; wicked ones may <note place="margin">4.</note> outwardly straine beyond vs, make faire shewes, and haue a kind of faith and ioy, &amp;c. but we must outstrippe them all in sinceritie of heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:18743:45"/>
Fifthly, if we would haue our duties comfortable to our selues and profitable, when men obiect them vnto <note place="margin">5</note> vs, and wee meete with but small comfort in the world because of them, let vs labour to become true Israelites: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Dauid</hi> was mocked for dancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke, but his vprightnesse bore him vp. <hi>Iob</hi> had no comfort in his troubles, but onely his sinceritie: <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I die, I will neuer take away mine innocencie from my selfe, Iob</hi> 27. 5. This also was the onely stay to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the day of his straitenesse.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, God hath appointed a day to try thy heart, <note place="margin">6</note> and the soundnesse thereof, to turne out all the windings of it, and hee abhorres the double heart, that turnes it selfe vpon deceitfulnesse, as a doore vpon hinges; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke to the singlenesse of it before-hand.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, and lastly, onely they that walke vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">7</note> are Citizens of heauen, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 15. 2. but as for the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, he shall not come, or not stand before God, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 16.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if thou hast thy heart at some command, yet <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note> giue it not scope, but keepe it still aboue all keeping, fense and hedge it about, or else it will deceiue thee. Take heed lest there bee in any of you an euill heart of vnbeliefe, and so you be deceiued through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne. Aboue all custodies keepe thy heart; watch it in all things: neuer aske the question, which <hi>Dauid</hi> did concerning the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 11. <hi>Will they deliuer vs?</hi> for assuredly our hearts will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs.</p>
                  <p>Motiues to the diligent custodie of our hearts: First, <note place="margin">1 Motiues to a diligent custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the heart.</note> How easily doth a little yeelding ouer-carry vs to great sinnes? giue the heart an inch, and it will take an ell; a false heart askes but a little at first and seemes modest, but it is to draw on to greater. Wee haue seene a little sore as bigge as a penny grow to a gangrene, which eates vp the whole body; and a little sinne suffered, is a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18743:46"/>
gangrene that takes one part after another, till the whole soule be eaten vp. What mischiefs haue we heard of by a little sparke? What sowrenesse in the whole lumpe by a little Leauen? Open a sluce, and the waters runne amaine, as the waters from vnder the Sanctuarie, from the ankles to the knees, and so to the loynes, and then it becomes a great streame; and surely the prouerbe is true for the most part in sinne, Ouer Shooes, Ouer Bootes.</p>
                  <p>The enemie cares for no more then one breach, or one gate open to enter at: this is as good as if all the walls were cast downe; enemies be easier kept out then thrust out. And the reason is, because God often punisheth small sinnes with greater, as <hi>Peter,</hi> hauing once denyed his Lord, could not stay himselfe from a second and third denyall: a iust correction of his want of watching at the first: Therefore, beware of the conception of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as want of watch brings small sinnes to <note place="margin">2.</note> great ones, so it brings great grace often to a small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, yea to nothing: If men remit of their heat a little, they come from zeale to luke-warmenesse, from that to coldnesse, and so to be frozen in sinne. How many, who falling backe from their first loue and beginnings, haue remitted the performance of religious duties, in former times seene in profession, and in godly practices, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proued: first, weary: secondly, idle: thirdly, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: and now are openly prophane, and thus haue made shipwracke of their soules? And what matter, whether the ship bee cast away at once by violent tempests, or drowned by drops and degrees?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how slily can the heart vnwatched, contriue <note place="margin">3.</note> and carry away sinnes of high nature, and like the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot that thinkes none saw her, wipe the mouth, and it was not shee? Why may it not doe a little euill, that great good may come of it? Some can goe to Masse, and doe as others doe, communicate in all the idolatrie
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18743:46"/>
of it, to learne to loath it, and laugh at it. Some can run to Playes, to see filthy vices acted, to hate them the more, and as though it were so, some can giue way to such Varlets to make collections, that grudge the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for Sermons. But doe you not thinke now that the false heart hath chosen her selfe good Schoole-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? For who euer heard, that chastitie was learned in the Stewes, or honestie at Playes? He is a mad man, that can no other way trie the heat of fire, then by leaping into it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, consider the greatnesse of deceit within, <note place="margin">4.</note> the snares without, and the effects of being taken by them, and the hardnesse to recouer the heart once let loose. All this will inforce the doctrine strongly.</p>
                  <p>First, the deceit within is wonderfull, seeing the whole frame is euill, the vnderstanding, conscience, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, will and affections; our Temples by the fall are become a stable, yea all euill dwells in the soule, a vast Chaos and confusion, inclinable to most odious and lothsome sinnes, whensoeuer Satan shall mooue vs, who by his interest in our flesh, and our acquaintance with sinne from the beginning, is seldome disappointed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the suares without are euery where: All places are full, the Street, the House, the Boord, the Bed, the Closet, the Church and Pulpit: All duties are full, as Prayer, Almes, Feasting, Fasting: All actions, Eating, Drinking, Trading and Sporting; so as no watch can be sufficient.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the effects of being taken, as shame, griefe, wounds of conscience, broken bones, sharpe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are to follow, torment of Soule, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out serious repentance) of Soule and Body in Hell: this is the sowre sauce appointed for such sweet meate.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, once let the bridle of watchfulnesse goe, the heart will runne away like a wilde Horse, and a long time ere thou canst catch it againe, and bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18743:47"/>
temper and tune for so good seruice againe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the heart must bee still kept, that the whole course may giue comfort: for the heart of the wicked <note place="margin">5.</note> may be vpright in some particular action, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> in taking <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20. 6. but it is not the ayme of our liues; but the godly, howsoeuer in some particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they may shew deceit, yet their comfort is, that the mayne course and carriage of their liues is vpright, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was vpright in all things, saue only in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Vriah;</hi> generall guile possessed him not, but in one particular action.</p>
                  <p>But by what meanes shall I thus keepe my heart? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, often heare and reade the Word, the sincere <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Milke, in it selfe, and in the effect: <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. The Word <note place="margin">Meanes of keeping the heart in good order.</note> is liuely, a discerner of the thoughts, it makes a man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with himselfe, and grow vp in sincerity: it is the hearts glasse: by it as by the Lords Heifer wee shal know the riddles and deeps of our hearts, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 <hi>Pauls</hi> idiot seeing the thoughts of his heart reuealed, falls downe, and saith, God is in you. The Word of God, first, yeelds thee light, it is as a light in a candle-sticke; nothing is hid, which before it is not reuealed. Secondly, it humbles the heart: no gold can bee rid of drosse, till it be molten and dissolued; crooked things are made right by wresting and wringing: so the Word brings the heart to vprightnesse by bowing and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Thirdly, it purifies the heart, by working, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, and increasing Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, set thy selfe often before God, and him at thy right hand, whose eyes see the hearts and secrets of men, to shew himselfe strong with the vpright. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Abraham</hi> if he would be vpright, must first walke with God: <hi>Moses</hi> saw him that was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. And indeed hypocrisie riseth from secret Atheisme: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> tempted God in their hypocrisie; and impossible it is for a man to speake and doe in Gods presence, and not sincerely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:18743:47"/>
Thirdly, set before thee often the last Iudgement, in which all things and persons shall appeare naked, and be not as they seeme, but seeme as they are: thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est collude with men, but Gods pure eyes cannot bee deceiued: see <hi>Pauls</hi> example, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. So thinke of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-recknings, and how narrowly things shall be look't too, and what a hard man the Master is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, call thy selfe often to examination, trie thy heart and reines, to see thy guile cleerer, to bewaile and striue against it. Trie thy workes of obedience, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue thy comfort and peace in them; obserue how thou art affected, when thou takest thy selfe tardy in them. Say to thy selfe, Oh my worke must be cleane, though it be not fine, it may not be blurr'd with hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>Take account of thy selfe Morning and Euening, bee seuere in examining it, keep an audit in thy conscience, summon thy senses, looke to the windowes, let not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceit by them, or if thou hast, thrust it out and looke better, and the rather because of the vntrustinesse of thy heart: he that is trustie, needes seldomer to bee reckoned with: and therefore <hi>Iosiah,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 7. gaue charge that no reckoning should be taken of them that had the money; for they dealt faithfully: but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustie Pilferer, or a slippery <hi>Gehazi,</hi> such as our heart is, had need be reckoned with euery day.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, marke the wayes, and frequent the company of the Godly and vpright; these will neither flatter thee in thy corruptions, nor suffer them vpon thee, if thou wilt take vp either their Precepts or Example. This <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> knew was a good helpe to keepe himselfe vpright. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 79, 80. <hi>Let such as feare thee, turne vnto me and such as know thy testimonies. Let my heart be vpright in thy statutes, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 101. 6, 7. <hi>Mine eyes shall be on the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: he that walkes in the perfect way shall cleaue to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, deale with thy heart as with a slippery man, whom thou darest not to trust: take bonds on him; so
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18743:48"/>
here binde it by vowes and promises, cause it to enter couenant with God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 106. <hi>I haue sworne, and will performe to keepe thy statutes.</hi> Register these bonds, reuiew them, At such a time, on such an occasion of sicknesse I promised thus and thus, Oh false heart, how hast thou forgotten thy vow?</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, being to deale with so vnconstant a thing as the heart is, doe as with an vnconstant man: we take him when we find him in a good veine, and lay hold on the opportunitie; for let him goe an houre, he will be of another minde: so with thy variable heart, when it is warme with any good motion, let it not slip; when thy heart is prepared to prayer, sorrow, reading, let not the opportunitie die, but as <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 57. 7. <hi>O Lord, my heart is prepared, I will arise and giue thankes:</hi> if the Spirit be quenched, he will be grieued.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, pray often that God would open thine eyes to see thy hidden corruptions, and anoint them with eye-salue, that thou mayest discerne thy sinnes, euen when thy deceitfull heart hath apparelled them with the cloke of vertues. Pray with DAVID, <hi>Lord renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> In one word to perswade to these pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, Consider how we are troubled to be called hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; but what else doth the Lord but call the best of vs so, when hee saith, the heart is deceitfull aboue all things?</p>
                  <p>Againe, what an indigne thing is it for a man to bee beguiled of himselfe? Men cannot abide to be deceiued of others, yet most are deceiuers of themselues, and that in a thing which should bee so familiar vnto them. Is it not a shame to bee deceiued in the knowledge of himselfe, and his owne estate? In a matter of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the saluation of his owne foule? What maruel, if Satan and all other deceiue those, who are so willing to deceiue themselues?</p>

Christian duety of Faith, Loue, Obedience, Humility, Patience, &amp;c. but he may shew his measure and degree of it in his owne life and conuersation. Thou being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted strengthen thy brethren. Thus euery priuate Christian shall be a Teacher in his place, and able to strengthen others, and say: I haue preuailed with God by humility and silence, and so shall you: I haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against my sinnes by humble prayer and confession, so shall you: I haue obtayned comfort in distresse by these and these meanes, and so shall you: I preserue my peace with God by such and such courses, as himselfe hath appointed, and so in time shall you. Thus must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Christian by wise obseruation and application of Gods Word and Workes to himselfe, shew himselfe an example and copie of the rules of Christian life: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families to them that are about them, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their children; Christ came from heauen to be an example of meekenesse and lowlinesse; <hi>Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly, and yee shall finde peace to your soules.</hi> God himselfe teacheth men by his owne example, to rest on the Sabbath as he did, to be holy as himselfe is holy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Farre are they from this, that make themselues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of scoffing the Word and Professors; examples in lying, swearing, drinking, oppressing; examples in Sabbath-breaking, gaming, whoring, and the like: whom we leaue as hopelesse, to the Lords rebuke, who will take them at the rebound, and make them examples of his plagues, to as many as they haue beene examples in sinne, euen to Men and Angels. Are these the fruits of so long hearing, of praying, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Church? Are these the lessons thou learnest? Is this the returne of thy prayer? Take vp betime with thy selfe, lest God be inforced not to take vp with his displeasure against thee.</p>

               <p>First, for the cause, <hi>While I kept close my sinne,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> while I dissembled it and confessed it not. Whence note, <note place="margin">A godly heart cares not to shame it selfe, so as God may be glorified.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, the disposition of a godly mans heart, hee cares not to shame himselfe to all the World, so God may be glorified. <hi>Dauid</hi> publisheth to all the world his sinne and shame, his hiding of sinne, and his guile of heart. Why doth he thus forget himselfe and his fame? He was a King, had glory, wealth, and honor. Oh, but he was a Christian, hee had piety and holinesse in his heart; where he can glorifie God, he will abase himselfe; if he can edifie others, he will cast downe himselfe. The like we see he did in the 51. <hi>Psalme,</hi> and many other places. The like did <hi>Moses, Daniel,</hi> and other holy Pen-men of Scripture set downe their owne sinnes and shame; so <hi>Paul,</hi> I was a <hi>Persecutor,</hi> an <hi>Oppressor,</hi> a <hi>Blasphemer;</hi> who could say more against him then himselfe did?</p>
               <p>But meaner men then Kings are ashamed to be known of any sinne, and flatter themselues, Because they are great, therefore scarce men: but <hi>Dauid</hi> though a King, who had carryed his sinne so secretly as none knew it, none could compell him, yet is willing for God and his Church, and a good conscience to shame himselfe: And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18743:50"/>
teacheth vs thereby, that euen the greatest, though they might without being detected conceale their sinnes, yet in some cases must confesse them; and that they should more tender the quiet of their consciences, then all the honor of the world, more respect Gods glory then their owne.</p>
               <p>Cases of open confession are these: First, in case of publike offence: so <hi>Achan</hi> confessed and gaue glory to God. Secondly, when knowing our owne sinnes and Gods mercy, we confesse them, to comfort others: so <hi>Paul</hi> relates of his persecution, blasphemy. Thirdly, to witnesse our sound and thorow turning to God, we must not be in some case loth to acknowledge our faults in the face of all the World.</p>
               <p>Many are franke often-times in complayning of themselues, and acknowledging of their corruptions; but farre short of this holy man: for it proceedeth not of hatred of sinne, but often from boasting; or, It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from iust ground or settled iudgement, but from too light an opinion, that our selues are sinners: or, It often goeth with lesning or excusing the sin or ones selfe, and not with exaggerating of his sinne (as here) to the sound breaking of his heart: or, It hath not Gods glory, and good of the Church for its end, but a mans owne glory: for many vpon slight occasion will confesse their faults, that themselues may bee better thought of for it, and to conciliate a good opinion of themselues. Therefore in thy confession to others take these rules with thee; See the ground, affection, the manner and ends be good and iust; else thy heart is not eased, but burdened the more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may hence note, that a guilefull secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Guilefull se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity may cast a godly heart on a slumber, till God awaken it</p>
                  </note> may hold the conscience of a conuerted person in a slumber of soule, so as hee shall be hindred from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, till God by some forcible affliction waken him: This wee may see in <hi>Dauid</hi> here: So <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18743:50"/>
held a long time the sinne of selling their brother, till the affliction wakened them; before which time they could tell their Father and their Brother, <hi>Wee are twelue brethren and one is not, and, One is dead;</hi> as if they had not sold him. <hi>Ionah</hi> sleepes vnder the hatches, though the stormes rise, the waues beate, and the ship be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the goods lost; till God by the Mariners bid him, <hi>Vp sleeper,</hi> and the lot finde him out. So Professors often leaue their first works, and slack their first loue, till God come against them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A reason hereof is: First, ignorance and blindnesse in <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> the best, which suffers them not to see sinne in the nature <note place="margin">1.</note> and degree of it: onely light discouers darkenesse, and therefore being light but in part, euen the best cannot but faile in finding out their owne sinnes. Secondly, a <note place="margin">2.</note> kinde of hypocrisie, and guile in the heart of the best, which <hi>Dauid</hi> here acknowledgeth: for the best would often seeme better then they are, and would rather bee sinners then so reputed. Thirdly, an affection to sinne through an old acquaintance with it: for euery mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">3.</note> so farre as it is vnregenerate, is in loue with sinne: <hi>Iob</hi> calls it (20, 12.) a sweet morsell, which the wicked hold vnder their tongue and will not let goe: And the regenerate themselues part with sinne indeede, but (as our Sauiour implieth) as from their eies and right hands. Fourthly, because of the effect of it: for sinne discouered <note place="margin">4. <hi>Pudor conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis.</hi>
                  </note> brings shame. <hi>What fruit had yee of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> And to auoid this shame, men would hide their sinne, which is a filthinesse and a nakednesse. Fifthly, a security and negligence in the heart: men are loth to dig so deepe, to search narrowly their hearts to <note place="margin">5.</note> finde out sinne, a tedious worke it is of mortification, and so are loth to trouble their sinne or themselues. Sixtly, and lastly, because the nature of sinne (to which <note place="margin">6.</note> the best giue way) is, to dead the heart, to quench the Spirit, and to extinguish his graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:18743:51"/>
And therefore, first, beleeuers must not flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but bee still awaking themselues to seeke after <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> God; we must enter into our hearts, and consider our waies; we will keepe reckoning what we runne on the score with men: but rare are they which thinke how deepe they are in Gods bookes, such bad husbands are we for our soules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee should vse meanes against this guile, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> which preuailes against the best: first, the counsels of the Word must not be neglected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the motions of the Spirit must be entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cherished: for that is a monitor in the eare, and sets before vs the way and our aberrations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the checkes and prickes of conscience, which attended vnto, would often awake vs, and saith, <hi>Thou art</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the man,</hi> This and that <hi>sinne lies at the doore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must not bid adieu to the remembrance of sinnes past and pardoned, but euer beare them in minde so farre, as to work out godly sorrow, holy bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and lowlinesse of minde; and so farre as may be a spurre to more fruitfull obedience for time to come. Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> though his sinne was forgiuen him as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> told him at first, yet euer remembred and set before him his murther and adulterie. Thus <hi>Israel</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the desire of a King to be their sinne. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remembred his blasphemy and persecuting.</p>
               <p>For this, let vs be often opening and looking on our wounds, seeing the neglect of them, and hiding of them is lewd carelesnesse, and mortally dangerous. It is no newes, that a souldier is shot or wounded: but to see him goe with it, neuer regard nor dresse it, is a forelorne negligence, and condemned as a desperate folly: so for vs fighting in this world, to come by knockes and maimes is no maruell; but to hide them, and let them goe and ranckle and fester, not complaining of them, not vncouering them to the Surgeon &amp; Phisicion of soules,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18743:51"/>
is spirituall frensie and madnesse. See we not, that our soules in their swaruing from God, are like bones beside the ioynt? the longer they go, they prooue more paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; therefore take them betimes, they are set more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, note, in that <hi>Dauid</hi> is said to bee silent, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrin.</hi> 3.</note> not confesse his sinnes of murther and adultery, almost <note place="margin">Gods child may hold some outward parts of godlinesse, and yet not see and confesse his sinnes for a time.</note> of an whole yeere, that a man, euen Gods child, may hold some outward parts of godlinesse, and yet for a time by a slumber of conscience lie silent, and not indeed come to see and confesse sinnes. All this yeere <hi>Dauid</hi> came to the Temple, there prayed and praised God, and confessed sinnes, he laid not aside all his family-duties: but out of doubt performed some or the most of them, yet he confesseth he was silent; for while a man lies in sinne, his prayer is as no prayer; his confession is no confession: first, his prayer is not accepted before God: <hi>Psalme.</hi> 66. 18. <hi>If I regard wickednesse in my heart, the Lord will not heare my prayer.</hi> Secondly, the Sacraments doe him no more good, then they did <hi>Iudas.</hi> Thirdly, Gods word, because it is not mingled with faith, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; it is as pure liquor, put into a fustie vessell: and lastly, sinne separateth betweene God and him: <hi>Isai.</hi> 59. 2.</p>
               <p>Thou commest to heare the Word, to pray, to keepe <note place="margin">Use.</note> the Sabbath in the publike seruice of it, and thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou hast done a great matter: but if thou commest with an impenitent heart, a sleepie and slumbring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, thy prayer and confession is all silence, God heares nothing; if thou speakest to God, speake with thy heart, else he heareth thee not.</p>
               <p>Thinke we not, that <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren held on a forme of Religion, while their sinne troubled them not for so many yeeres? and what was all their prayers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions all that while but silence? and so many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who fall from many goodly beginnings, will take
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18743:52"/>
such order, that they will keepe so much religion, as they may bee thought to haue some feare of God in them, but either couetousnesse, or some other sinne holds them, which they repent not of, as hindreth for the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeking of reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p>Many also goe on in a forme of Religion, confesse their sinnes in the Church, and ioyne in other good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises in priuate, yet in some one sinne their conscience slumbereth: and though they bee not altogether hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and without all touch of feare, or desire of fauour, yet are they very coldly mooued to confesse sinne, or seeke peace; they go slumbring on, and weare out much time without comfort of their duties, and are loth to be stirred, till God take them in hand, and iudge them for not iudging themselues, and force them by violence to that, which it had been more for their ease voluntarily to haue vndertaken.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the effect of hiding sinne, which is trouble both inward and outward, euen in Gods owne children.</p>
               <p>But here first note what is the ende of afflictions in <note place="margin">Note.</note> them, to wit, not the punishment of their sinnes, which <note place="margin">The end of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions is to shake the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of their securitie.</note> are all remitted by one satisfaction of Christ: but to shake them out of their sleepe of securitie, and to draw them out of the thickets, in which they would willingly lie hid.</p>
               <p>Yea, but they be fruits of sinne, and part of the curse <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> of sinne.</p>
               <p>In themselues indeed they be the fruits and effects of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> sinne, but now their nature is altered, and of curses, by Christ are changed into crosses; the Lord, who bringeth light out of darknesse, brings this good out of them, that they helpe forward the repentance, mortification, and conuersion of sinners vnto God: <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 17. <hi>It is good for mee that I was afflicted, that I might learne thy statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:18743:52"/>
Now <hi>good</hi> is diuers: first, naturall: secondly, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: thirdly, morall: fourthly, sensible: fifthly, by euent or accident.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>naturall</hi> is that, which is infused into euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the creation; their nature, vse, quantities, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all are good; so are not afflictions in their nature, being the punishment of sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>morall</hi> good is whatsoeuer is agreeable to the morall law; so are not afflictions, they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the morall law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>spirituall,</hi> whatsoeuer appertaineth to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, as faith, hope, loue, &amp;c. thus be not afflictions good, spiritually.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, good to the <hi>sense</hi> is, whatsoeuer pleaseth the sense of man; so was apple good to the eye: thus <hi>no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is good and pleasant</hi> to the sense <hi>for the present: Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they are good by <hi>euent</hi> and by accident, <hi>partly,</hi> by Gods ouer-ruling prouidence, that can turne them to good; and <hi>partly</hi> by <hi>grace</hi> in the elect, who make a good vse of them.</p>
               <p>First, to say with the <hi>Papists,</hi> that the afflictions of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> godly are so many temporall punishments, and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for sinne, is</p>
               <p>First, to derogate from that onely satisfaction of Christ, and from the perfection of it. Secondly, to lessen the merit and desert of sinne, which is death eternall. Thirdly, to misse Gods end of afflicting his children, which is not to punish that, which is already punished in Christ, but to purge that, which still cleaueth vnto them, and hangeth fast on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when thou art any way distressed and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> especially in conscience, come backe to thine own sinne, say with thy selfe: Surely I haue either not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at all, or not fully of all; this is, because I <hi>haue held my peace,</hi> and haue not confessed my sinnes to God, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18743:53"/>
not forsaken them. For when afflictions haue done that for which they are sent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue opened the eare, and humbled the heart, as a messenger which hath done his errand, they depart, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 41. the Lord threatneth the Iewes, that because they haue walked stubburnely with him, he will walke stubburnely against them: but how long? till their vncircumcised hearts bee humbled, and they willingly beare the correction, praying for their sinne, then hee will remember his couenant: <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 14. <hi>The Lord speakes once or twice to a man,</hi> saith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> and if one say, <hi>I haue sinned and peruerted righteousnes, and it did not profit me,</hi> then he will deliuer his soule: here is a way for ease.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, willingly accept the prouocations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when they stirre to renue repentance, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> thy soule, or hardning thy selfe by continuing without reconciliation: Answere the summons of God, hold thy peace no longer; for this increaseth the rods, and tieth affliction fast vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this being a prerogatiue of Gods children, namely, that euill shall be turned to their good, as good <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> to euill to the wicked, be not dismaied in afflictions, but comfort thy selfe in the Lord thy God, and in this, that the present affliction tendeth vnto, and endeth in good, because it brings foorth the fruits of vnfeigned righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
               <p>Now the grieuousnesse of <hi>Dauids</hi> touch of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is set out, first, by the effects: secondly, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it.</p>

               <p>Thus <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. 8. hee would heare (that is, be by the Spirit perswaded) the voice of gladnesse, (that is, tidings of Gods fauour) that the bones which he had broken, might reioyce: that is, that the strength he had lost, might be recouered, and his paine, which was like the breaking of bones, might bee eased. <hi>Iob</hi> also complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that his griefe had drunke vp his spirit: and <hi>Psalm.</hi> 102. 3. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, that his bones were burnt like an herth, because of Gods displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And my moisture turned to the drought of summer.]</hi> That is, looke how the Sunne in Summer parcheth and drieth leaues and hearbs; so is my naturall moysture, (which should moysten and cherish my body) drawne out and dried vp by the parching heate of Gods displeasure. The like he complaineth, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>My strength is dried vp like a shell, or a potsherd,</hi> which is bak't in the fire; that is, There is no more moysture in me, then there is in a bak't potsherd; hee was almost resolued into dust al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Hence we may note, what a wonderfull torment, the <note place="margin">Doct.</note> torment of conscience is; no griefe in the world, is like to <note place="margin">No torment in the world like the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> the griefe of conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 4. <hi>The arrowes of the Lord sticke fast in me,</hi> saith the holy man: and, <hi>Oh that my griefe were well weighed! Hezekiah</hi> said, that <hi>the Lord dealt with him as a lyon, crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bones, Isa.</hi> 38. 13. And <hi>Prou.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>A wounded spirit,</hi> saith SALOMON, <hi>who can beare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:18743:54"/>
And what is the reason of all this?</p>
               <p>First, because here is a combate with God, and with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> his wrath hand to hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the body and spirit, and all is downe the winde: it might bee, that a good heart would beare <note place="margin">2.</note> out the body, but here the heart is quite deiected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we haue the experience of many, who haue sought the pangs of death, to auoid these pangs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> could find no ease but in a desperate death in hanging himselfe. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 9. 6. Such as wish to die, seeke death and cannot finde it: they follow it, but it flies from them; and all this in the paine of a despairing conscience. But here come three questions to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>First, How can it bee, that the wicked binde vpon themselues such heauy bundles of sinnes, and carry all so <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Why wicked men feele no such burthen of sinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, as the godly, of sinne pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> easily, whereas the godly finde such bitternesse in sinnes forgiuen? how comes it to passe, that the godly feele such sorrow in sinne pardoned, and the wicked feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in sinne vnpardoned?</p>
               <p>For these reasons: first, because now is the time of Gods patience and forbearance, of his bountifulnesse and long-suffering towards the vessels of wrath. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> now is the time of their reioycing: but when the daies of their banquetting are gone about, then shall come many heauy messengers to tell them of fearefull newes; there comes a day of wrath, when they shall reape as they sowed, and drinke the dreggs of Gods wrath to the bottome of the viall. They treasure vp sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with their sinne, and their griefe shall be full: That sinne that now sets no sorrow to their heart, shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be a worme euer gnawing, a fire neuer going out, a Riuer of brimstone kindled by the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and a perpetuall weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how comes the body to be troubled by the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2.</note> minde?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:18743:54"/>
First, by the strait vnion, and sympathie betweene the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> soule and the body vnited into one person: for while the <note place="margin">How the body commeth to be troubled by the mind.</note> soule is possessed with feare, sorrow, languishing, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and heauinesse, it is impossible, that the body can take any delight in the comforts of nature, but that sleep shall depart from it, or bee not so short as troublesome: the meate and drinke shall be tastelesse or lothsome, or mingled with teares: <hi>I forgot to eate my bread,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Psalm.</hi> 102. No comfort shall bee comfortable to him: for when the spirit, which should sustaine all a mans infirmities, failes him, what can sustaine him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the righteous iudgement of God, who correcteth together those who haue sinned together, <note place="margin">2.</note> and as they haue been vndiuided in sinne, so are they not diuided in the smart of it. The body hath been a seruant to the lusts of the soule, and so receiueth the wages of sin with it. <hi>Dauid</hi> abused the vigor, strength and health of his body in the sinnes of adultery and murther, and now the Lord chasteneth him in both.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how comes it to passe, that all the godly haue not this torment for sinne, that they are not thus struck <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. Why all the godly are not a little terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their sinnes.</note> with terror, nor so affected for sinne, as to haue their strength impaired, and their body dried?</p>
               <p>First, their persons are not alike, and therefore Gods dealing with them is not alike: some are more obscure in the world then other, and haue onely more secret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> some are more fitted by God to be speciall ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels for his glory, in whom he will shine to his whole Church, as <hi>Dauid, Hezekiah, &amp;c.</hi> and these he will spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially worke vpon, to make them patterns of his mercie, both in leading them in and out of trouble: for first, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he lets the world see, that great grace is ioyned with great corruption. Secondly, that the best haue matter of correction in them. Thirdly, that hee will not spare to rebuke sinne in those that are neerest and dearest vnto him. Fourthly, he will haue others to looke vpon them,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18743:55"/>
and Gods dealing with them, in their casting downe and raising vp.</p>
               <p>Secondly, according to the difference of sinnes, may be the difference of sorrow: many men of greater grace then others, haue fallen into greater sinnes then others, and their knowledge being more then others is, their apprehension of the sentence of the Law hath been dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and so of wrath due to their sinne. Besides, in some others, some speciall corruption which hath often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, or the constitution of body, may adde a sting to the sorrow of mind: some are naturally more fearefull, as melancholy constitutions, and so their impressions are deeper, and of longer continuance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although in ordinarie Christians, before sense of remission, there is a sufficient measure of labour, and wearinesse vnder the burthen of sinne, yet some of all kindes God will exempt from such depth of griefe, that he may shew himselfe free in all his working.</p>
               <p>O that men would hence come to feare the paines prepared for sinners! for if, first, a drop of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> let fall, secondly in loue, thirdly, on his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, fourthly, for a moment, doe so amaze them, and drinke vp their spirits, their soules and bodies; how much more shall the Ocean and deepe sea of Gods wrath against his enemies for all eternitie, consume and torture them in hell? Blind people of the world wil not know what hell meaneth, till they be in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs learn to haue compassion on such as are troubled in spirit, seeing such is their heauines, as presseth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> downe both soule and body; let vs apply our selues to comfort them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did here in his owne person and example. Many thinke this sicknesse to be but passion, conceit or melancholy, and because it changeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy often, they thinke it to arise from the body: but there is no disease like to this, for symptomes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: First, they all are naturall, this supernaturall. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Secondly,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18743:55"/>
they from the constitution of the body, this from the constitution of the soule. Thirdly, in them the humours first or imagination (as in Melancholy) are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered, in this the conscience first, and the humours after. Fourthly, they all may be cured by naturall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bringing the body to a temperature, all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall medicines vnder heauen cannot cure this sicknesse. Blessed is hee that iudgeth wisely of the poore: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the sicke conscience is mercy indeed. Christ had the tongue of the learned giuen him to speake a word of comfort to such weary soules, and was sent to bind vp the broken in heart; and not onely ministers, but euery Christian hath receiued of his anointing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that <hi>Dauids</hi> sicknesse of body was from <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> the sinne of his soule, learne that health is a special bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, seeing wee euer carry that about with vs which might change it: the first and most noysome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which breeds bodily diseases, is sinne the disease of the soule; and therefore if God change his hand, and bring weakenesse vpon our bodies, we must not fixe our eyes vpon second causes, not on abundance of peccant humours, but looke backe to our sinnes and life past, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how <hi>silent</hi> and impenitent we haue been, turne to God, bewaile and forsake sinne, resolue to vse our health better, and our strength for God, and not against him; and thus the sicknesse of our body shall turne to the soundnesse and health of the soule: else wofull is the state of that man, who being sicke both in soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is brought neere to the gates both of death and hell. And in our recouerie, let vs take vp that lesson of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, <hi>Goe and sinne no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if this touch of conscience be so great, then <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> must that conclusion be true, He must needs be a blessed man, whose sinnes are forgiuen, whose wounds of soule Christ hath taken vpon himselfe, by bearing properly the wrath of God for them vpon the Crosse. But alas,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18743:56"/>
who thankefully acknowledgeth and walketh worthy of the loue of his Lord, whose spirit was heauy to the death, that our spirits might bee lightened, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science was submitted to this heauy trouble, that wee might find peace of conscience in him; and whose-selfe was made an offering for sinne, that we might be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged from it?</p>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>In my roaring.]</head>
                  <p>AN argument of extreme paine, that made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vtter a feareful noise, like the roaring of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And by roaring is meant, bitter crying and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations through sense of paine, without further appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension: for as yet no further was this holy man come. Men vse to vent much sorrow by weeping and crying, and so <hi>Dauid</hi> made triall, if by this meanes hee could helpe himselfe to ease, but all in vaine; sorrow for sinne is not alway cast out with teares, the conscience of sin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned bites, whether thou criest, or art silent, and therefore thou must come to another remedie.</p>
                  <p>First, note. <hi>Dauid,</hi> while he lay slumbring in his sin, made a great noyse, but hee calls it roring rather then godly sorrowing, more like and fit for beasts, then for men.</p>
                  <p>Euery godly mans sorrow for sinne is not alwayes godly sorrow: and indeede, when men cry and lament <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> only in sense of paine, without further motion of Gods <note place="margin">Euery godly mans sorrow is not godly sorrow.</note> loue in the heart, or bending the Spirit to sue after God; or when the Spirit grieued with-draweth himselfe (as it is often in the godly, and here in <hi>Dauid:)</hi> it is rather a brutish noyse, common to men and beasts, then any voyce acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when sorrow is a fruit of impatience, or <note place="margin">2.</note> distrust, or ioyned with murmuring, or excesse, or any other sinfull quality (as some godly mens sorrow hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18743:56"/>
beene) it is no godly sorrow, let the obiect bee what it will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when sorrow, euen for sinne, brings neither <note place="margin">3.</note> glory to God, nor comfort to the heart, it is not godly sorrow; for that doth both; but here was a sorrow in <hi>Dauid,</hi> which did neither: for still he hid his sinne, and it was not yet accompanied with so much as confession of sinne, and much lesse with forsaking it; the matter of accusation was no whit abated.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that sorrow, which proceeds from the sight <note place="margin">4.</note> of sinne in generall, but not in the particular, cannot be godly sorrow: for thus the wickedst on earth will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse sinne, and semble sorrow for it. But this was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> sorrow; he was not so destitute of minde, or so past himselfe, as that he could not, or did not generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himselfe a sinner in this time, but seeking to hide his particular sinne, his sorrow was but roring.</p>
                  <p>This may, first, incite vs to examine our sorrow, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> it be godly sorrow or no, acceptable to God, and comfortable to our selues.</p>
                  <p>How shall I know whether my sorrow be godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> or no?</p>
                  <p>Know it by these rules: <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, godly sorrow hath a right obiect, which is God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 1.</note> himselfe offended, and here is a difference betweene the <note place="margin">Infallible rules to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne godly sorrow by.</note> sorrow and sense of the godly, and wicked, as in their sicknesse. The Lyon roares, and the beasts feare: it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of God; therefore the wicked feare and sorrow, because God is become their enemie. Plainly: it is Gods power or Gods iustice, which makes them feare and sorrow, before whom the Hills melt, and the Rocks breake asunder, and the Earth burneth before his eyes, and who can stand before his wrath? And their sorrow is for themselues, that they cannot make their part good against him in holding of their sinnes; selfe-loue is the moouer of their sorrow:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18743:57"/>
But the Church is sicke of loue; that is, there is in the godly heart a sense of Gods loue, and a motion towards God offended: In this heart, louing friendship with God, the griefe is, because by sinne it hath changed his loue into displeasure. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. The Spirit being powred on them, they shall mourne for him; that is, when the godly shall come to see what euills and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries their sinnes brought vpon Christ, and how odious their offences haue beene towards him (for it was not so much the Scribes, Priests, Romanes, and <hi>Iudas,</hi> that brought Christ to his death, as the sinnes of the Elect:) then shall they weepe for him. The Spirit of God euer directs men to God.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 6. The people of God are said in the day of their fast to draw water, namely, out of their hearts, and to powre it before the Lord; whereby is meant, that they wept bitterly for their offences against the Lord. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Against thee, against thee haue I sinned:</hi> hee needed not haue beene so much troubled for his sinne, either for shame (for it was not knowne but to God alone) or for punishment; for none could call him to account: but this wounded him, he had offended his mercifull God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>Ioseph,</hi> being tempted to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, said, <hi>How shall I doe this great wickednesse and sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God?</hi> the wrong, that he should haue done his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, was nothing in his eye to Gods offence: But <hi>Iudas</hi> sorrowed not for his Master, but for himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as God is the obiect of godly sorrow, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen God loued for himselfe, so God is the Author of it, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</note> working it in nature; whereas worldly sorrow is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, riseth from nature, and tendeth to the preseruation of nature, very little looking beyond: It lookes with <hi>Cain,</hi> more at punishment then at sinne; present distresse more affects it then Gods indignation: but this is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, a plant of God, and an impression of his finger.</p>
                  <p>How may I know that my sorrow is from God? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:18743:57"/>
When it is wrought in Gods meanes, and they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily <note place="margin">Answ.</note> three: First, his Word: <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>When they heard</hi> PETER <hi>say that, they were pricked in heart.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his Rod. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>I am the man that haue seene affliction in the rod of thy visitation:</hi> this is the hammer, that beates the Word home to the head. Marke, I say, his Rod; and to know it to bee his, besides the former we may take another note; that it makes all other rods easie and light, and swallowes vp carnall vexation, as <hi>Moses</hi> his Serpent did the Sorcerers: when men lay on with their rods of indignities and iniuries, it will not suffer impatience, reuenge, moodinesse, that men refuse their meat and drinke, and part from their sleepe; here is worldly sorrow; now a dramme of godly sorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling sinne, would weight downe a talent of this. Thirdly, Gods Spirit is another principall cause, by whom God worketh godly sorrow in his children; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the Spirit of mourning and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this makes both the Word and the Rod effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, and this Spirit may bee seene in godly sorrow, strengthning, comforting, quieting, and refreshing the heart with inward ioy and contentment, and bowing it to obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as godly sorrow comes from God, so it goes to God againe, and leads to God. The sorrow of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 3.</note> prodigall Sonne, after he came to himselfe, made him goe to his Father, with teares in his eyes, and repentance in his heart, and confession in his mouth; <hi>I will say to him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and against thee. Hos.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Surely in their afflictions they will seeke me dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</hi> Take heede of such sorrow for sinne as driues from God: if thy sorrow hinder reading, prayer, hearing, godly conference; yea, if it bring thee not on thy knees and further all these, though it bee for sinne, it is from the Deuill: for godly sorrow keepes God in sight still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:18743:58"/>
Fourthly, it is limited by God, it exceeds not the bounds of moderation; sorrow for sinne may not passe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 4.</note> measure: for Gods Word doth bound it for the measure, which it may not goe beyond: now it is vnbounded and passeth the limits, first, when it vnfitteth the body, or mind to good duties, or to a good and chearefull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing them: now God loues a chearefull giuer. He made the soule and body to helpe one another in his seruice; and as the body must not oppresse the soule by surfetting and drunkennesse, so the soule must not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the body by pining and ouerthrowing the state of it. Though wee must destroy the body of sinne, that is, the lusts of it; yet we must not destroy the body of the man; for that is murther, and the way to runne into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when it maketh vs forget consolation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Faint not, when thou art rebuked of the Lord.</hi> Griefe for sinne must not swallow vs vp, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. And the reason is, because that sorrow, which is not ioyned with some assurance of reconciliation, is sinfull and faithlesse; and where this is, there cannot but be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Hee speaketh vnto vs, as vnto chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when it exceeds in time, and wee suffer it to dwell with vs, and vpon vs; whereas if we sorrow for a night, we must expect ioy in the morning, and feare, if we finde it not, that it is more our owne impatiency and corruption, then any other iust cause; for faith in his worke still expecteth better, and hopeth still.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when it takes away all ioy from a Christian, euen while it is present, it is not godly sorrow. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Reioyce alwaies, and againe I say, reioyce.</hi> Why is the Apostle so earnest in doubling this precept, but because he saw this Christian reioycing so necessarie at all times, as without it no good duty can be done well, neither hearing, nor prayer, nor thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18743:58"/>
whereof it is the ground? and againe, because the godly, to whom the exhortation is directed, (for the wicked need not to be vrged to carnall ioy) are so beset with trials, that if they doe not still lift vp their dumpish hearts to the Lord, they cannot but be ouerwhelmed?</p>
                  <p>But this is strange, that wee must ioy euen in sorrow; <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> how can a man reioyce and sorrow at the same time?</p>
                  <p>Indeede carnall ioy and sorrow cannot stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Answ.</note> at the same time, but Christian ioy and sorrow can <note place="margin">Reasons why Christian ioy and sorrow may and must stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> and must: for first, suppose the sorrow be from without, in respect of those persecutions and afflictions that the godly are beset withall, euen herein they haue a signe of blessednesse, a cause of reioycing, and a commandement so to doe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sang in the prison, the Martyrs in the flames, and <hi>Iohn Baynam,</hi> as if hee had been in a bed of Roses when he was at the stake.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the cause be inward, from sinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which is the most iust cause, yet euen then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ioy may and must rellish a godly mans sorrow, in that by the pardon of sinne hee hath escaped the wrath to come. If a man for some heinous offence were ready to suffer the most exquisite torments that man could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, if his deare friend should come with a pardon, but that will not serue the turne, vnlesse hee put himselfe in his place, and indure all that torment for him, here is cause of reioycing, that he hath escaped the torment, but of sorrow, that by his wretchednesse his friend should be so tormented. So it is betweene Christ and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. Or as if a man condemned to perpetuall prison for debt, a suretie should bee content to sell his goods and lands to deliuer him; here is ioy for his deliuerance, but sorrow, that he should be such a banquerupt and waster, thus to vse his friend.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is there not cause of ioy euen in heauinesse, when the Christian heart can consider what a couenant and league of friendship he is entred into with the Lord?
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18743:59"/>
how sweete must his loue beé to him now being a friend, that so loued him when he was his enemy, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne to death for him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the curse of sinne?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, is there not cause of ioy to thinke, that now, though I am troubled with sinne, yet I haue the Spirit of Christ, to witnesse my adoption, and to seale vp to me my priuiledge, to be called his sonne, and to become co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heire with Iesus Christ? and in the meane time is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie way mindefull of my good; so free-hearted, that aske what I will, that is good for me, I shall haue it, his eare is open to heare my moane, to fulfill my desires; and is preparing that great glory, whereby I shall in due time be like the holy Angels, euer beholding the face of my heauenly Father?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, godly sorrow ends in God, it goes not away, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 5.</note> but with sense of Gods loue and fauour, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departs with ceasing of paine and change of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things. It is not the increase of corne, wine, or oile, that can content the hart, seased with godly sorrow, but onely when God lifteth vp the light of his countenance vpon it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the fruit of godly sorrow is repentance neuer <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 6.</note> to be repented of, that is, a new life vnchangeable, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to God not to returne againe to folly; whereas hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are purged, and forget they are purged, and so returne againe to folly.</p>
                  <p>By these notes try thy sorrow, whether it bee godly sorrow or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the sorrow of the godly for sinne be not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> alwaies godly sorrow, what shall we thinke of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans sorrow? How do the vngodly deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, thinking, that when they cry aloud in their paine, and can speake some good words, that it is repentance, and that God heares them? But it is as the roaring of cruell Lyons, such as <hi>Esau's,</hi> when hee lifted vp a loud
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18743:59"/>
voice, and wept in the losse of the blessing, but kept re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge in his hart, and could threaten his brothers death. <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 14. the Lord calles it the howling on their beds, as Dogs and Wolues vse to doe in the sense of paine, and threatens, that when they call, he will not heare: as if he should say, Let them semble neuer so much feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it is but as the roaring of beasts out of the tumult of heart. If this noise had a good rise or ground, it were well, the sorrow were deepe according to the greatnesse of the euill: but it is onely the violence of affliction, that mooues this vehemency of affections, sense of paine, not sense of sinne, affecting of deliuerance, not of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason, why this sorrow is so helpelesse, is, because it stirres not the heart out, to seeke for reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God in Christ, and then the greatest pleasure must be in withdrawing themselues so farre, as they can from God, as <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, could not endure the presence of God, but hid himselfe among the trees of the Garden. How can this sorrow end in ioy, which driues from the fountaine of ioy, and when as much comfort is taken in God, as a guilty felon taketh in the sight of the Iudge, who is to pronounce the sentence of death vpon him?</p>
                  <p>This is a heauie and comfortlesse sorrow, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of sorrows euerlasting; which yet many content themselues withall, as godly sorrow: but it brings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to bee repented of, and is a sorrow to be still sorrowed for; if there were no hell nor iudgement, a wicked man would neuer sorrow, his sinne hath no place in his sorrow, nor God offended.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is not the sorrow of godly men, alwaies godly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> sorrow, out of which they can reape ioy and comfort? how then can men reape any ioy out of carnall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meanes? as many, being troubled with these grudgings of conscience, get them to worldly comforts,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18743:60"/>
to thrust away the sight and memory of sinne; they get them into merry company, and suppose that by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, dancing, banketing, and gaming, they shall forget their griefe: but so doth he, that for a dropsie, drinkes a cup of cold water; he hath brewed his griefe, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his sorrow; his paine returnes, and he roares for it, and is worse then euer he was. And if euery sorrow for sinne ease not the sinner, then much lesse can the delight in sinne doe it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if euery sorrow for sinne will not remedie <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> the sinne, which is of all other the most likely meanes, then let any thing in the world bee applied to the griefe of conscience, besides the right remedie (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dauid</hi> findeth out) and it doth but inlarge the sorrow. <hi>Dauid</hi> had worne out much time in hiding his sinne, and had drawne all the couers hee could deuise, ouer his conscience: but all in vaine, his sinne returnes againe, and all his meanes are so farre from easing his griefe, that they increase it, and bring matter of roaring. So then, carry thy sinne in a cloud as long as thou canst, thy conscience will find it out and tell tales; then, finde out as many pretexts and couers as thou canst, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or diminish it, they are but figge-leaues, too short and thinne a couer.</p>
                  <p>Nay, couer all with an externall shew of Religion, and obseruance of outward worship, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did; yet the gash of thy sinne remaines as his did, it will at length bring such paine into thy soule, as will make thee roare, as though thy bones were broken. In one word, sinne cannot be couered, nor the conscience eased, but only by Christs righteousnesse obtained, and put on by faith and repentance, euery thing else increaseth matter of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and accusation.</p>
                  <p>So much of the effects of hiding sinne, in changing the body, and roaring of the voice: Now of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the trouble.</p>

               <p>HEre is another amplification of the Prophets mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and sorrow. It was no light sorrow, which pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the marrow of his bones, and made him expresse it, not in ordinarie cries and voices, but made him roare out more like a Lyon then a man. But this makes it sad and heauie indeede, that it was continuall, and without release or intermission. And the reason of all his sorrow, was the heauinesse of Gods hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hand.]</hi> The hand, being a member of mans body, and the instrument of manifold actions, is referred to God, and signifies sometime, first, his effectuall purpose and counsell concerning things to be done: so <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28. &amp;c. to do whatsoeuer thy <hi>hand</hi> and counsell determined. Secondly, his actuall power, working all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that counsel of his will; so <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 30. so that thou stretch forth thy <hi>hand.</hi> And thus God hath a twofold hand. First, of blessing and protection, with which he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery liuing thing; <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 28. Thou openest thy <hi>hand,</hi> and they are filled. Secondly, a smiting or heauie hand; and this is twofold.</p>
               <p>First, a <hi>reuenging hand,</hi> and so it is a fearefull thing to fall into the <hi>hand</hi> of the Lord. Secondly, a <hi>correcting hand,</hi> meant in this place, whereby he scourgeth &amp; buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feteth his owne children. Now the sense of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er punishing or correcting, is called Gods hand: as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 11. The <hi>hand</hi> of the Lord was sore at <hi>Ekron,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Arke: And an <hi>heauie hand</hi> in resemblance, because when men smite, they lay their hand heauier then ordinarie. Hence we may note three points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: first, that all afflictions are Gods hand. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God laies his hand heauily often vpon his deare children. Thirdly, that God often continues his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18743:61"/>
hand, night and day on them.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>All afflictions are Gods hand: Amos</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Shall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>there be euill in the Citie, and the Lord hath not done it? Isa.</hi> 28. 21. <hi>The Lord shall stand as in mount Perazin, and bee wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may doe his worke, his strange worke, and bring to passe his act, his strange act:</hi> that is, execute his iustice which wee inforce him vnto, whereas shewing of mercy is familiar to his nature, more proper and familiar to him: he is loth to reuenge, as in mount Perazin <hi>Dauid</hi> did vpon the Philistims, when he smote them, and called the place the Mount of diuision, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 11. or as in Gibeon, when he slew the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites with hailestones, and made the Sunne and Moone stand still, till <hi>Ioshua</hi> had slaine them all, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 12, 13. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>When wee are iudged, wee are chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reasons hereof are these: <note place="margin">Reas.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, they are from Gods hand purposing and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">1</note> them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Wee are predestinate to be like the image of Christ;</hi> that is, in suffering. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>No man should be mooued by these afflictions: for your selues know, that we are appointed thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they are from Gods hand <hi>executing</hi> them, as <hi>Isaiab</hi> 45. 7. <hi>I make peace, and create euill, I the Lord doe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>all these things.</hi> So also <hi>Genes.</hi> 45. 8. <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>God sent me before you. Iob</hi> confesseth the like, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>The Lord bade</hi> SHEMEI <hi>to raile vpon</hi> DAVID: <hi>Hosea</hi> 6. 1. <hi>He hath spoiled, and he hath smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, afflictions are from Gods hand <hi>ordering</hi> and <hi>disposing</hi> them: first, in their causes, circumstances, kinds, <note place="margin">3.</note> manner, measure, and time both of their beginning and ending.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in their ends and issues, which are, first, his owne glory in manifesting his mercy, iustice, wisedome,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18743:61"/>
power, &amp;c. Secondly, the euerlasting saluation of his children, whilest by afflictions,</p>
               <p>First, he stops them in their course of sinne, as with an hedge of thornes, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 6. that they should not breake ouer into the pleasant pastures of sinne, therein to be fatted to the slaughter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee brings them to a true hatred of sinne, when they taste the bitter fruite of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to the exercise of mortification, and desire of heauen and heauenly things: and thus they are iudged of the Lord, that they may not be condemned with the world.</p>
               <p>Yea, but afflictions are euill in their nature, the curse of sinne, and flashes of hellish torment; so the Lord calls <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> them euil, and makes the daies of the afflicted euill, they are enemies to the ioy, peace and comfort, which the godly at length shal eternally enioy; how then can they be the hand of God?</p>
               <p>True afflictions are in their nature euill, but not euill <note place="margin">Answ.</note> so simply and absolutely, but that there is some respect of good in them: for, first, as they proceed from the chiefe good, whose will is the chiefe rule of all good, and euery thing is therefore good, because he willeth it, thus are afflictions good; yea, euill of sinne is so farre good, as it is willed by God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as they are punishments inflicted by a righteous iudge, they are good: thus all execution of iustice vpon <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> &amp;c. is good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as they are chastisements, comming from the <hi>hand</hi> of a mercifull Father vpon his children, they are good: for a father doth good, and his dutie in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his child.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as they are ouer-ruled by Gods wisedome and power, they are good; not onely harmelesse, but profitable, and by his blessing, are meanes to draw vs neerer the chiefe good, by furthering both our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18743:62"/>
heere, and our glorie heereafter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as they are sanctified by Christ, they are good: for had they been simply euill, Christ had not been so laden with them: but as himselfe was consecrated by them, so himselfe consecrateth them to the wholesome vse of all beleeuers: and so they are finally good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are a part of that straite way, that leadeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life.</p>
               <p>But how can afflictions bee the hand of God, when <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> such wicked instruments, as all wicked men, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <note place="margin">How afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can bee Gods hand, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils hand, or wicked mens be in them.</note> himselfe, band themselues against the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Very well: for first, it is not against the honor of the Iudge and course of iustice, that some base slaue bee vsed for the hangman and executioner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it cannot preiudice the iustice and goodnes of God, but rather magnifies his wisedome and power, when by the most wicked wiles of the diuell and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, he brings his owne righteous will to passe; here is a mightie worke of God, that can draw light out of darkenesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it exalteth his iustice in the ouerthrow &amp; iust destruction of such as exercise their malice against his seruants: for while they hate and maligne them vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they heape vp coales vpon their owne heads.</p>
               <p>This teacheth vs, that we must with the Prophet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> euery affliction befalling vs, to bee Gods hand. It is easier to feele a sorrow, then to conceiue or see Gods hand inflicting it: men thinke it enough, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to say and beleeue, that the world, and all things in it are ruled by Gods prouidence: but, come to applie it to this or that particular, there they faile. If prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie come vpon vs, and things fall to our minde, wee can thanke God: but when the crosse comes, we are willing to see any thing but God: then we runne vpon inferior causes; either we are wronged by wicked men, or it came by our own ouersight, or by the vnconstant whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18743:62"/>
about of worldly things. As if a man beaten should altogether looke at the staffe, wherewith he is smitten, and not at the hand mouing and ruling it: or as the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Curre bites at the stone, and looks not after the thrower.</p>
               <p>Neuer seuer thy crosse from Gods hand, though there be neuer so many instruments: <hi>Ioseph</hi> looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his brethrens sinne, and said, <hi>The Lord sent me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; Iob</hi> beyond the Sabeans and Chaldeans rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and stealing, and said, <hi>The Lord hath taken away; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> beyond <hi>Shimeis</hi> wickednesse, and said, <hi>The Lord hath bidden him.</hi> Christ himselfe looked beyond the Pharises, Priests, Iewes, <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the souldiers, to his Fathers cup, which he must drinke. <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 11. So, if we can see Gods hand, the affliction will be borne meekely: but if we gaze on men or meanes, it will be intolerable, and we must needs breake patience. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7. The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims would trie, whether Gods hand strucke them, or it was a chance, thou needst not doe so.</p>
               <p>But may we not looke at second causes?</p>
               <p>Yes, but not as the hand, but as rods in the hand of <note place="margin">Quest.</note> God: as <hi>Isai.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Ashur</hi> is called, <hi>the rod of Gods wrath:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and whilest such rods serue our heauenly Father, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stizing his children, and amend them, themselues are torne in peeces, and worne to the stumpes, and quickely after cast into the fire. For a man therefore to flie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wicked men, and to complaine of them, is, rather to confesse their sinne, then his owne; and to shew, that he knoweth, what was their dutie better then his owne. To fret and storme at second causes were, as if a man deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, should chafe at himselfe, because hee auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the blow, or should fal to biting the sword that stickes in his flesh, whereas his businesse were to plucke it out, and runne to the Surgeon.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore consider of these three things. First, that all power is from God, and in his hand.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:18743:63"/>
               <p>Secondly, that none haue any power against vs, but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 19. 11.</note> from aboue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the iust Iudge of the World would not afflict vs, if there were no cause in our selues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, heere is a notable ground of patience, in that our afflictions are the hand of God: 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>your selues vnder the mightie hand of God;</hi> that is, with meekenesse and silence buckle and bow vnder it: for,</p>
               <p>First, it is his hand, who is infinite in glory, power and Maiesty, and may dispose of his owne as he pleaseth: and it is to no purpose to struggle by murmuring, or impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie, to get out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the hand of our Father; thus Christ su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 11. <hi>Shall I not drinke of the cup that my Father hath giuen me to drinke?</hi> It is a cup, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, tempered and measured by our Father; if it be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bitter in the top, the bottome will haue a pleasant farewell; it is giuen vs of him to drinke, and therefore we must needs drinke it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the hand, that shall not be further stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out to smite, then it shall be to saue vs: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 1. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand is not shortned, that it cannot saue;</hi> the same <hi>hand</hi> that imbraceth the Church, is vnder her head, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Saints grounded their patience hereon, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 9. 10. <hi>I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, because thou diddest it: Remooue thy stroke away from me, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by the blow of thine hand.</hi> So <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 15. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rested himselfe on this, <hi>What shall I say? hee hath said it, and he hath done it:</hi> and <hi>Eli,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>It is the Lord: let him doe what seemeth him good.</hi> Also 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26. If he say, <hi>I haue no delight in thee, loe, here am I, let him doe to me as seemeth good vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if all afflictions be the <hi>hand</hi> of God, then we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> see whither to goe for release, we cannot expect it at the <hi>hands</hi> of men or Angels, but from God; none can take
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18743:63"/>
off Gods <hi>hand,</hi> but himselfe, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Come, let vs turne to the Lord; he hath spoiled, and he will heale vs; hee hath wounded vs and he will bind vs vp: Iob</hi> 10. 7. <hi>there is none that can deliuer out of thine hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How doth the Lord rebuke those, who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the hand that smites them? <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should ye be smitten any more? yee will fall away more and more yee seeke not vnto me. Asa</hi> insisted in the hand of the Phisician to remooue Gods hand: but his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teacheth, that euen lawfull meanes must not preuaile against Gods <hi>hand:</hi> where God himselfe is not chiefly. sought, men goe no further then the hand of a man op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing them, and seeke deliuerance that way; which is as if a malefactor should seeke to the executioner, and not to the Iudge, who hath power to pardon, or repriue or hang him.</p>
               <p>Others runne vnto vnlawfull and wicked meanes, to the Witch, the Wise or Cunning man and woman, who are no better then diuels incarnate, and yet are more sought to, euerie one of them, then all the Ministers in a Countrie, as though all the deuils or gates of hel could stirre Gods hand, or breake his arme.</p>
               <p>Oh, but they doe good and helpe vs. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed God permits them so to doe, to mens further <note place="margin">Answ.</note> hardening, and remooueth one hand that is sensible, to lay on one which is farre heauier; the deliuerance is by breaking the prison, to be clogd with more burden some fetters. The generall rule for all troubles, is <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in all deliuerances out of trouble, repaire to God with thankefulnesse, who hath remooued and stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> his hand; so did <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 15. 1. So did <hi>Hezekiah, Isa.</hi> 38. 18. 19. 20. and so did the nine Lepers. Thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse is the onely impost, that God requires at our hands. So much of the first point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:18743:64"/>
Secondly, <hi>God laies his hand heauily often vpon his owne deare children</hi> as here vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; vpon <hi>Iob, cha.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Oh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that my griefe were throughly weighed, &amp; my calamity laid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gods hand is often heauie vpon his owne children.</note> 
                  <hi>in the balances together! it would be heauier then the sand of the sea, &amp;c.</hi> So also <hi>cha.</hi> 16. 12, 13. <hi>He hath taken me by the neck, and beaten me, and set me as a mark for himself: His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers compasse me round about; he cutteth my reines, and doth not spare, &amp; powreth my gall vpon the ground. He hath broken me with one breaking vpon another, and runneth vpon mee like a Gyant.</hi> All which phrases imply: first, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and most noble parts were afflicted: and secondly, that God in his sense was become his enemie, and could not be more fierce against him then he was. <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 15. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complains, that God had bruised all his bones like a Lyon. <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Dauid</hi> shewes, that his affliction was violent both in his body and soule: <hi>My bones tremble</hi> (saith he) <hi>and my soule is sore vexed:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 3. hee affirmes, that the paines of hell had caught hold on him, that is, such temptations, distresses and horrors, as most neerely resembled the very paines of the damned. What a heauy hand was that vpon <hi>Ionas,</hi> when he was cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea, and was in the Whales belly three daies and three nights, when he cried out of the belly of hell, and said, that he was cast away out of Gods sight?</p>
               <p>And why doth the Lord lay such heauie things vpon <note place="margin">Quest.</note> his children?</p>
               <p>For sundrie Reasons.</p>
               <p>First, there is deepe corruption lurking in the best, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> who not feldome are cast vpon so dead a sleepe of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> that they cannot be wakened with a little shaking, till by most grieuous afflictions the Lord breake their bones, consume their strength, and bring them into such griefe and paine, as sets them a roaring. A wonderfull thing, that those, that haue tasted the sweet loue of God in Christ, which should alwaies allure them, and remaine as a prouocation and perpetuall spurre to follow after
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18743:64"/>
God, should so far be carried back with lusts, as that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God seek them out, and whip them home with sharp scourges, they were likely to perish with the world. Let vs see in our example: <hi>Dauid,</hi> deare to God, hauing not shaken off the delight of his sinne, would couer it, if he could from Gods eyes: (for he cannot peaceably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that sinne, which hee thinkes God sees;) but God makes him know, that he sees it, and because smal checks of conscience will doe no good, he laies on to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his heart with his bones, and spares not for his roaring. It is our owne fault, that wee need so great crosses to subdue so great corruptions: for as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamednesse of some colt is such, as if he be not sore rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and beaten, he would neuer be broken; so is it with our corrupt natures, which as hard knots must haue hard wedges.</p>
               <p>Secondly, smaller troubles haue often a smaller work, <note place="margin">2.</note> small things cannot make great hearts stoope, a smal fire will not purge away drosse from gold, but it must bee quicke and pearcing; a small wind doth not fan away the chaffe of vanitie, a small correction or smart makes the child more froward, till sounder correction subdue him; small trials doe not so exercise faith, nor send men out of themselues to God: for as none for the scratch of a pinne, or a little headach, will seeke to the Phisician or Surgeon; so a sinner in smaller grieuances of the soule will scarce thinke he needs goe to God. <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 14. <hi>God speakes once or twice, and then makes the obstinate sicke with smiting them he will haue his blowes felt:</hi> the strong purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at last worketh out most health and soundnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the greater the affliction is, the more odious doth sinne appeare to bee vnto God; a strong poyson <note place="margin">3.</note> must haue a strong antidote: the more the godly are striken downe for sinne, the more are they stirred vp to godly sorrow, to hatred of it, to zeale against it, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more watchfully do they preuent sinne to come,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18743:65"/>
and looke better to themselues: as a good Physician of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes letteth blood, not to make a man sicke, but to preuent sicknesse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the greater the tryall is, the better experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue they of themselues: for first, God afflicts the <note place="margin">4</note> body heauily, but it is for the soule; the soule would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perceiue the owne euill, but for the euil of the body, nor feele the miserie but by the body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in great trials there is experience of a great combat betweene the flesh and the Spirit; where any faith is, it will lift vp the heart in inuocation, silence, and an expectation of the good hand of God: but the flesh will be complaining of Gods absence, desertion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his hand and helpe: here is sense of the spirits willingnesse, and the weakenesse of the flesh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is great experience of their graces in great trials, that both themselues and others may take knowledge of their constancie and patience. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> was made a mirror of patience, and a patterne of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, which he could not haue been, if the trial had not been so sharpe as it was. Then the Mariners skill is best tried, when the tempest is vehement; and the valour of a Captaine is best seene in the hottest skirmish.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in great trials, there is great obseruation of Gods dealing, of the comforts of God, and of the strength of God, and therefore the Lord brings many of his, as it were, vpon the stage and theater of the world, that they may be instruments of his praise, and may by their experience be able to teach others, how they shall finde God in affliction: for as one piece of yron cannot be soldred and fastned to another, vnlesse both be made red hot, and beaten together: so one Christian cannot be so soundly affected to another, vnlesse both haue had experience of the like miserie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Gods children haue great afflictions, and are pressed with an heauie hand, that God himselfe may be <note place="margin">5</note>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18743:65"/>
cleerely seene to bee their deliuerer, when in the eyes of all flesh they are lost; therefore they see themselues in the red Sea of affliction, and in a wildernesse of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and sometimes with <hi>Ionas,</hi> in their owne and other mens sense, drowned in the bottome of the sea, in the belly of the Whale, that as <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay foure dayes in the graue, that Christs power might bee manifested in raising him: so also may the goodnesse of God, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two daies will reuiue vs, and in the third will raise <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2.</note> vs vp.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, as great afflictions make way for abundant <note place="margin">6</note> mercy from God to vs, so also for abundant thankes from vs to God. If one cure a trifeling matter, it neither so bindes the patient, nor yet commends the Physician: but if any be cured of some deadly, and almost-vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desease, then we professe we could neuer haue met with such a Phisician in all the world againe, and we are accordingly thankefull.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, were it not for great afflictions, we could neuer know the power of Gods Word in quickning vs, chearing and comforting vs in them, that it is the Word of life, is most euidently seene in death it selfe.</p>
               <p>First then, let vs hence take a view of the wickednesse <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> of our nature, and of the working of it, euen after our calling and conuersion, and cease to wonder, that the Lord often brings violent afflictions vpon his owne children, which he sees most necessarie to awake them out of their slumbers, and quicken them to their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of sound peace and reconciliation. <hi>Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, before hee was afflicted, went astray like a lost sheepe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may learne hence, that vehement affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> and Gods heauie hand is no signe of his hatred to <note place="margin">Gods heauy hand no signe of hatred to his children: Why.</note> his children; good <hi>Dauid</hi> had Gods heauie hand lying sore vpon him. For,</p>
               <p>First, all outward things fall alike to all, and no man
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18743:66"/>
knoweth loue or hatred by the things that are before him: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in iudgement hee remembreth mercy, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 2. and afflicteth in measure, though our sinnes haue beene beyond all measure, and deserue, that our crosses should be so too: <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 9, 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his wisedome knoweth the due quantitie and proportion that will doe vs good, and though there wants no will in Satan and wicked men to passe it, yet the miserie shall not exceed Gods limit, who hath said to the proud waues, <hi>Hither shall ye come, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, he hath a seuerall measure for the godly and the wicked: for his children hee measureth iudgement according to their strength, to the wicked according to the measure of their sinnes: but as the best garden and flowers lye open to stormes and haile to fall on them as well as the wildernesse, so the dearest of Gods Saints to afflictions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Lord chastize, and punish his children <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> so heauily, the whole burthen of whose sinnes Christ hath borne in his body on the crosse, where shall the wicked and vngodly appeare, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17? How heauie shall his hand lye on those, who with high hand sinne against him? the weight of the mountaines shall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it; to which they shall say, <hi>Fall vpon vs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs.</hi> If the way to heauen be so strawed with crosses and heauinesse, what is the way to hell and of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse strawed with, but woes and curses? Shall not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers and teares, much sorrow and strife against sin, nay nor the request of the Spirit, and the intercession of Christ, keepe off such bitter things from them, who sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not without some resistance breake out? What then shall become of those, who neuer pray, neuer sorrow for sinne, but sell themselues to commit wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? if infirmities be so lashed, what shall rebellions?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18743:66"/>
If weakenesses in his children, what shall wickednesse in his enemies?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this admonisheth the godly not to bee too <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> much discouraged, if they lye vnder an heauy hand: but consider of these foure things,</p>
               <p>First, that to expect continuance of outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">1</note> is earthlinesse, or selfe-loue, yea, a meere folly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a priuiledge of the Church triumphant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that through many afflictions, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2</note> into the Kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 14 22. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is more cause of discouragement in the want of them, then in their presence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that no new thing befalls them: <hi>Dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued</hi> (saith Saint PETER) <hi>thinke it not strange concerning</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>the fierie triall, which is among you to proue you, as though some strange thing were come vnto you: But reioyce, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as yee are partakers of Christs sufferings, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider, that neither our vnhappines is to <note place="margin">4</note> be measured by the things of this life, nor our happines: for then of all men were we most miserable; neither let vs thinke wicked men to be happy by outward wealth, &amp;c. seeing such things are cast vpon all in common, both prosperitie and aduersitie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we may hence obserue a difference betweene <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 5.</note> Gods heauie hand on the godly, and on the wicked: for <note place="margin">Differences betweene Gods heauie hand on the godly, and on the wicked.</note> howsoeuer, these afflictions on both are all one, if wee consider,</p>
               <p>First, the matter of them: secondly, the threatning of the law, laying them as punishments of sinne vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one offending: and thirdly, in respect of sence and feeling, as there is no difference betweene the smart of slaues and of sonnes. Yet there is much difference:</p>
               <p>First, in the <hi>person inflicting</hi> this heauie hand, who is to the one as a seuere Iudge that smites out of the rigor of iustice, but to the other, as a gracious Father, out of loue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18743:67"/>
correcting them: with the one he is angrie out of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and disposition, hating sinne, and reuenging for it; with the other, onely in their sense and apprehension.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they differ in the <hi>persons bearing</hi> this heauie hand: the one is gold, not consumed in the fire, but <note place="margin">2.</note> accepted through Christ, and made more pure and bright by the fire of afflictions; the other refused, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hatred, and as drosse wholly consumed with this heauy hand; vessels of wrath were neuer in Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose intended to be refined by afflictions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a difference in <hi>Gods end and aime:</hi> the one he laies his heauie hand on, to destroy the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">3</note> for the sinnes sake, and his quarrell is against the partie; on the other, to destroy sinne for the persons sake, and his quarrell is onely to the sinne: on the one, to satisfie his iustice, because they haue offended already; on the other, to signifie his mercy, and to preuent future offences.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they differ in the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>issue</hi> in both. In <note place="margin">4.</note> the one by afflictions, their corruptions breake out more; as wind increaseth the flame, and oyle (though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid) cooles not, but more heateth the furnace: so the wicked are the worse for afflictions, they fret and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine: but the godly are bettered by them, they acknowledge the hand, exercise patience, prayer and praise, and are daily more and more purified, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly waiting on God, till he increase their strength, or decrease their crosse. In the one it is as the lightning, which sets the house on fire; in the other as the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to purge the corrupted aire of our hearts.</p>
               <p>The third doctrine followes, and that is this, namely, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God laies his heauie hand vpon his children a long time,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God laies an heauie hand a long time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne children.</note> and with much continuance night and day, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith and felt it: the truth hereof we may see in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons and in Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:18743:67"/>
First, the troubles of <hi>Iob</hi> were long and painesul night and day, as <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>When I say, my bed shall comfort me, then thou fearest me with dreames.</hi> And <hi>Verse</hi> 19. <hi>Thou wilt no let me alone, till I can swallow my spettle.</hi> Good <hi>Hannah</hi> carried not onely the burthen of barrennes, but also of vexation and affliction by <hi>Peninnah</hi> many yeeres, as the Text prooueth, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 7. A daughter of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was bowed by Satan 18. yeeres, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 8. Another woman that had an issue of blood 12. yeeres, was cured by Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43. good <hi>Aeneas</hi> was sicke of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie 8. yeeres, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 33. and a man that was lame 38. yeeres by the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> was <hi>cured, Iohn.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the whole Church hath felt long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous smartes: <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 3. Surely he is turned against mee, he turneth his hand against me <hi>all the day.</hi> The children of Israel were in Egypt 400. yeeres, and 70. yeeres in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. The ten generall persecutions lasted almost 300. yeeres. And why is this so?</p>
               <p>First, sometimes Gods children in their falles harden <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> their hearts, and grow stiffe in their sin, which was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> case here, and then the Lord hardneth himselfe to grow stiffe in displeasure; as <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. <hi>If yee walke stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely against mee, and will not obey mee, I will then bring seuen times moe plagues vpon you according to your sinnes.</hi> Oftentimes GODS children would sit silent, if the Lord would bee as silent as they: but whom hee loues, hee will bring backe the way that they are gone, and great hearts (we know) will not stoope for a little.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ hath not taken away the lingring of <note place="margin">2.</note> trials, but the malignitie and poyson of them; yea, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe through all his life was a man full of sorrowes: and we must not looke to be better; hee deserued them not, we haue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God would haue vs in the continuance of our <note place="margin">3.</note> trouble, to see the continuance of our sinne; were our correction alwaies short, we would not bee perswaded
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18743:68"/>
of the greatnesse of our sinnes. Plaisters vse to continue, and not fall off till the wound be cured; and if a right vse of afflictions were attained once, a ioyfull issue would soone follow: but some lust is not denied, and that addes a sting vnto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God by the continuance of his hand would hold vs in a continuall exercise of grace, as of humilitie, <note place="margin">4</note> faith, patience, prayer, repentance, &amp;c. it being with a godly man, as one that hath a precious Iewell, which he is carefull to keepe in his hand, so long as hee watcheth, none can get it from him: but when he sleepes or slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, his hand opens, and it falls out, any man may haue it. By continuall blowing, the fire is kept in, but it dies by discontinuance.</p>
               <p>Yea, grace is not onely held on worke by affliction, but is also by the same brought forth into example, as <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, and the Canaanitish womans faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 23. Christ was not so instant in repelling her, but she was as constant in faith, prayer and humilitie. And hence it is, that the Lord commonly laies not so heauie a hand vpon bruised reeds, weake Christians: but often deferres helpe to those, that are strongest in grace, and dearest to himselfe; as men put the greatest timber, and the heart of the Oake to the greatest stresse. <hi>Abraham</hi> staies for the promise, till the performance is impossible in nature, because hee must be a Father of the faithfull. <hi>Iaacob</hi> waites fore the promise aboue 20. yeeres, and is a seruant, and a stranger, before he enioy <hi>Canaan.</hi> Who were they that cried, <hi>How long, Lord how long? how long wilt thou forget me? and shall I neuer bee remembred? hath God forgotten to bee mercifull? hath hee shut vp his tender mercies in displeasure? Psal.</hi> 77. 7, 8, 9. And, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> These were the voices of the dearest seruants and sonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the longer the Lord delaies deliuerance, the more comfortable will it bee when it comes: the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <note place="margin">5</note>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:18743:68"/>
we get a thing, the surelyer we keepe it; that which we procure by many prayers and teares, we keepe more carefully, and make meere account of; whereas lightly come by, lightly set by. The euill we hardly auoide, we are more watchfull against for afterward, whereas a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease soone cured is not much cared for, to preuent it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and lastly, God by the continuance of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie <note place="margin">6</note> hand vpon his children, would haue vs acknowledge how heauy and continuall those torments are, which are prepared for impenitent persons. If repentant sinners be laid vnder such lingring euills in this life, what shall the wicked and vngodly endure? If the Lord shew himselfe so stiffe to his children, that often he will not be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a long time, how will he pursue the hard-hearted sinner, that still stiffeneth his necke against him? surely his wrath shal abide, and settle vpon such, and come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to the vttermost.</p>
               <p>But how will all this stand with those many places of <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Scripture? as that the Apostle calles our afflictions light and momentany, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. and that God endureth but a while in his anger, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 30. 5. and that for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hides his face, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 8. doth not both this text and our owne experience shew, that they belong and tedious? and therefore I am either no child, or else God may lay tedious euils vpon his children.</p>
               <p>First, euills cannot belong, where life is so short as a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> spanne: if our daies be euill, yet are they but few, saith <note place="margin">How long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are but short and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany</note> 
                  <hi>Iaacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they are long to sense, but not to faith, though they last al the life, faith expecteth a blessed fruit, <note place="margin">2</note> and is supported by patience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are long, if they be compared with the <note place="margin">3</note> continuance and terme of our life: but not long, if they be compared (as in that place of the Apostle they are) with that eternall glory, and neuer-ending happinesse which followes them. This is Gods Arithmetike,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18743:69"/>
with whom a thousand yeeres are but as one day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, afflictions are long, if wee looke at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alone, and not at our sinnes; but compare thy suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings <note place="margin">4.</note> for weight or continuance with thy sinnes, thy afflictions with thy transgressions, and they will seeme short and light.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they would not onely seeme, but also be long indeed, if we should not see Christ in them, lightning <note place="margin">5</note> and shortning them: but when we see Christ sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our lingring afflictions and sorrowes, and carrying a way the eternitie of them by his suffering, which was short for time, but infinite in merit, then they are short indeede, euen a moment, seeing they last but a part of this life, the whole being but short and momentany.</p>
               <p>First then, those who are neere vnto God, haue no reason to flatter themselues, or beare vp themselues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> his fauour, when they embolden themselues to sinne against him. For he lookes to be glorified in them that come neere him: and though hee take not away his grace, yet he will scourge them with such rods, as they shall thinke him to breake their bones.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Gods hand be on thee, which thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue remoued, take heed of delight in sinne, or cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> in goodnesse, harden not thy selfe in thy departure from God; for then thou shalt surely find him hardning himselfe, and walking stubbornely against thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in lingring euils iudge thy selfe, and thy lingring in sinne: if the Lord were not mercifull to vs <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> as he was to <hi>Lot,</hi> we would neuer go out of our Sodom; and therefore all this is righteously vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this serues to comfort the godly, who are <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> longer exercised with trials, both inward and outward: Oh they thinke God neuer dealt so with any, and crie, How long, Lord? and will he neuer be more intreated? Yea, but stay a little.</p>
               <p>First, know that Gods waies are aboue the reach of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18743:69"/>
flesh and bloud. Secondly, compare thy sufferings with thy sinnes, &amp; thy afflictions with other godly mens, yea, with Christ, the deare Son of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou wilt see, that no affliction hath befallen thee, but as great or greater hath befallen thy fellow-members, and thy Head also. Thirdly, know this for certaine; were health, peace, and prosperitie as good for thee as troubles, thou shouldest haue it, but thy present estate is best for thee: and doth God enuie that to his children, which he throwes to his enemies? see wee not numbers, that it were better for them to be bound on their beds, and perpetually sicke and bedrid, then to abuse their health and strength as they doe? hast not thou also abused thy health, peace, &amp;c. and thereby forfeited them?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Sense of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie must goe before sense of mercy.</note> in what estate? and then promised him a Sauiour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5. <hi>They that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy. Mat.</hi> 5. 4.

DAVID, before he could be restored to the ioy of his saluation, had a deepe sense of his sinne, a deepe sorrow and touch of conscience for it.</p>
                  <p>And good reason that this should be so: for</p>
                  <p>First, touch of conscience, though it be no grace, yet it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> is a preparation to it, and makes way to it, as the needle to the thread: and the Diuines call it truly a beginning of grace, that is of <hi>preparation, not of composition.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, till legall feare hath through serious sense of sinne made a man feare euen for punishment, and despaire in respect of himselfe, he is neuer in earnest stirred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, and much lesse to desire, the promise of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, published and propounded in the Gospell. And hence the Lord, partly by his Word, doth driue men to their wits ends, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts said, <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we doe?</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his works vpon them, as the Iaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 29, 30. and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 12, 13. God binds him in chaines, and sends him to Babel, and in his captiuitie he humbled himselfe, and sought the Lord; when he was in affliction, saith the Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the promise is made onely to the hungrie, <note place="margin">2.</note> that the Lord will fill them with good things, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1. 53. Now till a man come to see his miserie by sinne, hee can neuer get out of himselfe, he neuer sees in what neede he stands of Christ, he hungers not, nor thirsts after him and his merits, he prizeth not his blood, and therefore is without any part in him, because hee is not capable of him. <hi>If any man thirst, I will giue him to drinke of the water of life,</hi> saith our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37, 38. see <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. A begger, so long as he hath any thing at home, cares not greatly for stirring abroad; and so long as we finde any content in our selues, and see not our vtter beggery, and that how without Christ wee are readie to starue,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18743:71"/>
wee are but weakely importunate with him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the heart of euery man by nature is like a fellow field, which must be ploughed vp, rent, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, <note place="margin">3</note> before the seede of God come there; hee sowes not among thornes, nor will cast in his heauenly seed of grace or comfort, till our surrowes be ploughed, neither can all this renting and ploughing be without sense of paine. For this purpose hath the Lord set vp a ministrie in the Church, to charge men with their spirituall sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and speciall sinnes, as he sent <hi>Nathan</hi> to tell <hi>Dauid, Thou art the man;</hi> and as Christ himselfe said to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria, that she was a woman little better then a harlot: here was the Lords plough, that subdued their clods, and prepared their ground for the seede of grace: this is the Lords sacrificing knife, to make wounds in the conscience, to pare away the dead flesh, and so to make way to sound cure.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the conuerting of a sinner, is the curing of a sicke and wounded soule, and the Phisician is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">4</note> who, that his cure may bee sound, first searcheth and lanceth, and stirreth in the wound, which puts the patient to much paine, before he powre oyle into it, and binde it vp. Many are the gashes and mortall wounds of our soules, inflicted by Satan and our owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we must, and shall feele the smart of them, before we be throughly healed.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose hath the Lord placed the conscience in a mans soule, to tell him what hee hath done amisse, and to follow him with hue and crie, yea, to apprehend him, and set vp a gibbet in his soule, to which it adiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and all to bring him into himselfe, to seeke and sue for pardon.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and lastly, God will be honoured in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">5</note> confessing of that which is amisse, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If wee acknowledge our sinnes, hee is faithfull and iust to forgiue them.</hi> DAVID himselfe must confesse, that he had done
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18743:71"/>
very foolishly in numbring the people. Nay, hee will haue an healing of their error, an vndoing of that that is done, and a building vp of that which they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied, as <hi>Saul,</hi> the more zealous persecutor, the more zealous preacher; <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the more heauie oppressor, the more heartie restorer.</p>
                  <p>First then, we see that God dealeth here, as in all the matter of our saluation, to set forth his mightie power <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> in bringing the ioy of his elect out of sorrow, as at first he did light out of darkenesse: as by Christs death hee works out our life, so he killeth vs also to make vs aliue: as once he set his Bow in the heauens, a signe of present raine, yet a perpetuall and generall signe, that the world shall neuer be drowned againe; euen so the Lord giues his children the couenant of life, but through death; a righteousnesse, but by a sense and groning vnder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse; a present blessednesse, but through sense of miserie; an happy resurrection, but through dust and corruption. Thus he foundeth their soundest ioy in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, their laughter in teares, their happines in vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and miserie: all the former weight that lay vpon <hi>Dauid,</hi> doth but make him seeke reliefe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his peace when he hath regained it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, heere is a ground of sound comfort for Gods children in sorrow, if it bee godly sorrow, that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> they may say with IOB, <hi>After darknesse I shall see light,</hi> this sense of miserie shal leade me to the sense of mercy, this sorrow may last for a night, but ioy shall come in the morning; after two daies he will reuiue vs, and in the third we shall liue in his sight, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>I know, this hand, which is so heauie vpon me, is vnder my head, to bring me light out of this darknesse, and life out of that, which for the present is more bitter then death it selfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notes of that sense of miserie, which shall haue sense <note place="margin">Markes of that sense of misery which shall finde mercy.</note> of mercy, are these:</p>
                  <p>First, it workes a displeasure against a mans selfe for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18743:72"/>
displeasing God, as 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>What indignation hath this wrought in you?</hi> that is, an holy blaming of our selues, and iudging our selues worthy any punishment; and this not in generall onely, but euen in particular sinnes, and in all the sinnes, that we can know by our selues, as a Surgeon in curing tumors, brings the matter to a head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a constant purpose not to sinne for a world, but to cleaue vnto God with full purpose of heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a change of the whole man in affection and action: what a change was wrought in the Iaylour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conuersion? <hi>Acts</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a trembling at the Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. This was in <hi>Eli:</hi> and good <hi>Iosiahs</hi> heart did melt at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Law; the Conuerts hearing the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> were pricked in their hearts. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it feeles and watcheth the worke, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of corruption, it auoides occasion of offence, and seekes occasions of God, it grieues as oft as it falls or offends euen in smaller things. <hi>Ioseph</hi> fled from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, and <hi>Dauids</hi> heart smote him, in cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, it lookes not to outward things more then needs must, it is not comforted but by Christ, and waites patiently for Christ, being no whit hasty to vse vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, but depends vpon God. <hi>Dauid</hi> comforts not himselfe in corne, wine, or oile, but in Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. It is instant with God in prayer, as the Canaanite, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Finde these notes in thy selfe, and thou mayest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thy selfe in the deepest distresse that is: for if thy soule thus truly mourne for sinne, thou art in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to blessednesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this rebukes the common error of men, who <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> account conuersion, and the attaining of happinesse, a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18743:72"/>
matter of nothing; men thinke that heauen stands by their beds-sides, it is but a light Lord haue mercie; whereas neuer hee went to heauen, that sailed not by hell: it is a burdened soule, that seekes and gets ease; a weary soule, which Christ refresheth; a soule pressed with an heauie hand, that sues for mercy. No man can taste of the sweete fruite of mercy, that hath not tasted the bitter fruite of sinne, and of a wounded and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed conscience. And whosoeuer hath not felt the griefe and smart of his sinnes, may iustly feare hee neuer truly repented; and thou that saiest, thy sinnes neuer troubled thee, thou thankest God, shalt find, that there is more trouble behind.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, labour to feele thy spirituall miserie and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> wants, that with <hi>Lazarus</hi> thou maiest get thee to <hi>Diues</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Motiues to get a sent of our spirituall miserie.</note> his gate, and examine thy selfe if thou hast felt it. How loth are men to feele the smart of sinne, to heare the law come vpon their conscience, for feare they bee set into dumpes and melancholy, to feele the crosse, whereby God breakes the stubbornnesse of nature, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues it?</p>
                  <p>Alas, poore soules, that nip true repentance in the blossome, and blast it in the beginning, that thinke they are very neere heauen, when they are loth to point their foot into the first step, which is to mourne, and to be cast downe to hell in their owne sense, and in the feeling of their owne sinnes: till which time thou hast not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one foote or finger toward eternall life; therefore know,</p>
                  <p>First, that thy case is dangerous, and thou art still in thy sinnes, who wilt not let the word come home to thy heart, and wilt not suffer Gods Spirit to meete thee in the Ministerie, and canst not indure the power of the Word to wound either thy soule or thy sinne, but it hath been in vaine to thee; a certaine signe of a man as yet out of the state of grace, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>Such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18743:73"/>
                     <hi>not to know God, he gaue them vp to the lusts of their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, know that an accusing conscience for sinne is better then a dead conscience; a sleepie, benummed, or seared conscience, is the most grieuous plague that God can strike a man withall in this life; his wrath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes drowsie consciences, to giue them vp to a spirit of slumber, and at length to a reprobate sense. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. <hi>My people would not heare my voice, Israel would none of me; so I gaue them vp to the hardnesse of their hearts, and they walked in their owne counsels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let vs bee mooued to make search into our miserie, considering, first, that if we shead not teares on earth, God can neuer wipe them away in heauen: and if we do here shead teares for sinne, God carries an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefe to wipe them all away; such Aprill showres bring the May-flowres of grace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that our soules in their swaruing from God, are like bones out of ioynt; the longer they goe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, the more painefull they prooue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the health of the body, men will purge and sweat, and make shift to swallow, and get downe bitter pills and potions: so the vomit of the soule is the griefe of repentance, take it betime, and the danger is lesse. Were the medicine of repentance grieuous to take, yet in regard of the euerlasting health, to which it restoreth vs, wee should like wise men, take the sweete with the sowre, and chuse this rather, then to feede on such sweete meates as please the palate, while they bee tasted, but cause at length vomits more bitter then death.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how highly doth God esteeme of a man or woman of a broken heart? 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 19. Good <hi>Iosiahs</hi> heart melted, and God had a care to take him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the euill to come. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. <hi>I walke with him that is of a contrite spirit, to reuiue the spirit of the humble,</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:18743:73"/>
                     <hi>and giue life to the contrite heart.</hi> Now followes the ground of <hi>Dauids</hi> confession, which is first in order.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>I said, or thought.]</head>
                  <p>THat is, I purposed, I resolued. <hi>Dauid</hi> had been in a long conflict in himselfe what to doe, he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part with his sin, nor yet hold it: in a woe case hee found himselfe, and as a man whose bones were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet loth hee was to goe to the Surgeon; faine hee would haue hid his sore, but the paine would not suffer him. Long hee reasoned with himselfe how hee might carry away his sinne most quietly, but found no peace in hiding it, but still his terrors were increased; and then he grew at last to the best resolution, that neither feares nor terrors, nor sorrowes should any longer, as an hedge shut vp his way to confession; he will no longer be tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betweene feare and hope, doubts and desires, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations and resolutions; but now <hi>(I said)</hi> that is, I thought in my heart, I spake with my mouth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently I resolued and acted, that I would present my self before God in humble confession of my sinne.</p>
                  <p>The same phrase we haue, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. when the lost sonne had lost himselfe in straying and wandring from home, and had spent his money and strength on harlots, and was now a fitter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion for swine then any thing else; &amp; when he who had wallowed in the mire of his sin, and fed himself with the swil of iniquity, was now right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorted for his bed and boord with swine, cast out of mens company, and none pitying him to giue him so much as huskes to eate. Now he begins to consider what a wofull estate he was in, he thinkes of his fathers house: but with what face can he behold the face of his father? he considers of the seruants in his fathers house, but he is not worthy of a place among them: these and such thoughts would haue kept him from his father, but,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18743:74"/>
necessitie so vrging, and famine sore pinching him, vpon consideration he came to the like resolution, <hi>I said I will goe to my father,</hi> that is, I resolued to goe, and so he went; so <hi>Dauid</hi> said he would confesse, and confessed. Hence we may see in the first place, that</p>
                  <p>Sound consideration brings forth sound resolutions. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29. <hi>Oh that men were wise, that they vnderstood</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>this, that they would consider their latter ende. Psal.</hi> 119. 59. <note place="margin">Sound consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration brings forth sound resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>I considered my waies, and turned my feete vnto thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 4. to still Gods enemies, he bids them <hi>examine themselues, and be still.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reason hereof is good: for</p>
                  <p>First, consideration is an applying of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> and the mind, to the things that are offered, and makes the minde intent vpon them; it is a candle held to the minde, to giue it light in the thing to be done, and in the manner of doing it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it informeth the iudgement, the chiefe office whereof, is to trie and compare things together; which hath euer been the circumspection of the wise, as <hi>Dauid</hi> compares his present estate with the former. It is the definition of a mad man to bee without iudgement, to follow his fancie, and to be led by appearances with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out triall: so the prodigall sonne, when he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, is said, to <hi>come to himselfe, Luk.</hi> 15. 17. till which <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> time he was as a mad man out of, or, besides himselfe: therefore <hi>Elthu</hi> counselleth his friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 4. thus, <hi>Let vs seeke iudgement amongst vs, and know among our selues what is good;</hi> that is, Let vs trie <hi>Iobs</hi> speech how true and iust it is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sound consideration inclines and determines the will according to the light of the mind, and the sound informing of the iudgement, and accordingly perfecteth the action. He were a mad man, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath apiece of poyson in his hand, would incline his will to eate it. Now when consideration hath sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18743:74"/>
enlightned a mans minde, informed his iudgement according to that light, and determined his will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that iudgement, it must needs bring forth sound resolutions, purposes and actions.</p>
                  <p>Againe, see the truth of this doctrine in sundrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: First, a man that is to goe a small iourney, will consider, whether he be in his right way, what time hee hath to go through in, what places are most dangerous, how neere he is to his iourneyes ende, what is the vse of his iourney, and accordingly hee resolues for his furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and expedition: So, if a man consider of his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to heauen, of the difficultie of the way, the danger by theeues or robbers, of the shortnesse of his time, how neere his waies end is, &amp;c. he would speedily resolue of repentance, and amendment of life, which without this consideration is not onely deferred, but also vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a man that considers of the haruest, of the returne and profit of his husbandrie, will also consider of the seed-time, and of the sowing of his ground, he wil not spare his seede, as distrusting the haruest, or fearing to lose it. So, whereas many are bad husbands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neuer consider of the haruest, others expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an happy haruest in the Kingdome of heauen, sow to the spirit, consider this their seede-time, and, while they haue time, will sow their seede, cast it liberally on the ground <hi>or waters,</hi> distribute to the necessities of the Saints, and <hi>after many daies</hi> they finde it with increase an <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 1.</note> hundreth thousand fold.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wise men thinke theeues and fellons to bee mad men, that seeing euery Assises so many hanged for theft, yet will steale and rob, and this is, because they consider not the ende: but hee that considers the vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidable danger of the law, the seueritie of it, the eye of the Iudge vpon him, the irreuocable sentence of death, and the shamefull execution of it, resolues to depart out
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18743:75"/>
of the way of such danger. So, what makes the wicked to be accounted mad men in wise mens eyes, but their foole-hardy rushing into a thousand rebellions and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against God? they know, that one sinne is able to damne them, had they ten thousand soules and bodies, and yet they rush into thousands of sinnes; it being with them as it is with him, that knowes one or two graines of poison will kill him, and yet eates a pound of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he considers not the ende. Whereas, if men did consider the danger of sinne, the curse of the Law, the torment of conscience here, and of hell hereafter, durst they so aduenture vpon sinne? But I speake of a sound consideration: for it is true, that most men in grosse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue an heauen, an hell, a iudgement, an account, and a punishment: but not, not digesting it with due medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application to their owne soules, it doth them no more good, then Phisicke put into a mans pocket can helpe him to his health; all this knowledge is lockt vp in the braine and brest, and is as insensible, as fire in a flint-stone, if it bee not beaten out by sound conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>All this serues to stirre vs vp to consider of our waies, <note place="margin">Vse.</note> and of our estates, and of the actions that wee doe: for <note place="margin">Motiues to consider of our waies and estates.</note> these respects:</p>
                  <p>First, inasmuch as without it, no state of life can bee rightly ordered: the Mariner, if hee consider not his compasse continually, and his course by it, runnes into <note place="margin">1</note> remedilesse dangers; and so it with vs in our voyage to our hauen of Heauen. The Marchant, if he consider not his affaires by his count-booke of gaines or losses, his debts and wares, will soone proue banquerupt; so we in our spirituall traffique, without sound consideration, shall soone be blowne vp. If <hi>Eue</hi> had considered of the Serpents words, had she, and had we by her been such losers? Had <hi>Adam</hi> considered of <hi>Eues</hi> gift, had hee been so deceiued? If <hi>Abraham</hi> had considered the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18743:75"/>
of <hi>Sarah,</hi> would hee haue taken <hi>Agar</hi> into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some? What doth all this proue, but that, if we were as rich as <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie, yet wants of considering our estate would lay vs to spoile?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a prerogatiue that man hath aboue all <note place="margin">2</note> creatures, to haue a facultie of examining his actions by consideration, and yet how little doth man respect this priuiledge, without which hee were to be sorted with beasts or mad men? especially, in sound consideration for the good of his soule: the beast liues by things present, man should consider the end before he beginne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, without consideration no action can bee done well, or succeed happily, no spirituall action; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">3</note> it is not in faith, if it be done without considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as for example,</p>
                  <p>First, we can neuer heare the Word well; if first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand we consider not whom we come to heare, and to what ende, namely, to further our saluation: without this we come but as to a play. Secondly, in hearing, if wee consider not our selues to bee in Gods presence. Thirdly, after hearing, if wee consider not of what wee haue heard, and that God will iudge vs by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in prayer we are commanded, first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, and then to pray, as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hastie to vtter any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God:</hi> For this consideration must offer both matter of prayer, and also stirre vp affection and desire, else it will be but a dead and cold prayer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Sacraments, we must first examine and consider our selues, of the Couenant, of the seales of it, of our faith, worthinesse and repentance; and afterward we must consider the fruite of it, else all is but hypocrisie and vnsound. By all which we see, that it is onely sound consideration that brings foorth sound worshipping of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, sound consideration preuents much sinne, <note place="margin">4</note>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:18743:76"/>
and much punishment, and drawes a man out of sinne and iudgement:</p>
                  <p>First, it preuents sinne: for if a man did seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of sinne, what paine, and losse, and shame, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">1.</note> comes by it, he would not meddle with it, being so heauie, so dangerous. There is a Historie of a vertuous woman, that being sollicited to folly by a younker, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for a pan of hot coales, and desired him to put his hand vpon them but one houre; he refusing that, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, How much lesse will you bee able to indure hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire for euermore? and so he desisted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it preuents punishment, or the iudgements of God: the Niniuites considered of the threatning of <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Ionah,</hi> and so preuented the threatned destruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it drawes out of sinne, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 2, 6, 7. the Church of the Iewes seeing her selfe so crossed and hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">3.</note> in with afflictions, that shee could not follow her idols, then shee considers her present miserie, and the small hope and helpe from them; then she saith (that is, resolueth) to goe and returne to her first husband: for it was then better with her then now.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it drawes out of iudgement: <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>They haue laid it waste, and being waste, it mourneth vnto</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>me: the whole land lieth waste, because no man setteth his minde on it:</hi> that is, considereth deeply of the cause of its desolation in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we haue so much the more neede to be stirred vp to consider of our waies, because there is no vice that <note place="margin">5.</note> doth appeare, or dares to appeare in his proper colour, but apparelled and masked in the likenesse of some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: as no counterfeit coine is offered to a man in the copper-colour of it, but washed ouer with siluer or gold. Now if we consider not of things offered vs, we shal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be deceiued, yea, surprized of enemies vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of friendship.</p>
                  <p>Thus seeing the necessitie of sound consideration, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18743:76"/>
set vs yet more forward in so needefull and so neglected a dutie, obserue these directions:</p>
                  <p>First, let vs labour to see the dulnesse of our nature, to crosse it, and stirre it vp, and thinke the dutie so much <note place="margin">1 Sundrie godly directions to helpe vs, in our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our selues.</note> the more necessarie and excellent, as our natures oppose, or are heauie vnto it. What? shall a man consider of his houses, rents, fields or garments? and take no time to repaire himselfe, and hurts sustained by inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, set some time apart to consider of thy estate more seriously. <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> had as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, <note place="margin">2.</note> and more weightie affaires to intend then we haue, and yet they meditated in the Law of the Lord night and day: a shame for many Christians that take care how to passe their time, neuer passing any in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their estate; this were a good pastime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, make choise of good matter for sound consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: as first, consider of God: first, of his presence; <note place="margin">3. Choise mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> this kept <hi>Ioseph</hi> from sinne. Secondly of his mercy, to feare him. Thirdly, of his loue, to loue him againe. Fourthly, of his workes: first, of Creation; delight more in a spirituall, then in a naturall vse of them. Secondly, of gouernment; for there is no day or time that passeth, but we may make speciall vse of Gods works, either on our selues or others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider of thy estate with God, whether a change be wrought in thee, being the child of wrath by <note place="margin">2.</note> nature, what markes thou hast vpon thee to distinguish thee from them who are not the Lords, whether thou beest in the state of grace, how thou growest in it, or whether, and how farre thou art gone backward, what assurance of remission of sinne, and what strength against sinne thou hast, whether thou liest foiled of any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether thou resoluest of amendment of life, how thou hast kept or broken thy vowes with God, what vse
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18743:77"/>
of Gods mercies or corrections thou hast made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it haue not been better with thee then now, and whether thou mayest not be in farre better estate, were it not for thy owne default.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider of thine actions; for the matter, whether allowed by the Word; for the manner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">3</note> done in faith and obedience; for the end, whether thou aimest at wealth, pleasure, or preferment in the world, rather then at Gods glory, and to be rich in God: for God aimes at his glorie in all things, and so must wee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, consider of thy calling, first, generall as thou art a Christian, whether before thy profession, thou <note place="margin">4</note> cast the costs as a wise builder and captaine, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. whether thou hast the power of godlinesse, and art not content with the meere forme of it, whether thou ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thy profession, or disgracest it by inconsideratenes. Secondly, speciall, in which thou spendest most of thy time, whether thou seruest God in seruing man, whether thou art faith and iust, or vniust and vnfaithfull in these lesse things, whether thou sanctifiest it by prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou dependest vpon God for daily successe and blessing, or leanest to thine owne labour, whether thy ende be to enrich thy selfe, or to make it as a meanes to please God, and passe thee through the world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, consider thy latter end, and therein,</p>
                  <p>First, the recompense of reward: so did the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, <note place="margin">5</note> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16, 26 and so moderated their hearts in doing their duties, and in suffering afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider of the account that is to be made of euery idle word and thought, much more of euerie wicked, swearing, reuenging word and thought.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider of the day of death, the vncertainty of life, the leauing of that wealth, for which thou strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thy conscience, and the neede of much comfort in such an vncomfortable houre, how that peace of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18743:77"/>
conscience at that time will prooue the best wealth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, consider of the day of Iudgement, when all things shall bee naked, and euery man shall receiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which he hath done in the flesh, bee it good or euill.</p>
                  <p>These and the like considerations will bring foorth sound resolutions of bettering a mans estate, if any thing in the world will.</p>
                  <p>A second point of doctrine arising out of <hi>Dauids</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, is this: Where Gods Spirit hath taken place, it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> preuailes at length against all the corruptions of the <note place="margin">Gods Spirit at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes against corruptions of flesh.</note> flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> was a long time hindred from going to God: first, by the greatnesse of his sinne. Secondly, by the strength of corruption, against which hee was not fully resolued. Thirdly, by the vnworthinesse of his person. Fourthly, by the greatnesse of Gods anger and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hand. And fifthly, by the sentence and curse of the Law. Yet on the other side, by the secret worke of the Spirit in his heart, vnto all these was opposed: first, the greatnesse of Gods mercy. Secondly, the merit of Christs sacrifice. Thirdly, the promise of the Gospell. Fourthly, the nature of faith, which beleeueth aboue and against sense.</p>
                  <p>These being committed together, after a doubtfull combat, faith foiles infidelitie, hope despaire, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Law, the promise the threatning, and life kills death, that now he saith, resolueth, and professeth hee will come and confesse his sinne. This truth also we see in the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ calls her to open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and tells her of the drops of the night, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hee had taken to come vnto her: Oh, but shee had put off her coats, washed her feete, and was loth to stirre and disease her selfe, till Christ went away in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; yet putting in his hand by the hole of the doore, and secretly affecting her heart, her heart was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18743:78"/>
to him, then she arose and sought and found him.</p>
                  <p>So in <hi>Peter,</hi> how was he ouermastered by his flesh? a man would haue thought him vtterly lost, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and forswore his Master, and cursed himselfe: but Christ looked backe vpon him, and the Spirit began to shew himselfe as before, and got the masterie.</p>
                  <p>And all this stands vpon very good reasons: for</p>
                  <p>First, the Spirit in Christians by regeneration is more excellent then by creation, both in respect of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> and of the ende and continuance: the former wee haue from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> meere man, the latter from the second <hi>Adam,</hi> God and man: by the former, <hi>Adam</hi> had power to continue if he would, but had not the act of continuance: but by the latter, <hi>Adam</hi> had, and we also haue both the will and deede of continuance. So 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>They that are borne of God, sinne not;</hi> that is, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or to death, because the seede of God is in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Spirit of grace may by corruption bee <note place="margin">2.</note> hid a long while, as the Sunne vnder a cloud, but it shall breake out againe, because of those many promises which God hath made to the godly: as first; <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20 Faith, if it be but as a graine of Mustard-seede, shall rise to a great tree to shelter the soule vnder.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that if there be any fruite of grace, though it be neuer so weake, yet he wil not quench the smoking flaxe, nor breake a bruised reede, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 3. but cherish it as he did the young man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 21. and dresse it to be more fruitfull, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>the gates of Hell shall not preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, Matth.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the godly in their declinings to the right hand, or to the left, shall at length heare an inward <hi>voice</hi> of the Spirit, saying, <hi>This is the way, walke in it, Isai.</hi> 30. 21.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Spirit of grace (I meane not of restraint, <note place="margin">3</note>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:18743:78"/>
but of renouation) is a seede of all vertue, because it is in stead of originall sinne, which is a spawne or seede of all sinne: now as life is in the seede, which seemes to be a dead thing; so is the Spirit aliue and quickening, when it seemes farre otherwise: hence it is called the spirit of life, which as it raised Christ from a naturall death, so it doth raise his members at first from the death of sinne to the life of grace, and much more from the sicknesse of sinne to the soundnesse of grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the many titles, which the Spirit hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make himselfe knowne by, clearely confirme the <note place="margin">4.</note> truth propounded, especially these foure. The holy Ghost in the Scriptures is called</p>
                  <p>First, the Spirit of strength, to strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the elect, be they neuer so weake, and to foile their corruptions, be they neuer so strong. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is he that is in you, then he that is in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Spirit of libertie, to loose the captiues, that if a man be neuer so miserable a slaue and in bonds, where this Spirit comes, he will loose the fetters of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that grace shall haue the vpper hand, and the Spirit shall master the flesh. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ is, there is libertie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is the Spirit of comfort: <hi>When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter shall come, &amp;c.</hi> to shew, that when life is ready to be gone for want of comfort, then hee comes with new life and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he is called the Spirit of supplication, which makes vs able to pray, euen when we are at the worst and weakest; nay, himselfe makes requests for vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. So that if our prayers bee so weake as they can yeeld little comfort or helpe, yet his requests are preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough.</p>
                  <p>First then, this serues to confute such as hold, that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> grace can be quite shaken out of the heart, as though the lust of the Spirit did not continue as long as the lust
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18743:79"/>
of the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. as though the grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had no priuiledge aboue the grace of Creation, as though God had made no promise vnto it for perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as though the Spirit of God were a dead or dying spirit, a spirit of weakenesse, a spirit of bondage, a comfortlesse spirit, without all motion and desire in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this comforts Gods elect, who haue euer had <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> the gift of the Spirit: though thou art toyled with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and feelest the Spirit gone, yet be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he wil come againe, and not absent himself for euer. Many are the heart-sorrowes, which many that are deare to God, are broken withall, both in respect of euil and of good.</p>
                  <p>For the former: the euill they would not, that doe they; they are vexed with wicked thoughts, desires, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and actions; and vow to leaue sinne, to serue God better then they haue done, to forsake euill company, and to follow the meanes of grace and amendment: men say they will obey, euen in comming to the word, and in hearing it they say, they will learne and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: but their sayings, vowes, and promises come to nothing.</p>
                  <p>If good meanings and purposes would serue the turne, they were well: but you see nothing done, the motion is no sooner kindled then quenched; they are monstrous persons, all mouths, and tongues and voyces, without hands and feete. The Conuert sonne said, hee would goe to his father, and went; the dutifull sonne is he, who saith, he will goe into the vineyard, and goeth: but the sluggard feareth many Lions: Oh there is a beare in the way, and so many strawes are so many hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thornes to hinder him in any good resolution. Let the sound Christian learne better things of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and feed his godly motions, first, by the Word: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by prayer: thirdly, by heauenly meditation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:18743:79"/>
Now followes the third point in the confession, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the matter of it, and that is set downe in three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My sinnes, mine iniquities, and wickednesse]</hi> (or, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: for the Holy Ghost vseth a most forceable word to set out the vilenesse of this sinne, the <hi>iniquitie</hi> of my sinne:) <hi>Dauid</hi> would confesse all kindes of sinne, all manner of sinne; whence wee may learne, that</p>
                  <p>Serious confession of sinne reacheth vnto all sinne, knowne &amp; vnknowne, and sets it before it selfe in a most <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> odious manner. So the Prophet here in three phrases all <note place="margin">Sound confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion reacheth vnto all sinne.</note> tending to one thing, ioyned together, noteth the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of his confession, and that hee confessed in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: besides, by the nature of the words in Hebrew, he riseth in the degrees of sinne, till hee come to <hi>peshagin,</hi> which are the highest sinnes that Gods child in incident vnto; rebellions, treasons, or disloyaltie. And further, from one sinne hee goes to all; hee would faine haue hid one sweet sinne, but hee saw such mischiefe in that, that hee resolues now to discouer all for the sake of that one, and, if the way to get out of one bee to confesse it, the next way (hee thinkes) to get out of all, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse all.</p>
                  <p>The same course hee takes in the 51. Psalme, wherein, being touched in conscience for his Adultery, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; hee goes further and beginnes at his originall sinne, saying, <hi>I was warmed in sinne, and borne in iniquitie:</hi> And in the same Psalme hee sets his sinne before him in the scarlet colour of it, <hi>Deliuer mee from bloods:</hi> Why? hee shed but the blood of <hi>Vriah;</hi> yea, but hee cals to minde the blood of many that attended that worthy Captaine, who all by his occasion fell with him: at least the plurall number sheweth the bloudinesse &amp; heinousnesse of that sinne, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. The Lord said to <hi>Cain, The voice of thy brothers bloods is come vp before mee;</hi> that is, for <hi>Cain</hi> to kill his Brother, was as odious as to haue slain a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18743:80"/>
of other men; and the Lord would put him in minde of the many streames of blood, that ran this way &amp; that way from his godly Brother <hi>Abel:</hi> and as the Lord there speakes in the plural number, to aggrauate the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of his sinne, so doth the holy Prophet in the same forme of speech vtter his sinne, to make it as odious to himselfe as might be.</p>
                  <p>The like example we haue, <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 5. where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man maketh a sound confession in the name of the whole Church then in captiuitie, &amp; in it amplifieth the sinnes of the people, and riseth by sundry stayes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to make them out of measure sinnefull; thus,</p>
                  <p>First, wee <hi>haue sinned:]</hi> there is errour and departing from the right way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee haue <hi>done iniquitie:]</hi> there is a crooked course, and peruerse walking vndertaken.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and <hi>done wickedly:]</hi> here malice is ioyned to weakenesse, an indeuour in the birth of sinne, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall working of it out.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we <hi>haue rebelled:]</hi> here is obstinacy and warre against God, as Rebels take vp Armes to shake off the yoke of lawfull gouernement.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, by <hi>departing from thy Precepts:]</hi> here is obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate malice against the Law written and cleere light, here is a willing sin, they wilfully cast themselues head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, though they see the danger.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, wee <hi>heard not thy seruants the Prophets:]</hi> a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne against the Law explained and applyed by Gods seruants, who came in his name, that is: First, by the authoritie and Word of God: Secondly, they were most faithfull, and applyed themselues not to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people onely, but also to <hi>Kings, Princes, Fathers, and People,</hi> that is, to all sorts and orders of men without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons: And all this in the Plurall number, <hi>All we are guiltie,</hi> none excepted: thus in so many words hee heapes vp the number and greatnesse of their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:18743:80"/>
So in <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6. Oh my God, <hi>I am confounded and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to lift vp mine eyes to thee: For our iniquitie is growne vp ouer our heads, and our trespasse is gone vp to heauen; from the dayes of our Fathers we haue beene in a great tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe vnto this day.</hi> Oh, but know to thy comfort: First, that it was so with <hi>Paul</hi> after he was regenerate: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, consider of these three things. First, whether thou hate &amp; detest these euils in thy selfe: Secondly, whether thou resist them, &amp; suffer them not to be in quiet: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether being ouertaken with them, thou renuest thy repentance. Finde these things in thee, and thou mayest iustly say with PAVL, <hi>It is not I, but the euill that is in mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the latter: the good which they would doe, they cannot doe, their hands are as fast bound as if the spirit of libertie were quite gone: but be not dismaied: First, canst thou also not doe the euill that thou wouldest? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, doest thou finde the will present with thee? If this be so, here is a motion not of the flesh, but of the Spirit, let not frailety of the flesh discourage thee.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but if I may know, that euer I had the Spirit, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> then I hope hee will come againe: therefore, how shall I know, that euer I had the Spirit preuailing in mee?</p>
                  <p>Know it by these workes of the Spirit: First, one work <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of the Spirit is to cast down high things that are exalted <note place="margin">How to know whether euer a man haue had the Spirit of God.</note> against God, and to bring into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Christ, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Hast thou then subiected thy reason, affections, and delights vnto grace? hast thou denyed thy selfe, that whatsoeuer the Spirit in the Word suggesteth, it is thy whole heart to vndertake it? then assure thy selfe, the Spirit hath beene in thy heart; and will come againe: Secondly, this is the new Couenant, and another Condition, that where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is giuen, he writeth the Law in our hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 35. he brings in a new light, new inclinations, new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the man is a new man, and his life a new life. Did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18743:81"/>
thou then euer finde a change in thy selfe, that thou wouldest not for a world bee the same man thou vvast and hold the same courses? Findest thou that thy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance pleaseth thee not, and thy will conformeth it selfe to Gods will? then feare not, for the Spirit hath beene with thee: Thirdly, the Spirit is a Spirit of suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Hast thou then had a care and true desire of reconciliation? a true sorrow, that euer thou offendedst so good a God? a purpose of heart to cleaue vnto him, and to keepe his fauour which thou iudgest better then life it selfe? Oh cheere vp thy selfe in this, this fruit growes not out of thy Flesh, but from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Fourthly, <hi>Walke in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the Flesh, Gal.</hi> 5. 16. Examine thy selfe by this, hath the flesh and the corruptions of it any dominion ouer thee as a voluntarie vassal? Art thou a willing slaue to it? Doest thou accomplish and fulfill the lusts of it? If these things bee so, thou neuer as yet hast had the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Alas! I haue some strife, but I am too too often foyled. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, thy case is good enough: only hold on to striue and to striue faithfully, this struggling is a signe of some <note place="margin">Answ.</note> life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, know that the whole brood of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot be subdued on the sudden, but as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites wasted the Canaanites by little and little: so the Holy Ghost destroyes by little and little, rootes out and foyles these cursed enemies of our soules, but not all at once, lest wee should want exercise, and so grow idle and secure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, vse the meanes to get not onely the presence, but also the preuailing of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Oh that I knew what meanes to vse! what are they? <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wouldst haue the preuailing of the Spirit, take <note place="margin">Answ.</note> these courses:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:18743:81"/>
First, bee humble in thine owne eyes, empty thy selfe <note place="margin">Meanes of the Spirits preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> of pride and vaine conceits; the promise is, that God giueth grace to the humble, nay, he dwels with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broken heart, <hi>Isay</hi> 57. 15. that is, abides and continues with it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, be diligent in the ministerie of the Word of reconciliation, which the Apostle cals the <hi>ministerie of the Spirit;</hi> for it is as fuell to feede and strengthen the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yea as bellowes to blow vp the graces, which else lye idle. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Stirre vp the gift of God, that is in thee.</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Quench not the Spirit; Despise not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying:</hi> marke the neerenesse of Spirit and Prophesie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, obserue the motions of Gods Spirit, &amp; feede them, and from motions proceede to resolutions and practices: not the worst man but hath some good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Balaam;</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledged that <hi>Dauid</hi> was more righteous then he: but imitate thou good <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> here; hee followes the motion that hee had, hee said he would confesse, and confessed; So the Prodigall Son had a good motion, he remembred his estate he had been in, and his Fathers house, but (said he) I starue here; then hee resolues to goe to his Father, and went. Goe and do thou likewise, this is to adde thy strength to the Spirit; and thus a conuert is not meerely passiue in working out his saluation, but actiue, once being acted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, pray earnestly for the Spirit: for he is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on thirstie grounds, as <hi>Isay</hi> 44. 3. <hi>I will powre water vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that is thirsty, and floods vpon the dry ground:</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If yee being euill, know how to giue good gifts vnto your children, how much more shall your heauenly Father giue the Holy Spirit to them that aske him?</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>I acknowledged my sinne, neither hid I mine iniquitie.]</head>
                  <p>HEre is <hi>Dauids</hi> confession it selfe; he did not resolue, &amp; suffer his resolution to dye, but he said he would
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18743:82"/>
confesse, and confessed: but many are of another spirit, they resolue, professe, promise, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, I was a <hi>Blasphemer, a Persecuter, an Oppresser,</hi> but I was receiued to Mercie: Here were three heinous degrees of sinne; the sight of which made him confesse himselfe the chiefe of all sinners, <hi>verse</hi> 15. and made him admire and magnifie the Mercie of God, who vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed so aboundant grace to such a desperate wretch as hee vvas: and of this kinde are the confessions of all the godly.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons of this point are very good:</p>
                  <p>First, a Reason hereof is drawne from the nature of grace, which <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, worketh alike against all sinne: and he that hath grace to confesse one sinne aright, by the same grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth all; he that truely hateth one sinne, truely hateth all; If a man truely feele the weight of one, it makes him grone vnder the burthen of all much more. For all sinnes are of the same nature, so as repentance cannot be sound, if any one sinne be laid hold on; which made our Prophet, being humbled for one, to repent of all. Thus also doe the Israelites in their conuersion, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Pray for thy Seruants</hi> (said they to <hi>Samuel) that we dye not: for wee haue sinned in asking vs a King, besides all our other sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the grace of sound conuersion suffereth not starting holes and hollownesse in the soule, but worketh it to sinceritie: Now the sincere heart deales truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and it selfe; it knowes that God loues trueth in the inward parts, therefore it will confesse ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frankely vvithout hiding or lessening any sinne. Againe, it knowes that God loues a free-will offering, and therefore it will offer a free and heartie confession, and there can bee no better signe of sinceritie then this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sound grace is an open enemie, and at warre with all sinne, especially the sinne which is next it, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18743:82"/>
will not spare to disgrace it by all meanes; it vvill shew true hatred against it, that if confession will discouer the loathsomenesse of sinne, it will not bee nice in it, but bring it into discredit with it selfe. And where grace is more abundant, there is more abundant sense of sin, and this sense brings abundance of words like so many swords and weapons against it, euery one expressing greater hatred of it then other as <hi>Dauids</hi> words here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another Reason hereof is drawne from the nature of sinne, which, first, is a debt as we haue heard; <note place="margin">2.</note> a debt which is impossible that euer we should bee able to pay; this debt stands vpon our heads in Gods debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke: Now it vvill not stand with an honest dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deny or seeke to out-face or lessen a due debt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, and much lesse will it stand with a godly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to deny or conceale our debts to God, with whom wee cannot play false if we would. And therefore it is as little as a man of a broken heart can doe, to goe to the Creditor, and in humilitie confesse the debt, and craue pardon and forgiuenes: So Christ our Lord hath taught vs to pray, Forgiue vs our debts, which implyes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And <hi>Dauid</hi> prayes the Lord to blot out all his sins; wherein hee secretly confesseth, that hee hath a large score in Gods booke, which he is vtterly vnable euer to satisfie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sinne is a loathsome filthinesse and vn clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a good heart is ashamed of euery nakednesse of the Soule, which it sees Gods eye to bee vpon: and, because it knowes that the next way to couer this naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is to vncouer it (as the whole experience of <hi>Dauid</hi> in this Psalme teacheth,) it labours by confession to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all, whereof it is or may be ashamed: and indeede all true confession must proceede from the shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of face for sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sinne is a gash or wound in the soule: and a man hauing many wounds or diseases, seekes the cure of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18743:83"/>
them all, howsoeuer of the greatest first and soonest, yet he neglecteth none, because the least of them is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and painefull: so it is in sinne, the confession of which is as the laying open of a sore, that the plaister may bee fitly laid on: a man that would haue all cured, will not hide any, but vncouer euen the least.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will haue his children in some measure <note place="margin">3.</note> like himselfe herein and resemble his owne image, that, as hee esteemes of sinne, not as a light or small thing, but the most vile and odious thing in all the world, and so hee euer speakes of it and carries himselfe to it: so shall his children in their measure: and for this purpose</p>
                  <p>First, he vsually putteth forth his worke of iustice, and layeth an heauy hand on the soule (as on <hi>Dauid</hi> here) &amp;, when the eye of the soule beholdeth the Lord frowning vpon it without, and the conscience within accusing, then shall nothing be small, little sinnes shal be counted great enough: that which Satan did extenuate, to make it as small as a graine, and as light as a feather, shall now swel thicker then the Mountaines, and seeme heauier then al the sands of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord will haue his children to know the price and worth of mercie, before he bestow it vpon them; hee will make them hunger and thirst after it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all desires, hee will haue them to see their sinnes in as hatefull and ougly a visage as may be: for the more the sight of sinne is, the more earnest is the desire of mercie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will teach his children, in the serious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of their sinne, so much the more to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himselfe: For, the more wee confesse our owne base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vilenesse by sinne, the more wee magnifie the power and goodnesse of God in pardoning the same.</p>
                  <p>First then, this serues to confute the wicked doctrine <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> of the Church of Rome, taught and defended at this day, concerning merits and supererrogations, which most
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18743:83"/>
diametrally opposeth it selfe to all this doctrine of sound confession, whereas the Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 27. shewes that the master must forgiue all the debt, or els nothing but perpetuall prison is to be expected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this reprooues the confessions of mostmen, which are in grosse and in generall: They are sinners as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> other men bee, without any touch or feeling of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sinnes; which, though it be taken for a sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, yet indeede is such as the vilest Atheist may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; nay I say, a reprobate and cast-away, that shall neuer be saued, shall doe this and more, as wee may see in the examples of <hi>Cain, Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> who came to particulars in their confessions, and so goe farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond these men. Nay, numbers of these, that poste off their sinnes in the lumpe, with such slubberd confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cannot tell wherein they haue particularly offended. Yea if they were examined, they would make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue they had kept all the Commandements of God. If thy body vvere sicke to death, and the Phisician came, it would not content thee to tell him thou art sicke, and no more; but thou wouldst shew him thy particular griefe and disease, with the speciall manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it: and this must thou doe also by all possible meanes, before thou carrie away the cure of thy sin, and be restored to spirituall soundnesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, contrarie to this sound confession, are many other vile practices of men, who are in loue with their <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> sinnes:</p>
                  <p>First, such there bee in the world, that hood-winke themselues, and would rather lose both their eyes, then with either of them see the foulenesse of their sinnes; they wil smother the checkes, and stifle the voice of their own consciences; they follow their sports, their pastimes, their merry company, and take any course to thrust away the remembrance of their sinne by any meanes possible; but alas! they returne againe, because the guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18743:84"/>
how should a man repent of that sinne, which hee will not see, lest he should sorrow? small is the ease and comfort that a poore fellon gets against the sentence of execution, by shutting his eares lest he should heare it; he were madde, if he should thinke to scape hanging by so doing; his onely way were to humble himselfe and begge pardon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others there bee, that can sport themselues with their sinnes, and boast of them; and this is as if a thiefe should boast of his robberies: here is a confession of them, but such as is the committing of the same ouer againe; for there wants nothing but the same opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie againe, seeing there is the same affection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, others can iustifie and defend, yea patronize and plead for their owne sinnes, and others, by writing, preaching, example, and countenance: What saith one? I am not alone, I haue company, I loue not to be singular, I do but as others doe; it is the fashion to sweare, at least by faith and troth, and not to doe it, were to be out of fashion; I hope, if I neuer do worse to doe well enough, I hope God is not so straite-laced as you bee. And some are not ashamed (if they be put in minde of themselues, and bee rebuked for their swearing, drunkennesse, or pride) to say, What neede you care? you shall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for my sinnes, you haue enough of your owne to care for: all who must know, that their case is most fearefull: for</p>
                  <p>First, an euill and a naughty heart it is, that can cloake and excuse sinne, and farre from true humiliation, as may <note place="margin">Danger of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne.</note> appeare in <hi>Saul,</hi> who in stead of aggrauating his sinne, found out many excuses, <hi>The people did it,</hi> and, <hi>It is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice to the Lord,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. such is the power of corruption, which we sucked from our first Parents: the <hi>Serpent,</hi> saith one; the <hi>Woman,</hi> saith the other, gaue it me: as though they had reason so to doe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a most dangerous case to lessen a mans
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:18743:84"/>
owne sinne: for it suffers him not to see his misery, hee takes himselfe to be in good case, and to stand in neede of no repentance. For such Christ came not, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 12. they be whole men, and neede not the Phisician: But I pray you, is not that the most dangerous sicknesse of all, when a man hath no feeling of his sicknesse?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a signe, that such a man lyes vnder a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere iudgement of God, seeing the onely way not to be iudged of the Lord, is to iudge our selues, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. Nay it is a thing to be obserued, that euen when the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is euen comming out against the wicked, then will they excuse their sinnes: <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 44. Lord, <hi>when saw wee thee hungry, or thirsty, or in prison, or naked, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred not to thee?</hi> and presently these shall goe into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting paine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how vnlike are these men vnto God, who sets out sinne in a most odious sort? how vnconformable to Gods Law, that sets an eternall curse vpon the head of the least sinne? how farre from the disposition of the godly, who thinke nothing so vile and hatefull as sinne? And how seruiceable to Satan, whose trade is to aduance sinne and colour it?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this teacheth vs to reuerence that ministrie, which would set our sinnes distinctly before vs, which <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 4.</note> helpes vs to sound confession and remission: A necessary doctrine; because, as men naturally loue nothing better then their sinnes, so they can abide nothing lesse then the discouerie of them: Hence <hi>Ahab</hi> hates <hi>Micaiah,</hi> for hee neuer prophecyeth good; that is, he dealt plainely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flatterie; hence the world hated Christ, because hee testified of it that her workes were euill. So, many now a dayes are discontented, The Preacher is too peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, some say too sawcy and busie, and takes too much vpon him, what neede he speake of such and such things? certainely hee receiues information, and opens it in the Pulpit; he is euer in the Law, and bindes me too hard;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18743:85"/>
I would thinke his feete beautifull, if hee would bring tidings of peace. But here is a man loth to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his sinnes, and farre from holy <hi>Dauids</hi> minde, who saith, <hi>Let the righteous smite me, for that is a precious oyle, Psal.</hi> 141. 5. he desires as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 11. that all the world might be still and at rest, and neuer a Trumpet, or voice like a Trumpet to waken it, to shew the people their transgressions, and the house of <hi>Iaacob</hi> their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>These men say to the Ministers, as the Sodomites did to <hi>Lot, Shall hee iudge and rule? Gen.</hi> 19. 9. and as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and his complices said to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Yee take too much vpon you, Numb.</hi> 16. 3. therefore come, <hi>let vs breake their bonds in sunder, and cast away their cords from vs, Psal.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>But know whosoeuer thou art, that thou must looke for no peace by vs, till thou warrest with thy sinnes: Shall wee preach mercie to thee, that feelest no neede of mercie? Shall we cast a pearle to a swine? Thou that art of the frozen generation, that needest a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a sonne of thunder, why expectest thou a <hi>Bar-Ionah? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Horse belongs a whip, and to the Asse a bridle, and a rod to a Fooles back, prou.</hi> 26. 3. Wert thou an humble soule, and hungry after Christ, then our word would be as good newes out of a farre countrey, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25. 25. but till thy wound be lanced, and the core thrust out, wise Surgeons will neuer powre in oyle; doe thou let the plough of the Law breake vp thy fallow ground, and then blame vs if wee bring not the seede of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the fourth point in <hi>Dauids</hi> confession, the manner of it. First, in respect of God: Secondly, of himselfe. For the first: First, hee will confesse before the Lord, and make his sinne knowne to him: Secondly, he will not hide it; the one amplifying the other, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in these phrases. Thou shalt dye, and not liue, <hi>Iohn</hi> confessed and denyed not; so here, <hi>I made knowne, and</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:18743:85"/>
hid not; the doubling of the phrase shewes, that hee doubled not, but did that he did to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>In that <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, hee will confesse <hi>vnto the Lord:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> note, that all true confession of sinne must be made vnto <note place="margin">All sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sin must be made vnto God.</note> God. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>Against thee, against thee onely haue I sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what is the reason hereof?</p>
                  <p>First, because it is God, that is most offended with <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> sinne, his Law is transgressed, his displeasure incurred, and his reuenge prouoked; and what reason haue I to confesse a debt to him, to whom I owe nothing? God is the partie offended, therefore I must go to him alone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he onely can properly forgiue sinne: <hi>Who</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>is a God like vnto thee, that passest by the sinnes of thy people,</hi> saith the holy man? The Iewes that were blind in many things, yet could see well enough, that onely God could forgiue sinnes: and indeede who can remit a debt, but he to whom it is due? therefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>If we confesse our sinne, he is faithfull to forgiue vs, Chap.</hi> 1. 1, 9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, confession is a part of prayer and diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, whereof it is said, <hi>My glory I will giue to none other.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is manifest by the sence of such as truely confesse, who need many compassions; but, <hi>great are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>thy tender mercies, O Lord, Psal.</hi> 119. 156. and hee is <hi>rich</hi> in mercy, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4. All the mercie that can come from Man or Angell, is but a poore mercie, a little mercie, which can doe no good to the satisfying of the debt, or cancelling the bond. Men and Angels are but children, in whom are drops onely, but God is the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in whom is the sea and seate of mercie.</p>
                  <p>But how can a man make his sinnes knowne to God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1.</note> by confession, seeing he knowes them before?</p>
                  <p>First, it pleaseth God so to speake of himselfe, and to <note place="margin">Answ.</note> suffer vs to speake of him, as wee our selues are capable. Thus he brings himselfe in, like an earthly Iudge; who,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18743:86"/>
though he know the facts of the prisoners, yet seemes for the orderly course of iustice not to know them: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 21. Come, <hi>Let vs goe downe and see, if it be according to the cry of Sodome:</hi> how can hee goe downe, who is euery where? and how can hee but see, who is all an eye? but thus hee speakes after the manner of men. So he saith to <hi>Abraham, Now I know thou louest me, who sparedst not thine onely Sonne for mee.</hi> God knew <hi>Abrahams</hi> loue to him before, but now <hi>Abraham</hi> knoweth, that God knowes it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, men are said to hide their sinne, when they seeke to extenuate or lessen, or conceale any necessarie circumstance of it: or seeke colours and shifts, that it should not bee presented naked and bare as it is, in the Lords sight: and then it is said to bee hid from God, not that it is so indeede, (for it is so much the more manifest to God:) but because it is so in the corrupt iudgement of the sinner; which folly soone tooke hold of <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, who thought himselfe well hid from God with trees, and his sinne with leaues.</p>
                  <p>But seeing God knowes all so well, why must we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 2.</note> to him?</p>
                  <p>First, not to make God know any thing which hee <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> knowes not, but hee will haue vs performe homage and duety to him, as an absolute Lord, and soueraigne Iudge. So <hi>Ioshua</hi> said to <hi>Achan; My sonne, confesse, and giue glory to God, Iosh.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that our selues may take better knowledge of our sinnes, and humble our hearts in the sight and <note place="margin">2.</note> sense of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because this is a meanes, in which himselfe will be found mercifull, and which he hath appointed for <note place="margin">3.</note> vs to attaine ease and comfort by: wee must take <hi>Dauids</hi> course here, if we would obtaine an happy discharge of sinne, as he did.</p>
                  <p>But was not <hi>Dauid</hi> farre ouerseene, to confesse onely <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 3.</note>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:18743:86"/>
to God? Why did hee not goe to the Priest, and tell all his sinnes in his eare?</p>
                  <p>Auricular confession of all a mans sinnes in the eare of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> a Priest, as necessarie to saluation, was not knowne in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non dico confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tearis conseruo tuo qui expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret, sed dicito Deo qui sanat,</hi> Chrysost. <hi>in Psalm.</hi> 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> time: besides, he knew he had not sinned against the Priest, and therefore he cared not for his forgiuenes; it was not the Law or bond of any Priest that hee had broken, and therefore what had he to do to forgiue him?</p>
                  <p>Doe you then condemne all confession of man to man? Doeth not S. <hi>Iames</hi> say, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Confesse one to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We allow confession of sinnes to men: First, <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Secondly, <hi>priuate:</hi> in sundry cases. Publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, thus</p>
                  <p>First, for the setting vp of Gods glory, with the shame <note place="margin">1.</note> of a mans selfe. Thus did the holy Pen-men of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">Cases of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to men.</note> writing of themselues, proclaime their owne sinnes to all the world, that God might thereby bee glorified, and his Church edified. And Gods speciall prouidence hath detected in sundry persons those sinnes, which they haue kept close by them, and forced them by a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession vnto men, to glorifie God, as may be seene in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> example. <hi>Gehazi,</hi> not confessing his sinne vpon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Master, to whom God had detected him, was stricken with Leprosie: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi> with death: <hi>Ionas</hi> by his confession to the Mariners, glorified God; and the fruit was, <hi>They feared God excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, men must sometimes publikely confesse <note place="margin">2.</note> their sinne vnto men, for the good of the Church; as, when Christians haue publikely offended the Church of God, they are to giue publike satisfaction by open and free confession: for hereby</p>
                  <p>First, the truth of their Repentance is testified. <note place="margin">Benefits of publike confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to men, foure.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods mercy is publikely implored by the whole Church, which is forceable.</p>

Thirdly, a whole Congregation is instructed, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take heede of like sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the loue of Gods people is notably confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againe to the party. Vpon such a publike confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and humiliation, was the Incestuous person receiued in againe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. it is sufficient, that the same man was <hi>rebuked of many:</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 18. it is recorded of the beleeuers of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that being stricken with a great feare, they came and confessed their workes <hi>before the multitude.</hi> It is much to bee desired, that this publique confession, being an ordinance of Iesus Christ, were more practised in euery congregation, then it is, or is like to be: for if those <hi>that sinne openly, were rebuked open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> others would feare, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we allow also priuate confession of man to man, in two cases: <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in priuate iniuries betweene man and man: for by our sinnes wee may also wrong men, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> and here it will be meete to come and confesse our fault to the party wronged, to testifie: First, our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Secondly, our sound reconciliation. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the speech of Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>If thy brother trespasse against thee seuen times a day, and hee come and say, It repents mee, thou shalt for giue him.</hi> Yea, God himselfe sends <hi>Abimilech</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he had vnwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wronged and offended, to reconcile himselfe to him, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 20 7.</note> that hee might obtaine <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayers: So likewise hee sent <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, hauing wronged him, to <hi>Iob,</hi> to confesse their fault, and get him to intreat of Gods peace <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 41. 8.</note> for them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in trouble of conscience, to finde peace, it is fit to vse the helpe of some speciall man, minister or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being a man of wisedome, gifts, and secresie, to confesse to him both the trouble of conscience, and the cause of the griefe: Of this the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse one to another, &amp; pray one for another.</hi> Now in this case, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16.</note>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:18743:87"/>
although the Minister should bee the fittest man, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a <hi>learned tongue</hi> and studied in the cases of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to minister vnto a wearie soule a word of comfort inseason, and hath speciall promise to be heard, as being a <hi>minister of reconciliation</hi> betweene God and his people; and it is not for nothing, that the Lord vseth this reason to <hi>Abimelech, Goe to</hi> ABRAHAM, <hi>for hee is a Prophet:</hi> Yet that place shewes, that the troubled conscience is not to be tyed to one person, nor to a Priest, but to bee performed also to priuate Christians.</p>
                  <p>Hence wee may see, how farre all this differeth from <note place="margin">1. Difference of Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession from Popish and Auricular.</note> Popish Auricular Confession: For, first, we hold it not a matter of absolute necessitie, to confesse vnto men, as they doe; but that there be cases, wherein it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient or necessarie. Secondly, we vrge not confession of all sinnes, with all the circumstances to bee necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">2.</note> yea, the very thoughts and intentions of the heart; which is</p>
                  <p>First, the rack and gibbet of consciences, and no easer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is fit for such as would know all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of States, Kings, and Kingdomes: all a Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue cannot maintaine so many intelligencers, as make knowne so much to the Pope, as this common leager of confession, in all States, and Courts, and Houses, yea, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes of men and women.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a fit meanes to know the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all persons, by which they know where to haue fit agents for their villanies, fit Patients for their lusts, resolute Catholikes to stab Kings, and blow vp Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houses: But wee leaue it free, and to be onely of those sinnes, which most trouble the conscience, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace of the soule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we inioyne it not at set times, as once a yeere <note place="margin">3.</note> at Easter, but onely when the fore-named occasions are offered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we say it may be made, not to a Priest onely <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:18743:88"/>
or Fryar, and their owne Parish Priest; but, if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be a fit man, then to him; and, if hee be not, then to some other Minister, or in the defect of such a one, then to some ordinarie faithfull Christian, to whom hee may discouer his trouble, with the cause of it.</p>
                  <p>And if all this be so, that confession must be made to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> God: then consider before thou sinne, that thou must go backe to God againe, after thy departure from him by sinne: the Prodigall goes from his Father, but hee must come backe againe; if there be a going from God, there must be a returning to him; if thou hide thy sinne, thou must againe vncouer it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if sinne must be confessed vnto God, then doe it sincerely as before God. In all things, the heart <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> and tongue ought to agree, because the Lord made the one, to expresse the other; and so our Prophet in this confession suffered not his tongue to runne before his <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> wits, but hee thought hee would confesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: so in all the parts of Gods worship, the first thing respected is the heart; whereas contrarily many in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, publike or priuate, haue one thing in their mouth, another in their heart.</p>
                  <p>Againe, thou sinnest before God, before his face, in his sight, the Lord looking on, and standing by; there is nothing which is not naked to his eyes, no darknesse nor night can couer thee, for that is as day to him, with whom is no darknesse: and therefore it is a bootlesse thing to seeke to hide thy sinne from him, hee heard thee lye, sweare, and forsweare; hee saw thee drunken, and committing vncleannesse; thou couldst not flye from his Spirit, his fierie eyes did looke on thee, himselfe stood at thy elbow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thou confessest vnto God, then in confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euer set thy selfe before God, and this will season it <note place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>Necessary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of Confession. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
                     </note> with necessarie qualities: as first, thou wilt bring shame in thy face, and an holy blushing, as it is said, <hi>What fruit</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:18743:88"/>
                     <hi>haue ye of those things, whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> And it is hollownesse and impudencie to offer to confesse foule sinnes, without blushing and shame before God. Oh, said the holy man <hi>Ezra, I am confounded and ashamed to lift vp mine eyes vnto thee:</hi> A good heart, seeing Gods eyes to be set on his nakednesse, stands agast, and ashamed in it selfe, and there is no quietnesse to it, till it bee couered with the garment of Christs righteousnesse: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61, 62, 63. <hi>Then thou shalt remember thy wayes, and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and confounded, and neuer open thy mouth any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou hast done, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, if thou settest thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in confession, it will breed anguish and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of spirit, for that sinne which is confessed, as the conuerts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>were pricked in their hearts</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their sinnes; there will be inward griefe for offending a good God, and grieuing his good Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it will bring in a purpose to leaue and forsake that sinne which is confessed, and all other. Can a man, setting himselfe before God, confesse that sinne which he purposeth to liue in and hold and not forsake? this is but to aske leaue to sinne.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the setting of a mans selfe before God, wil bring in a resolution to renounce all sinne, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> shall say, <hi>What haue I more to doe with Idols?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it will bring in a secret, but most earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of forgiuenesse, for it cannot but consider in God: First, the Maiestie offended: Secondly, the danger of his wrath, which is a consuming fire, and an execution of all the plagues written in the booke of the Law: and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the riches of his mercie, in prouiding so precious a meanes of redemption, which neither man nor Angell could once thinke of, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it breeds a reforming of that which is amisse, and an healing of the error, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8. <hi>Lord, halfe my goods I giue to the poore:</hi> according to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18743:89"/>
counsell of <hi>Samuel</hi> 1. 7. 3. <hi>If ye be come againe to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, it breeds an holy feare for time to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it beholds Gods eye vpon euery sinne, his anger on euery one, till by the bloud of Christ he be appeased, his mercie in forgiuing, that he may be feared; and this feare abates the rage of sinne: nay, it will feare the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and hate the appearance of euill, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 22. and the garment spotted with the flesh, <hi>Iude</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, there is a mourning and complaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden and bondage of sinne: Oh, <hi>who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me from the body of this death!</hi> saith <hi>Paul:</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou made vs to erre from thy wayes, and hardned our heart from thy feare?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, there is great desire, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. namely, a longing to satisfie <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the members of the Church, with desire to be restored to their fauours and fellowship.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Confession to men: For duties of Pietie and Charitie must goe together, or else all is abominable, as appeares, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 9. 10. <hi>Will ye steale, murder, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, and sweare falsely, and burne incense vnto Baal, and walke after other gods whom ye know not; and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say; We are deliuered, though we haue done all these abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations?</hi> So <hi>Isay</hi> 1. 11. <hi>What haue I to do with your sacrifices? &amp;c. for your hands are full of blood, verse.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Against my selfe.]</hi> This is the second branch of the manner of <hi>Dauids</hi> confession, hee will confesse against himselfe. Hence note, that <hi>He that will truely and soundly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> 
                     <hi>confesse his sinne, must become his owne vtter enemie,</hi> he must <note place="margin">A true confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor must be his owne vtter enemy.</note> set himselfe against himselfe as much as possibly he can. So did DAVID here, hee shamed himselfe to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, and spared not his owne name, though a King, so GOD might haue the praise of his mercie, and the Church the benefit of his example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:18743:89"/>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 6. When <hi>Iob</hi> was reproued for his inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate words, he brake out at last into this speech, <hi>I abhor my selfe, and repent my selfe in dust and ashes.</hi> He is a great enemie, that hates man; but farre greater, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors him: yet so was <hi>Iob</hi> to himselfe. <hi>Daniel</hi> in his prayer saith, <hi>I am confounded and ashamed to looke vp to heauen, shame and confusion of face belongs vnto vs this day, Dan.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So close doth he follow the matter against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 15. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rippeth vp his owne grieuous sinnes, in such sort as his greatest enemy could not haue spoken more against him, then he spake against himselfe. Hee was not contented to call himselfe a vile person, but (as though he had said too little) he adds that he is the <hi>chiefest of all sinners.</hi> Who could more accuse the poore Publican then he did himselfe? Oh, <hi>I am not worthy to lift vp mine eyes to heauen, Luc.</hi> 18. 13. and the Prodigall Son, <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy Son, Luc.</hi> 15. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>And good reason it should be so: for</p>
                  <p>First, sound confession is called a iudging of our selues, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. Now in the course of iudgement, there are foure things, all against the partie to be iudged: First, <hi>arraignement;</hi> and this in confession is, when wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and summon our selues before the barre of Gods iustice: Secondly, <hi>examination;</hi> and this is, when wee narrowly inquire of our selues what wee haue done: wherein as the Kings Atturney sifteth out, and exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth euery circumstance of the crime against a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to make it seeme as odious as may be; so should we sift out euery circumstance of our sinne, to make it as vile to our owne eyes as may be, so as our hearts may be conuinced: Thirdly, <hi>conuiction</hi> or pleading guiltie, and confession; &amp; that is, when with the penitent Thiefe, our soules can say, We are <hi>righteously here,</hi> and iustly laid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods indignation, worthy to be cast into Hell. And neuer was he truely humbled, that is, more ashamed to confesse sinne, then to commit it: Fourthly, there is an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18743:90"/>
                     <hi>execution</hi> and holy reuenge, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. and this is, when we beate downe our bodies, and mortifie our members, and vndertake good duties, that the like occasions may be preuented for afterward. These parts of an enemy doth euery humbled soule take vp against it selfe, when it iudgeth it selfe before God; and who can be a greater enemie to himselfe, then he that doth so?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an essentiall difference betweene the <note place="margin">2.</note> sound confessions of the godly, and the slubberd confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the wicked; the godly renounce themselues and their sinnes, but hypocrites doe not, they neuer learned the first lesson of Christianitie, which is selfe-denial, their mindes are set vpon euill workes, and therefore how can they be against them? They repent not but with a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be repented of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all the accusers and enemies, that the child of God hath, if they be put together, cannot obiect halfe <note place="margin">3.</note> so much against him, as hee can against himselfe; men may speake much, but not so much as himselfe. And therefore if he deale truely betweene God and himselfe, he will so shame himselfe, as all his enemies cannot. And for this end, God hath seated the conscience in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the soule, as a Iudge of the actions, and hath giuen it an eye, to pry into the secrets of the heart, and cleared this eye in the regenerate, to discerne more euidently the owne estate, &amp; giuen it a voice to follow the sinner with hue and cry, to make him pronounce the sentence of guiltinesse and death against himselfe; and all this is to iustifie God in any iudgement he brings vpon vs, and to glorifie him when he brings vs out by any deliuerance: But as for the wicked, the eye of conscience in them is dazeled, or quite put out, and lets them goe on to their condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a godly man must become his owne greatest <note place="margin">4.</note> enemie in confession of sinne, because grace must carry a man further then nature can doe: nature can make a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18743:90"/>
man hate sinne, but other mens rather then his owne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 24. <hi>Iudah</hi> thought whoredome worthy of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as it was the custome in those dayes,) in his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law <hi>Thamar,</hi> but not in himselfe; when the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens he had left with her were brought forth, then hee could confesse she was more righteous then he, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with burning; whereas, if shee were worthy to be burnt, then much more he. But grace looketh rather vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans owne sinnes, then anothers, accounting them more venemous, poysonfull, odious, and hate-worthy then anothers. We hate all Serpents deadly, yet not so much those in another countrey, as these in our owne, nor one that is ten foot off, as that that is hard by; the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer he is, the greater is our antipathie and hatred against him. Now seeing euery sinne is a Serpent, therefore we must hate euery one, but that more especially which is neerest and vpon our hands, as the Viper vpon <hi>Pauls,</hi> to shake it off as he did.</p>
                  <p>To come now to the Vses:</p>
                  <p>First, this lets vs see what is the nature of sinne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> men conceiue of it; they thinke not of it as of sinne, if it haue either profit or pleasure with it, but hold and hugge it as a sweet morsell vnder their tongue, they conceiue a great sweetnesse in it; whereas indeede it makes a man his owne greatest enemy. If hee neuer repent, it is an intolerable euill; but if hee doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he sees that the sweetnesse of it is bitter inough, such as makes him say, that the pleasure of sinne is very deare, and bought at too high a rate.</p>
                  <p>A man can bewayle any outward commoditie being lost, and say as <hi>Iaacob</hi> did, I haue lost this and this child, all these things make against me; So, I haue lost such and such commoditie, all these make against me: but, where is the man that can say, Loe my sinnes, these are they that make against mee? But let the wise bee perswaded neuer to thinke of sinne as of a friend, to fall into too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18743:91"/>
acquaintance with it, but know that it is such an enemy, as thy selfe must bee thine owne greatest enemy for it, or else God will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, must a man set himselfe against himselfe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> in his confessions? then this taxeth the practice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men:</p>
                  <p>First, of sundry, who will neither deny their sinnes, nor yet confesse them. They wil not deny them for shame, because it is against their knowledge &amp; conscience; they should seeme to pull the Sunne out of heauen, and deny the light of Nature, if they should say they do not sinne; and as for confession, they will confesse none, though neuer so sinfully done, they deale gently with them, and are loth to fall out with their friends; faults they will confesse them and ouersights, and infirmities which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath, sinnes of weaknesse, though indeede of wickednesse, such as are done by the strength of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neuer resisted.</p>
                  <p>Thus through ancient acquaintance they cannot leaue them, they looke so amiable and louely, thus they flatter themselues in sinne: but if euer such come to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God againe, they must put on another person, and deale in earnest against them, before they can see God friendly in the pardon of them, they must call a spade a spade, that is, confesse sinne to be such as indeed it is; If the question be: what is the vilest thing in the world? The answere must be, These sins; and, Who is the vilest person liuing, the answere may &amp; must be, Themselues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others haue set colours on their sinnes, that they might neuer see the hatefull and ougly face of <note place="margin">2.</note> them: as</p>
                  <p>First, anger and hastinesse, when a man is all on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flame, and burnes all about him, for no iust cause; What will he say? Why, it is but spirit, or at worst heat of nature, and he cannot do withall, it is soone past &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Well, an enemy to his sinne would conclude it to be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18743:91"/>
spirit indeede, but an euill one, and an heate which is kindled from the fire of Hell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, excessiue pride, though men out-runne their degrees, and out-weare all fashions, in attiring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues most immodestly, so that a man may read in broad letters, and great characters, the lightnes of a light mind, yet they say, it is but ornament or complement, or at worst, the fashion. An enemy now to sin would esteeme it, as indeed it is, a fashion vnbeseeming such as professe mortification, &amp; a fashion whereof the Apostle saith, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion not your selues according to this world,</hi> and not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them with Principles drawne out of the Diuels Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, prodigality is but kindnes of nature, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but frugalitie, drinkings after the maner of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but societie &amp; humanitie, Impudency and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but good education; Luke-warmnes in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but good discretion &amp; policy: and, though Christ gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to purchase a people zealous of good works, yet it is thought a mans praise to be no meddler, and to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous is counted nothing but to outrunne the bounds of godlinesse. Thus Satan had taught the world a tricke to harden mens hearts, and hinder them from sound peace and repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, others so tender their names in their publike sins (which are as manifest as a nose on a mans face, as we <note place="margin">3.</note> say:) as they shrinke from shewing themselues in open confession against themselues, and that when Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the good of the Church, yea the peace of their owne consciences calls for confession. But farre are they from the affection of a zealous heart, which would make them turne against themselues and their sinnes, in returning to GOD. This would haue thought that <hi>Dauid</hi> should haue had more care of his credit then thus to rip vp his sinnes, but <hi>Dauid</hi> was of another minde then they.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:18743:92"/>
Fourthly, those (truely so called) Puritanes and Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists that need not repentance, being whole men, in full conformitie with the image of GOD, so deifyed, that they cannot sinne. These are to bee branded with that odious name of Puritanes, and not they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sinnes, and labour to preuent them for time to come. And Papists rather are true Puritans, who say they fulfill the Law, and need not say, Forgiue vs our debts, because GOD is rather indebted vnto them by their workes of supererogation: let men lay the vile reproch of Puritanisme (which is an heresie) vpon these, rather then the godly not deseruing it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this is a ground of instruction, how to carry <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> our selues towards them that are afflicted in soule, and soundly humbled, that we aggrauate not their sinnes, or the danger of their estate, but rather comfort them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they can and doe speake more basely, and thinke more vilely of themselues then we can doe. It is the part of a miserable comforter to adde sorrow to the afflicted. Old <hi>Eli</hi> should haue had more compassion on <hi>Annah,</hi> and not haue beene so inconsiderate as to say shee was drunken: <hi>Oh my Lord</hi> (said she) <hi>I am not drunken, but my soule is troubled within mee,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 16. It was the fault of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, that in stead of comfort, they went about to proue him an hypocrite; Of such the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth in the Canticles, <hi>Thus I was wounded in the house of my friends.</hi> If Gods childrens estate be alreadie heauy, they lay it heauier on them: But, blessed is he that wisely iudgeth the poore.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, seeing in confession of sinne a man should become his owne greatest enemie, we must conscionably <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 4.</note> vse the meanes to become our owne enemies, not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of our bodies, but of our owne body of sinne. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1</note> And what are these meanes.</p>
                  <p>These: <note place="margin">Meanes of sound hatred of our owne sinnes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, let vs search and sift our selues, our estates and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18743:92"/>
wayes. Zeph. 2. 1. <hi>Fanne your selues, fanne your selues, O Nation not worthy to be loued. Lam.</hi> 3. 40. <hi>Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord.</hi> Let vs carry lights into our soules, to see the secrets of them. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Know thine iniquitie:</hi> How? by the Law of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Arist. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de anim. c. vlt.</hi>
                     </note> commeth knowledge of sinne: the more insight into the Law, the more sight of sinne &amp; miserie: being right it selfe it is <hi>index sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> shewing vs what to do, and what is done amisse. See <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let vs take knowledge of the rottennesse <note place="margin">2.</note> and corruptnesse of our nature: for if wee could see our nature aright, we should finde iust cause enough to hate our selues, it being a stinking sinke, a filthy puddle, and an impure fountaine that sends forth muddy streames, a bitter roote sending out odious fruit, such as whereby we shew our selues enemies to God and righteousnesse, hauing the spawne of all sinne in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, meditate on the greatnesse of sinne, examine <note place="margin">3.</note> in what degree and circumstances thou hast sinned, and, as thou hast risen in the degrees of sinne, so rise accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the degrees of humiliation and hatred of them, and of thy selfe for them. A low degree of humiliation will not serue <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> when their sinnes are in high degrees.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let vs looke vpon our sinnes in the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">4.</note> kindes of them, in the fountaine and streames of them, in wandring thoughts, idle words, and prophane hurtfull actions; sinnes by omission of good, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of euill; sinnes of knowledge and presumption or of ignorance, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12. for many sinnes we know not, which we must giue vp to the Lord to bee searched by him, and by his mercy either to be brought to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or graciously passed by; sinnes of youth, or past, to repent vs of them; and of age, either present, to grone vnder them, or future, to feare and preuent. In regard hereof say, Lord, <hi>who knoweth the errours of</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:18743:93"/>
                     <hi>this life? they are in number as the haires of our head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, let vs labour to see the danger of our sinnes: for he that sees an euill, will be the more carefull to preuent <note place="margin">5.</note> the danger of it.</p>
                  <p>First, see the danger of sinne in the infinite Maiestie <note place="margin">Wherein the danger of sin consists: sixe things.</note> of God offended, for he will set himselfe stubbornely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all offenders, that haue not set themselues against themselues, in regard of their sinnes, and put forth his wrath in flaming fire, to render vengeance vpon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in trampling vnder foote the blood of the Couenant, as an vnholy thing: God sent his onely Son <note place="margin">2.</note> Christ Iesus from heauen to take our nature vpon him, and to shed his blood for vs, and yet in sinning we tread it vnder foote: what a dangerous thing is this? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in quenching the motions of Gods good Spirit, who hath often striuen with vs in the ministerie, <note place="margin">3.</note> and betrusted vs with his gifts and graces; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 30. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in staining our honourable profession, which we should rather haue adorned and beautified, as though <note place="margin">4.</note> other men would not debase our profession enough, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we doe too. <hi>We should walke worthy of our high Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> 1. Thes. 2. 12. <hi>and in holinesse, whereunto we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> chap. 4. 7. <hi>being Saints by calling,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 2. <hi>and ought to bee holy, as hee which hath called vs, is holy,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 15. What a shame is it to infringe so excellent priuiledges?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, in repetition of sinne, when wee commit the same sinne againe &amp; againe, euery yeere, moneth, weeke <note place="margin">5.</note> and day, yea euery moment of the day. Better had it been for vs to haue been Gentiles and Painims, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew the trueth, then to heare sinne reprooued, and yet rush presumptuously into it, and after repentance to wallow againe in the mire; See 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21, 22. it is a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18743:93"/>
pittifull and lamentable thing, that a man should wash himselfe from sinne by repentance, and then go and pull Gods vengeance vpon him againe by tumbling himselfe in them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and lastly, the danger of sinne is great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">6 Sinnes against many meanes.</note> wee haue sinned against such great meanes of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as namely, first, against our <hi>vowes,</hi> made in baptisme, and renued in the supper, or which wee haue made of our selues vpon certaine occasions, that wee would doe such or such things no more: all these wee haue kept very slenderly, or not at all, whereas ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie requires performance of a promise, made to man: and is it nothing not to keep touch with God, who hath commanded vs to keepe touch with men? Remember the precept, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, against the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>checkes</hi> of conscience, and is this nothing? Christ saith, <hi>This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and men loue darknesse more then the light: Rom.</hi> 1. 18, 21. Wee reade, that God plagued the Gentiles for neglecting the means of knowledge by the creatures; how much more will he punish vs, that professe the light of grace, and yet spurne against it, as if we were still in the night of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? how many among vs liue in a number of sinnes more odiously, then did many of the Gentiles, who could liue somewhat ciuilly and honestly, in respect of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious enormities?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, against many of <hi>Gods corrections,</hi> both in our selues, and in others: when a childe receiues no good by correction, we thinke his parents wil goe neere to thrust him out of doores; so is it betweene God and vs. See an excellent place, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 18. to 29. <hi>Because we are no whit benefited by other mens chastizements, the sentence is not far off, but is alreadie pronounced against vs, We are weighed in the ballance, and found too light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, against the <hi>great mercies</hi> of God: this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18743:94"/>
the sinne in Gods sight: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. to 13. the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> exaggerates <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne, by shewing him the particular benefits, wherein God had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him, and concludeth; the greater Gods loue was, the greater was his ingratitude and forgetfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>What a number of mercies haue we in this one, that the glorious light of grace shineth so bright vpon vs in the Ministery, whereby we may be put in minde of Gods exceeding loue, and what he deserues at our hands, and what are our sinnes against him, which giue him iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to remooue his blessings from vs? Let vs looke to it; if we doe not vse these large blessings consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, our sinne will be so much the more heauy in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Let vs confesse our sinnes, and vnthankfulnes especially, and in our confessions, become enemies to our selues, (for wee see true confessions are to bee thus qualified) and that by these meanes prescribed, which may helpe vs thereunto.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>And thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne.]</head>
                  <p>DAVID had made himselfe an enemie to himselfe, and now to obtaine that which he laboured for, he makes God his friend; this is the fruite of serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. <hi>Thou forgauest]</hi> The Word signifies to wipe off all the score, namely, the debt of sin and of punishment. <hi>The punishment]</hi> or rather, iniquitie of my sinne (as the Word may be better translated) that is, my wicked sinne; as if he had said, Though it was against my conscience, a foule, filthie, and bloudy sinne, yet thou madest it, as if it had neuer beene.</p>
                  <p>God forgiueth sinne two waies: first, in his owne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counsell, according to his owne decree; and this is, when he accepts the satisfaction of Christ, for the sinne committed against him. Secondly, actually, vpon humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and repentance; and this is, when he puts foorth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18743:94"/>
actuall forgiuenesse in mens owne consciences, whereby he perswades them, that their sinne is forgiuen. And this latter is here spoken of: <hi>Dauids</hi> sinne was remitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by faith in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but now the remission thereof is testified to his owne conscience: and hence hee comes to retaine his former ioy, and his mourning gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is turned into a garment of gladnesse; he had now a comfortable experience of his happie estate. Now in that <hi>Dauid</hi> thought and purposed to confesse, and then it followes presently, <hi>Thou forgauest:</hi> note that</p>
                  <p>So soone as euer a sinner doth truly, and soundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <note place="margin">Doct.</note> his sinne, the Lord doth presently follow with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse: <note place="margin">Remission of sinne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a sound purpose of confession.</note> remission of sinne doth immediatly follow a very intent and purpose to confesse it. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>Hee that hideth his sinne, shall not prosper: but he that confesseth and forsaketh it, shall haue mercy.</hi> There must be forsaking of sinne with confession, to shew the soundnes of it, and then presently followes remission. And why?</p>
                  <p>First, it is grounded on Gods faithfulnesse, who hath <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> made a promise, for this fruite of confession; 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we confesse our sinnes, he is faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from all vnrighteousnesse.</hi> As if he should say, God of his infinite mercy, hath promised to all true penitents and confessors, that he will forgiue and neuer remember their sinnes any more, he must stand to his promises, or else he should be vnfaithfull: and <hi>hee is iust</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>to forgiue;</hi> a man would haue <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9.</note> thought, he would rather haue said, Hee is mercifull to forgiue: no, but hee is iust to forgiue the sinnes of true beleeuers, because they are all satisfied for, their whole debt is paid, and Gods iustice will not let him demaund the same debt twice, of the suretie, and of the debter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, true confession is a fruite of sound conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <note place="margin">2</note> at the first act whereof, all a mans sinnes are done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, although the tydings of it comes not so soone to his owne conscience. This appeares in the example
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18743:95"/>
of <hi>Dauid</hi> here; he no sooner <hi>said,</hi> that is, truly resolued to confesse, but the Lord remitted his sinne, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, saying, <hi>Thy sinne is put away, thou shalt not die:</hi> see the storie, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7, 13. The prodigall sonne saies, He will goe to his Father, and whilest yet he is comming, before his confession, <hi>his father sees him a farre off, runnes to meete him, falles on his necke, and kisseth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, true confession is a signe of adoption. Now where this is, there is a heart resolued to seeke God, so <note place="margin">3.</note> that a man puts off all his former hatred of him, and the affections of his heart are sanctified, to desire peace and reconciliation with God: this cannot proceede from a heart that is now at enmitie with God, as it was by nature, but which is a friend, and reconciled. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reprobate person can desire saluation out of selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, and to saue his skinne, but not properly reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but a godly man desires Gods loue and friendship, and reconciliation with him, for his owne sake, more then, and aboue his owne saluation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, remission must needes attend sound confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; because this confession is ioyned with some kind, <note place="margin">4.</note> and seede of sauing faith, which, be it neuer so small, is a fruite of the sanctifying Spirit, and makes a man parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Christ, and in him of God the Father with all his blessings: for in this confession, as wee haue noted, there is</p>
                  <p>First, a deniall of a mans selfe, which is a worke of the renewing Spirit, which whosoeuer hath, he is the childe of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is in it an apprehension of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull nature with application, and taking hold of it for himselfe; which application is either not at all, or false in the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is in it a true touch, which holds on in seeking God; whereas in the wicked, there are some good wishes and confused apprehensions: but, being
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18743:95"/>
without sinceritie, fall off, and come to nothing. Whence we conclude, that true confession of sinne goeth alwaies with remission and pardon of it.</p>
                  <p>But, how can confession be sound, before sin bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, seeing nothing can be acceptable where sinne is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1.</note> not pardoned? it seemes rather that confession should follow remission.</p>
                  <p>To answere this, we must conceiue, that in God, the iustifying of a mans person, his sanctification, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.</note> and confession are al giuen at once, at the same moment, because at the first acte of grace, there is a change in the whole soule: but in respect of vs, of our apprehension and application, one grace goeth before another; as the cracke of thunder and lightning are both at one time: but we see one, before we heare the other, because our sight is more quicke and apprehensiue then ourhearing. Likewise these graces are wrought all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by God, yet in regard of vs and our sense and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, pardon comes after confession.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God in the beginning of our conuersion giues vs that grace, the which he doth not presently giue <note place="margin">2.</note> the feeling of. As a child in the wombe liues and moues, but hath no knowledge of his life and motion: so Gods children are in a comfortable estate, but they know not the comfort of their estate; Gods graces in them are in so small degree, that they can scarce acknowledge that, which in truth is in them.</p>
                  <p>But wee see, that numbers of men haue confessed their <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2.</note> sinnes, and yet had them not remitted. <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Caine</hi> confessed, and yet remission of sinne did not follow, they were reprobates.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine speaks of sound confession, such as they <note place="margin">Ans.</note> had not: for first, it was not voluntarie, but extorted: <note place="margin">Vnsound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> Reprobates cannot say as <hi>Dauid, I will confesse,</hi> but are drawne out by head and eares of God thereunto; they would stil haue hid their sins if they could; therfore their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18743:96"/>
confession was no freewill-offering, and so not sound nor accepted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it seekes not ease of sinne, but ease of sense, desiring onely that God would take out of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the horrors of hell, and it looketh on the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not the offence done against Gods Maiestie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it proceedes not from a childlike feare of God, but seruile, without any true purpose of godlines. <hi>Saul</hi> indeed said, <hi>I haue sinned, I obeyed the people foolishly:</hi> but, though he thus confessed, yet he doth feare the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple still; and therefore he saith vnto SAMVEL; <hi>I pray thee honour mee before the people:</hi> a true feare of God would haue hated the occasion of sinne, as well as the sin it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it proceeds not from lowlinesse, pouertie of spirit, or from meeke and humble subiection to God, as the godlie's doth, who iustifie Gods proceedings, cleare him in his iudgement, repose themselues in his mercy, and waite with hope and confidence for a gracious issue, but with murmuring, pride, and hardnesse of heart, as in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or with final desperation, as in <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But euen the godly themselues will often bid battell to this doctrine, and say, Alas! if assurance of remission <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> follow sound confession, what shall I thinke of my selfe? I haue long bewailed my sinnes, and yet rest without this assurance; my case is not <hi>Dauids,</hi> either my confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not sound, or my person not in the state of grace, or this doctrine vnsound.</p>
                  <p>We must distinguish between the presence of a grace and the sense of it; a grace may be there present, where <note place="margin">Answ.</note> there is no feeling: there may bee the presence of Gods loue, faith, and remission of sinne, where there is no sense of them.</p>
                  <p>How can this be, seeing faith is a full assurance and <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> certaine perswasion? can a man be thus perswaded, and yet not feele it?</p>
                  <p>

Yes: first, there may be faith, where there is no such <note place="margin">Answ.</note> assurance, as many complaints of Gods children in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation do witnesse abundantly: <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> thought, God had quite cast them away, and hid his face in vtter displeasure; here are beleeuers and faith, yet no sense. Was Christs righteous heart euer destitute of faith? did his Father euer cease to loue him? surely no, wee may <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christs promise is, <hi>Blessed is he that beleeues, though he see not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We must distinguish betweene the want of faith, and the weaknesse of it: vnfeelingnesse comes through weakenesse, and not alwayes of the want of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Prayer for that grace, which seemes to be absent, is a signe of the presence; and, prayer for sense and feeling of pardon is a fruit of faith.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, There be sundry degrees and measures of faith; some Saints are as the weeke, which can smoke only and not flame, yet the least graine of faith layeth hold on Christ to saluation.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, In temptation it is sufficient, that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren liue the life of God, though they know not that they liue. In a swoune a man liues, though he perceiues it not; it is sufficient, that other men know he liues; a little embers lyes vnder a heape of ashes; so Gods child hath that in him, which shall support and sustayne him vnto greater perfection, though he know not his graces.</p>
                  <p>First then, this serues to ouer-throw a doctrine of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> Church of Rome, which is, that remission of sinne doth follow Confession <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that is, If one come and confesse all his sins auricularly, then the very worke wrought doth carry away pardon: But this is vtterly false, that God hath tyed remission of sinne to the very worke of Confession, because Confession is effectuall only so farre forth as the person confessing is a beleeuer,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18743:97"/>
sanctified, and iustified. Else why was not <hi>Sauls</hi> sinne remitted, seeing it was confessed? the only reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he, as also <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> were not in the state of grace. First then, pardon belongs to the person, that is accepted through Christ, not to the worke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Papists speake this of confession to the Priest, which is the racke of the ignorant world, but <hi>Dauid</hi> of confession to God which bringeth peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their Absolution, which is pronounced on Confessors, is most blasphemous, and preiudiciall to Gods royall and high prerogatiue. The blinde Iewes could say, <hi>Who can forgiue sinnes but God?</hi> And, <hi>Nathan</hi> said not, <hi>I,</hi> but, <hi>God hath put away thy sinne.</hi> So that this their absolution belongs not to any Prophet or Apostle, ordinary or extraordinary, nor to any of their successors; no, not to Christ himselfe as man. Which is the rather to be obserued, to meet with their blasphemous opinion, for which they lay this ground.</p>
                  <p>Christ (say they) was God and Man. As God, he had an absolute power to forgiue sinnes: As man, hee hath a proper power, and that is deriueable to the Priest, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Christs place, to whom he delegates a power to forgiue, as himselfe had power to forgiue; and for this that place is brought, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 21. <hi>As the Father hath sent me, so send I you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To answere this, We will not consider Christ as God; (for so there is no question, but he may, and doth forgiue sinne:) but two wayes else: first, as Mediator, God and man. Secondly, as man, altogether of our nature if we were without sinne. As Christ is Mediator and King of his Church, so he deriues to his Ministers, not a power of remission, but a ministery of remission of sinnes; not to forgiue sinne, but to pronounce, that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen it: this only hath he left to the Church. But as he is meere man, he hath no power to forgiue sinne, but as being the sonne of man, hee is likewise the Sonne of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18743:97"/>
God: In the time of his humiliation he said not, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue mine enemies, but, <hi>Father, forgiue them, they know not what they doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the place, which they abuse to their irreligious opinion, we must note, first, that it is spoken of Christ to his twelue Apostles, and not of any Euangelicall Priests. Secondly, it importeth only a similitude and likenesse betweene Gods sending of Christ, and Christs sending of his Disciples, but not any equality, that suppose Christ as man had power to forgiue sinnes, yet not that they should bee equall vnto him herein, and haue the same power that he had.</p>
                  <p>And the similitude stands in these foure things:</p>
                  <p>First, Christ was before all Worlds, ordained to bee a Mediatour: so they were ordained to the office of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship, not of Priesthood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Christ himselfe was immediately called to the publike execution of his office of Mediatorship, by the voice of his Father, as appeares in his Baptisme; <hi>This is my well-beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased:</hi> so were the Apostles immediately called by Christs owne voice: <hi>And this was their prerogatiue aboue other Ministers, to come from Christs owne bosome, as he did come from the bosome of his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as Christ in publishing the Gospell, had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and absolute authoritie to giue Lawes to his Church, from which there might be no appeale: So his Apostles had from him an immediate assistance of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie, so as they could not faile in their doctrine and writings; howsoeuer as men they might erre, yet not as Apostles; so that from them there lay no appeale.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as Christ was made a King and a Prophet, not onely of the Church of the Iewes, but ouer all the Churches in all Nations: so the Apostles commission was not tied to any one Countrey, but they must goe and teach all Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:18743:98"/>
And thus it is true, that as God sent Christ, so Christ sent them; but all the while here is no equalitie: for to make ordinarie Ministers equall to Christ in power, is to make them Mediatours and redeemers, yea, gods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ouerthrowes another doctrin of theirs, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> teaching, that no man can be perswaded of the remission of his owne sinnes, vnlesse it be by a speciall reuelation, or by a morall certaintie of workes; whereas we see <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> here had this perswasion of forgiuenesse by neither, but by a certainty of faith vpon true confession.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, seeing remission of sinnes is a fruite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> we see the errour of silly ignorant people, that say, they are as sure of remission as any man in the world, they hope as well as the best, nay, are sure to bee saued with the first; if any get remission of sinne, they are sure it shall be they; and all this without sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. But how is this remission sealed vp vnto them? by what pattents? they neuer had any doubting, no touch of conscience for sinne, no dislike of themselues, they neuer confessed to the Lord against themselues; and therfore the Lord neuer answered them in assuring them of forgiuenes. There is nothing yet in their liues but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes and rebellion; and therfore this is but a senselesse presumption which destroyeth their soules.</p>
                  <p>Others, not a few there are, that thinke to ease their conscience, by lessening their sinne, or excusing it. Some say before the Angell it was their ignorance, and so mince their sinne, and harden their soules, till the Lord be angry at their words, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 6. Others seeke to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, while he knocketh and vrgeth their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If they can thrust him out of presence, and put out the remembrance of himselfe, and the feare of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Oh then they be safe. But how are these men wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deluded, that thinke themselues safest and best, when God is farthest off them?</p>
                  <p>Others, when sinne comes afresh vpon them, draw
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18743:98"/>
their thoughts, and turne their sailes another way, as when <hi>Sauls</hi> furious thoughts come vpon him, they must be appeased by <hi>Dauids</hi> musike, whereas remission must be gotten by confessing, and not by committing of sin. Some must haue Iesters to fill their hearts full of folly, to take God and all good motions and remembrance of sin out of their soules; whereas, of all the delights that euer <hi>Salomon</hi> tried his heart withall, wee neuer reade that hee kept a Iester or Foole. Some, when a warning peece of humiliation is shot off by God, haue no better way to resist it, and to driue away the qualmes of conscience, then by sorting themselues with drinkers, gamesters, and good fellowes, as they call them; and, as euery mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light drawes him, so is his practice. But this is no other then the brawning of the conscience, farre from lasting peace, which comes from remission of sinnes, and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion comes not from commission, but confession of sinne.</p>
                  <p>If men, that are now called to confession and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the Word, or the Spirit, or any of Gods works on themselues or others, will yet doe as the hardned Iewes, <hi>kill Oxen and Sheepe, and drinke wine in boules, and</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>What? cannot God, without the condition of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and sorrow and confession of sinne, remit sinne, and conferre fauour vpon sinners?</p>
                  <p>Yes, if we speake of Gods absolute power, whereby <note place="margin">Ans.</note> he can doe a number of things which he neuer will; hee could haue made 10000. Worlds, when he made but one; hee could raise vp of stones children to <hi>Abraham;</hi> Christ could haue prayed for 12. Legions of Angels, and his Father could haue sent them to deliuer him, or hee could without them haue deliuered him from the Crosse, but would not. Thus if God would, hee could remit sin without repentance and confession, and that without all impeachment of his goodnesse; because whatsoeuer hee can will, is most iust and good: but if we consider Gods actuall power, and his reuealed will, which belongs to vs and our children, he cannot, because he will not: the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29.</note> reasons hereof are these:</p>
                  <p>First, it will not stand with his eternall decree, by which he hath tied the meanes and ende together; the end is saluation, the meanes to come to it is faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So God hath decreed, that a mans body should liue by meanes; he could now preserue it without meat, drinke, sleepe, &amp;c. but hee will not, because it is against his decree. Againe, God hath not eternally decreed to saue all, but out of all a few, a little flocke: now if hee should remit the sinnes of the impenitent, and of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18743:99"/>
then he should saue all, and so the way to heauen should bee the broad way, and not many, but, all should goe in it; which was <hi>Origens</hi> errour, directly against <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Orig. in. Libro</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Gods decree and word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it will not stand with the iustice of God, to forgiue their sinnes, who repent not of them, but rather loue them, who obey their lusts, and follow the leading of them most willingly: 2. Thes. 1. 6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God, to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi> If God haue any iustice, he must exercise it against such <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Est tamen quaedam Specialis Vniuersalitas,</hi> Ambros.</note> as hate him, and reiect all his commandements: but to saue all, would prooue him to bee a God all made of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God could haue no mercy, if hee should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the sinnes of all, good and bad: for there could be no difference betweene his mercie and his iustice; this is mercy to some, to pull them out of the common corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and curse of sinne, and mercy only reioyceth against iudgement: if there were no iudgement, neither could there bee any mercy. Besides, will it stand with Gods wisedome, to bestow and giue mercy to him that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and despiseth it, or to fill with mercy the vessels of wrath?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where were Gods truth, if he should forgiue the sinnes of impenitent and vnbeleeuing ones? what strength were in the curses of the Law, that the soule that sinnes, shall die? to what vse could the promises of the Gospell serue? what vse of the prayer of Christ for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, that his Father would keepe them in the truth? why did he put such difference betweene men, that hee would not so much as pray for the World? What neede of the death of Christ? of whom the Apostle saith, <hi>The Iust died for the vniust, but so as they should be righteous in him:</hi> or, what neede of any part of his righteousnes and obedience, who fulfilled the Law for righteousnesse to euerie one that beleeueth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:18743:100"/>
Fifthly, God hath made it a priuiledge of the Church, and the members of it onely, to haue their sinnes forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: So we say in the Creed, <hi>I beleeue the Communion of Saints, and remission of sinnes.</hi> Isa. 33. 24. <hi>The people that dwell there, shall haue their iniquitie forgiuen:</hi> and 62. 12. <hi>They shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Forgiuenesse of sinnes then is a part of the promise of God, made to those that are in couenant with him: Ier. 31. 31, 34. <hi>The dayes come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new couenant; for I will forgiue their iniquitie, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their sinnes no more.</hi> Yea, this Psalme in the first verse, makes it a note of a blessed man, and a prerogatiue of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if God should bestow remission of sinnes in <note place="margin">Qui iam viuit proùt vult, viuet aliquando proùt non vult.</note> generall to all, what neede is there of any grace, what vse of the feare of God, of faith, &amp;c? then we might set open all the doores of licenciousnesse and sinne, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might doe what hee list without all restraint or bridle. So that to tye remission of sinne to repentance, makes not onely for our saluation hereafter, but also to correct and bridle sinne here, and set vs into the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of eternall life, euen in this present World.</p>
                  <p>But how is this remission of sinne free, if wee cannot <note place="margin">Quest.</note> haue it without these conditions of faith, repentance, confession, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>Yet is it still free: first, because, though it bee not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Ans.</note> without these, yet it is not giuen for these, as our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is free, though it cannot be had without faith, <note place="margin">Fides iustificat non nisicorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiuè.</note> because it is not giuen for the dignitie of our faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, euen these conditions are not of our selues, but the gifts of God, and so can merit nothing. Thirdly, faith and repentance are required not to shew for what, but to whom remission of sinnes is bestowed, namely, to such only as haue obtained mercy, and for whom Christ hath freely merited the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:18743:100"/>
This serues to confute a grosse and ignorant conceit of many, who say, That God, who made all, will saue all, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> and so lay all the care of saluation on God, and neuer trouble themselues in vsing the meanes. Alas, poore soules! No, no, neuer thinke that thou canst diuorce what God hath coupled, namely, the ende from the meanes; it is true, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, Hee that made thee without thee, doth not saue thee without thee.</p>
                  <p>Why, say some, did not Christ dye for all and euerie <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> man? and shall not they bee saued, for whom Christ dyed?</p>
                  <p>To this the Schoolemen say, that Christ dyed for all <note place="margin">Ans.</note> 
                     <hi>sufficienter,</hi> but not <hi>efficaciter:</hi> Christs merits were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to redeeme 10000. Worlds, if they had faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, saith <hi>Leo.</hi> But we speake of the effectuall shedding of Christs bloud, which was shed for many (not all) to the remission of sinnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Christ died for all, that is, for all those many, saith <hi>Augustine,</hi> namely, all the Elect, for the sinnes of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Totus mundus de toto mundo exemptus &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptus,</hi> Amb.</note> the World of the Elect: for there is a World of the Elect, standing of Iewes and Gentiles, who are brought to faith and repentance. Thirdly, all and euery singular man cannot receiue remission of sinnes, but onely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by the hand of faith, some of all sortes of men: now the Apostle saith, that <hi>faith is not of all men; and therefore it is called the faith of the Elect:</hi> Tit. 1. 1. <hi>Therefore let no man deceiue you with vaine words: for, for such things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience,</hi> Ephes. 5. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this doctrine wee may see, that no man <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> can be assured of remission of sinnes, but the true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, who truly repenteth of his sinnes. Euery man indeed will professe in his Creed, that he beleeueth the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes: but this is but a vaine blast in the most, whose sinnes binde them ouer to eternall death. Onely
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18743:101"/>
the true beleeuer hath the right markes of remission of sinne, which are these.</p>
                  <p>First, he onely is weary and heauy laden, and sees his <note place="margin">1. Notes of a man dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of his sins.</note> neede of Christ, whereas the wicked are whole in part, or wholly, and neede not the Physician.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, onely hee hath a spirit free from guile, which is made a note of remission, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. Of all other <note place="margin">2.</note> we may say, as <hi>Peter</hi> did of <hi>Simon Magus; Thy heart is not right with God:</hi> one mans heart is a temple of Gods Spirit; another hath not the Spirit of Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not his.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, onely a true beleeuer hath the consequents <note place="margin">3. Fruites of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins.</note> and fruites of remission of sinnes, from which, as from fruites, we may goe to the tree: as</p>
                  <p>First, the first of them is regeneration, he is borne of <note place="margin">1.</note> God, and sinneth not, that is, he hath not raigning sinne with him, nor sinne vnto death, because the seed of God is in him: as for others, who professe remission of sinne, they are slaues to their sinnes, and these haue dominion ouer them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another is a daily purging and clensing of <note place="margin">2</note> the reliques and remainders of sinne, as 1. Iohn 1. 9. <hi>God is faithfull to forgiue vs, and to cleanse vs from all vnrighteousnesse: he that hath his sinnes couered, hath them also cured.</hi> Of Christ it is said, <hi>that he came by water and bloud, &amp;c.</hi> Hee that is made whole, goes and sinnes no more, that is, he feares sinne for time to come. Professe then remission of sinnes as long as thou wilt: If Christ wash thee not, thou hast no part in him; if thou beest as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 8.</note> foule as formerly thou wast, euery man but thy selfe may see what thou art.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third fruite is faith working by loue, and this loue worketh: first, towards God, who is much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <note place="margin">3.</note> because he hath loued and forgiuen much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47 and much praised for so happie a change. But the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are haters of God, and neuer care for his prefence,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18743:101"/>
for his word or children or Sabbaths, and yet they hope vainely for forgiuenesse of sinne. Secondly, it works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, and manifests it selfe in forgiuing our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and enemies. The godly looke vpon the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>Forgiue one another, euen as God for Christs sake forgaue vs.</hi> But alas! many pray, <hi>Forgiue vs as we forgiue our debters,</hi> and therein plainely curse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; for their minds lust after enuy and wrath, and hence are those common speeches; I may forgiue him, but I will not forget him, and, He may come in my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster,</hi> but not in my Creede: A manifest signe, that God hath not forgiuen thee at all, and that his forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thee is not to forget thee nor thy sinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is refuge for a wearie soule, and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> conscience: doest thou want the voice of ioy and gladnesse in thy soule, and lyest groning vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of sinne? be not dismaied, for in that thou canst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch Gods presence in the full and free accusing of thy selfe, in complaining of thy self, and iudging thine owne soule, here is a sound ground of comfort, thou art hee, who hath right into the tree of life; thou art hee, on whom the Lord will looke in mercy, thy repentance and faith intaile pardon of sinne vnto thy soule.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, is it so, that God remits onely the sinnes of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> repentants? then aboue all things labour to attaine this grace of repentance, and testifie it in sound confession before God; In the Courts of men, confession brings shame and punishment, but in Gods, a couer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In great Princes Courts, no mourner might come; and therefore <hi>Ioseph</hi> must put off his prison-garments before he come to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but none but mourners are accepted in Gods Court; mourne therefore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile thy sinnes; this alone can assure the heart of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Oh, I haue repented long of my sinnes, but feele no <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> such assurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:18743:102"/>
Yet feare not, but ioyne to these endeuours these <note place="margin">Answ.</note> helpes:</p>
                  <p>First, vse conscionably the Word and Sacraments, which make knowne and seale vp to the beleeuer the pardon of sinne by Christ; meditate and feede on the promises which are made to the penitent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, grow vp in humility, euery day bee more low in thine owne eies then others, and beware of pride, because it becomes thee to bee humble: for the more contrite the spirit is, the fitter it is for Gods Spirit to dwell in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, vse earnest and daily prayer for the earnest of the Spirit, to witnesse vnto thy spirit, that thou art the childe of God: for he, being the Comforter, must bring these comfortable tidings to thy heart, he must apply the promises of life and saluation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, take heede of actuall sinnes, which grieue the Spirit, and are as water to quench the comforts of the same; especially beware of presumptuous sinnes, which wound the Spirit most, and most preuaile ouer thee: <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, exercise thy selfe to godlinesse, and to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of sanctification in thy generall and speciall calling, and this will assure thee of the presence of the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit leading thee.</p>
                  <p>These things if thou failest in, blame thy selfe if thou walkest heauily and vncomfortably; God will be found in his owne waies, and no other.</p>

                  <p>Those are the best teachers, that can speake from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> of the Lords working in themselues. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. <note place="margin">Those are the best teachers that can teach from their owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> The Prophet teacheth confidence and securitie in God, to those that are vnder the secret of the most High, but the best ground he thought was to lay it on his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18743:103"/>
verse 2. <hi>I said to the Lord, O my hope and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse,</hi> that is, I had a good cause so to say; and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>Surely, hee will deliuer thee from the snare of the hunter, &amp;c.</hi> So likewise the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> being to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that the remnants of corruption cannot condemn the regenerate man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. hee inforceth it from his owne experience, thus, <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Christ Iesus, hath freed me from the Law of sinne and of death;</hi> as if he had said, Of like things and persons there is the like consequence, My infirmities are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto me to death, no more shall yours.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of this point are these:</p>
                  <p>First, he that hath a flame in his owne heart, may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> kindle another, and hee that doth not first edifie his owne heart, shall not be so meete to edifie and speake to the heart of another; a godly mans zeale will warme such as are by, when another shall speake but coldly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this man shall deliuer the Word with much certainety and assurance, because hee speaketh with fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <note place="margin">2.</note> A man may out of reading and light of vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be powerfull in speech, and yet want the seasoning of grace, and speake of many delicates which are vpon the Kings table, whereof himselfe neuer tasted: but hee that hath tasted and fed on them, shall both speak more, and more certainely, and be better beleeued.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee that hath experience of the Word hee teacheth, will build euery way, not onely by doctrine, <note place="margin">3.</note> exhortation, and reproofe: but also first, by example, which greatly preuailes and vrgeth men to glorifie God in the day of visitation: Secondly, by Prayer in secret with God for his people: his experience of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of godlinesse inflames his affection as <hi>Pauls,</hi> whose loue to his countrey was such, as hee could haue beene contented to be accursed for their saluation, he wisheth all like him, and that euery man had part in Christ as he hath, and as earnest is his endeuour. And this prayer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18743:103"/>
of faith hath great power with God, and a promise of blessing vpon a mans selfe and his labours, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other wants.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God giueth more speciall gifts and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to speciall men to this purpose, to inable men to his <note place="margin">4.</note> worke: as 2. Cor. 1. 14. <hi>We were comforted in our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we might be able to comfort them that are afflicted, with the same comforts wherewith God hath comforted vs:</hi> plainely noting, that hee is not so fit to comfort others, who hath not experience of the comforts of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The same <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth of the matter of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Psal. 40. 10. <hi>I haue not hid thy righteousnesse within my heart, but haue declared thy trueth and saluation, and haue not concealed thy mercy and trueth from the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:</hi> where hee shewes, that his first care was to confirme and strengthen himselfe by Gods promises, and, when God had taught his heart, he would and did publish, not onely Gods trueth, but also his mercy and saluation vnto others; namely, that which his own soule had experience of.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, a good teacher is the Phisician of mens soules: now a good Phisician is the experienced Physician that <note place="margin">5.</note> can finde out the disease and maladie of sinne, and hath approoued medicines to cure a sinfull heart, not so much out of books and reading, as out of practice, that knows the danger of sinne in himselfe, and thereby hath pittie and loue to remoue it in another. And hence in the Law <note place="margin">Ad hoc opus, quò quis sanctior est, eò tardior est.</note> no man might be entred into the ministerie before hee were thirtie yeeres old, that the Priests might first learne to teach and be of some ripenesse and experience, before they taught others. Whence <hi>Nazianzen</hi> saith, Our Lord was thirty yeeres old, before he began to be a Preacher: <hi>&amp; tu magister vis fieri antequam discipulus:</hi> yet is it he that teacheth all, had need learne of none, and therefore wee should learne before we teach.</p>
                  <p>But whether may an vnregenerate Minister saue and <note place="margin">Quest.</note> conuert a man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:18743:104"/>
I mooue this question the rather, because many can <note place="margin">Answ.</note> scarce be perswaded to heare such, whose liues are scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, as being vnworthy to take the Word into their mouthes, and vnable to conuert or amend others. In sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of whom, I would not any way confirme or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Ministers, who being Phisicians cure not themselues, or who like the images in high-wayes point others the way, but themselues stirre neuer a foote in it, or like the file, which smootheth other things, but it selfe remaines rough. Howbeit euen of these, I know no restraint in the Scripture or let, why they may not bee meanes of conuersion to others: The Reasons that mooue mee to thinke so, are these:</p>
                  <p>First, the ministerie is Gods owne ordinance, and the power of it stands not in the person of the messenger, <note place="margin">1.</note> but in the worke of his owne spirit. 1. Cor. 3. 5. <hi>Paul may plant and</hi> Apollos <hi>may water, but God must giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi> The fruit of preaching is not left to the highest Ministers in the New Testament, not to Euangelists, no nor Apostles. A gracious Prince giues a Pardon to a condemned person: Now suppose he should send it by the very est miscreant in his Kingdome, doth the Pardon lose his vertue therefore? or were hee not mad, who should therefore refuse it? So, a Physician sends a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne potion or cordiall by some rakehell boy in the shoppe; doth this hinder the worke and vertue of the Physicke to him that takes it according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? The case is the same, and sheweth that the Word is not made worse by his vnworthinesse, who bringeth it.</p>
                  <p>And neither doth the worthinesse of the Preacher make the Word effectuall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the best being but earthen vessels, in whom God puts this heauenly treasure, that <hi>the power might be knowne to bee of God, and not of men,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 7. and, Rom. 1. 16. <hi>it is the power of God to saluation, to euery one that beleeueth; and not of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:18743:104"/>
Secondly, the praise and glory of our conuersion must <note place="margin">2</note> wholly bee ascribed vnto GOD, whereas this conceit would much turne it off vpon man. And if a man shall say, that an vnregenerate Minister can goe as far in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting a man as a regenerate, it wil not seeme vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to him that considers first, that God often doth excellent good and great workes by bad agents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee gets himselfe the more glory of his wisedome, power, and goodnesse. Secondly, where God giues a man a calling, he may and doth often blesse the worke, which is his, though not the person working. Thirdly, that the whole worke of a man in conuerting others is externall, which this man can performe as well as hee that is conuerted: for the true preaching of the Word is the parent of faith, and wholesome doctrine is the immortall seede of our new birth, which none denies but many vnregenerate men do and can deliuer. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that vnlesse God giue more then the most gracious Preacher can giue, nothing can be done; nay, that God giues more by a Minister then himselfe hath, be he good or bad. <hi>Augustine</hi> was first conuerted by <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and afterward went farre beyond him in light and in grace, &amp; so <hi>Dauid</hi> out-stripped his teachers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 98, 99. And doth not God herein make his glory shine, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest himselfe to be the giuer of all that grace, when the instrument conuayes more then it selfe hath?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, why hath the Lord thought good to send both sanctified men, and vnsanctified? <hi>Balaam</hi> speaketh <note place="margin">3.</note> Scripture: <hi>Saul</hi> is among the Prophets: <hi>Iudas</hi> teacheth and worketh miracles among other Apostles: and in the day of iudgement many shall say, Lord, wee haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and wrought miracles in thy name, whom Christ neuer knew, but will say to them, Depart from me, yee workers of iniquitie. Why doth he make the Word in a sanctified mans mouth oftentimes the sauour of death? Why are wee straitly commanded to heare wicked men
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18743:105"/>
that sit in <hi>Moses</hi> his chaire, and to doe what they say, if there were no sauour of life in their worke; and if that of the Prophet were not true, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 10, 11. The Word of God (who euer brings it) <hi>returnes not in vaine,</hi> but accomplisheth the worke, whereunto hee sent it; and if the ministerie of vnregenerate men were alwaies without efficacie?</p>
                  <p>We deny not but hee may prepare to conuersion, and build the conuerted, and condemne the wicked; but, to <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> winne men to saluation, wee are not perswaded of his abilitie.</p>
                  <p>What? is the Word in his mouth strong meate; and cannot it be milke too? and why should God vse him in <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the one chiefe ende of his calling, and not in the other? no reason can be giuen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> seeing many false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preach <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not purely, but of enuy and pride, <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 18. disdained not, but said, <hi>I reioyce that Christ is preached any manner of way: Gaudet in re, non in modo,</hi> saith one: He knew that if Christ were preached, some would lay hold on him, and be called out of their estate of Heathenisme and Gentilisme; and that though the preaching of these euill men did not themselues good, yet it was good for the Church. They were like the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctor Ecclesiae benè docendo &amp; malè viuendo, instruit Deum quomodò eum debeat condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare.</hi> Chrysost.</note> of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, who built an Arke for others, and perished themselues. And why was <hi>Paul</hi> so carefull, lest while he preached saluation to others, himselfe should be reprobate? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. if a man might not himselfe miscarrie, preaching saluation to others.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but God hath promised no blessing to his labor, but a curse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3, 4. the vngodly shall <hi>not prosper</hi> as <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> the godly doe.</p>
                  <p>First, the worke of an vnregenerate Minister, that is called by GOD, is Gods worke, and not onely his. <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Secondly, his worke shall not prosper to himselfe, nor he in it; but I know nothing, that can stop Gods mercy,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18743:105"/>
why it may not be prospered to another. Thirdly, those promises and threats in the first Psalme, concerning the prosperitie of the godly, and vnhappinesse of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, are not directly meant of outward things or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of inward and spiritual; &amp; thus the wicked neuer prospers in any thing he takes in hand, and thus the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuer miscarry, but all things are turned to their best.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. Christ said to PETER; <hi>Thou being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>strengthen thy brethren:</hi> therefore a Minister had neede be conuerted, to doe good.</p>
                  <p>Not so, but Christ onely promiseth <hi>Peter,</hi> that when <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Satan hath sifted him, he shal be raised againe, and being restored out of his fearefull sinne, he must by his example and experience, confirme sinners against distrust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, as hauing knowne Gods speciall goodnesse, in drawing him out of so great a gulfe, as his deniall was.</p>
                  <p>But the reward of sauing soules and conuerting men, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> belongs not vnto an vnconuerted Minister, namely, to shine as the Starres for euer and euer; <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he conuerts none.</p>
                  <p>The place is meant of faithfull Ministers, who with <note place="margin">Answ.</note> desire, faithfullnesse, and in Gods manner and meanes conuert men, as the former words of the verse intimate, They <hi>that are wise, shall shine as the brightnesse of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> according to that of SALOMON; <hi>Hee that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth soules, is wise: Prou.</hi> 11. 30. that is, he is wise, first for himselfe, and prouident for his owne good, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reward; and then for the Church, discharging faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice vnto it: Such a wise man the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> would haue <hi>Timothie</hi> to be; <hi>Take heede vnto thy selfe, and vnto learning, and continue therein: for in so doing, thou shalt saue both thy selfe, and them that heare thee:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. <note place="margin">Nequicquam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:18743:106"/>
And thus I haue fully cleared this question: Let none be so fond, as to refuse the almes of the King, because he giues it by an Amner; or a pretious gift of his father, for the lewdnesse of the carrier: <hi>Elias</hi> refused not his meat, because a Rauen brought it, but looked vnto God, who sent him with it: so doe thou heare the Word as Gods word, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. not as mans, that it may worke effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in thee; looke not so much to the messenger as the message.</p>
                  <p>To come now to the vses of the point.</p>
                  <p>First, it shewes, that it is great neede, that a Minister be a good man, both for himselfe and others, and haue <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> experience of God in his owne soule. For if the Word be onely in his mouth, it may doe others some good, but himselfe none: if in his booke alone, then when his booke failes him, the Word failes him: but if with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> he ponder things in his heart, the word which hee keepes, will keepe him. For this purpose he must labour to finde the Word, which he deliuers, to be first effectuall to beget faith in himselfe; and adde prayer for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who workes freely where he will; else his Word, which God makes powerfull in many of his hearers, shall be a dead letter vnto himselfe. And no maruell: For many wicked men may and doe speake of great points of religion, of the state of Gods children, and of cases of conscience, but without any taste or experience, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and certaintie in their owne hearts of the things they speake; a forme of knowledge they haue attained, which is meerely historicall, and a booke-learning, and speake as they that tell of strange Countries and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of which they haue read, but neuer saw them. Such men God often discouereth, by letting them fal off euen from that they know; their speech, their practice bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to be Atheists, as in heart they euer were, as may be seene by experience of many great Lights that haue done much good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:18743:106"/>
Secondly, let priuate Christians learne hence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their owne hearts, and Gods dealing with them, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> that they may bee able to speake feelingly, in teaching and comforting others. Let them learne to obey from their heart, the forme of doctrine deliuered, let them bee transformed into the truth taught and professed: he that doth this, wil prooue an excellent Light and patterne of godlinesse in the Church, bee his course of life neuer so priuate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must all benefit the Church by our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did communicate this his experience of Gods goodnesse to all: For first, we receiue no gift, but the whole Church hath a right in it. Secondly, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication thereof we shew our loue, which is liberall and communicatiue; <hi>Loue edifieth,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. Thirdly, euery member being graced, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the whole body: as an ornament, suppose a ring on the finger, deckes not the finger onely, but also the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Fourthly, the ende of Gods giuing of his gifts, is to traffique for him and his people: did men thinke of this, they durst not hide their talents, and bee vnfruitfull as many are, much lesse vse them to the hurt of the Church, and disgrace of the godly, as not a few doe.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in this inference <hi>(therefore) Dauid</hi> giue vs to vnderstand, that this worke of Gods mercy shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not die in himselfe, but suruiue for euer, and refresh the godly of all ages; hence note, that</p>
                  <p>The ordinarie workes of Gods mercy vpon his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> are not recorded for them alone, but for euery <note place="margin">Euery godly man must make vse of Gods mercy, manifested to any one.</note> godly man to make his vse of them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. <hi>Things reuealed belong vnto vs and to our children.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are written aforetime, are written for our learning, &amp;c.</hi> We will prooue this by an induction.</p>
                  <p>In the Scripture there is matter first, of doctrine: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of life: both either of faith or of fact. That mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doctrine belongs to our learning, none denies;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18743:107"/>
more question is of matter of fact and example: but the Scripture puts it out of question, that the examples of the Saints are likewise recorded for our instruction: wee may see it thus:</p>
                  <p>All examples of Scripture concerne either God or man: If God, it is some worke of mercy or iudgement: If man, it is an example either of vertue or vice: Now all these are for our instruction.</p>
                  <p>First, the workes of Gods mercie to his children. <hi>I am.</hi> 5. 17. to teach vs how mercifull GOD is to heare the prayers of his Saints; and to let vs see how much the prayer of the faithfull, if it bee feruent, auaileth, hee induceth the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> who prayed, and shut and opened the heauens.</p>
                  <p>What tell you vs of <hi>Elias,</hi> that was rapt in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret? What are we silly wormes to him? <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, but <hi>Elias</hi> was a man subiect to the same infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore though thou be a man subiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Answ.</note> infirmities, pray thou also: for the hearing of prayer depends not vpon the worthinesse of the person (suppose <hi>Elias</hi> himselfe) but vpon Gods mercie in Christ; that is, mans merits: So was <hi>Elias</hi> his prayer accepted, and so shall thine. And to further our hope and confidence, in the same place is alledged the example of <hi>Iob:</hi> Yee haue heard (saith the Apostle) of the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> and what end God put to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Alas! What tell you me of <hi>Iob,</hi> a iust man, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, not a man like him on the earth? <hi>Sol.</hi> Oh, but the Lord is very pittifull and mercifull vnto vs, as well as vnto him, if wee bee righteous as he was. In our Text, <hi>Dauid</hi> found mercy when he confessed. <hi>Ob.</hi> Alas he was a man after Gods owne heart, and a speciall type of Christ. <hi>Sol.</hi> Yet he was but a godly man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall euery godly man finde the like mercy vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as he did. <hi>Paul</hi> was receiued to mercy being a grieuous persecutor and blasphemer. <hi>Ob.</hi> Oh hee was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18743:107"/>
a man rapt into the third heauens, a chosen vessel. <hi>Sol.</hi> But he was receiued to mercie, that God might in him set out an example of his long-suffering vnto them, which afterward should beleeue to life eternall, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the workes of Gods iustice are written for our instruction, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>All these things came on them for ensamples to vs, on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> The <hi>Corinths</hi> might haue said, What haue wee to doe with the examples of those, that liued in the Old Testament? we are baptized and receiue the sacraments, so did not they. <hi>Sol.</hi> Not so, but they ate the same spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate, &amp; drank the same spirituall drinke in diuers signes: and then hee applyes the examples, that if they sinned as their Fathers, they should be as deepe in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they were. <hi>Luc.</hi> 17. 32. <hi>Remember</hi> LOTS <hi>wife:</hi> many hundred yeeres after, Christ calls his hearers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member her. So 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. the Lord made Sodome and Gomorrah an ensample to them that should liue vngodly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, examples of the vertues of the Saints are written for our imitation: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 22, 23. <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and his faith was counted to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Ob.</hi> But hee was fully assured, the Father of the faithfull, and an eminent man: what is that to vs, who are farre behinde him? <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes that it is: for <hi>this was not written for him alone,</hi> saith the Text, but <hi>for vs also,</hi> to whom our faith shall bee imputed also for righteousnes. What if thou art not in the degree of Faith, which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was in? Be sure thou be a sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it is not the strength of Faith, but the trueth of it, if it bee but a graine, which layeth hold on Christ. <hi>Moses</hi> his meekenesse, <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, and <hi>Iosephs</hi> chastitie are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our learning.</p>
                  <p>But if wee must imitate all the obedience of the <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Saints, wee must imitate <hi>Abraham</hi> in killing our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:18743:108"/>
The Doctrine extends it selfe onely to ordinary facts, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and not to extraordinarie ones, such as this and others are: the godly must bee imitated in all that obedience, which they yeeld to the common rule of life, but not in speciall commandements. <hi>Ier.</hi> 19. 4, 5. The Iewes after the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> did offer vp and burne their children, thinking, that because <hi>Abraham</hi> pleased God in offering his Sonne, so should they: but the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth and condemnes their fact, saying, <hi>I neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this, nor spake it, neither came it euer into my heart;</hi> namely, not in the Law and commandements which binde all; it was onely a speciall tryall of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> That place therefore is the ground of this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to follow the Saints so farre as their examples are ordinarie in vertue: yet wee may make some vse of this fact of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as, to part with our chiefest delight if God call for it. And so the Apostle limiteth the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christians; <hi>Bee yee followers of mee, euen as I am of Christ;</hi> we must not follow him being rapt into heauen, or speake all tongues, &amp;c. but so farre as hee exprest Christs vertues in his life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the vices and slips of the Saints are recorded also, though not for our imitation, yet for our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For (as one saith) the Patriarkes instruct vs, as well <note place="margin">Instruunt Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archaeta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errantes quàm docentes.</note> erring as teaching vs; for their slips shew: First, that it is not the strength of grace by which we stand, but Gods power: Secondly, that the best needes mercy, and is farre from merit vnlesse, it be of death: Thirdly, that we had neede raise our selues vp by repentance after euery fall as they did: Fourthly, wee must hereby prouoke our owne watchfulnesse, and, while we stand, take heed lest we fall: for if such great Okes be shaken, what shall wee poore shrubs expect?</p>
                  <p>The reasons of the doctrine are these:</p>
                  <p>First, drawne from the scope of the whole Scripture: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> all which, and euery part of it, tendeth to make the man
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18743:108"/>
of God perfect and fit to euery good worke, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. Now if euery godly man, or man of God must bee made perfect by the Scripture, then must euery one make vse of Gods ordinarie workes to any of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is vnchangeable, and the Spirit euer <note place="margin">2.</note> like himselfe; looke as his course hath been towards his children in times past; so he will still deale, proceeding by the same rule of iustice and mercie: hee neuer takes a wicked man by the hand, neither did any innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son euer perish vnder his hand; as a iust God he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like sinnes with like iudgements, and remembers mercy to the godly, because mercy pleaseth him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God would not onely describe a way to life in the Scriptures, but also hath there set before vs leaders <note place="margin">3.</note> and guides in that way; whence there is not a vertue in all the Scripture commended in the precept, but it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifyed and made to shine in some patterne, and that for these two ends: First, that the godly might haue full and assured direction: Secondly, that the wicked, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing both holy doctrine, and holy example, might iustly be condemned.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God would set a testimonie of his grace <note place="margin">4.</note> and glory in his children, whom because they giue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his truth, and proceedings, hee calleth a cloud of witnesses: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. First, because in their life and conuersation they witnessed by word and deed to Gods Church: Secondly, in their death many of them witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by their blood: Thirdly, hereafter they shall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for or against vs; <hi>The Saints shall iudge the world:</hi> and therefore euery godly man ought to make vse of their example.</p>
                  <p>And is this so? then this first ouerthrowes that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> and tyrannicall practice of the Church of Rome, which takes away the Scriptures from the Laiety, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie for simple people, though they be the deeds of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18743:109"/>
their inheritance, as if God had onely entred couenant with Monkes, Priests, and Regulars, and not with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men and women, who may not know either what God hath promised on his part, or expecteth on theirs. But if according to our doctrine all must make vse of the foresaid examples, then they must haue the Scripture to know them by, being therein registred.</p>
                  <p>When God gaue his Word to the Hebrewes, hee wrote it in the Hebrew tongue, a tongue familiar to them, and gaue charge that euery one should teach it their children, and deriue it from one generation to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. After when GOD would propagate it to the Gentiles, and the Monarchy came to the Grecians, God put into the heart of <hi>Ptolomie Philadelphus</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide seuenty two of the most expert Hebrews, skilfull in the Greeke, to translate it into Greeke, which language was generally knowne in all Nations of Europe, Asia, and Africa: which translation of the Septuagint is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day. Afterward, when the Roman Empire preuailed, and the Latine speech began by that meanes to be most common, God would haue the Scripture translated into Latine; to what other end, but that it should be read and vnderstood, and remembred &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised of all, because it concerned all?</p>
                  <p>But why doe the Papists thus cofer vp the Scriptures now? the true cause is, that the light thereof may not discouer their workes of darknesse: but what say they? Oh it is darke and obscure, hard and knotty, a breeder of heretikes, and matter of strife.</p>
                  <p>What? did God giue the Scripture for a remedie, and is it turned to poyson? did it once serue as a hammer to bruise errors? and now doeth it serue to breed them? was it once profitable <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; to improue? and now to impaire the trueth? Did God send it for a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> of peace? and is it now no other then a make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? All controuersies must be decided by it, and peace
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18743:109"/>
established on earth with God and men. The Word is a Lanthorne, and the Commandement a Light, and plaine to the simple, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. and 119. 130. And is it now so darke, as no man can see his way by it? hath God giuen all rules of doctrine and manners of faith and life, and not onely that, but witnessed all his way with man in examples of mercy and iustice, encouraging piety and vertue, and punishing the contrary? and all in vaine? what could the Lord doe more to make it easie and plaine, and fit for instruction, then he had done?</p>
                  <p>In a word, by remouing the Scriptures, they doe not onely depriue men of sauing doctrine in the precepts, but also of the chiefe helpe of godly life in the practice of beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if euery godly man must make vse of Gods <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> ordinary dealing with his children, then wee must take the counsell of <hi>Bildad</hi> to <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 8. 7. <hi>I pray thee looke to the examples of the former age, and prepare to search of thy fathers;</hi> namely, whether if thou be pure, God will not awake to thee: looke whether any pure in heart were euer forsaken of God, and as thou shalt find, so conclude, that God will deale with thee too; make this vse of their example.</p>
                  <p>And we must not onely obserue Gods waies with them, but also their waies with God, following their ordinarie examples in vertue, and watch our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their vices. Many search into the liues of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and there spy <hi>Abraham</hi> perhaps lying, <hi>Noah</hi> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>Salomon</hi> with many wiues; and hence they boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster themselues in sinne: they alleage the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> for adultery, and of <hi>Paul</hi> for rage against God and the godly: but this is to walke by the darke side of the cloude with the Egyptians to destruction; therefore let vs turne to the light side, to the Saints graces.</p>
                  <p>Ye shall haue some, that being exhorted to piety, and <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> to a narrow watch ouer their waies, will say presently,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18743:110"/>
Doe any thus or thus, as you would haue vs? why, then we shall be singular, we shall haue no company.</p>
                  <p>I wish men would consider their waies by this rule: If <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.</note> thou seest no godly man before thee, suspect that way, and get out of it: but howsoeuer, few in the world walk in the straight way to life, because few find it; yet look to the Word, and thou shalt see on all hands, some or other in that way, there thou hast a cloude to follow, to goe when it goes, to stand when it stands, so thou be on the light side of it; a notable guide through this pilgrimage of our life.</p>
                  <p>Oh, there is no example of such precise carriage, as <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> you would haue vs take vp, none but a few strait-lac't Ministers vrge or keepe it.</p>
                  <p>Yes, looke to the Scriptures, and thou shalt finde such <note place="margin">Ans.</note> as haue gone before any that are now liuing: it would be counted too much precisenesse now, to walke with God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, or for Masters to instruct their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and call them to an account for what they haue heard, and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> did so. If a man should be euer plodding in the Word, to draw good lessons from it, he shal be counted but a Bible-carrier; whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated on it day and night, and <hi>Marie</hi> laid vp, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Word in her heart: these would be surely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted too precise, if they were now liuing.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but if a man stand on these precise points, he shal be generally condemned. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then? <hi>Dauid</hi> cast away all such by-respects, and <hi>Moses</hi> forsooke all, euen <hi>Pharoahs</hi> court, to abide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch <note place="margin">Ans.</note> with Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. the Apostle left all and followed him, and the Saints alway counted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches of Christ aboue the treasures of a Kingdome. They so ordered their families, that they would not brooke a lyer, a swearer, a deceitfull person, a prophane and scoffing <hi>Ismael,</hi> all must be cast out.</p>
                  <p>Oh, then we shall shortly doe our worke ourselues. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:18743:110"/>
But <hi>Dauid</hi> did so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 5, 7. and other of Gods <note place="margin">Sol.</note> children: are we not also counselled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. that no prophane person be amongst vs? Thus we see, that there is no such strictnes, but an example therof may be found in the Scripture: therefore let the world scoffe and laugh while it will, yet the godly must make vse of these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we must hence learne to be ready to speake of our experiences of God to euery godly man, that others <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> may learne from vs to trust in his mercie: so doth <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 66. 16. <hi>Come &amp; harken, all ye that feare God, and I will tell you what he hath done to my soule.</hi> Thus are Fathers charged to tell their children, and the children their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, concerning the Passeouer, and the stones that were pitcht in Iordan. So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> said, when longer life was granted him: <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 19. <hi>The liuing, the liuing shall confesse thee, as I doe this day, the father to the children shall declare thy truth.</hi> And by this meanes there shall be a succession of men still vpon earth, to tell of the mercies of God when we are gone; and so, while we in our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall doe it in heauen, others by our meanes shal do it on earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here is a note to know, when a man makes right vse of the Scripture, not onely when hee beleeues <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> the storie, (for so doe the deuils:) but when he affects it, applies it to himselfe, mingleth it with faith to make it profitable, to admonish himselfe and others by it. Hence issue three great benefits.</p>
                  <p>First, a Christian shall be in no condition, but he shall bee able to parallell his estate in some of the Saints, hee shall see his owne case in some of them, and so shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine instruction, direction, and consolation by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee shall testifie to God and his Saints, when our liues shall be exemplarie, and conformable to godly precepts and examples.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the day of iudgement, we shall haue all the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18743:111"/>
Saints, Patriarkes, Prophets and Apostles to witnesse with vs, and for vs. In a difficult case, a man would giue all hee hath for a witnesse on his side; and we in this great assise of life and death shall haue the witnesse of all the godly; God shall stand for vs, the practices of the Saints shall iustifie our practices; if we iustifie their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices here, they shall iustifie ours hereafter.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>Euery one that is godly.]</head>
                  <p>HEre is the person that must pray, the godly, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them. The word translated, <hi>godly,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in Hebrew two things: first, one whom God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy vnto, a gracious man, in fauor and grace with God: so the elect are vsually called vessels of mercy, that as a vessell is filled with liquor, so are they with Gods mercy. Secondly, it signifies one that sheweth mercy, a mercifull man, which is a propertie of a godly man, who is like his father, mercifull as he is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the lionish and wooluish nature is put off, and hee is become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meeke, gentle, as the Lambe and the little childe, <hi>Isai.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>Out of the former consideration wee may note, that</p>
                  <p>Onely the godly man is fit to pray, or, onely hee that <note place="margin">Doct.</note> hath grace, can pray for grace; vessels of mercy can pray <note place="margin">Onely he that hath grace, can pray for grace.</note> for mercy, and none else. <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked, is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the righteous is acceptable vnto him.</hi> Genes. 4. 4. <hi>The Lord had respect to Abel and his offering: but vnto Caine and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering he had no respect. Now by faith Abel offered a better sacrifice then Cain,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. First, <hi>His person was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because he was in Christ, and then his sacrifice.</hi> Iames 5. 16. <hi>The prayer of the righteous auaileth much, if it be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.</hi> Ier 11. 11. <hi>Though they crie vnto me, I will not he are them.</hi> What is the reason? see it in the tenth verse, <hi>They</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:18743:111"/>
                     <hi>turned backe to the iniquities of their forefathers, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to heare my words, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reasons of this point are these: First, he must be a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> good man, that must pray a good prayer, a good tree that must bring forth good fruit: a bad man cannot make a good prayer; for such as the roote is, such is the fruit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he only can pray aright, that hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer, which teacheth vs to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> this <note place="margin">2.</note> is the Spirit of adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. neither doth God know any other voyce, but the voyce of his owne Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18. Pray in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Yea but it is said, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. the holy Ghost is giuen <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> to them that aske him; therefore hee can pray and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the Spirit, that wants him.</p>
                  <p>The scope of this place is not to shew, whether the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> holy Ghost or prayer goe before; but to shew how those that receiue the Spirit, are to be exercised; who, where he is, lyeth not dead or idle in the heart, but stirs vp desires and grones vnspeakeable.</p>
                  <p>But how can a man pray for the holy Ghost and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> him, when he hath him already?</p>
                  <p>By the holy Ghost is meant, first, the gifts and graces <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of the holy Ghost. Secondly, the inward sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him in the heart: thus we may pray both for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his gifts, and for a comfortable sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him: for neither of them is euer so great, but we may still pray for more, to haue them increased. Shall we not pray for daily bread, because we haue bread? or shall not we say, <hi>Forgiue vs our sinnes,</hi> because wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the remission of our sinnes? yes, because we pray for Gods staffe and blessing on the former, and a more full and comfortable feeling of the latter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, onely the godly man can pray, because hee only hath the promise of prayer: all the promises of life <note place="margin">3.</note> in grace and glory, are made to godlinesse; the promise
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18743:112"/>
to be heard in prayer, is made to the go dly man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>If yee abide in me, and my Word in you, aske what ye will, and it shall be giuen you.</hi> How can hee aske mercy, that hath no part in mercy? or how can he be heard in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to whom mercy belongs not?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because onely the godly man hath faith, without which nothing can please God: this faith assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">4.</note> vs of that we aske, and issueth from iustifying faith; see 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 13, 14. <hi>That yee may beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God, and this is the assurance,</hi> that <hi>if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs.</hi> Faith is an hand or arme, by which wee lay hold vpon blessings: if once wee bee perswaded that God hath giuen vs Christ, wee will easily beleeue that hee will giue vs all things with him; for he that giues the greater, will not denie the lesse. Our Sauiour, when diseased persons came for bodily health or ease, was wont to say, <hi>According to thy faith be it vnto thee:</hi> so in all our requests, the presence or absence of faith giues our prayer returne: according to the weakenesse or strength of the arme of faith, so is the coldnesse or abundance of comfort to our heart: so that faith onely giues taste and rellish to the prayer, which a beleeuer makes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Christ in his prayer teacheth vs to begin with <hi>Our Father,</hi> teaching thereby, that he must call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">5.</note> who must pray acceptably; and that includeth sundry child-like affections, all concurring in a rightly disposed person to pray, as first, Reuerence and feare, when hee comes before his heauenly Father: A Sonne honoreth his Father; If then I bee a Father, where is mine honor and feare? <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. 6. Secondly, a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like boldnesse, comming through Christ to a Father full of mercy and compassion, pittying his children more then earthly parents can, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 15. By Christ we haue boldnesse, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. Thirdly, loue to God as to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for a godly man seekes not himselfe in prayer, but
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18743:112"/>
Gods glory with his owne shame. Fourthly, charity and loue to our brethren: for when wee come into the sight of our Father, wee dare not bring prayers in one hand, and malice in another, but pray, <hi>Forgiue vs as we forgiue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, onely the godly man can pray acceptably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">6.</note> hee alone hath remoued the barre and partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, that stood betweene God and him, bringing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and godly sorrow for sin with him. The blinde man could say, <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> that is, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ones; but hee heareth those that are repentant. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 18. If I regard wickednesse in my heart, the Lord will not heare me. Incense in the Law was a type of prayer, yet in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 13. the Lord tells the Iewes, who came in their sinnes, that incense was an abomination vnto him: God hates our incense, our prayer, if we come with prophane hearts as they did; he neither receiues it from vs, nor we any good thing from him; but a godly man hath remoued this rub.</p>
                  <p>First, Note hence the miserable condition of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> sinner, and of an vngodly man, that is without remorse, and wallowes in vnconscionable sinnes: hee cannot pray, he neuer prayed in all his life, he was neuer in mercy heard in his prayer, but loseth all his labour; and well if it were no worse; for all his prayer is turned into sinne, his prayer is abominable, <hi>Prom.</hi> 28. 9. as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he went about to pray, he did nothing but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply sinne against God; he mumbled vp a few prayers and fared accordingly.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, then it seemes vnlawfull for the wicked <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> to pray; if he pray not, it is condemnation; if he pray, it is no lesse.</p>
                  <p>He is bound to pray, but not to sinne in prayer: in the second Commandement hee is inioyned to bow <note place="margin">Answ.</note> downe and worship God in prayer, and the third bindes him euer to doe it well, lest he pray in sinne, and so take Gods name in vaine. Alas then, what must he doe? on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18743:113"/>
the grace of repentance can reconcile these two, and draw the sinner out of this maze, and make him pray aright.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but God heareth the wicked often-times, and <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> granteth what they aske, as peace vnto <hi>Ahab</hi> vpon his humiliation.</p>
                  <p>God heareth what a wicked man saith in prayer, and yet heares not his prayer, no, not when he giues the same <note place="margin">Answ.</note> thing that he asketh: for, first, all that the wicked get <note place="margin">How God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth wicked men, or rather heareth them not.</note> from him, is externall and common to good and bad, but no one fauour of speciall grace. Secondly, he giues them euen that in wrath and vengeance, not for their prayers sake. Thirdly, when they aske things good in themselues, and euill for them, not knowing to vse them aright, hee granteth in iustice what it had beene mercy to haue denyed; as contrariwise, hee heareth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in mercy, denying them that, which they haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully asked. Fourthly, that which he giues, shall turne to their woe and miserie, and shall but heape coles vpon their heads, euen wealth, prosperitie, and dignitie, all shall but make their sinne out of measure sinfull; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all things shall worke together for the best to the godly, euen crosses and afflictions. Fifthly, God giues nothing but by vertue of the promise; no promise but is by Christ; a wicked man hath no part in Christ, and therefore neither in the promise: a plaine case. Sixtly, neither is the wicked mans prayer a meanes of granting the request, or obtayning his desire, so as God stil heares not his prayer: for how can that prayer finde accesse or acceptance, which is not preferred in Christ? but they are fed onely by a generall prouidence as the beasts are. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>The wicked man calls not on the Lord;</hi> that is, either prayes not at all, or as good he did not. Let this be a motiue to further our repentance: for else, if a man vtter neuer so many words of prayer, God will not heare him: how iust is it, that he that will not heare God, when
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18743:113"/>
he calleth, should not be heard of God, when hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth? that he, that is a prophane mocker of God, God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 28, 29.</note> should mocke him in his destruction? that he that turnes his eare from the Law, should haue Gods eare turned from him? that he should aske and not receiue, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth amisse?</p>
                  <p>How iust was it vpon the Iewes, who were cruell and of bloudy hands, that God should hate their persons and prayers? and is it not as iust, that vnmercifull men, Oppressors, Vsurers, Ismaels, Quarrellers, whose hand is against euery man, and euery mans against them; hard-hearted persons, that stop their eares against the cry of the poore, that they should cry and not be heard? Surely, the sentence is passed already, that iudgement mercilesse belongs to him that shewes no mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this doctrine ouerthrowes the idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> wherewith numbers of men delude themselues; O, if they haue but time at their death, to say, <hi>Lord haue mercy,</hi> then they shall doe well enough, though all their life they cast off all care and counsell. But what? Is the godly man he, that shall pray and find mercy? and shall prophane wretches, that haue set their faces all their dayes against heauen, thinke to bee heard in the day of their distresse and death? How canst thou then claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one promise (and much lesse all) when thou neuer keptest the least condition of faith and repentance? How then shall God be iust, who hath said, that he will laugh at such, when their sorrow commeth? Besides, we must <note place="margin">Difference betweene prayers of the godly, and wishes of the wicked.</note> obserue a great difference betweene the prayers of the godly, and the wishes of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>First, the one is an earnest desire of the heart, prizing greatly that which he desires; the other is but a snatch, or a sudden flash, out of an illumination of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but not out of any affection of the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he vnderprizeth the thing prayed for, and will not sell all for it. That which others get with much labour
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18743:114"/>
and strong cryes, a wicked man thinks he may only call for it, and haue it; hee will enioy his lusts all his dayes, and then the last day promise reformation. No, no, God is not so prodigall of mercy, as to take thy leauings, and be beholding to thee for a little lip-seruice; in all the Scripture there is but one example of one receiued to mercy the last houre, thinke not that thou shalt bee the second.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the one is a true desire with endeuour in <note place="margin">2</note> the right meanes, and care to referre it to the right end; he will obtayne heauen by Faith, Repentance, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c. but the vngodlies proceeding is but a iump, to the end without the meanes. Cursed <hi>Balaam</hi> desired to die the death of the righteous, but he would leape o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the life of the righteous; so, many leape ouer the meanes, and thinke to come to the end immediately; but twentie to one if they leape not too short. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> desired the gifts of the holy Ghost, but to a bad end, to make gaine of them, and that he might be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be some great man, whereas a godly man aymes onely at Gods glory in his owne saluation.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, if euery true desire hath assurance to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, because it must be directed by the Word, lifted vp <note place="margin">3.</note> by the Spirit, and encouraged by the Promise, then can no such vnsettled and vncertaine wishes, bring any comfort to the heart, when a man hath all his life long resisted the Word, despised the meanes of Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Promises, and grieued, nay, despighted the Spirit, how can hee haue any comfort by his prayer? and, how can he haue any elsewhere if not from that?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this shewes vs, that the way to bee heard of God in prayer, is to be godly, to bring Godlinesse and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> Religion, an heart mortified to sinne, and quickned to grace, adorned with faith, and settled in good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Dauids</hi> example of finding deliuerance in trouble, and comfort in affliction of Spirit, belongs only to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18743:114"/>
and humble men, that shall confesse and pray as hee did. If thou wilt be heard of God in prayer:</p>
                  <p>First, get the notes of Gods child vpon thee, and thou <note place="margin">Meanes to be heard in prayer.</note> shalt obtayne mercy: for it is the priuiledge of a child to be heard, in whatsoeuer his father sees good for him. What saith Christ? If you, being euill, can giue good things to your children, how much more will your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, become Gods seruant: for it was the vsuall ground of <hi>Dauids</hi> prayer, to say, <hi>Lord, I am thy seruant, heare and deliuer thy seruant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, get humilitie vnto thee; for the sacrifice of God is a contrite spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 17. such sacrifices hee is well pleased with.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the poore blinde man sheweth; the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that man whom God heareth. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 31. God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not sinners, but if any be a worshipper of him and doth his will, him he heareth. The same condition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, that would speed in his suites. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 22. Whatsoeuer wee aske, wee receiue of him, because wee keepe his Commandements, and doe things pleasing in his sight. <hi>Yee aske, and haue not,</hi> saith IAMES, <hi>because yee aske amisse:</hi> and when doe wee aske amisse? when wee doe not keepe Gods Commandements: but how shall we know that we keepe them? <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. if we loue one another: for charitie is an vndiuided companion of true pietie.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point; let vs take <hi>Iobs</hi> friends coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell vnto him, Acquaint thy selfe with God, and he shall prosper thy way before thee, thou shalt cry vnto him, and he shall heare thee, <hi>Iob.</hi> 22. 21.</p>
                  <p>Now in the second place, in that the word translated (Godly) signifies a mercifull man, note that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No seruice of God, or exercise of Religion, can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">All acceptable seruice must bee from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull men.</note> 
                     <hi>to God, which is not performed by mercifull men.</hi> All Gods worship must be ioyned with mercy: for here it is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18743:115"/>
said, The mercifull man shall pray, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11. to 16. God reiected all the Iewes seruices, because they did not fast from strife as wel as from meat, and because their hands were full of bloud. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Seeke yee the Lord, all the meeke of the earth;</hi> whence is noted, both that this is a denomination of a righteous man, to be meeke, and that none but such meeke persons can seeke God to find him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 5. The doctrine of the Pharises was, that if men brought oblations to the Temple, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued not their poore Parents, yet God was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them: but the words following shew, that this was but an hypocriticall tradition, reuersing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne mercy:</hi> what is it that we aske for, when wee come to doe God his due homage, but to obtayne blessednes and happinesse? but this we cannot doe, to be accepted, without mercifulnesse. So, <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. <hi>If thy brother haue any thing against thee, goe first and bee reconciled, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reasons of this point are these: First, those things <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> which God hath ioyned together, no man must sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but God hath ioyned together the workes of the first and second table, the loue of himselfe and of our brethren; of himselfe and of his image; of our forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our neighbours, and his forgiuing of vs; these are inseparably ioyned, and therefore we must not dissolue them. Hence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 10. hypocrites pretending Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are called to breake <hi>their bread to the hungry,</hi> that is the true fasting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, vnmercifulnesse hindreth both the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our prayers, and likewise the preuailing of them. <note place="margin">2.</note> First, it cuts off prayer, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. Husbands must dwell with their wiues like men of knowledge, and take heed of strife, lest their prayers be interrupted. The very hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, the neerest couple, cannot pray priuately,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18743:115"/>
if they doe not put away strife; and how can the same but hinder publique prayer also? The Spirit of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not light on a Christian, but in the shape of a Doue, as it did on Christ; the Temple that is fit for the holy Ghost to dwell in, must be mercifull: see <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6, 7. Secondly, it hinders our prayer from preuailing, because of the promise and the threatning: the promise of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard is made only to the mercifull, that the meeke shall inherite the earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 11. and that the Lord will hide them in the day of wrath, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. So threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is gone out against the mercilesse, euen iudgement mercilesse belongs to him that shewes no mercy; and as a man iudgeth, so he shall be iudged, and his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall be met to him againe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1, 2. so that if a man be an <hi>Ismael,</hi> rough against euery man, God will be rough against him; and, if we be vnpittifull, we shall be vnpittied of God and Men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, no sound worship can proceede but from a <note place="margin">3.</note> sound Religion, and that is the Religion and wisedome which is from aboue, and the qualitie of it is that it is peaceable, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17. gentle, easie to be intreated, <hi>full of mercy, and good fruits.</hi> The Gospell which we professe, is a Gospell of peace, fostereth peace, and seeketh it by all meanes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, so long as any a<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e slaues to the deeds of the <note place="margin">4.</note> flesh, it is impossible they can be acceptable to God: but debate, hatred, anger, rage, murthers, are condemned for the vvorkes of the flesh, which shut a man out of heauen, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>But vvherein stands this mercy, vvhereunto prayer <note place="margin">Quest.</note> must be coupled?</p>
                  <p>It stands in these things. First, in pittying the bodies <note place="margin">Answ.</note> of men in their wants. Secondly, their soules much more. Thirdly, in supplying their wants, as reliefe, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, comfort, counsell, &amp;c. to be rich in good workes, and restore them that are fallen, by the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:18743:116"/>
This teacheth all of vs that professe the doctrine of the Gospell and true Religion, and the pure worship of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> God, how wee ought to be disposed, when wee come to performe vnto God religious duties, as prayer, &amp;c. Those that come neerest to God to present seruice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, must more especially look to this point, namely, to take heede of the spirit that lusteth after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and sets men in a rage against Gods image and those of the same profession with them; and they must take the counsell of the Apostle, 2. Cor. 13. 11. <hi>Bee of one minde, liue in peace, and the God of peace shall be with you.</hi> And let vs consider</p>
                  <p>First, we are all members of one bodie, wherof Christ <note place="margin">Motiues to mercy.</note> is the head; nature teacheth one member to pitie and help another; if one bee ill affected, to get remedy for it; and so must Christians.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a meeke and mercifull spirit is much set by of God, and called for at our hands by Christ, of whom wee must learne to bee humble and meeke: a sure note of one that is brought into Christs Kingdome and sheepefold.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hath taken all execution of vengeance out of our hands; <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. and if we will take the sword of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge into our hands, it will prooue but a sword to our owne destruction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if we looke at the recompence of reward, we are to be prouoked to the workes of mercie. As a man sowes, so shall he reape, sowe mercy and reape mercy, sowe liberally, and reape liberally; God giues seede to the sower, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. and makes men rich vnto the works of mercie, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. How was the poore widdowes oile increased, when shee sowed mercie to <hi>Elias</hi> in his want? She had sufficient, till the hard yeere was blowne ouer. Thy expences shall haue a rich returne, it shall bee but a lending to God with abundant vsury; for earthly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18743:116"/>
and base things, we shal obtaine heauenly and glorious; it is a sowing on earth, to reape in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if we desire patternes and presidents in merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we haue enough: First, wee haue God himselfe, whose mercies are aboue all his workes: how mercifully did he forbeare the world an hundred yeeres? and what experience haue our owne soules, how he daily forgets and forgiues innumerable sinnes? Therefore be we mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as our heauenly Father is mercifull. Secondly, Christ the Sonne of God is a president herein, whose mercy and compassion was such as hee laid downe his life for vs, that wee should also lay downe our liues for the brethren: 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. Thirdly, the Saints of God haue gone before vs in examples of mercy. <hi>Moses</hi> was a man mightie in word and deede, yet the meekest man on earth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Abraham</hi> yeelded to <hi>Lot</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior; <hi>Isaac</hi> swallowed many indignities at <hi>Abimelechs</hi> hands, and <hi>Iaacob</hi> as many at <hi>Labans. Dauid</hi> spared <hi>Saul</hi> his enemie, when he had him at an aduantage, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Shimei</hi> a Traytor, when hee had cursed him and threw stones at him. Yea all the Prophets, Apostles, and Saints, as much as lay in them, had peace with all men. If wee professe our selues the Sonnes of God, how are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18.</note> we so rough against our brethren, so without pittie and charitable disposition? as <hi>Lamech, Ismael,</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi> who learned of the Deuill, who was a murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to hate and kill his brother. Let professors leaue these workes of the flesh to such as are in the flesh: let vs be led by another rule, as Christians mercifully consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering one another, and not as bruit beasts ledde by sensualitie. We must not follow noysome lusts and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but the rule of Gods Word, to blesse though we are cursed, and take things at the best, and seeke peace, and follow after it. Let professors consider the sweet fruit of Christian communion, which by a mercifull and meeke spirit is enioyed, but by wrath and rash anger
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18743:117"/>
violenced; how that the peace of the Church and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like quietnesse, the honour of their profession, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their conscience, and acceptance of their prayers or any seruice cannot stand by them, if they subdue not their spirits in this behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this shewes vs what to thinke of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which vpsetteth and vpholdeth it selfe by crueltie <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> and malicious rage and furie; it is a religion which God hath no delight in, hee neuer did set it vp, nor accepted it. It cannot be the right religion, which by crueltie, sword, and fire, either planteth it selfe, or seeketh to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant others. Therefore wee may note in the Scripture, that those religions, that were hated of God, were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and vnmercifull. One might haue read in <hi>Cains</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head what religion he was of: no maruell if God reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his sacrifice, seeing hee bore such deadly malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his brother. Of what religion were the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that kept vnder the Israelites so tyrannically, but barbarous, wicked, and idolatrous? <hi>Iaacob</hi> must haue a place by himselfe to dwell in, because his religion was an abomination to them, they must not see him performe the seruices of it. <hi>Manasseh</hi> set vp Idols, sought to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yea himselfe was a Magician or Coniurer, and what was his practice? Looke and wee shall see, that no man euer shed more innocent blood then hee did. Here was a note of a false religion, euen cruelty, such as wee read not of in any of his predecessors. <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> a monster among Idolaters, did so prodigiously waste the blood of the holy people, as neuer was since there began to be a Nation, till that time. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. The heathen Emperours made such butcheries vpon the bodies of the Saints, as euery street seemed a shambles of Christians, and euery line of the story written in blood; and their religion was sutable, barbarous, and butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Saul</hi> was zealous in his religion, and breathed out nothing but slaughter and threatning, but all that while
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18743:117"/>
his religion was proportionall, hee knew not Christ nor what hee did. But the Romish religion goes beyond all other in crueltie and vnmercifulnesse, and therefore of all other must be most hatefull to GOD. It was said long since, that Antichrist the head of that Church must be an <hi>Appollyon,</hi> a Destroyer, and 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. the sonne of Perdition, both actiuely, and passiuely, in himselfe and vnto many others. He must be cloathed in scarlet, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour dyed in the blood of the Saints; and a beast that must make warre against the witnesses of God.</p>
                  <p>The Church of God in the Old Testament indured most grieuous oppression, and was vnmercifully handled in Egypt by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in Canaan by the King of Syria, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 8. by <hi>Eglon,</hi> King of the Moabites; by <hi>Iabin,</hi> King of the Canaanites; by the Midianites, Ammonites, and Philistims, and by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish captiuitie: But all this was nothing to that it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> And yet this of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was but a type of Antichrists persecution; his wicked rage was but a shadow to this: Here is an vnmercifull Destroyer, that killeth, first, the soules of men by poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their mindes with false and damnable doctrines: Secondly, the bodies of men with horrible and vnheard-of crueltie and tyrannie.</p>
                  <p>Here is a woman drunke with the blood of the Saints <note place="margin">Romish religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on accursed, because so cruell.</note> and of the Martyrs of Iesus; <hi>Reu.</hi> 17. 6. What shall we thinke of that religion, by whose edicts, perswasions, and approbations all the Christian blood almost hath bin shed vpon earth since the ten first Persecutions? Who hath done this but the firebrands of Babylon? What of that religion, which committeth Kings and Emperours together, making them Wolues and Tygers one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? and who doth this but <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the head of this Babylon? What of that religion, that blowes vp Massacres, Rebellions, Seditions, Treasons in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys? This also doth the scarlet-whore of Babylon.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18743:118"/>
What of that Religion, that sends out cut-throat vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines with Pardons to stab and poison Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the earth, yea to blow vp with one terrible blow three whole states and Kingdomes? This also doth the mercifull holy Father at Romish Babylon.</p>
                  <p>Who hath kindled so many furnaces to burne the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Gods Saints in all Christendome, but that meeke sonne of perdition, whose mercies are cruell? What may wee thinke of the mercilesse inquisition in Spaine? Or that horrible massacre of the Christians in France, the like whereof was neuer seene in any Nation? Here in our owne land, what damnable plots, and deuillish designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue there beene against the persons of our Kings and Princes? What shall I speake of the vnnaturalnesse of their cruelty amongst vs, while they haue chased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all pitie and respect of silly persons, who in regard of the impotencie of their mindes or their tender age, might by all lawes of nature and Nations haue laid claime to mercie, if the Ocean of heathenish, I meane Popish crueltie, had not broken all bounds and bankes?</p>
                  <p>What hurt could a Boy of eight yeeres old doe to their religion, who yet for that was scourged to death in <hi>Bonners</hi> house? What hurt could that babe do them, that sprang out of the mothers wombe, and was cast in againe, because it was a yong Heretique, and so bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the mothers flames and the owne blood? What madnesse was it to apprehend a madde man, one <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> who held his dogge ouer his head as the Priest did the hoast, for which hee and his dogge were burnt for Heretiques? a wofull meanes to bring a madde man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wits.</p>
                  <p>With how little reason could they demaund a reason of the faith of a madde man (one <hi>Cowbridge)</hi> and make a madde mans words without vnderstanding, a sentence of his owne death, for which hee was burnt at Oxford? but where furie hath madded men, no argument can
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18743:118"/>
mooue them to pittie. What religion is that, the wrath of which sticketh not either to bury the quicke as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> at <hi>Burges,</hi> or to vnbury the dead, as <hi>Wickliffs</hi> bones burnt one and fortie yeeres after his death? <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> wife at Oxford, two yeeres after his death burnt for an Heretique; at Cambridge Mr. <hi>Bucer &amp; Phagius,</hi> cited out of their graues to appeare foure yeeres after their buriall, which when the silly ashes could not doe, they were digged out, and burnt on the market-hill, because they did not answere and satisfie such articles as were laid against them? <hi>Richard Hun,</hi> apparantly hanged by them in the prison, was also burnt after his death. <hi>Iohn Tooly</hi> being dead and buried, was cited to appeare before <hi>Bonner</hi> by a day appointed, at which time limited and expired, he was excommunicate, and straite charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that no man should eate or drinke with him, or if any met him, they should not bid him God speed, or if he came to Church in time of diuine seruice, he must be thrust out: after that this excommunication wrought nothing vpon the dead man, hee was condemned and committed to the secular power, and so the poore dead man was the second time by the Sheriffs executed. Is this cruell religion of God? Did Christ or any of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles bring in the trueth by fire or sword? No, it is false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that must stand by power and humane policie.</p>
                  <p>When the two Disciples asked Christ, if they should call for fire from heauen against the Cities that receiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not? No, saith Christ, <hi>Ye know not what spirit ye are of:</hi> But let Antichrists Disciples aske him, as <hi>Faux &amp; Winter</hi> did <hi>Garnet:</hi> Shall we call for fire from hell against those Kingdomes which will not receive vs? Hee saith, Yea, because hee knowes what spirit they bee of, resolute, but infortunate Gentlemen: begin to dig vnder the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-house, and when all the house is set to make lawes against the Catholikes, giue them a terrible blow, and they shall neuer know who hurt them.</p>

O, but what speake you this against the Religion of the Church of Rome? this is the fault of men, not of their <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but it ariseth out of the grounds of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> which is ful of cruelty and bloudinesse. Iesuitisme <note place="margin">Iesuitisme the rebels Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.</note> is the Rebels Catechisme. I will set downe their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in certaine positions, which are eminent in their Authors at this day.</p>
                  <p>First, the Pope ought to driue Woolues, and bad lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, heretique Kings (that is, Protestants:) <hi>àgrege &amp; dominio,</hi> not only excommunicate, but also driue them from their Kingdomes. This is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> position de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Pope himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not onely manifest, but also secret and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected heretiques; so <hi>Symancha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, not onely themselues, but all their fauourers also and children: So <hi>Creswell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>quibuscunque modis,</hi> by any meanes, saith <hi>Sanders: vi,</hi> or <hi>dolo,</hi> as <hi>Iudith</hi> put downe <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and <hi>Iehu Athaliah; Reinolds</hi> and <hi>Boucherius:</hi> or by a knife or dagger, as <hi>Henrie</hi> the third and fourth, Kings of France, were murthered: or by Dag, Dagger, or poyson, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Queene often, at the perswasion of <hi>Walpoole,</hi> a Priest and Cardinall of Coome: or by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder against three Countries, at the perswasion of <hi>Garnet,</hi> Prouinciall of Iesuites in England.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, not only the Pope, but also all Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound <hi>arctissimo conscientiae vinculo &amp; extremo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimarum periculo,</hi> to resist any hereticall King, <hi>sirem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stare posuit,</hi> if he can bring the matter about: So <hi>Creswell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Kings as soone as they begin to be heretikes, are presently <hi>ipso facto &amp; deiure</hi> excommunicate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their Kingdomes, and their subiects freed from the oath of alleageance; so saith <hi>Allen,</hi> who for the same obtained a Cardinall-ship. This, saith he, is a iust, holy, and honourable warre; and hence he speaks to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18743:119"/>
Nobles to rise vp in armes against Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, a French King was iustly slaine before excommunication published, because pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like sorrowes waite no formes, and in such publike things euident knowledge <hi>sententiae locum habet,</hi> is in place of sentence: So said <hi>William Reinolds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eightly, a secret heretike is not onely <hi>ipso iure</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, but his children also deposed from the Kingdome, because leprous parents beget leprous chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Thus <hi>Symancha</hi> a wicked Knaue cuts off branch and roote.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Yea, but the Pope-holy-Father, he approues of no such things, no, not he, because he cannot erre. Yes, then <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth, erred not in teaching, that so soone as a King is an heretike, his subiects are freed from all loyaltie.</p>
                  <p>Nor <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, in making a laudatorie oration vpon the murder of <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, King of France.</p>
                  <p>Nor Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> in his Bull, saying, <hi>Volumus &amp; inbemus,</hi> We will and command, that all subiects take vp Armes against Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, no murder without a Iesuite, no Treason without a Priest. <hi>Mariana</hi> found an apt scholer of <hi>Rauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liac,</hi> and gaue him a poysoned Dagger to kill the French King. <hi>Catesby, Percy, Faux,</hi> were apt scholers of <hi>Garnet:</hi> so <hi>Gerard, Parsons, Greenewell.</hi> Nay, these peaceable men themselues, one strucke out the tooth, another the heart of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth. Who after all this can doubt of the wickednesse of the Romish Religion? or who can thinke it acceptable vnto God, seeing the godly, the mercifull man onely can performe acceptable seruice?</p>
                  <p>What? is not God pleased with that religion, which <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> he hath prospered so long? neuer any Religion so rich, so strong, so embraced, so defended by the Kings and Princes of the World.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, the shaddow neuer leaues the body, Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme a shaddow of Christianitie: so Antichrist began to worke in the Apostles daies, and shall continue to the ende of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord will haue his Church still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in this world, to shake it out of securitie, and to get Gods Armour, which is onely able to preserue it from the deadly poyson that is in that enchaunted cup.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by prolonging this warre, he hath occasion to shew his wisedome, mercy, and iustice, in preseruing his Church through such danger, and to trie the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and constancie of his Saints: Heere is the patience of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, sinne and want of zeale in the Church, is a cause why he still stands a farre off; the time of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not yet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. But yet the sentence is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against that Church, <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great Citie,</hi> Reuel. 18. 2, 6. <hi>and giue her double to that shee hath done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Church is already blasted by the <note place="margin">2.</note> breath of Gods mouth: Gods Word hath detected the Man of sinne's fraude, wherewith hee hath blinded the world: his Bulls, that were once as terrible as thunder, and affrighted all Christendome, are now accounted but paper-shot or a flea-bite, and as winde in great part; his Pardons and Indulgences, which were once bought at so deare a rate, are now contemned euen of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as things of no value: his claimes are disclaimed by Princes; and notwithstanding all his Phisicians about him, he is consumed, and much withered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he shall bee quite abolished in himselfe and his members at the comming of Christ, when himselfe <note place="margin">3.</note> and his whole sent shall bee cast into the burning Lake, as a Mill-stone into the bottome of the Sea, neuer to be raised vp againe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The true God must onely be inuocated in trouble.</note> 
                     <hi>day I called vpon the Lord, and the Lord heard me. Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> in his day, when his daies seemed to be cut off, <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his face to the wall and wept, and prayed to the Lord,</hi> who heard his prayers, saw his teares, and gaue him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, <hi>Isai.</hi> 38. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Paul</hi> also in his day, being buffeted with the messenger of Satan, prayed thrice, that is, often to the Lord, and the Lord answered, <hi>That his grace was sufficient for him:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
                  <p>The reasons of this point are these:</p>
                  <p>First, he cannot be a godly man, that in the time of his peace and prosperitie, approues not his godlinesse, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> much and often in this dutie of prayer, and much more in his affliction and distresse; because, first, a godly man cannot bee without the Spirit of adoption, which makes the heart thirst after the liuing God, and formeth sighes and grones and desires in the soule after him; the Spouse calleth Christ, him whom her soule desireth: whereas it is a signe of a dead soule, and of a bad constitution, to be without these desires and requests, as DAVID makes it a note of an Atheist, not to pray: <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a godly man cannot deny vnto God the principall part of his worship, which himselfe hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for his owne so great glorie, and our owne so great good and vtilitie. A godly man cannot but giue him the honour of Maiestie, in seeing our hearts and wants, and abilitie to relieue them, and the honour of mercy, both in confessions, petitions and praises.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a godly man cannot but depend vpon God,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18743:121"/>
as the Fountaine of grace, as the Father of lights, the Staffe of his life, the Length of his daies, the Strength of his heart, his Portion for euer: neither can a godly man testifie this confidence in God otherwise, then by resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him as a God hearing prayer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a godly man cannot but sanctifie all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and gifts, and all Gods creatures by this meanes, which else are not pure vnto him. Nay, a godly man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but increase and strengthen his graces by the meanes of prayer, and by the same meanes preserue his holinesse and grace, and exercise them, which stand or fall, are weake or strong, as this grace of prayer is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a godly man cannot, but much more in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and trouble, seeke God by prayer. If aduersities <note place="margin">2.</note> presse him, disease paine him, dangers threaten him, sense of sinne pricke him, conscience of guilt wound him, and corruption worke vpon him: now is a time of seeking God in his promises; now is a time ofneede, when a man sees his owne weakenesse; now is the time of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that commandement, <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble,</hi> and, <hi>the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke:</hi> Now is a time when men lay fast hold vpon God, and will not let him goe, whereas in the time of peace, we hold God but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely. When <hi>Iaacob</hi> wrestled with the Angell, he would not let him goe till he had blessed him. Affliction is as bellowes to our prayer, to kindle and blow vp this grace to a great flame and brightnesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, no godly man will pray to any, but the true God in trouble: First, because euery godly man knowes, <note place="margin">3.</note> that whom hee prayes vnto, hee makes him omniscient, that must see the wants of all men, and all the desires of all mens hearts: he makes him omnipresent, that must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all the prayers, preferred in all the corners of the world: and he makes him omnipotent, able to supply all the wants which are made knowne vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:18743:121"/>
Secondly, the ground of all prayer is the Couenant, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 9. <hi>Now, O Lord, thou art our Father: loe, we beseech thee, behold, we are all thy people:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 4. Euery godly man knowes, that the Couenant is made betweene God and his people, and that all the promises of helpe in the Scripture are his, and none else can lay claime to vs but God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. Therefore godly men, being in couenant with none but God, they will pray to none but God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euery godly man knowes the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue:</hi> he knowes, that God is a iealous God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no corriualls; for his glory he will giue to no other: see <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, euery godly man knowes, that hee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, on whom hee calleth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. And hence it is called the <hi>prayer of faith;</hi> therefore as he must beleeue onely in the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, so he onely calles vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, euery godly man knowes, that if the Spirit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his prayer, it teacheth him to call Abba Father, and, if his prayer be squared to the rule of prayer, he must goe to our Father which is in heauen. He that is a Iew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, hates Samaritane-worship, who worshipped they knew not what, but hee knowes what hee worshippeth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 22.</p>
                  <p>Well, if this be so, then no godly man euer did, or wil pray to the Angels or Saints, or to the Court of heauen; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> for this is an high vngodlinesse and idolatrie: for,</p>
                  <p>First, the Angels know not our hearts directly: 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 39. <hi>Heare thou in heauen in thy dwelling place, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and doe and giue euery man according to all his waies, as thou knowest his heart; for thou onely knowest the hearts of all the children of men:</hi> here we see, that it is Gods priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And if hee onely, then not the Angels, who therefore are not able to know our wants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:18743:122"/>
Secondly, the Angels are but fellow-seruants, and not gods to be worshipped.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they refuse all religious worship and seruice and honour (sauing <hi>honor charitatis)</hi> that is to be loued. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. 9. <hi>See thou doe it not; for I am thy fellow-seruant:</hi> as if he had said, If I were God, thou mightest worship me.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but <hi>Ioshua</hi> fell downe before the Angell, and worshipped him, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 14. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the Lord himselfe, the Captaine of the Lords hoste, that is, Lord of the Angels: and he is bid to put off <note place="margin">Answ.</note> his shooes, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, when God was present.</p>
                  <p>Also, IOSHVA called him IEHOVA, which can agree to none but God: IOSHVA <hi>non adorâsset, sinon agnouisset Deum,</hi> saith ORIGEN. Or lastly, IOSHVA was but a man, and subiect to infirmities as we are, and therefore his action, if it had been sinfull, may not be our rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Another Angell came, and stood before the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>Altar, hauing a golden censer, and much odours was giuen vnto him, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the golden altar, which is before the throne.</hi> Therefore we must both inuocate them, and they offer our prayers to God.</p>
                  <p>First, by prayers are meant the prayers of the Saints in <note place="margin">Answ.</note> earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the Angell, is meant Christ himselfe, who elsewhere is called the Angell of the couenant; he offers our prayers; and the <hi>thuribulum aureum,</hi> the golden cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, is <hi>corpus eius sanctum,</hi> and the Altar is himselfe, who sanctifieth our prayers, as the Altar doth the gift: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, heere is but one Angell to offer our prayers; and if it were a created Angell, it yeeldeth no ground to inuocate all, as the Papists doe, naming them seuerally, <hi>Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:18743:122"/>
Secondly, as not to the Angels, so neither will a godly man pray to the Saints departed: for <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? Psalm.</hi> 73. 25. Whom? the Papists will say, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iaacob,</hi> and the rest. Well, but <hi>Dauid</hi> had none of them; <hi>Adam, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and other godly men were then in heauen, yet hee knew not their helpe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Saints in heauen know not our wants. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtlesse thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of vs, and Israel know vs not.</hi> If so great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes (saith <hi>Augustine)</hi> knew not what became of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, surely neither did other dead persons know. If ABRAHAM and IAACOB know vs not, no more doth PETER, PAVL, the blessed Virgin, nor any other of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euery godly man will goe to the Father by the Sonne: for none comes to the Father but by the Son, and, <hi>There is no Mediatour but one, euen the man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>Indeede there is but one Mediatour of redemption, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but moe of intercession: and it is great boldnesse to rush into the Kings presence, if way be not made by some of his Councell or Guard. <hi>Absolom</hi> could not come into his Fathers sight, but by <hi>Ioabs</hi> intercession, nor <hi>Adoniah</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> but by his mother.</p>
                  <p>First, Christ hath performed the whole office of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation euery way, and is our whole saluation: and the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Scripture was much ouer-seene to omit that distinction, if any such were, where it had so fit place, and necessitie did so vrgently require it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the King hath commanded, that we should mediate onely by the Prince, and not by any other of the Court or counsell of heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a carnall argument from things earthly and ciuill, to heauenly and spirituall, as in the instance of <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Salomons</hi> Mother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:18743:123"/>
Fourthly, it is but a glosse to vse their distinction, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery where they pray the Saints to intercede for them, not only by their prayers, but also by their merits; and not only set the Virgin at the right hand of God, as <hi>Salomon</hi> did his Mother, but also set her aboue Christ, diuiding his Kingdome into two, one halfe of which standing in administring iustice they leaue to him, but all the office of mercy is hers; and so they appeale from the Throne of the Fathers iustice, to the seat of the Mothers <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Biel in Can. Miss. Lect.</hi> 8.</note> mercy; and so betweene them the Sonne hath nothing to doe: nay, shee must command her Sonne, in the right of a Mother, to be propitious vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>But the Saints departed, though they see not directly <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> what is done on earth, yet they see in God, or the glasse of the Trinitie, all our doings, or else the Angels may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale them vnto them: therefore still wee may pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>This argument is more brittle then their imaginary <note place="margin">Answ.</note> glasse, which we must handle tenderly for feare of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. For what is this glasse? Is it the essence of God? No, this neuer was, nor euer can be seene; if it could, as it is most simple, so neuer was there any change in it, nor any new or diuers image: and if they see in Gods essence our doings, they see all things, euen the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Papists themselues denie. Or is this glasse a bright and glorious light, as some say? But thus it is impossible for the Saints to see any thing, because God sees it: for by common reason, doth he that sees the glorious light of the Sunne, see al which the Sunne doth enlighten? or can hee bee present where euer the beames of the Sunne are?</p>
                  <p>Oh, but they call not on the Saints as Gods, but as <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Gods friends.</p>
                  <p>First, this is false: for by this inuocation they ascribe <note place="margin">Answ.</note> vnto them omnipresence, and omnipotency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they inuocate them as Gods. Secondly, Idolatrie is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18743:123"/>
a spirituall whoredome: now it will bee no good excuse for a woman, to say, Shee is not so bad, shee yeelds not her body to her husbands enemies, but to his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aquinas</hi> stands much on one place to proue inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, and that is, <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Call now if any will</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>answere, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith hee, wee may call vpon the Saints, and they will heare vs.</p>
                  <p>A most silly argument: for, first, by Saints, <hi>Eliphas</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> meaneth not Saints in heauen, but in earth. Secondly, by turning to them, he meanes not, that he should doe it by inuocation, but by considering of former examples: and it is, as if he had said, Giue me example of any Saint so punished, as thou art, and not for sinne: for that was the argument. Thirdly, suppose hee had wished him to call vpon the Saints, yet it was the speech of a man, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to error, and not of God; and if he exhorted <hi>Iob</hi> to Saint-worship, he was not to be obeyed. Fourthly, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> in the eighth Verse sheweth, whom he should go to for helpe, saying, <hi>I would enquire of God, and turne my talke to God, namely, to pray vnto him, and repent before him, if I were as thou, in thy misery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last obiection hath more wit then good matter. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> As, say they, We beleeue the communion of Saints, so wee must beleeue the communion of prayers: for this is the chiefest benefit and speciall part of communitie.</p>
                  <p>In the naturall body, common sense is distinguished <note place="margin">Answ.</note> from euery proper sense: so is it in the mysticall body; the Saints that are absent, helpe vs in common consent of nature, but the present Saints, which are on earth, onely they helpe vs with the proper sense of our misery, which they know, and therefore lend vs helpe: in generall, they desire our good, crying with a lowd voyce, and saying, <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true, &amp;c.</hi> but in speciall they know not our estate. Againe, there is a twofold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18743:124"/>
one of person, in the same mysticall body; and so wee acknowledge wee are one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Saints in heauen; the other of office and speciall administration; and thus only the Saints on earth are in communion with vs; they in heauen cannot doe the same office for vs, as we can doe one for another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, much lesse can any godly man pray to dead <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> things, to Images, stocks, and stones, to a piece of bread in the Masse, to Relikes as bones and rags, and much lesse to the woodden Crosse: all which directly ouerthrowes the horrible Idolatrie of the Church of Rome, whose Idols are aboue the Idols of the Gentiles, both in base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and in multitude.</p>
                  <p>For the first: if the Heathens had worshipped Mice, or Rats, or Frogs, yet they would haue scorned to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship rags and bones, and mouldy bread, and a rotten stick, or block, for the Crosses Relike, and yet these the Papists doe inuocate. As for the number, <hi>Augustine</hi> notes, that the Heathen had three thousand knowne gods, and in diuers places three hundred <hi>Iupiters,</hi> or chiefe gods: but the Papists haue multiplied three thousand by thirty thousand: euery Citie, nay not only euery City (for not according to the number of their Cities, but of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, is the number of their gods:) euery house, nay, euery person hath his speciall Angell to bee prayed vnto daily; euery state, order, art, disease hath a speciall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone and Physician to be inuocated. Euery Altar, euery consecrated Host receiued or boxed vp, is a God, new made by the Priest and Baker, and this must bee inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yea the holy beasts in Popery haue their seuerall gods; the horse hath <hi>S. Loy</hi> to pray vnto if he can, and the Pigs haue <hi>S. Anthony:</hi> the Sea hath her <hi>Neptune</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, the Woods their <hi>Satyres,</hi> the Waters their <hi>Nymphs,</hi> the Corne <hi>Ceres,</hi> the Wine <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the very like heathenish superstition and idolatrie is in Popery. I will not speake of the Prophets, Apostles,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18743:124"/>
Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, Bishops, and Fathers, and a Legion of Legend-Saints canonized, and speciall prayer directed vnto them. Whence I conclude, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to bee an heape of Idolatrie, and a sinke of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable heresie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we see by this doctrine, where to speede our <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> selues in affliction, and whither to goe, namely, to God: for so did the Prophets, Apostles, Saints, and Christ on the Crosse, and we haue no example to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but the worst will runne to God in trouble and <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> danger, and seeke him diligently, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>First, the wicked first try all meanes abroad, if they <note place="margin">Answ.</note> can haue any helpe and refuge. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6. Many say, <hi>Who will shew vs any good?</hi> if they can finde helpe there, that is their god for the present.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if an vngodly man see no helpe there, his heart is downe, he must then to God, but he prayeth not; he only howles vpon the bed of his sorrow like a beast, through sense of paine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his shewes of prayer, hee seekes not God, but himselfe, not Gods fauour, but present ease.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the manner of his prayer is tumultuous, his desires are not distinct, his prayer not settled in his soule vpon true sense of his want, his voyce not tuned by the Spirit; his lips walke, but his heart mooues not; so hee babbleth wordes, he is soone wearie, he is in a businesse that hee is not vsed to, and at least hee holds not on till God answere him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if he obtayne reliefe or release, he can impute it to second causes, and then he hath done with God till he need him againe. Thus he hath neither experience of Gods loue, nor increase of loue to God. Thus it is hard for him to pray in affliction, and he can neuer doe it well that is not a godly man, accustomed to prayer in his peace.</p>

                  <p>HEre is the fourth or last point in the godly mans practice, namely, the time when hee shall pray. The phrase implyeth three things: first, that prayer is a seeking of God: for finding supposeth seeking. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is a time when God, though sought, will not bee found. Thirdly, that there is a time, when the godly shall finde him.</p>

                  <p>But God is euery-where present, and what neede wee <note place="margin">Quest.</note> seeke him? or, seeing hee is neuer absent, how can hee bee found?</p>
                  <p>In God are two things to be considered: first, his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> God is sought in his presence not in his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> Secondly, his Presence. His Essence or Godhead, which is not farre from any of vs, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27. wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke nor finde. But his Presence, or, some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table signe of his presence and grace, we are commanded to seeke, and to our comfort doe often finde: this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture the seeking of <hi>the face of God;</hi> the face is that, whereby a mans presence is knowne; and whatsoeuer it is, wherein the Lord doth manifest his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is called the face of God, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 30.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but the Lord said to MOSES, <hi>No man can see</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> 
                     <hi>my face and liue, Exod.</hi> 33. 20.</p>
                  <p>The face of God is either <hi>prima</hi> or <hi>secunda, praesentia</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>Deitatis</hi> or <hi>habitationis.</hi> First, the first face of God is his diuine Essence, which is inuisible, which no man euer saw or can see, both because he is a Spirit and cannot be seene
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18743:125"/>
of any mortall Creature; as also because our weakenesse is such, as the brightnesse of such Maiestie would bring vs to nothing: for, if our eyes cannot, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of themselues, behold the brightnesse of the Sunne-beames, being a creature, how are we able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the infinite and surpassing brightnesse of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Secondly, the second face of God is his grace and fauour, called in <hi>Exodus</hi> the backe-parts of God, when God doth manifest his gracious Presence, or some part of his glorie, in some ordinarie or extraordinarie reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it. Of the former God speaketh to <hi>Moses,</hi> of the latter speakes <hi>Iaacob;</hi> hee had seene God face to face, that is, more cleerely and manifestly then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore he called the place <hi>Penuel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the old Testament, the Arke of the couenant was called the face of God, and the seeking of speciall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his presence there, is called the seeking of his face, because the Lord many wayes there gaue speciall testimonies of his presence, as</p>
                  <p>First, by giuing Answeres and Oracles from the Mercy-seat.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by preseruing it from the contempt of his Enemies, so as fiftie thousand Bethshemites were slaine for looking into it; nay, the Priests, the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> might not see it, but onely the high Priest once a yeere.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by winning honour to it by diuers miracles, as, that before it the waters of Iordan were diuided, the walls of Iericho fell downe, and <hi>Dagon</hi> before it lost his head and hands. And because God was so specially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there, the Iewes must in their prayers turne their faces towards the Arke, and towards Ierusalem, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did being in Chaldaea. And that the Iewes might know where to finde God at all times, hee told them that hee would dwell in the Sanctuarie, and sit between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:18743:126"/>
Indeede the Iewes were encouraged hereby to seeke God, but what is that to vs? If wee had such a set place, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> where GOD had tyed his presence and residence, wee should haue more comfort to seeke him, then now wee haue.</p>
                  <p>Wee want not encouragement of seeking God, nor <note place="margin">Answ.</note> neede doubt of finding him, if wee take these grounds with vs:</p>
                  <p>First, if wee seeke him in his owne house: for where should a man be found but in his owne house? God had <note place="margin">1. Conditions in seeking God.</note> one standing house in the Old Testament, not where his infinite essence, which the heauen of heauens was not able to containe, but where his Name and memoriall dwelt: but in the new he hath a number of houses, and being omni-present, he will be found in them all: First, the Church-assemblies, thefe be so many Bethels or hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God; there the Church sought him, and found him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 1. among the tents of Shepheards; and Christ was downe in the Garden, and among the beds of Spices, that is, the assemblies of the Saints, where graces grow vp as sweet spices in a bed. Christ delights to walk in the midst of the golden Candle-stickes; therefore in these houses of Prayer seeke him by faithfull prayer, and thou shalt not misse him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, euery Christian Family is a house of God: where two or three consent in any one thing in his name, Christ is in the midst them. <hi>Adams</hi> Family, where God was worshipped and sacrifices offered, was Gods face; whence <hi>Cain</hi> complaines he was cast out. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saluteth priuate Christians with the Church in their houses. Therefore make thy house Gods house, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his worship therein, and thou shalt haue him neere thee with all sweet fellowship and fulnesse of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euery Christian soule is a temple of GOD. 2. Cor. 6. 16. <hi>Yee are the Temples of the liuing God:</hi> as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18743:126"/>
God hath said, I will dwell among them, and walk there. Then make thy heart his Temple, and, if thou wouldst finde him, seeke him there, thou shalt finde him no where else, or sooner then there. Adore him in thy soule, and worship him in his holy Temple, offer vpon the Altar a pure heart thy sacrifice, euen the sweet incense of prayer. Let the candle of thy faith euer burne before God, let the Arke of thy soule keepe the tables of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and keepe within thy heart that pot of Manna, euen Christ, the bread of life. By this meanes thy soule is Gods Temple, where he will be found as a man is in his owne house.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as we must seeke him in his owne house, so by his owne light and meanes, and this is two-fold: <note place="margin">2.</note> First, the Word of God in Precepts and Promises; this is a lanthorne to our feete, and a light to our pathes, by which God may be discerned, whom the darknesse of the world cannot comprehend. Secondly, such signes of his presence as he hath made choice of to reueale his grace in. In the Old Testament beleeuers must seeke him in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and ceremonies, and therein hee gaue them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answeres: the sacrifices were partly hilasticall or expiatorie, and partly Eucharisticall or gratulatory; the ceremonies were all typicall, and pointed at Christ and the good things to come in him. So in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God hath appointed visible signes annexed to his Word, as the publique seruice of him in Spirit &amp; trueth, the offering vp of our sacrifices of prayer and praise, and frequenting of the holy sacraments or ceremonies; in all which he will be sought, &amp; out of these wil not be found. God cannot bee seene or found but by his owne light, and therefore hee that must seeke him, must haue the light of vnderstanding: <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>The Lord looked downe, to see if any would vnderstand and seeke after God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we shall finde God, if we seek him, not by the eyes of sense and nature, but of faith and obedience. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:18743:127"/>
God being of a spirituall nature, cannot bee seene with the eye of flesh, which seeth nothing but that which is materiall, visible, finite, and circumscriptible as GOD is not. Nay, if the soule of man a finite spirit cannot bee seene with the bodily eye, much lesse the God of spirits, who is infinite and of such puritie, as the Angels are not able to behold.</p>
                  <p>Neither are wee able to see God, or finde him by the eye of our minde, as being corrupted with sinne: nay, neither can seeke him more then the Gentiles, of whom it is said, that <hi>the Lord was found of them that sought him not,</hi> Isai. 65. 1. For till the sound of the Gospell was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried among the Gentiles, and Christ was proclaimed the Sauiour and Messias, inuiting them to saluation, they neuer asked after Christ, but had their mindes darkned, alienated from the life of God, by the ignorance that is in them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. A dead man cannot seeke the things of this world; the lost groat could not thinke of her that lost it; no more can a man seeke God before his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; it must bee an eye of grace enlightned and cleared by God, that can seeke him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeke and ye shall finde,</hi> Mat. 7. 7. and, Whosoeuer seeke, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> finde.</p>
                  <p>Christ speakes thus to his Disciples, and the promise is <note place="margin">Answ.</note> not made to the seeking, but to the seeker, being a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp; in Christ: So as the meaning is this: Whosoeuer haue beene first sought of God and found of him, shall seeke and finde him: else <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man comes vnto me, vnlesse the Father draw him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we shall seeke aright, if wee seeke God in <note place="margin">4.</note> Gods manner, and that is in foure things. First, if we seek him in <hi>sinceritie</hi> of Spirit, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18. praying <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> as knowing that we are to deale with God who is a Spirit: and in sinceritie, because he is a God that loueth trueth in the inward parts: This condemnes hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call seeking, which is but deceitfull. Ier. 29. 13. <hi>Yee shall</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:18743:127"/>
                     <hi>seeke me, and finde me, because yee shall seeke me with all your heart.</hi> Secondly, in <hi>feruency:</hi> men are commanded to seek for wisedome as for gold &amp; treasures; how eagerly &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly do men seek after gold and earthly things? why, no labour can beate them from their desires: How much more carefully ought they to seek after spirituall graces, and most of all after God himselfe? Thirdly, in season, <hi>timely,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 2. <hi>Early in the morning will I seek thee;</hi> that is, euery morning the beginning of my worke shall be to looke towards thee, I will begin my duties in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inuocating thy help and aide. Fourthly, in <hi>his Sonne:</hi> seeke him in Christ the onely Mediator; For none can come to the Father but by the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, we shall seeke aright and with comfort, if we seeke him in the right ends, namely, for himselfe; not as <note place="margin">5.</note> the Iewes who followed Christ for bread and the belly; not to gaine the world by him, but to gaine himselfe and his fauour, which is better then life; Yea to obtaine this, be content to seeke him with the losse of all, as the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Martyrs did. And then wee seeke himselfe for himselfe, when wee seeke his glory in euery thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to our owne shame and confusion.</p>
                  <p>Is this so? Doe the godly seeke God in prayer? Then <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> it followes that a godly heart findes a want of God: For seeking is of a thing that we want &amp; fain would haue, Ps. 143. 6. <hi>My soule desireth after thee, as the thirstie lands:</hi> and the reason is, because he knoweth he hath lost God; For, what need he seek that he hath not lost? First, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature he hath lost the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable presence of God, which in our innocencie wee enioyed, by losing our selues, we lost God. Secondly, in the dayly admissions and commissions of sinne after grace receiued, we lose his sight &amp; presence: For our sinnes separate betweene God &amp; vs, as a cloud betweene the brightnesse of the Sun and vs. Thirdly, a godly man sees the want of God, because hee knowes in some sort the worth of GOD, without
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18743:128"/>
whom the soule is dead, grace lost, the conscience in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heauen turned into hell, both here, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The world were not so miserable without a sunne, nor the body without breath, as the soule without God, the Sun of his Church, and the soule of the soule of euery beleeuer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godly hauing receiued a taste of Gods sweetnesse in Christ, and his graces, still seeke him for more; the more they drinke, the more they thirst; as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> the more familiar he was with God, the more hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to see of Gods glory: and here is no sacietie in this life, but the more a man hath, the more he wanteth and seeth his wants. But</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, if God depart in displeasure, and leaue a sense of wrath in the soule for sinne, then the soule findes such want, as it cannot sustaine it selfe without him, euen <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> will seeke God in trouble, and hypocrites in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will seeke him diligently, in hypocrisie. How much more will the godly heart aboue all desires, seeke his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and one cheerefull countenance from him? Of this want and this seeking our Text speaketh.</p>
                  <p>Numbers of men neuer finde any want of God, they finde the want of health and wealth, of friends and meanes: many say, Who will shew vs any good? and a great sort seeke corne, and wine, and oyle; but a few say, Lord lift vp thy countenance vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>God forbid we should feele no want of God. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The carnall man cannot feele the want of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <note place="margin">Answ.</note> presence, because hee contents himselfe with the comfort of his creatures, and therefore he cannot seeke God to finde him. A man that seekes a lost iewell, lookes still to see that, for other things comming in his way hee sees not them, but passeth sleightly ouer them, hee seekes not them; so hee that seekes GOD, makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition onely for himselfe, no other thing contents him but himselfe, no other thing takes vp his minde,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18743:128"/>
and therefore the worldling indeede wants not God nor seekes him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the godly man seeke God in prayer, then he frequents the places where God hath promised to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> bee found: Hee hath pleased to tye himselfe to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Saints, that there those, that would meet with him, might be sure to finde him. Gracelesse men therefore are they, that turne their backes vpon God, that leaue the Church and assemblies, that take their horse and trauell about worldly businesses on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, with pretence that they can pray as well in the way, and serue God on horseback as well as the best: But they are deluded by the Deuill whom they serue, they haue no God but their belly and their wealth. And is it not a strange enchantment, that while a man runnes from God, from his presence and assemblies, yet hee should thinke to meete with him and finde him? And so he shall, hee will at last meete with thee, and finde thee out in thy hypocrisie; and if his patience let thee goe on, waiting for amendment, remember that he is fetching a stroke, which, the higher it is lifted, the heauier it will fall. Be warned by others example.</p>
                  <p>A certaine Noble man for hunting vsually on the Lords day, had a child borne with the head of a dogge, that seeing he preferred his dogges before the seruice of God, he might haue one of his owne getting to make much of, Theatr. Histor.</p>
                  <p>Also a Flaxe-woman at Kimstat in France, dressing her Flaxe commonly on the Sabboth, for meere coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse and eager greedinesse vpon the world, after two faire admonitions on two Sabboths together by fire, was the third day burnt with her Flaxe and two children. A warning for women, who on the Lords day minde their Brewing, Baking, Buckes-driuing, &amp;c. and will not be reclaimed.</p>
                  <p>A certaine man working hard at haruest on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18743:129"/>
in the meane time a fire kindled in his barne, and consumed all: according to the word of the Lord: <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
                  <p>At Paris garden, at a Beare-bayting, <hi>anno</hi> 1583. eight persons were slaine, many hurt, and all affrighted by the sudden breaking of the scaffold. Thus God hath waies enow to finde out prophane persons: thou canst not runne from God, but thou shalt know how farre thou art gone from him, and thou that carest not to find him, shalt be sure he will find thee in iudgement; and if thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rich by breaking Gods holy Sabbath, the Lord sends leannesse into thy soule, and the rust of thy money shall crie out against thee one day, Oh this is the money, which I haue got by breaking the Sabbath. The like may be said of them, that banish Gods worship and godly speech from their houses and tables, Oh, they will haue no such salt at their bankets, such words are neuer season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whereas they ought rather to bring in goodnesse into their families, then nip it in the head, and cast the Arke out of their houses.</p>
                  <p>So much of the first doctrine: the second followes, and is this.</p>
                  <p>There is a time, when God will not be found, though <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> he be sought. And this is true both in the wicked and <note place="margin">There is a time wen God will not be found, although he be sought.</note> the godly: first, the wicked still pray in a time of not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God; if they seeke, they neuer finde, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>Many shall seeke to enter, but shall not be able.</hi> Iames 4. 5. <hi>Yea aske and haue not, because ye aske amisse;</hi> now the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked alwaies aske amisse. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. The poore blinde man concluded against al the Scribes and Pharises, <hi>that Christ was a good man and righteous, because God heard him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, because the promise of hearing prayer is not made to the prayer it selfe, but to the person praying, <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> and not vnto him farther, then he is inuested with Christs righteousnesse, in whom he and his prayer is accepted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God wil not be found, when he is not sought
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18743:129"/>
in truth of heart, which can be found no where, but in a conuerted person; for then he is truly sought, when the heart bringeth these things: first, an earnest desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation: for no sacrifice is acceptable, but from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. Secondly, a speciall word and promise. <hi>Aske what is agreeable to his will, and you shall obtaine it,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 14. Thirdly, a speciall faith in the promise, which is necessarie to a true seeker, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Let him aske in faith.</hi> And <hi>Mark.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>If yee beleeue, yee shall haue what yee aske.</hi> Fourthly, it brings the exercises of pietie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, a putting off of the old man, and a putting on of the new: <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. <hi>Wash and cleanse you, and then come and seeke me.</hi> These conditions a wicked man cannot performe in seeking, and therefore he findes not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the wicked seeke not commonly, till the time of finding be past, they seeke too late; so did the foolish Virgins, it was too late when the gate was shut, it was too late, for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the sea, it was too late for <hi>Esau</hi> to seeke repentance, and the blessing with teares, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely reiected it, while it was in his power. While they haue light, commonly they spurne at it, and while the day lasteth, are idle; they neuer seeke God, till they must needes; and therefore when the night comes, they cannot worke or helpe themselues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if we consider what the finding of God is, we <note place="margin">When God is found.</note> shall see they cannot finde him. Then God is found, first, when according to the prayer of faith, he visiteth vs in mercy. Secondly, when by some signe of his mercy, hee testifieth a fatherly care and loue ouer vs. Thirdly, when he vouchsafeth not a generall, but a speciall and gracious presence with vs: Thus <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 12. the Church seeketh God till she finde him: But how is this finding exprest? thus: <hi>till he comes, and raines downe righteousnesse vpon vs:</hi> that is, when by the power and dew of his Spirit our hearts, otherwise like a drie and barren ground, are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, so as his Word may bring vp in vs blessed fruites of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18743:130"/>
righteousnesse, acceptable to God. But no wicked man hath any testimonie of Gods care ouer him as his Father, but onely as a Lord, neither enioyeth he more then a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall presence, not the presence of any speciall loue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> praying in hypocrisie, was heard in mercy, and <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> his prayer obtained a remoouall of the euill threatned: 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29.</p>
                  <p>Gods mercie is twofold: first, temporall; secondly, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> spirituall. God often giues to hypocrites to be heard in temporall mercies, as here an externall humilitie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed with an externall benefit, a temporall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with a temporall deliuerance: but for any spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deliuerance from the guilt and bonds of his sinne, or any spirituall blessing concerning saluation in Christ, to come from God as a father, this <hi>Ahab</hi> did neither seeke, nor could finde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in temporall things, the wicked are not heard in mercy so much as in iustice; not in loue, but in anger and wrath. Thus the Israelites asked Quailes, and had them: but, <hi>While the meate was in their mouthes, the wrath of God was vpon them, Psalm.</hi> 78. 30. The same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple asked a King, and, <hi>he gaue them one in wrath,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe said afterwards. It is not alwaies a mercie, that God grants a request: for then the Lord had shewed mercy to the deuill, to whom none belongs, when hee granted him his request against <hi>Iob</hi> and the Swine, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he did it for to bee a meanes of his owne shame and iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the godly also seeke sometimes, when God will not be found: but this must be vnderstood with two cautions: First, for the present he will not be found, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 2, 4. the Church sought Christ, whom her soule loued, <hi>but found him not;</hi> shee went a little farther, and found him. How strange did Christ shew himselfe to the woman of Canaan? what grim countenance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt shewed he by his silence, not vouchsafing to speak
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18743:130"/>
to her? and when hee spoke, what rough and churlish words gaue he to a woman in that distresse, calling her a Dogge? and yet in two or three words more shee heard from him, <hi>Be it vnto thee euen as thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their sense God will not be found, though indeede he neuer sends away emptie the prayer of faith: for though hee obscures his face, as the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and couers himselfe with a cloud, that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cannot come vnto him, yet the very sustaining of vs in seeking to him argues his presence. When the prodigall sonne was but resoluing to goe to his father, the father went out to meete him with compassion and loue, while he was yet a farre off, and had no sense of it. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> often complaines, <hi>Will the Lord absent himselfe for euer? hath he forgotten to be mercifull? and will he be neuer more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated? Why art thou so farre from the words of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint? thou makest as if thou heardest not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what be the reasons that the godly finde not the <note place="margin">Why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themselues alwaies find not God.</note> Lord alwaies? first, the Lord will not bee found of the godly, to chasten and correct them for their sinnes. Why cannot the Church finde Christ, seeking him so earnestly, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1? because she will seeke him in her bed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for her owne ease, and is loth to rise out of her bed; sometimes in the Streets, where shee list, and not where she should; sometimes she is heauie to go to the tents of shepheards, or the Temple; sometime shee hath reiected him, when he offered himselfe kindly, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3, 6. she wil not receiue him at the threshold; and therefore she must trudge vp and downe after him, and he will be farre from her finding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lord will not be found of a long time, that the continuance of their trouble, might let euen his owne children see the greatnesse of their sinnes, which haue plunged them so farre into Gods displeasure, as now he will not be intreated. For if our corrections were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies light and short, we would not conceiue sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18743:131"/>
the weight of our sinnes. And this dealing of God, though it may a while dismay his children, yet is good for them, that they may throughly feele their sinne, and, being bitten with it, might both seriously humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for the present, and beware of it for time to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will not alway be found, oftentimes to trie their faith hope, patience, and obedience. <hi>Abraham</hi> must not find God retrayting his heauie commandement till the third day, till hee was on the Mount, and had bound <hi>Isaac</hi> to the wood. <hi>Iob</hi> was tried to the vttermost, before he could find God taking his part, and so became a mirror of patience. The Canaanitish woman was held off so long, that her faith might bee a shame to all the Iewes, she being a Gentile: and therefore Christ said, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, euen the repentance of the godly, in respect of outward afflictions may come too late, and God will not be found. For though hee will not take his louing kindnesse from them, yet, if they be stubberne in sinne, he will visit them with the rods of men. If the decree bee once gone forth, they shall frustrate many meanes, and he will not repent nor spare, nor bee intreated: <hi>Ezech.</hi> 24. 13, 14. <hi>Thou remainest in thy filthinesse and wickednes; because I would haue purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthinesse, till I haue caused my wrath to light vpon thee, &amp;c. Moses</hi> (no question) repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the sinne, in that hee glorified not God at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of strife, yet in regard of the temporall correction, it came too late, he must not goe into Canaan. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all <hi>Dauids</hi> repentance and praying, the childe of adulterie must die, because, if once God passe sentence, it may not be called backe. Therefore, <hi>Search, O search your selues, O people, not worthy to be loued, before the decree come forth: Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Lord will not be found often for a time to the sense of his children, to whet vp their desires after
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18743:131"/>
him; both to make them long after him in his longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and also to make more account of his presence; as the Mother stands behinde a doore, and lets the Childe cry after her, it sees it owne weakenesse and gets a knock and thereby perceiues the need of her. Further, we enioy no good thing, as health, wealth, or libertie, but the harder it is come by, the more it is set by, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lightly comes, lightly goes; a disease easily cured is easily incurred, and not so carefully preuented. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 3. When the Spouse had sought Christ here and there, and could no where finde him, at length finding him, shee tooke fast hold on him, and would not let him goe.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, God will not alway be found, that wee might herein see a resemblance of that eternall displeasure of God, against impenitent sinners, when as those that seeke after the Lord with true repentance, stick in their trouble and cannot easily get discharge. This vse <hi>Peter</hi> maketh, 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>If iudgement begin at the house of God, what shall be the end of those that obey not the Gospell? and if the righteous scarcely be saued, where shall the vngodly and the sinner appeare?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to whom then is that promise made, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7. <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeke and yee shall finde;</hi> if the godly seeke and find not?</p>
                  <p>To the godly: but first, all such promises goe with <note place="margin">Answ.</note> exception of the Crosse, for tryall and correction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must distinguish between Gods delayes <note place="margin">Gods delayes to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from denyalls.</note> and denyalls; he giues not that we aske for the present, but giues it after when we are fitter to receiue it, and the giuing will make more to his glory and our comfort. <hi>Abraham, Zachary, Annah,</hi> prayed, no doubt, for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their yong dayes, but were not heard till they were stricken in yeeres, whereby God had more glory, and themselues more exercise, experience, and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is found often in another kinde, better for vs, when we thinke he will not be found, as in <hi>Paul,</hi> Hee prayed God to remoue the pricke of the flesh, but
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18743:132"/>
God would not be found in that, yet he was in supplying sufficient grace. Christ himselfe praied that the cup might passe from him; his Father was not found in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but hee was found in passing him well through it, which was far better. So if God giue not the particular we aske, but some thing better then it for it, as patience, exercise, and increase of grace, and strength that holds the heart in faithfull expectance, who can denie but that he is found? and sometimes God giues more then our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and is this a denyall? A poore man askes a penny, we giue him a shilling; is this to denie his request?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godly in seeking are tyed to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, of which if they faile, let them blame their owne vnfaithfulnesse, and not the faithfulnesse of God who cannot denie them, as</p>
                  <p>First, if they seeke not according to his Will, or as his Word alloweth, but as <hi>Zebede's</hi> Sonnes, they know not what they aske; they must haue, not what is good for them, but what seemeth good to them: this was <hi>Moses</hi> his fault, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they aske without faith, in wauering and doubting of Gods hearing or answere.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they aske without patient wayting the Lords leisure, making more haste then good speed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the manner and time of hearing, which sinne was noted in the Israelites, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 41. they limited or stinted the holy one of Israel: here it is iust that the Lord is not found of his owne seruants: But keepe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of seeking, and in some of these wayes the promise is true, <hi>Seeke and yee shall finde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, if there be a time, when God will not be found, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> then must the godly hence learne rightly to conceiue of Gods not hearing their prayer: for it proueth not, that either they are out of Gods fauour and loue, as hastie persons are ready to gather and conclude against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Lord regards them not, oh hee hath broken
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18743:132"/>
the bottle of their teares, and they are none of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or that the Lord grudgeth their good or is loth to afford it them; or to discourage them, to the breaking off of their prayers; or God hath forgotten his promise: But it serues to teach them to turne against their sinnes, <note place="margin">Peccato graues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit oratio.</note> which hide good things from them, and to ioyne watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against euill, with wishing and prayer for good. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the longer our prayers are put off, enter we into a more serious examination, &amp; seuere proceeding against our sinnes. Thirdly, say thus with thy selfe, The Lord now tries my faith, patience, loue, hope, and perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: I must not limit him as the Bethulians did, or send for him in post-hast, but wait his leisure; though the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stay, &amp; be yet appointed for a time, yet at length it shal speake and not lye, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3. And, were it fit for a subiect by poste to send for the King? Fourthly, it may bee, I know not well what I aske, and the Lord knowes to giue mee better or aboue that I aske: If it bee a good thing, perhaps it is not good for me, or not yet. I must be kept humble still with a pricke in the flesh, to let out my winde of vaine-glory. What? haue I a promise for that I pray for? else I offer strange fire. And is not this promise conditionall? let me pervse it and so pray. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doubtlesse the thing I aske is worth more prayer and more labour, and I vnder-value it: God by this delay would make mee know the worth of it by hard obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and learne to vse it well when I haue it, that I may not forfeit it: great things must bee sought with great affection. Sixtly I must know, my prayer is a seed-time, it is sowne in heauen, and cast into the bosome of God, and, as we cannot sow and reape presently, but the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man waits patiently a whole winter, so must I wait the comming vp of my prayers: for certainely, if the prayer of faith presently returne vs not some good, it layes vp good in store for vs, to enioy afterward. And if God intend my bettring by present denial of my prayer, so must I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:18743:133"/>
Secondly, the godly must learne hence to pray for their prayers, seeing it is so hard for them to pray well, to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> end that they may finde entrance to God, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before him. Thou that hast not found God vpon thy prayer, tell me, Hast thou prayed, that God would heare thee therein, and direct thee to pray aright? Know this for certaine, Thou must sanctifie all things, euen the word and prayer, by the word and prayer. Take vp <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> practice. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 169, 170. <hi>Let my complaint come before thee, O Lord, and giue me vnderstanding according to thy Word. Let my supplication come before thee, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me according to thy promise.</hi> Or else thou mayest pray in a time of not finding.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the wicked may here see, what a great plague is vpon them, seeing God reiecteth their prayers, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> turnes them to sinne.</p>
                  <p>First, the soule of a naturall man is dead to God, and a dead man, we know, vtters no voyce.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing we liue at Gods allowance and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, and hee giues not till wee seeke, how poore and miserable must they bee, that can not seeke him to obtayne?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the strength of a Christian is in his prayer, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength was in his haire; if this bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he is a prey for all the spirituall Philistims.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it was the curse of <hi>Moab</hi> to pray and not preuaile, and it was the comfortlesse case of <hi>Saul</hi> in his need, not to be answered.</p>
                  <p>But God will not deale so roughly with his Creatures <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> as you talke of; why, he is gracious and ready to heare.</p>
                  <p>We acknowledge these attributes of God; but what <note place="margin">Answ.</note> is that to thee that art a Moabite, and out of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; what will Gods mercy profit thee, that lyest in sin vnrepented? Mercy belongs onely to the vessels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. What good can a conditionall promise doe him, that no way performes the condition? promises of mercy
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18743:133"/>
belong onely to those that keepe the condition of beleeuing.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a third doctrine to bee considered, and that is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a time wherein God will be graciously found of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>godly man, if he seeke him.</hi> Matth. 7. 7. <hi>Seeke and yee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">There is a time wherein God will be found of euery godly man, seeking him.</note> 
                     <hi>shall finde:</hi> this is a generall promise, made to all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ: and, <hi>Whosoeuer seeketh, findeth. Ier.</hi> 29. 11, 12. There is a promise, that Gods people shall cry vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and he will heare them; they shall <hi>seeke him, and finde him,</hi> because they shall seeke him with their whole heart. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>Before they call I will answere, and while they speake I will heare.</hi> Psal 9. 18. <hi>The poore shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way bee forgotten, the hope of the afflicted shall not perish for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Gods nature is to tender the miserie of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> and distressed, wherein hee cannot denie himselfe. <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Now for the oppression of the needy, and for the sighes of the poore, I will vp, saith the Lord, and set him at libertie.</hi> Exod. 3. 7. <hi>I haue surely seene the affliction of my people, and heard their cry, because of their taske-masters: for I know their sorrowes, and now am come downe to deliuer them:</hi> this is Gods philanthropie and louing affection to mankinde, to put forth thoughts of peace towards them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if God should not take one time or other <note place="margin">2.</note> to answere his children, he should not bee as good as his promise, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, and I will heare thee.</hi> Hee should reiect prayer preferred according to his will, and in the name of Christ, and the voyce of his owne Spirit, yea, the prayer of faith, tending to his glory and the saluation of his people, which hee cannot doe and continue faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he sets out a time of finding in respect of his <note place="margin">3.</note> owne glory, sundry wayes: first, by being found of his people, he procures praise and abundant thankesgiuing, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 24, 26. <hi>He hath not despised the poore, nor hid</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:18743:134"/>
                     <hi>his face from him: my praise shall be of thee in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. The poore shall eate and bee satisfied, they that seeke after the Lord, shall praise him:</hi> see <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. 13. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 19. <hi>The Fathers to the Children shall declare thy praise.</hi> Yea, the Lord challengeth this as a chiefe part of his glorie, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 7, 8. Secondly, by being found of his people, hee magnifies his owne name in the midst of his enemies; for they brag and exalt themselues, when they can tread vpon the necks of the godly. Now, lest they should say, We haue preuailed, and, Where is now their God? He steps in and findes a time to heare their weake prayers. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 8. <hi>He saued them</hi> (the Israelites pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the red Sea) <hi>for his names sake;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prayer of the Church, <hi>Not vnto vs, Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy name be the praise, 'Psal.</hi> 115. 1.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God will in time bee found of euery godly <note place="margin">4.</note> man, often because of the malice of the wicked, when it is come to the height. The Israelites had often prayed, and groned vnder their afflictions in Egypt in the foure hundred yeeres, but, because the sinnes of the Amorites and Canaanites were not full and ripe, they found not God in all that time; but when they were full, they were deliuered.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God sets out a time of finding in respect of <note place="margin">5.</note> the godly themselues: first, to prouoke them to loue the Lord, who giueth and forgiueth much: as <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 1. <hi>I loue the Lord, because he hath heard my prayer.</hi> Secondly, to encourage them in prayer and in the course of inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, wherein they finde God so good; yea, to bee instant, and presse in vpon him: <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 2. <hi>Because hee hath heard me in my dayes, I will call vpon him.</hi> This the Prophet expresseth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2. <hi>All flesh shall resort to thee a God hearing prayer,</hi> or, Because thou hearest prayer, all flesh shall resort vnto thee.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but God hath denyed to heare the prayers of his <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> children, they haue sought and neuer found, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:18743:134"/>
First, we may pray for temporall things, we must know that al the promises for them are made with a condition, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> If God see it good for vs: in such things a godly man may pray all his life time, and not finde, because GOD sees it better for him to be without them, and to lye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we must distinguish betweene delayes and denials, as we haue seene. <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the godly haue many speciall graces, but it is Gods wisedome to leaue them in some want, to know <note place="margin">3.</note> some pricke of the flesh, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, lest they should be puffed vp, being taken vp into such an heauenly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God heares his children in a better kinde, as we haue shewed. <note place="margin">4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the godly are tyed to conditions, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten broken. <note place="margin">5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, it may be thy prayer is heard, but the answere <note place="margin">6.</note> is not yet come to thy heart, the sense of graunt is not yet brought to thee, and there must goe some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene seeking &amp; finding: so the Angell said to <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. 22. 23. From the first day that thou didst set thy heart to seeke the Lord and humble thy selfe, thy words are heard, and now I am come to tell thee.</p>
                  <p>If the godly seeke sometimes in a time of finding, then we must learne to iudge wisely of the poore and afflicted <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> in spirit, not to triumph ouer them as <hi>Dauids</hi> enemies did ouer him: Oh, God hath forsaken him; or as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends did, All that he was, at best hee was but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. Oh, saith the world, this is not the child of God: Why? because the Diuell hath a little power ouer him, and God is gone. A false conceit: For, first, though he be not heard presently, yet hee shall be heard hereafter; there is a time when he shall finde God. Secondly, God is delighted in an humble spirit, and a broken heart. Thirdly, he is the God of the abiect; his promise is, that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18743:135"/>
such as mourne in Sion, shal be deliuered and haue beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for ashes. Fourthly, after this rate we shall condemne the greatest lights of Gods Church; <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles were in a thousand dangers, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, assaulted on euery side, yet as deare to God as euer they were: and it was a Iewish scoffe against Christ, Let God deliuer him now if he will haue him.</p>
                  <p>Let vs rather consider our owne case what it may bee, and bee charitably affected to them in distresse, as wee would haue others affected towards vs in the same case, knowing, that that which befals one man, may befall any man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if there be a time of finding, let vs take heed <note place="margin">

                  <p>Alas! I am then no godly man: for I haue prayed <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> long, and God will not bee found; must I not feare my estate?</p>
                  <p>Yes, feare and doubt in the godly, make their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Answ.</note> more sure in the end, because it sends them to the meanes of comfort: and by this thou mayest trie thy feare, and distinguish it from al vngodly feares &amp; doubts, which vanish away without any such vse.</p>
                  <p>But I am vnworthy to finde God, who haue incensed <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> his wrath, like an vnkinde and vnthankefull wretch, and that euery day.</p>
                  <p>A false ground of a false enemie: all thy worthinesse <note place="margin">Answ.</note> is the sense of vnworthinesse, and an apprehension of Christs worthinesse: What worthinesse was in Israel, when the Lord couered her with his skirt, and shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his? Did shee not wallow in her blood and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? And is not God the same, promising and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming mercie to them that confesse their sinnes and forsake them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:18743:135"/>
Oh, but my sinnes haue abounded, and haue so separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betweene God and mee, that I doubt I shall neuer <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> finde him.</p>
                  <p>Not so: For where sinne hath abounded, grace hath <note place="margin">Answ.</note> abounded much more; and in the forgiuenesse of many sinnes, God shall haue honour of much mercy and loue from the sinner in greater measure. And if hee delighted in the death of a sinner, or tooke pleasure in the death of him that dyes, any one sin would furnish him with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reuenge enough; but he is much in pardoning and delights therein. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, an oppressor, a blasphemer, &amp;c. yet God had mercie on me, to be an ensample in time to come to all that should beleeue in Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas! he sinned of ignorance, but I of knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> the light of my minde, the voice of God, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit, the cryes of my owne conscience, and haue so quenched and grieued the Spirit, that hee will come no more; I may not look to finde God as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Tell mee when <hi>Iohn</hi> said, <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth vs from all sinne,</hi> 1. Epist. 1. 7. doth he meane <note place="margin">Answ.</note> onely sinnes of ignorance? No verily: and if GOD haue made no distinction of small &amp; great sinnes, sinnes of knowledge and of ignorance, of weaknesse and of presumption, you may iustly and must defie a distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing deuill.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the godly must bee incouraged by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> to seek the Lord in a time when he may be found.</p>
                  <p>Oh that I knew that time! when is it?</p>
                  <p>First, one time of finding is, when a man hath beene <note place="margin">Quest.</note> truely humbled and-toucht for his sinne: Of this time <note place="margin">Answ.</note> our Prophet speakes in the Text: after humiliation <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Certain times when God will be found.</note> found God, and teacheth that euery godly man shall then find him. It is the troubled spirit that God respects, and at whom else doth the Lord looke? <hi>Isai.</hi> 66. 2. CHRIST came not to the righteous (in their owne
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18743:136"/>
conceit:) but to call laden and humble sinners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another time of finding God is, when all good meanes and care haue been vsed to finde him. God will not be found at first, because he will try the diligence of his seruants, in which hee sees the price they set vpon him, and the thing asked. The Spouse in her bed cannot finde Christ; but, if she get out, and vse all good meanes, enquiring and seeking after him, at last hee is found: and a godly heart cannot but thinke that the comforts Christ brings with him, are worth all his paines and labour. And it will manifest our care, if wee seeke him: First, early, as Prou. 8. 17. <hi>I loue them that loue mee, and those that seeke mee early, shall finde mee.</hi> Secondly, if we seeke him with all our heart, as Deut. 4. 29. <hi>Thou shalt find him, if thou seeke him with all thy heart, and all thy soule.</hi> Thirdly, in perseuerance, not by starts and fits, as the carelesse and temporizers, but as the Church that neuer rests till she finde him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another time of finding God, is the godly mans extremitie, and vrgent necessitie; for that is Gods opportunitie. The Lord will be a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen in affliction, (when hee hath no refuge elsewhere;) <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 9. and Psa. 10. 1. <hi>Why hidest thou thy selfe, O Lord, in due time, euen in affliction?</hi> Deut. 4. 29, 30. <hi>When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come vpon thee, at the length, if thou returne to the Lord, he wil not forsake thee.</hi> When <hi>Ionas</hi> was wrapt with waues and weedes in the bottome of the Sea, hee cryed, and God spake to the fish to set him on land. <hi>Dauid</hi> called out of the deepe, and God heard him. <hi>Moses</hi> cryed at the Red Sea, and then God was found. Christ in his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the garden prayed, and GOD sent the Angels to comfort him. <hi>Abraham</hi> found God three dayes after the commandement, on the mount. And after three dayes, when the case was hopelesse, and the Disciples faith was a little preiudiced, Christ rose againe. Therefore wait,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18743:136"/>
thou art not yet in the deepes, nor yet at the mount, the third day is not yet come.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, another time of finding God is, when God offers himselfe to be found in the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; for by it God comes and knockes at our doore and seekes entrance, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 20. and the opportunitie of the Gospell is called the day of saluation, and the day of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation. Let vs walke, while wee haue the light; this is the acceptable time. The Iewes knew it not till it was past, and they were left in their sinnes; let vs take heed it be not so with vs.</p>
                  <p>How can wee want motiues to seeke the Lord with comfort and assurance of finding him? for</p>
                  <p>First, God hath a fatherly care ouer vs, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Shepheard seekes thee, leauing ninetie nine to saue <note place="margin">Motiues to seeke the Lord.</note> one; and is not he willing to be found if thou seeke him? oh goc and meet him?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ seekes and sues to thee, Open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, my beloued: and why should not wee set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates of our hearts, that the King of glory may enter in? Euen when wee runne away from him, hee seekes vs and offers vs conditions of loue; hee runnes after fugitiue ADAM, that if hee will beleeue in the promised Messiah, hee shall bee saued: And haue not wee encouragement enough to knocke at the doore of his mercy?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider what a wofull threatning is sent out against such as will not seeke the Lord? as Zeph. 1. 6. <hi>Hee will stretch out his hand against all them that turne from him, that sought not the Lord nor inquired after him.</hi> and Zech. 7. 13. <hi>It is come to passe, that as I cryed, and they would not heare, so they cryed, and I would not heare, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Gospell is the hammer, by which God still knockes: now if thou wilt lay hold on mercy offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thou shalt haue a blessed answere: but if thou wilt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18743:137"/>
bolt vp thy heart with securitie and ignorance, how can he come vnto thee? Christ, when hee was borne, found no roome in the Inne, but was content to lie in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and surely the world is no changeling, it is as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull still, men are loth to make Christ a roome in the Inne of their hearts: If now in his glory he would be content with Stables, that is, hearts filled with noysome lusts, as so many filthy beasts, this roome they could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him. But know, that hee is past infancie and abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath shewed himselfe a Lord of glory, and will haue a roome and entertainement like himselfe: and, if thou makest him no roome by embracing the Gospell in the Kingdome of grace, hee will neuer make roome for thee in the Kingdome of glory. Now is the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, now lay hold on the light.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but it may continue long, and what needes such <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> haste?</p>
                  <p>First, that is vncertaine, we haue seene as faire Sunnes <note place="margin">Answ.</note> as ours fall from the midst of heauen, as the Churches of <hi>Ephesus, Corinth,</hi> and the seuen in lesser <hi>Asia.</hi> Secondly, thou canst not deny, but that we haue forfeited all our liberties by horrible sinnes against it. Thirdly, suppose the Gospell doe continue with vs, yet thou knowest not whether thou shalt stay with it one night. Therefore work while the day is, before the night come, and thou canst not worke.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, because as a man, ready to bee drowned, is drawne out of the waters, and so saued: so Gods present deliuerance is compared to the drawing out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>He hath drawne mee out of many waters.</hi> Thus <hi>Moses</hi> was drawne out of the waters, and Gods protection is the onely Arke to saue his children.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to shew that as the promise of God is large and excellent, so it is most sure and true.

The Angell must <hi>not hurt the earth,</hi> till all Gods Saints be marked.</p>
                  <p>First, the godly man stands on a rocke, the Lord is his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> rocke, that looke as in the ouerflowing of many waters, houses are driuen downe, men are drowned, and cattel perish, but he that is vpon a high rocke, is safe: so he that hath made the Lord his Rocke and defence, heauen and earth cannot stirre him. In the great deluge, the waters rose not vp to heauen, but onely fifteene cubites aboue the highest Mountaines of the earth; and, if thy Rocke be in heauen, the floods of great waters shall not touch thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:18743:138"/>
Secondly, Gods protection compasseth his people, as the hilles compassed Ierusalem. <hi>Moses</hi> being cast vpon <note place="margin">2.</note> the waters, but first put into a basket, was safe enough till he was drawne out. When the great deluge couered the face of the whole earth, the Lord prepared an Arke for <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie; therein they were safe, because God shut them in: Gods protection is this basket, this Arke to his children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as, if a man be cast into the sea, and can keepe his head aloft, hee cannot bee drowned; so, as long as <note place="margin">3.</note> Christ the head is aboue, hee will not lose the least and basest of his members; If Christ bee in the ship, all is safe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods word and promise is to be with them; <note place="margin">4.</note> at Christs word, <hi>Peter</hi> walkes safely on the water.</p>
                  <p>But sense and reason is against all these your sayings: <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> What? haue not the enemies with their violent inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come neere, yea, and almost ouerturned the whole Church? What stirres, tumults, martyrdoms and butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries haue been outragiously committed on the poore Saints? What horrible slaughters haue beene done on Protestants, in France, Flanders, Spaine? in our owne Countrie, the fires haue been kindled as hot as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezars</hi> furnace, to burne the bodies of Gods Saints, and some yet aliue haue seene those <hi>Marian</hi> daies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the streetes ran with the blood of the Saints, as Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems did in the time of <hi>Manasseh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church is like the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> which, the more the waters rose, the more and higher it rose; or like the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> ship, wherein Christ lay asleepe, which may bee tossed with windes and waues, but not ouerturned: euen so, the more the waters of affliction bee increased, the more is the Arke of the Church exalted. The Church may bee beaten with waues, but it shall bee still lifted vp aboue them. The Disciples may faint, and see the streames rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to swallow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea, in their sense may say, <hi>Master, we</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:18743:139"/>
                     <hi>perish:</hi> but Christ is in the ship, he will awake in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and rebuke both the storme, and their little faith. Thus the Apostle saith, <hi>We are in all things more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Prophet yeelds, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 19. that, <hi>great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuers them out of all:</hi> but marke how:</p>
                  <p>First, sometimes they are exempted from the common <note place="margin">Sundry wayes of Gods deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of his seruants.</note> inundation, that it doth not come neere them, as those 7000. marked, who bowed not their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> were saued from <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and the tenth and remnant reserued from common plagues, to propagate Gods grace and glory with the manner of his dealing, and their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sometime they are wrapped in the common miserie, as suppose the plague, or fire, or sword, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in finde the Lords compassion and mercy in speciall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances. <hi>Ieremy</hi> was taken into Babylon with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, but it was better with him there, then among his owne people. So <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Thou hast afflicted me sore, but hast not deliuered me vnto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, sometimes the godly are left vnto death, and led, as sheepe vnto the slaughter, and sustaine all the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and ignominy their enemies can deuise. And this the Lord doth permit: first, in respect of their enemies, that they may by their blasphemies and cruelty prepare and hasten their owne destruction. Secondly, of the truth, which is sealed and ratified with the blood of the Martyrs. Thirdly, of the growth of the Church, which is sowne and watered with the bloud of the Saints, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the seede of the Church. Fourthly, in respect of the godly themselues, to sweeten them; for the fire is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test place for perfumes: But yet</p>
                  <p>First, the Lord is not carelesse, much lesse prodigall of the liues of his seruants, but by speciall counsell, thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth and disposeth of them: for hee numbers their flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18743:139"/>
puts their teares into his bottle, and suffers not a haire, much lesse the head it selfe, to fall without his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. <hi>Precious to the Lord is the death of his Saints, Psal.</hi> 116. 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, being thus left in the enemies hand, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of deliuerance is most true, seeing, first, the rod of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 3.</note> the vngodly doth not rest vpon them, but by being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to them are deliuered from them. Secondly, in the midst of death they liue, conquer, and raigne: so saith the Apostle, We are slaine, but not ouer-come: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because Tyrants and Persecutors cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Faith, Hope, and Profession. Thirdly, they are deliuered from all the bands of sinne and death, and the imperfect man is wholly renewed. Fourthly, they rest in their beds, euen euery one that walketh before the Lord, and are deliuered from seeing the euill to come.</p>
                  <p>But seeing the wicked are deliuered from troubles as <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> well as the godly, out of many iudgements, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge is this?</p>
                  <p>First, the wicked are often temporally deliuered as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> well as the godly, but a sting is left behinde, so as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances of the godly, and the wicked, in three things.</note> is a blessing in it selfe, but not to them, whereas the godlies deliuerance is a true blessing both in it selfe, and vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God deliuers either as a Creator, or as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As a Creator and preseruer of things created, hee <note place="margin">2</note> preserues the wicked from some present euill, to reserue them to a greater mischiefe. Thus are the Deuils preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by God, and reserued to finall iudgement; only the wicked haue offer of grace, which the Deuils haue not. But as a Father, he deliuers his children, who often deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers his owne by correction, taking them away from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which might corrupt them, so as if they be not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally deliuered, they are deliuered eternally. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by being taken away by iudgement, are freed from iudgement, the wicked euery way preserued, or rather reserued vnto iudgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:18743:140"/>
Thirdly, God deliuereth either by vertue of a promise, <note place="margin">3.</note> made and applyed to the faithfull, claymed and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by fasting, prayer, and obedience, as <hi>Mordecai, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> 4. 16. and <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. or else not by vertue of any promise, as the wicked, who haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, no faith, and therefore no sound blessing. Thus we see the great difference betweene the deliuerance of the godly, and of the wicked, and as great comfort in the one, which the other wants.</p>
                  <p>This serues to comfort the godly; in that the Lord sits <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> vpon the floods, and that to this purpose, to performe this gracious promise. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 3. <hi>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the floods, that they shall not ouerflow thee.</hi> So <hi>Eliphas</hi> telleth <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 5. 19 <hi>In sixe troubles he will deliuer thee, and in the seuenth, euill shall not come neere thee;</hi> as if hee had said, Though sixe and seuen troubles beset thee, yet the euill of them shall not come neere thee. This presence of God with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, makes them glorie in their troubles, as in a crowne vpon their heads: and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gloried, that hee was more in affliction then al the false teachers, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. the Saints were in most deadly tryalls, and would not bee deliuered (namely, vpon vnlawfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions) because they found God as good as his word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, miserable men are they that withdraw their <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> hearts from the Lord, and seeke him not in his promises, nor in their prayers, but trust to wind out themselues by other meanes: some make falshood their refuge, and some embrace the world and carnall meanes, and leane vpon the arme of flesh. These fly from their defence, wait vpon lying vanities, and forsake their owne mercy, <hi>Ion.</hi> 2. 8. 'tis as if <hi>Noah</hi> for feare of the inundation should haue left the Arke, and flyed to the Mountaynes, which had beene to haue throwne himselfe into the midst of the waters; and thus doe they, that to auoid troubles, feare, and fly their profession, and so Apostasie, and Idolatrie,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18743:140"/>
and corruption drownes them. We must rather with the Church fly to the Rocke, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 2. <hi>Saue me, O God, the waters are vpon me, yea, I am come to the deepe waters:</hi> and then, being deliuered, we must goe backe vnto him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Saluation is the Lords,</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 124. 1. <hi>If the Lord had not beene with vs, the waters must needes haue drowned vs when they rored vpon vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this serues to perswade euery man to become godly, seeing this priuiledge belongs only to such: there <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> is no man but desires safetie in danger, and yet no man but the godly man can assure himselfe of safetie therein. If then thou wouldest haue assurance of this promise, thou must practise pietie, in these seueralls:</p>
                  <p>First, become an humble person, repent and turne to <note place="margin">How to be safe in dangers.</note> God, cry out of sinne, sue daily for pardon, as for life and death, and then let all the miseries in the world come haile-shot vpon thee, thou shalt be safe. Only sinne is as poyson, cast into the Lords cup: God giues thee no poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to drinke, but that is of thy owne tempering: pull the sting out of these Scorpions, and the sight onely will be dreadfull, but the danger is past.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as thou mournest for thy owne, so for other mens sinnes. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. God deliuered iust <hi>Lot,</hi> vexed with the vncleane conuersation of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, get thy heart washed with the bloud of Christ, bee a true Israelite, a true beleeuer: for God is good to Israel, euen <hi>to the pure of heart, Psal.</hi> 73. 1. and <hi>Deliuer Israel, O Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, get innocency and vprightnesse into thy life, to be able to say with DAVID, <hi>Deliuer me according to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>mine vprightnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, draw daily neerer vnto God, and if God bee with thee, or thou with him, thou needest not feare, though thou walkest in the shaddow of death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 4. and doe this three wayes: first, get neere him in thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, loue him in his Word and Image. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 14.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18743:141"/>
                     <hi>Because he hath loued me, I will deliuer him and exalt him,</hi> that is, set him out of the reach of trouble. Secondly, in obedience: <hi>I am thine,</hi> saith DAVID, <hi>O saue thy seruant.</hi> Thirdly, in thy confident prayer: so <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 9. For hee said to the Lord, <hi>Thou art my refuge.</hi>

If thou put away iniquitie, the Almightie shall be thy defence; when others are cast downe, thou shalt say, I am lifted vp, Psal.</hi> 103. 3. The Prophet prouoking
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18743:141"/>
his soule to praise the Lord for all his benefits, reckons vp the healing of all his infirmities, and the redeeming of his life from the graue; but before all these hee setteth forgiuenesse of sinnes, as the Leader and the cause of all the rest, thereby shewing, that all other of Gods mercies haue their rise from hence, as from their head and originall.</p>
               <p>First, sinne layeth open the sinner to all Gods wrath, and the curses of the Law in this life, &amp; the life to come: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> it sets a man as a butt, against whom the Lord shooteth all the arrowes of his displeasure: sinne not remitted makes vs enemies to God, and God to vs, so as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect any other but fruits of hatred. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. Israel hauing worshipped the Calfe, was naked to Gods iudgements, and hauing sinned a sinne, could not stand before the men of Ai, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7. 11, 12. Sinne is transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that is, a thrusting of vs out of our way, and so from vnder Gods protection, who hath giuen his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge ouer vs, to keepe vs no longer then we are in our way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is Gods couenant, who promising to put his Law into their inward parts, and to write it in <note place="margin">2.</note> their hearts, and to become their God, and accept them for his people, he giueth the reason of all the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, because he would forgiue their iniquitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their sinnes no more, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33, 34. And indeed euery-where wee may obserue how God begins all our good here. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 41. First, he takes away the sinnes of his people, and then delights to doe them good, to watch ouer them, to build and to plant them. And <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 17, 18 First, the Lord takes their <hi>Baalim</hi> from his people, and then makes a couenant and marries his Church vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and then, to safeguard his Spouse, hee makes a league with the Beasts of the field, with the Fowles of heauen, and creeping things; then will hee breake the Bow, and Sword, and battell out of the earth, that they
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18743:142"/>
may sleepe safely. While man kept couenant with God, hee had dominion ouer the Creatures; but rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God by sinne, the Creatures rebell against him: and now God, making and renewing his couenant againe with man himselfe, reneweth also this clause of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Creatures, that they shall be at peace, which is no other then a promise of protection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, confidence is a fruit of faith: for wee must <note place="margin">3.</note> first beleeue God, to be our God, before we can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that his mercy and truth belongs to vs: our ground for our confidence in outward mercies, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances, must bee an assurance of his inward loue, in which wee may glorie, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5. <hi>Why art thou cast downe, O my soule? trust in God, he is my God and my present helpe.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. the Apostle laying this ground, It is God that iustifieth, challengeth with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence principalities and powers, things present &amp; things to come, and all creatures as too weake and impotent to separate vs from Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what doe the Scriptures else teach vs, while <note place="margin">4.</note> euery-where they make the particulars of our comfort, fruits of this root? as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74. Deliuerance from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies proceedes from the release of the punishment of sinne. Our peace with God, boldnesse with him, accesse to the Throne of grace, come from our iustification by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Peace at home in our owne soules, is a fruit of remission of sinne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Thy sinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee: Goe in peace:</hi> Yea, our whole redemption from first to last, from all enemies, spirituall and temporall, and all the fruits of sinne, is called by the name of remission of sinne, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. and in the entrie of our Psalme we haue shewed, that all our blessednesse is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in remission of sinne.</p>
               <p>But then it seemes, that where men are not protected <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and deliuered from danger, that their sinnes are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:18743:142"/>
This was the error of the Iewes, that they thought those, on whom the Tower of Siloam fell, greater sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note place="margin">Answ.</note> then the rest, and those whose bloud <hi>Herod</hi> mingled with the sacrifices. But wee must know, that the Lord doth performe his promises of temporall deliuerances and benefits, not absolutely, but conditionally, so farre as will stand with his wisedome and glorie, and the good and saluation of his owne children. Sometimes the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cannot hurt <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the Lyons <hi>Daniel:</hi> but againe, sometimes they may bee ouer-taken with dangers, and seeme to be left in them, but so, as first, they are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the former mayne ends; and secondly, as they are good for them, all things falling out to the best to them that loue God. Neither may it be strange, that although remission of sinne be the ground of all deliuerances, yet all that haue remission of sinne, haue not deliuerance from temporall dangers, but some of the Saints are hewne asunder, tempted, slaine, burnt, hanged, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiously put to death: For, as the subiection of the creatures to vs, dependeth vpon our subiection to God, and our peace with men, vpon our keeping peace with God: so our subiection and peace with God here, being only begunne and imperfect, we must recouer our safetie from the creatures, and peace with men, but in part and imperfectly. But yet that which is wanting here, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed with spirituall peace, euen here, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>In the world yee shall haue affliction, but in me yee shall haue peace:</hi> and afterward with that peace that is euerlasting.</p>
               <p>First then, where God begins our safetie, let vs begin <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> it, in labouring to feele our inward peace with God, which will quiet our hearts in the assurance of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and protection in outward things; it will be an easie descent from the greater to the lesse. In the want of <hi>outward things,</hi> say to thy selfe; God out of his loue hath giuen me his owne Sonne, and will hee not giue mee all things with him? Shall he giue me heauen, and not earth?
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18743:143"/>
In the want of <hi>inward</hi> comforts say to thy soule, Why art thou cast downe, my soule? while I was yet an enemie and a sinner, God hath reconciled me by the death of his Sonne; how should hee now cast mee off being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled? In bodily dangers, what a prop doth this doctrine giue vs? Hath my Lord prouided with so much cost, so great saluation for my soule? and will he neglect to saue and preserue my bodie? hee that doeth the greater, will not hee doe the lesse? In molestation by externall aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries; What? hath my Lord and head foiled the Deuill for me, troden Satan vnder my feet, and trampled vpon all spirituall enmities for mee? and will hee not beate backe the endeuours and vniust practices of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Shall I beleeue the greater, and not beleeue the lesse?</p>
               <p>Secondly, in receiuing and enioying outward benefits, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> labour to see them all to be the riuers &amp; streames of this fountaine; for then they be sweet indeed: as the streame is then sweet, when the head and fountaine is so; but, if the Fountaine be bitter or poisoned, so are the streames. For first, they are no further mercies then they proceede from mercy, and then they be mercies indeed as they are <note place="margin">Nothing is a mercy, but what proceeds from mercy.</note> called. Secondly, else we enioy them by a broken title, if not by vertue of the Couenant, and euen those creatures are in a kinde of bondage, from which God frees them often by plucking them from vniust owners, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 9. Thirdly, else we distinguish not our selues from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, scarce from the beasts, who find and taste the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the creatures as we do, but not of GOD in them. Naturall men stay in the fruition and delight of the things themselues, and can goe no further, whereas, as the riuers lead vs to the sea, so ought wee to bee led by them to the minde of the Lord towards vs in them. Fourthly, those that delight themselues in the pleasures and delights of things below, and want the pardon of sinne, are as if a man should drinke off a cup of sweet
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18743:143"/>
poyson with much delight, but presently or not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it workes deadly. Thy sinne is poyson, which thou castest into the cup that the Lord hath made to run ouer. Fiftly, a little gift with loue and good will, is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable then a great deale with strife and grudging. If a man can see Gods loue and good will toward him in Christ, hee will be content with a little, thankefull for a little, cheerefull with a little; and his portion, though very small, will bee very precious. Sixtly, if assurance of remission of sinnes giueth vs such ioy in trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that the Saints can reioyce in tribulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. how will it reioyce the heart in the fruition of Gods mercies? Oh then, how ought we to labour earnestly by the eye of faith to discerne the beames of Gods loue and fauour, chasing away the cloud of our sinnes, without which all our comforts are but bitter and vnsauorie?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence gather the priuiledge of Gods children, to whom remission of sinnes is sealed vp, which is, to be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> secure either from perils or in perils: For first, once in Gods Couenant, and euer safe: for the couenant is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as God himselfe is, an euerlasting couenant, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 3. Secondly, their afflictions are not punishments of sinne, but either tryals or louing corrections, the sting of them is gone. Thirdly, whereas the wicked, whose sinne is not pardoned, are haunted and vexed with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and feare where no feare is: a godly man is as bold as a Lyon, yea in the presence and sense of danger. <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Thou shalt not bee afraid of destruction when it commeth, but shalt laugh at destruction and death:</hi> For the stones shall be at league with thee, and the beasts, &amp;c. Who would not be exempted from danger, or fearelesse in danger, as seeing his owne safetie? Surely the way is to get the Lords louing countenance vp vpon vs, and then we shall be safe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 3. 7, 19.</p>

                  <p>THe Prophet borroweth a comparison from liuing creatures, who, being in danger or in chase or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, haue their hiding places to defend themselues in: the Lyon hath his denne, the Foxe his hole, the Conie his burrow, and the Godly man hath his asyle or refuge; <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place of the godly man, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures.</note> but with this difference: First, the beasts haue their dens &amp; caues in the earth, wherin they hide themselues, but the godly hath his hiding or secret place in heauen.

When <hi>Athaliah</hi> had put to death all the seede of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> onely <hi>Ioash</hi> his sonne escaped, and was hid in the house of the Lord sixe yeres; GOD had a chamber of prouidence to keepe him safe, when there wanted no meanes, nor diligence in <hi>Athaliah</hi> to finde him.

                  <p>Secondly, God hides his children by his protection, which is the accomplishment of his Word: this protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God is called his wings, which is a borrowed speech from Birds, which by their wings keepe their yong ones both from iniury of weather, and from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous Hawkes and birds of prey; that looke as the Hen gathers her chicken vnder her wings, so the Lord wil co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his owne vnder his wing, that is, vnder his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Psal. 91. 4. <hi>He shall couer thee with his feathers, and vnder his wings shalt thou trust.</hi> And this wing of God is represented by the wings of the Cherubins, extended ouer the Arke: these are the wings of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, vnder which <hi>Dauid</hi> desireth to bee hid, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17 8. It is also called Gods shield and buckler, because, as vnder a shield or buckler the bodie is hid and couered from the blowes and deadly thrusts of the enemie, so
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18743:145"/>
the godly are hereby wholly protected from dangers.</p>
                  <p>This is a great comfort for Gods children, who haue <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> such a hiding place as that God himselfe vouchsafeth to prouide for their safetie, who is stronger then all, and most faithfull; The Lord needs feare no tyrant, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his children to their rage, as <hi>Moses</hi> his parents, who durst not hide him aboue three moneths: And for his faithfulnesse, he neuer failed them that runne vnder his wing. <hi>Dauid</hi> calls him the saluation of all them that trust in him, from such as resist his right hand. A man without God, is a bird without a nest, and a beast hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a denne, lyable to any danger that comes: but great is the comfort of the godly, who know whither to go to be hid, both from the strife of tongues, <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 21. and from the violence of tyrants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we learne hence how to behaue our selues <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> in troubles; namely, to hide our selues in heauen, as the poore beasts doe hide themselues in earth.</p>
                  <p>May wee not hide our selues in earth, by vsing the <note place="margin">Quest.</note> meanes of safetie? Did not <hi>Dauid</hi> hide himselfe in Woods, in Caues, Holes and Rockes? 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 1, 5. and 23. 5, 6. 14.</p>
                  <p>Yes, neither must we neglect any good meanes of our <note place="margin">Answ.</note> owne safety, yet we must trust in none of them, but in Gods blessing, who must watch vs, and hide vs, or else all comes to nothing. Well knew <hi>Dauid</hi> how little helpe there was in any thing to hide him, vnles he had with the same, Gods wing to couer him. The strong Citie of Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 11, 12.</note> could not hide or defend him, and therefore the Lord warned him to come out of it, &amp; himself became a shield &amp; brazen wall vnto him. The vaste &amp; solitarie wildernes of Maon could not hide &amp; secure him, there <hi>Saul</hi> and his Souldiers had compassed him, onely the Lord hid him, and turned his pursuers another way. For this purpose the Lord often brings his children into the streits, that they may runne vnder his wing: for those, who at no
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18743:145"/>
time else will seeke him, will then seeke to him as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> himselfe. He knowes it is with the godly, as with a <note place="margin">Note.</note> beast in the field, which is safer in a storme, then in the fayrest seasons; the storme driues him to his den, and the hunter to the clefts of the Rocke, but, that being blowne ouer, he comes forth and is in danger of taking: So the godly in trouble drawes into his secret place, and so long as danger continues, so long he cleaues to God; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger he lyes open to Satan, his owne corrupt lusts, and other snares, as we may see in <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, who in the wildernes and his flight before <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Absalom,</hi> lay not so open to temptation as in his Palace. God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten imprisons and streytens his, that they may bee more warie in their enlargement.</p>
                  <p>But how may we make God our hiding place? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, by <hi>faith,</hi> leaning vpon the promises: For what <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> good can all the promises of God do, being not mingled <note place="margin">How to make God our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place.</note> &amp; tempred with faith? <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 49. <hi>Remember thy promise made vnto thy seruant, wherein thou hast caused me to trust.</hi> Habac. 2. 4. The vision shall come, in the meane time the iust shall liue by faith, which in times of danger fenceth, and compasseth them with all the promises of God; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vnbeliefe layes a man open to iudgements, debarred <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and strucke <hi>Zacharie</hi> dumbe: the greatest dishonour to God, is, not to relye on his Word: and the Prince that beleeued not in the Word of the Lord, was troden to death, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 7. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, couer thy selfe vnder the wing of God by <note place="margin">2.</note> the practice of <hi>repentance:</hi> for the way to escape iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to iudge our selues. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. When Ierusalem was to be destroyed, they that mourne and sigh for all the abominations thereof, must bee first marked for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance. And, can an enemie of God, an impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue the face, or any hope to goe to God for safetie and hiding?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hide thy selfe with GOD by <hi>prayer,</hi> and in <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:18743:146"/>
extraordinarie danger by fasting, which exerciseth both faith and repentance: thus our Prophet often prayes the Lord to keepe him as the apple of his eye, and to saue him vnder his wing. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> thus hid himselfe, <hi>There is no strength in vs</hi> (saith he) <hi>to stand before this great multitude, neither doe we know what to doe, but our eyes are toward thee;</hi> and being in this hold, hee had strength enough from enemies, who slew one another, and had no vse of his owne. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> likewise against <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had recourse to this hiding place, hee put on sack-cloth, went into the house of the Lord, and spred open the letter before him; and the Angell of the Lord in one night slew an hundred, fourescore, and fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. The Niniuites seeing the storme approching in the threat, <hi>Yet fortie daies, and Niniue shall be destroied,</hi> did flie to this shelter: for high and low, man and beast did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues in sackcloth and fasting, <hi>and they cried mightily to the Lord, and he was intreated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how shall I know, that God will bee my hiding <note place="margin">Quest.</note> place?</p>
                  <p>By these notes: <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, that in the Text, if thou hast got assurance of the <note place="margin">1. How to know that God is our hiding place.</note> pardon of sinne. <hi>Dauid,</hi> by long trauell hauing got this assurance, breaks out into these words, <hi>Thou art my secret place.</hi> This assurance must be gotten by confessing and forsaking sinne, and such a man is a blessed man: <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>Adam,</hi> so long as he would hide his sinne, could get no thicket thicke enough to hide him; the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue iudgements, is to remooue our sinnes. Hearest thou of a iudgement, or seest thou an approching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? meete the Lord with sorrow of heart, and with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of soule, and his wrath shall be appeased, and his furie turned away. <hi>Dauids</hi> wrath, when he was strongly resolued to kill and slay, was by <hi>Abigails</hi> humble and dutifull submission appeased. <hi>Esaus</hi> fury, being resolued to slay his brother, was turned away by <hi>Iaacobs</hi> seuen
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18743:146"/>
times humbling himselfe before him; much more will the Father of mercies, in whom is no passion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if thou trust in the Word of God: for man liueth by euery word of God, and then thou canst not <note place="margin">2.</note> seeke to any other shelter, thou canst vse no vnlawfull shifts, and wicked meanes to accomplish thy desires. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man saith, He trusts in God: but that is onely a vaine blast: for, whereas the first thing our Prophet doth, is to goe to God, many men looke to be hid euery where else first of all: and at last, when all meanes forsake and faile them, they would come to God. First, they flye to the wedge of gold, and say; <hi>Thou art my hope.</hi> Secondly, or else lye hid in humane strength, and the arme of flesh, as the Prophet saith, Some put their trust in Charets, and some in Horses. <hi>Dauid</hi> had gold, men, strength, and Townes of warre, but yet the Lord was his hiding place; hee knew how vaine it was to hide himselfe vnder the wings of wealth, that with those wings would flye away, and leaue him in the suds. Thirdly, some runne to Idols, Images, Saints, the Crosse or Holy-water, all which driue them from their hiding place. Fourthly, others in strange visitations and dangers run to hell, and to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to hide themselues: this is a common sinne, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult more with one Witch, then all the Ministers in a Countrie. And now, when none of these can doe a man good, hee must come to God, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when none of his Princes or Sorcerers could helpe him, then came to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> but he that did thus deceitfully hide him, the Lord hid and couered him and his Armie vnder water.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou must be a member of the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>Dauid</hi> desired one thing, euen to dwell in the <note place="margin">3.</note> House of God, and then he is sure God will hide him in the secret place of his pauillion. Assemble thy selfe with the Saints, frequent the publike places of Gods worship; euery Master will protect a good seruant in his seruice,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18743:147"/>
and especially while he is vnder his eye, and much more will the Lord: but when a man will get him out of Gods sight, then is he numbred to the sword, to the beasts, and to destruction: <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thou must cleaue vnto God in the loue and <note place="margin">4.</note> obedience of his truth. The promise is, <hi>he will keepe thee in thy waies.</hi> Israel being out of his way, and hauing made a Calfe, was naked; but before that, the Lord as a couer hid them. How can they make account of safety in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who to hide themselues from persecution of the Gospell, leaue it vpon the plaine field? Oh, say they, I loue the Gospell, and desire to giue obedience to it: but I was afraid of my name, of my libertie, of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>What? were dangers toward? and must thou therefore <note place="margin">Folly of many in danger, who run from their hiding places.</note> depart from thy secret place? one would thinke thou shouldest rather haue run vnto it. Must thou needs run out of doores, because a storme or tempest is comming? the filly vnreasonable creatures can teach thee more wit then so: why, thou runnest from vnder his wing, who would haue kept thee safe. Wilt thou saue thy life, by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Christ, who is the way and the life? wilt thou auoide the sword of man by an euill conscience, which is a sharper sword within thy bowels, striking through, and pearsing thine owne soule? Wilt thou auoide the flames of natural fire, by kindling the fire of Gods wrath against thee, yea, the flames of hell within thee?</p>
                  <p>How doe the deceitfull bewitchings of this world at this day, winde into men professing the Gospell? who to sit in the warme Sunne, dare not to bee seene with Christ by day, but like Owles and Bats and hateful birds, cast themselues into the night, and wilhold such a course of Religion, as that they seeme none of the forwardest; would faine speake for good men, so as none might heare them; would willingly supply their wants, and helpe their wrongs, were it not for feare of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18743:147"/>
hearing that voice, which would strike them to the heart, <hi>Surely thou art one of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thou must be a sincere-hearted Christian, and carrie thy selfe vprightly: He that walketh vprightly, <note place="margin">5.</note> walketh safely: vprightnesse is a brest-plate, which hides the chiefe parts from danger. <hi>Noah</hi> was an vpright man in his generations, and the Lord shut him in the Arke. <hi>Lot</hi> was a iust man, vexed with the vncleane conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked, and the Lord pulled him out of Sodom, and hid him in Zoar, the Angell could doe nothing till he was gone. Vprightnesse hides a mans selfe and others for his sake, he may glory in the power and truth of God in extremest perils.</p>

                  <p>DAVIDS confidence confines not it selfe within the time present, but is such, as that he can leane vpon God for afterwards.</p>
                  <p>How came <hi>Dauid</hi> to be so confident for future time? <note place="margin">Quest. Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had experience of Gods mercy in the pardon of sin, and drawing him out of former deepes (as the Psalme sheweth) and therefore hee resolueth thus for time to come: whence note, that</p>
                  <p>Experience is a notable Mistres, and the surest teacher <note place="margin">Doct.</note> of affiance for time to come: experience of God will <note place="margin">Experience the best tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</note> carry the heart through such trials, as flesh can neuer buckle withall. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 36. When <hi>Dauid</hi> was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> told him he was but a boy, he reasoned &amp; builded his victorie vpon the former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of God, saying, <hi>Thy seruant in his keeping of sheepe, slew a Lyon and a Beare, and so shall it be with this Philistim: Psal.</hi> 23. 10. <hi>Doubtlesse I shall dwell a long time in the house of God.</hi> How comes <hi>Dauid</hi> to this conclusion? In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verses he had said, The Lord had bin his Shepheard, had fed him, spred his cloth, filled his cup, comforted
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18743:148"/>
him, and so laies one experience to another, till he come to this godly perswasion.</p>
                  <p>The same doth the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>He hath deliuered me out of the mouth of the Lion, and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from euery euill way: Rom.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Experience brings hope, and hope makes not ashamed.</hi> For as a poore man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing often borrowed money of a rich man, and hauing found him free and cheerefull formerly, hath good hope and much boldnesse, that he will still affoord the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the like case: euen so the poore Christian, hauing found much supply many times, of wisedome, strength, deliuerance, perswades himselfe of the same for time to come.</p>
                  <p>First, God is honoured when his Word is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> true <hi>in it selfe;</hi> but this the deuils themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: but by experience wee finde it true <hi>to vs,</hi> and can set our seale to God and his Word, which is not onely a great honour to God, but also to our selues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith in a bare word without experience, <note place="margin">2.</note> doth much strengthen and comfort the heart possessing it, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> did receiue the first promise of a son by <hi>Sarah,</hi> hee relyed vpon it, and doubted not of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment: but when in temptation and particular troubles, wee haue particular proofes of Gods truth in accomplishments, it will bee a strong anchor to hold vs fast, that we be not carried away with violent winds and waues of temptation: as <hi>Abraham,</hi> after experience of Gods power, in quickning <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead wombe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his promise 30. yeeres after he had vttered it, when no man almost could haue expected it, seeing the whole course of nature was set against him, he could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily and readily ouercome himselfe in that difficult tryall of offering his sonne at Gods commandement; and the reason was, because former experiences perswaded him, that hee should rather receiue him from the dead, then Gods word should not be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:18743:148"/>
Thirdly, no maruell if experience be such a teacher of affiance in God, seeing it findes more sweetnesse by much <note place="margin">3.</note> in the performance of promises, then can be conceiued in holding the promises themselues, as a man that hath pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of an inheritance, which hee held long onely in reuersion, by experience of those supplies and comforts he now hath, tasteth much more sweetnesse, then hee could possibly conceiue while it was his only by entaile and expectation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the worke of experience euen in ciuil things, is of great vse, and no lesse in diuine: First, to make vs <note place="margin">4.</note> bold with God, as men are with an experienced friend. Secondly, to quell those distrustfull feares, which distract vs: a fresh-water souldier is afraid of euery cracke of a Gun, and thinks sure it will cost him his life: but a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier experienced, is fearelesse and more valorous. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to quiet the heart in Gods absence and desertion, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his approch againe. Suppose a man put into the world, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, if he should see the Sunne set, hee would thinke it quite lost, but experience teacheth, that it will rise the day following; and therefore we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when it is set, and waite the rising of it: so is it here betweene God and a Christian soule.</p>
                  <p>What makes vs content our selues in winter, when we see all things dead and withered? if such an vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time should continue euer, it would breake the hearts of men: but wee know that Summer will returne, and then all things will spring againe, and this cheeres vs vp: so in the winter of temptation, we may thinke wee shall neuer see God againe, but for all that, his grace and spirit shall come and shine againe to vs, it shall neuer absent it selfe for euer.</p>
                  <p>Alas! I haue had many experiences of God, and yet I <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> feele many grudgings of despaire, I cannot waite, I am too short-spirited, I cannot come to this affiance by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:18743:149"/>
Neuer had any man experience of Gods former loue, but he also sometimes had assured hope and confidence <note place="margin">Answ.</note> in God, but</p>
                  <p>First, neuer had any man faith at all times alike, which sheweth, that it is no naturall facultie, which is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vniforme, but supernaturall, giuen in such degrees as it pleaseth God, and so as place may be left for correction and tryall of his children.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, sense of weakenesse in a sound Christian is a meanes of strength, prouoking a man both to humble himselfe before God in prayer, as also to depend vpon Gods strength.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods fauour in this life is annexed with trouble, as the Sunne is ouer-cast with clouds, and the Moone with specks, yet, as the Sunne shall at length di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse those clouds, and shew his light and strength, so shall the light of Gods countenance shine vpon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in such brightnesse, at length, as they shall out-grow all these cloudes and ouer-casts, which hindred their comfort.</p>
                  <p>The way then to attayne affiance and sure confidence <note place="margin">Vse.</note> in God, being to get experience of his goodnesse vnto vs, wee must take paines in this dutie, so fruitfull and comfortable.</p>
                  <p>But how shall I come to haue experience of God? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Know, that to experience there goe three things; first, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                     <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Obseruation.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Memorie.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Three things concurring to make vp experience: 1. <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Knowledge;</hi> you must know God as hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed himselfe in his Word and Workes; this is the ground of experience, and, the more a man knowes God, the more hee will trust in him, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy name, will trust in thee.</hi> The better knowledge, the better affiance. <note place="margin">Speciall grounds to be knowne for Christian experience.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the speciall grounds of this experience, to bee knowne, are these: first, that God is the same, without change or shaddow of change; what he euer was, he is
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18743:149"/>
still; true, iust, mercifull. Secondly, that his couenant is the same, being an euerlasting couenant, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that couenant are for euer the same and truth it selfe: Heauen and earth may passe away, but one iot of the Word cannot. Thirdly, that his children being euer as deare vnto him as euer they were, hee doth alwayes maintayne their cause: for hee were not righteous, if hee did not euer loue and maintayne righteous persons, and dealing. Fourthly, that sinne being euer hatefull vnto him, he destroyeth it at length, and, because he neuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours wicked men, hee confoundeth all their plots and attempts vnder-taken against him, or his.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another meanes of experience of God, is <hi>Obseruation</hi> of the wayes of God: as first, the workes of <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obseruation.</hi>
                     </note> his power, and these wee shall see as farre aboue Satans power, as infinite is aboue finite; and againe, so farre from being hindred by our weakenesse, as it is perfected thereby, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. Secondly, the workes of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who knowes how to deliuer the iust out of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. Thirdly, of his loue and mercy, being as willing as able to helpe his children, whose grace is sufficient not only it selfe, but also for them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. He is most present in their greatest need, a very present helpe in trouble. Fourthly, of the gracious ends and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, he hath euer giuen to the tryalls of his seruants, not only for his owne promise sake, but also for thy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Consider, saith <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> who euer perished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent.</p>
                  <p>This obseruation or consideration, whereby things are pondered in the heart, being neglected or slightly vsed, experience of God must needes be wanting; as there can be no haruest, where the seed sowne rots in the earth, and comes to nothing: therefore, the Apostle exhorts, That we be not leaking vessells, to let things runne out as fast as they come in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another meanes of experience, is the <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. <hi>Memory.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:18743:150"/>
of such workes of God, as wee haue knowne and obserued: the Philosopher saith, that experience is <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex memoria,</hi> a multiplyed memory, because, of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the same thing often done, ariseth experience, and many memories of the same thing, is but one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Now, this remembrance includeth these things: first, a committing to memory such things as wherein God most expresseth himselfe. Secondly, a retayning of them in memorie as in a store-house. Thirdly, a recalling of them to minde vpon occasion offered. Fourthly, an applying to our owne speciall vses and occasions.</p>
                  <p>This is the way therefore, which hee must take, that would become fearelesse in future troubles, and to haue his heart established against all euill tydings.</p>
                  <p>First, to get the knowledge of God in the couenant, to be assured of his fauour and loue in the pardon of sin, which may bee knowne by the fruits of repentance, in confessing and forsaking sinne, and by loue of God in his Word, in his Image, in his Saints and graces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to grow vp in the obseruation of Gods working with himselfe, and his people, to obserue his owne increase of grace, the supply of comfort, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of his prayers, the issues and deliuerances hee hath had out of troubles and dangers. Alas! what a staffe and strength cast they out of their hands, who heedlesly passe by Gods gracious dealing with them? whereby, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is depriued of his glorie, and of the praise due to his mercy for the present, but themselues also for time to come of much comfort and confidence, which is as small as their obseruation is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to lay vp in our memorie the things which may bestead vs, that we may haue them at hand, and for our best vse: And this we shall doe.</p>
                  <p>First, if we haue a care of good things, and a right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation <note place="margin">Helpes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</note> of them. Men remember the things they care for, no man forgets where he hides his money. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18743:150"/>
129. <hi>Thy testimonies are wonderfull, therefore doth my soule keepe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we affect them as things of reckoning, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 16. <hi>I delighted in thy statutes, therefore I did not forget them.</hi> But if men iudge not aright of the things of God, or preferre in their iudgements and affections baser things, this breeds sensuality, which made a whole world of people forget in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, that which so neerely concerned them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we vse continuall helpes, as hearing of the Word, which is a continuall monitor vnto vs; godly conference, which is as a whet-stone of grace; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby wee hold things as our owne, and not by force and compulsion. These be as the Law written, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before the eyes of the Iewes, or as the frindges of their garments, to put them in minde of his statutes.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, vse prayer, by which wee keepe in that, which we would else cast vp againe: this is as vinegar, the smell of which keeps downe that which would rise in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack: And againe, prayer obtaynes the Spirit, whose sole office it is to bring things into our remembrance, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                  <p>By these meanes wee may store vp plentie of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and by euery experience we ought to draw neerer vnto God, and grow more familiar with him, more bold and confident.</p>
                  <p>We want no motiues hereunto: For first, experience <note place="margin">Motiues to get experience of God.</note> of Gods fauour is the greatest gaine of a Christian, and ought to be most desired, <hi>Lord, lift vp the light of thy countenance, Psal.</hi> 4. 7. as the losse of the sense of Gods good will, is his greatest losse. Nothing troubled the prodigall Sonne so much as the offence of his Father, he would haue beene glad to haue eaten with Pigs, hee weighed his misery with his prosperitie; his sorrowes were great, but all the paines he sustayned, was nothing to the vnreuerent vsing of his Father, who was not only
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18743:151"/>
kinde to his children, but to his hyrelings that lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 7. The Spouse hauing lost the sense of Christ, cryed and trauelled to seeke him, was robbed, beaten, and misvsed by the way, and her life was in great danger by confessing him among his enemies; yet all this is nothing, shee must haue Christ, shee cared not for the losse of her goods and apparell, nor her danger, shee will not giue ouer till shee haue himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, experience of Gods loue will make a man bold in good causes, euen to the death, whereas the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked feare, where no feare is; for they can haue no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in God. Whence it is, that one good man in a good cause, wherein he is assured God standeth by him, is able to withstand and confound a number, who are not able to withstand the terror of their owne conscience, which witnesseth them to be enemies of God, as our Sauiour himselfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 6. strucke not a blow, but only modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered his enemies, and asked them whom they sought: and they all fell prostrate to the ground. So in Gods children: <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> spake most kindly to his brethren, and told them hee was their brother, there was such a terror and feare in their consciences for wronging him, that they were not able to answere him a word. The godly are bold as Lyons, but the wicked as fearefull as Hares; they can laugh and sing in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme suffering of that, which the other are agast, and shrinke to thinke of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee that gets not a sense and experience of Gods fauour here, shall haue experience of his wrath and iustice hereafter.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Immediate preseruation is by himselfe alone, when no hand of man or Angell can reach to helpe, and so he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the Israelites in the Sea. <hi>Mediate</hi> is, when mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Angels, or by men, or other meanes hee preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his people, as <hi>Moses</hi> was by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and those in the ship by plankes and boords, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 44.</p>
                  <p>In respect of the <hi>manner,</hi> preseruation is either secret or manifest. <hi>Manifest,</hi> when he mightily preserues men in the sight of others, for the confirmation of the faithfull and confusion of their enemies, as the three fellowes of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> himselfe in the den of Lyons. <hi>Secret</hi> and spirituall, by which he eternally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth from all trouble those, who manifestly seeme to perish, as the Martyrs, who seemed left in their enemies hand, the body is slaine, but the soule is preserued, and sent to a better life: here is a secret, spirituall, and eternal preseruation: these are in <hi>occulto coronati: Augustine.</hi> According to which grounds, our Prophet is bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his confidence in God, being fully assured, that the Lord, of whom he had so good experience, would in all troubles make some way for him, and either by himselfe or some other meanes, vouchsafe either a secret, or a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>But seeing none are more troubled then the faithfull, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and none indeede lesse preserued from troubles, how can <hi>Dauid,</hi> or any other beleeuer so confidently vtter this?</p>
                  <p>It is true, none are more troubled then Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: <note place="margin">Answ.</note> for first, there is a perpetuall enmitie betweene
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18743:152"/>
the serpent and his seede, against the woman, that is, the <note place="margin">Why none are more troubled then the godly.</note> Church and her seede: and if there be hope, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and the wicked may grow kinde to the godly, there may be more hope of lesse trouble.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word of truth hath said, <hi>In the world yee shall haue tribulation:</hi> and, <hi>The world shall laugh, but you shall weepe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the way to heauen is straite and narrow and troublesome, because of the crosses it is strewed withall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, experience hath concluded, that all that will liue godly in Christ, must suffer persecution; wherein they are conformable to Christ their head, who by the crosse went to the crowne.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the blessing of sound peace and ioy is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and bestowed onely vpon them that mourne.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the meaning of the text, that they should be so preserued from trouble (which <hi>Dauid</hi> was neuer without) as trouble should neuer come neere them, or afflict them, but, as the word in the original sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, <hi>Thou shalt saue me from the straitnesse, or in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses of trouble.</hi> Note, that</p>
                  <p>The godly shall not bee exempted from trouble, but <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> preserued from it, that is, kept in it, and happily led <note place="margin">Godly not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from trouble, but preserued in it.</note> out of it. For <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, notwithstanding his confidence here, said, <hi>Certainely, I shall one day fall by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. And when he asked God, if he had forgot to bee mercifull, did he see any way to escape death and danger? So as his resolution here is this, that though the godly be in neuer so deepe distresse, they perish not, but are preserued in the straite, they are raised out of this depth of miserie: and this stablisheth the heart with confidence, as the words following intimate, <hi>Thou shalt compasse me with songs of deliuerance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine and phrase is expressed and confirmed by other places of Scripture: <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Thou hast set me at libertie, when I was in distresse:</hi> implying, that he was in a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18743:152"/>
straite, and as it were strongly besieged with enemies or dangers, but the Lord inlarged him, and so preserued him: <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 15. <hi>He will bring my feet out of the net:</hi> the godly may be in as great danger, as a silly bird in a net: but the Lord will breake the net, that the bird may escape, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 24. 7. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>who deliuered vs from so great a death, and doth deliuer vs, in whom we trust, that he will hereafter deliuer vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Gods care of his children, though it free them not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> from the exercise of troubles, yet leaueth them not till he haue deliuered them. Can a mother forget her child? she may let it get a knocke, and feare it with the sense of some danger, but leaue it in danger, she cannot. And who be they towards, whom the Lord thinketh thoughts of peace, or, to whom he will remember mercy, but vessels of mercy? <hi>Once haue I heard</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid) yea twice, that mercy belongs to God, Psal.</hi> 72. 11. And therefore it is so true, as it can neuer be false; <hi>once, yea, twice,</hi> that is, once by the Scriptures, and another time by the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods promise is, that hee will not suffer his <note place="margin">2.</note> to be tempted aboue that they are able to beare, and therefore at length they find him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 73. 2. <hi>My feete were almost gone:</hi> but not altogether: the man of God may slip and slide, and much adoe to keepe his feete, but at worst, his feete are but almost gone, and this comes from Gods promise.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods prouidence limiteth the times, in which his Church shall suffer, and no longer; sometimes <note place="margin">3.</note> a longer time, as Israel in Egypt foure hundred yeeres; sometimes shorter, seuentie yeeres in the Babylonish captiuitie; sometimes shorter then so, <hi>Yee shall suffer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation for ten daies, Reuel.</hi> 2. 10. Sometimes three daies, as <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly, and Christ in the graue; sometimes but one night, <hi>Sorrow may indure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning;</hi> and sometimes there is
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18743:153"/>
but an <hi>houre</hi> for the power of darknesse; then Gods time is come, and the godly see the saluation of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he preserues them in their troubles by his <note place="margin">4</note> presence, first, <hi>of power,</hi> and so a fourth like the Sonne of God, was in the furnace with the three children: and it is said, <hi>I will be with thee in sixe troubles, and in seuen, in fire and water.</hi> Secondly, <hi>of grace,</hi> his right hand is vnder their heads, giues them grace sufficient, proportions their strength to the burden, mitigates their sorrow, makes them possesse their soules in patience, yea, reioyce in sorrow, which else would sinke them, and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenseth their light affliction with an eternall weight of glory.</p>
                  <p>But sometimes the godly are not preserued, but made <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> meate for the sword, and appointed as sheepe for the slaughter, they die of the plague, and are slaine in battell as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Consider the Church either in the whole, or in the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> parts: First, the Church for the body of it is euer preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <note place="margin">How the Church is euer preserued in trouble, yea from trouble.</note> as in all ages may appeare, the case being with it, as in a militarie condition, wherein, although some souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bee wounded and slaine, as the Martyrs, and other godly persons, yet the Church carries the victorie out of the field, and is preserued: the Church for the body of it, is euer the conquering part; for <hi>Michael</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels must ouerthrow the Dragon and his angels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the particular members are often slaine, and seeme not preserued, as <hi>Steuen,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> slew, <hi>Peter, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> yet they are, first, preserued by that secret and spirituall preseruation. Secondly, sinne and corruption, which is alway present with vs, makes our preseruation to bee but imperfect. Thirdly, God turnes the corporall destruction of his Saints to the best, so as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>They would not be deliuered, because they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a better resurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:18743:153"/>
This serues to comfort the godly in their troubles, that they shall be preserued in them and from them, the gates of hell shall not preuaile against them. First, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the Red Dragon may create them trouble, so that they shall want no molestation that he can procure them; but hee cannot hinder their deliuerance, nor without leaue hinder their peace, no nor touch an haire of their head. Secondly, the wicked of the world will see they want no tryalls or vexation, but on the contrarie GOD will see they shall not want seasonable deliuerance: for <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 8. <hi>hee will not leaue him in his hand:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though such is their imbred malice, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take off their rods from the backes of godly men, yet God will not suffer the rod of the vngodly alway to <hi>lye on the lot</hi> of the righteous, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 3. Thirdly, their owne sinnes beset them hard, and so dismay them, as though they should neuer get freedome: and this is the strongest band of all, which tyeth them to trouble, and all other troubles were but a play, so that the heart were perswaded of the pardon of sinne (as the Saints in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conscience can confesse:) but sinne shall slay the vngodly; as for the righteous, the promise is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 24. <hi>Though they fall, they are not cast off;</hi> not that their sinne doeth not deserue they should, but because the Lord puts vnder his hand, and reneweth his grace to raise them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this may teach vs not to condemne the state <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> of Gods children when they are in trouble: For, either <hi>in darknesse</hi> they see light, when God stablisheth their hearts with inward peace or patience, or supplyeth strength, or lightneth their burden so as they can cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully carrie it: or at least with <hi>Iob, after darknesse</hi> they see light. If in Winter, when we see the heauens blacke, the clouds bent to stormes and tempests, windes roaring, waters raging, the earth couered with frosts, &amp; cold and snow, and barrennesse or deadnesse, were it not madnesse
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18743:154"/>
to say that there would neuer be any summer againe? that the yong springing corne, couered with such stormy and winterly weather, and lying buried vnder the cloddes, should neuer reuiue againe, and grow vp to the haruest? or that the frost-bitten rootes, and blasted blades should neuer spring forth to flower or seed? No man is so mad, <note place="margin">Summers fruits not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Winters stormes.</note> as to condemne summers fruits, because of the winters stormes and barrennesse. This present life is the winter of Gods children, wherein the seedes of grace lye hid and couered vnder the clods of heauy afflictions, disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a number of tryalls: shall we now condemne and curse the life of Gods people here, and their summer fruits to come in the haruest, because the fruits of grace, and the glory of their resurrection are couered and hid vnder persecution affliction, and tryalls?</p>
                  <p>Wherein we meet not only with the generall miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of vngodly men, but euen of the godly themselues, who sometime with <hi>Dauid</hi> think their owne estate most infortunate, and are ready to slip, to see and compare the wickeds outward prosperitie and happinesse with their owne vnhappinesse and apparent miserie, whereas the Sanctuarie telleth them of the end of both, and so quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this serues to teach the godly their dutie: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, to set before them in their tryalls these three things: First, the commandement of God: Psal. 50. 15. <hi>Call vpon mee in the day of trouble.</hi> Secondly, the promise, <hi>And I will deliuer thee.</hi> Thirdly, the accomplishment of it, or the experience of others, who haue found Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in trouble: as, Psal. 22. 4. <hi>Our Fathers trusted in thee, they trusted and thou didst deliuer them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the deepest of troubles wait for Gods preseruation, and know that though hee come not of a long time, yet at length hee that shall come, will come, and willnot tarrie. In this expectation beware of haste, and of euill meanes, and trust when thou seest no meanes,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18743:154"/>
yea, and against meanes, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, saying, <hi>If the Lord kill me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> The stile of the godly, is, to be brands plucked out of the fire, Zech. 3. 2. <hi>Is not this a brand taken out of the fire?</hi> which shews, that the godly may be cast vpon the coales, yea into the fire an vnmerciful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; may be smeared and scorched, yea, in part burnt and consumed; but at length the Lord in extremitie wi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> snatch them out of the fire and preserue them, as a man will catch speedily at that which he would haue burnt.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>Thou shalt compasse me about with Songs of Deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.]</head>
                  <p>IN these words the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> riseth vp by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and goeth beyond that that hee had formerly said concerning his confidence in God. First, he had said that God was his hiding place. Secondly, that he would preserue him in trouble: and now thirdly, that the Lord would make him ioyfull, and to triumph ouer his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and enemies, by compassing him in stead of troubles with mercies.</p>
                  <p>In the words are two things to bee considered: First, the matter of <hi>Dauids</hi> assurance, namely, <hi>Songs of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance:</hi> Secondly, the measure, <hi>Thou shalt compasse mee about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Songs of Deliuerance.]</hi> This implyes the matter of these songs, and that is Gods helpe &amp; deliuerance, which when the Lord affordeth, then there is matter of singing and setting forth that mercy: for a song beseemes him that reioyceth with great ioy, the which ought alwayes to attend our praises.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>to be compassed with Songs of Deliuerance]</hi> is, not to haue one or two, or a few occasions or deliueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to sing praises to God for, but abundant, yea innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable causes to praise and magnifie God, so as a man can looke no way round about him, but he shall see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18743:155"/>
and infinite mercies, and so many songs and praises, euery new mercie, being a new matter of a new song of Deliuerance. For looke as when a man hath endured an heauy, darke, and vncomfortable night, the morning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, and light begins to appeare, not in any one side of the heauens, but on euery side, that let a man looke where hee will, the light compasseth him, and it groweth lighter and lighter vntil perfect day: So, although Gods children seeme to be in darknesse and in the night of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, yet GOD affords some deliuerance, and brings the ioyfull morning, and then they see the light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on all sides, and can say, Now they are compassed with light and saluation. So as the thing, which our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here professeth, is: First, that the Lord would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him matter enough to frame &amp; compile holy songs of ioyfull praise and thankes. Secondly, that this matter should be so plentiful and abundant, that nothing should on any side be about him, but that whence hee ought to prouoke himselfe to returne ioyfull thankes, he should be begirt with blessings and mercie.</p>
                  <p>Hence in the first place we may learne, that</p>
                  <p>As God <hi>hath appointed times of sorrow and straitnesse for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 10</note> 
                     <hi>his children, so also of reioycing and comfort.</hi> This whole <note place="margin">Times of ioy succeed times of sorrow to godly men.</note> Psalme teacheth it, in the beginning of which how was <hi>Dauid</hi> deiected? What an intolerable burden of sinne complaines he of? how were his bones dryed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? how did his moysture drie vp as in the drought of Summer? how did hee roare night and day vnder the heauie hand of God? and all this misery pressed him a long time together: But now towards the end of the Psalme his confidence supporteth him, his ioy comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, his comfort not onely returnes, but also in such abundance, as hee seeth himselfe <hi>compassed with Songs of Deliuerance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Psal. 126. 5, 6. <hi>They that sow in teares, shall reape in ioy,</hi> (spoken of the Church returning out of captiuitie;) <hi>they</hi>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:18743:155"/>
                     <hi>went weeping and carried precious seede, but they shall returne with ioy, and bring their sheaues.</hi> Psal. 30. 5. <hi>Heauinesse may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.</hi> As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as is the vicissitude and change of darknesse and light, euening and morning, so certaine shall the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the godly be, their darknesse shall bee turned into light. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 1, 4. <hi>To all things there is an appointed time: a time to weepe, and a time to laugh; a time to mourne, and a time to dance.</hi> All times are limited by God to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but first for sorrow, and then for ioy. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 27. As it was with Israel in their iourney through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, so is it with Gods people in this world. After they had gone through many barren and dry places, then they came to Elim, where were twelue fountaines of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and seuentie Palme-trees, the Lord at length brings them to a pleasant station: So the Lord hath appointed after labour, a time of rest; after heauinesse, a time of ioy; hee brings his children from Marah to Elim, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 9. from a place of bitternesse, to springs of water.</p>
                  <p>First, because God is not alwayes angry with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note> neither doth hee delight in punishing, his anger is but for a moment, and for a little while he forsaketh, but the end is with euerlasting mercie to haue compassion on them, <hi>Isai.</hi> 54. 8. True it is that he punisheth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth sinne in his deadliest enemies, and in his dearest children, but all this as a iust and righteous Iudge, and as forced to it, not as a tyrant that punisheth, with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, desire, and delight.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the troubles of Gods children are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">2.</note> already by Christ, who hath carried the heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them, and hath left onely the crosse for them to beare, so as they cannot still lye vpon them. For if euen the troubles, which Gods chosen are exercised withall here, were euerlasting, and there were no time of release appointed by God, they would be out of measure pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18743:156"/>
and weightie: but this makes them easie among other considerations, that, if they bee heauie, they are but short, and (as the Apostle saith) but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the vse of afflictions and sorrowes of the godly is, but for a time to exercise their faith, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore cannot bee perpetuall; for, when the try all is ouer, the burthen must bee remooued. The time of Winter is bitter and barren, and cold, through frosts and stormes; but, besides that it is profitable for the earth and plants, to kill weedes and wormes, and to mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and rot the ground, it is a forerunner of a pleasant Spring, and a fruitfull haruest: Such is the state of the godly often here, Christ the Sunne of righteousnesse sometimes departs further off, and leaues the beleeuer in a wintrous estate, laid open to many stormes and sad showres; but, besides that all this winter prepares the soyle, and kils the weedes and vermine of the soule, it goes before an happy spring &amp; haruest, which will bring in fruits of righteousnesse to those that are exercised. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>I goe away for a while and ye shall be sorrowfull: but I will come againe, and your heart shall reioyce, and your ioy shall none take away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the promise of God must stand firme, who <note place="margin">4.</note> hath promised blessednesse to them that now mourne for sinne: <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 4. for they must bee comforted: therefore there is a time appointed wherein mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall bee comforted. <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. 16. The iust man falleth seuen times a day, that is, into distresse and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but riseth againe. The state of the godly in the sea of this world, is like the Sea Euripus, that ebbes and flowes seuen times a day; it ebbes no oftner then it flowes againe: so the godly haue as many comforts as sorrowes.</p>
                  <p>And most full of trueth and assured comfort is the promise made by Christ to his Disciples, Ioh. 16. 20. <hi>Yee</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:18743:156"/>
                     <hi>shall indeede sorrow, but your sorrow shall bee turned into ioy:</hi> It had been a great comfort, if Christ had onely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that their sorrow should bee mitigated, and more, to haue said it should bee shortly ended: but to say it shall bee turned into ioy, ministreth abundant consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and strength in the patient expecting of so happy a change.</p>
                  <p>Hence is it, that the sorrowes of the godly are often compared to the sorrows of a woman in trauel, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 17. <hi>Like as a woman with child beeing neere her time, is in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sorrowes of the godly like the sorrow of a woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell why?</note> 
                     <hi>sorrow, and cryeth in her paines; so haue wee beene in thy sight, O Lord. Ier.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>Sorrow is come vpon vs, as vpon a woman in trauell.</hi> And the sorrowes of the godly are like these sorrowes.</p>
                  <p>First, in bitternesse and sharpenesse. Secondly, in the vtilitie and profit of them, both tending to a birth. Thirdly, it is not without hope of deliuerance, and in euery hope there is some ioy and comfort in the midst of sorrowes, mixt with them. Fourthly, in the trauell of a woman there is not only an expectation of an end of that sorrow, but also of the fruit of it, which is the ioyfull fruit of the wombe. Fiftly, there is a certaine time set both for the one and the other: All which our Sauiour cleerely confirmeth, Ioh. 16. 21. <hi>A woman, when she brings forth, hath sorrow because her houre is come; but when shee is deliuered, she remembers not the sorrow, for ioy that a man-child is borne:</hi> So you are now in sorrow, but your hearts shal reioyce: so as there is a time set by God not onely to finish the sorrowes of the godly, but also to turne them vnto ioy, as the winter not onely endeth, but is turned to Summer.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, there must bee some difference of the sorrowes <note place="margin">5.</note> of the godly from the wickeds, as there is in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and estates; and this is the difference, that they sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row without mixture of ioy, or hope or expectation of deliuerance by any promise, no time is set for their
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18743:157"/>
deliuerance: nay, all their light must bee darkened, their sunne must set and neuer rise more, and they left in an euerlasting night: but the godly sorrow quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise.</p>
                  <p>Isa. 27. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Hath hee smitten him as hee smote those that smote him? Or is he slaine according to the slaughter of them that were slaine by him, &amp;c?</hi> Here the Prophet shewes great differences betweene Gods afflicting hand <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Gods smiting of his children, and his enemies.</note> vpon his people, and vpon his enemies and theirs: and the difference is,</p>
                  <p>First, in the measure: on the one but drops, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a sea of wrath: One drinke a cup, the other draw a viall of his displeasure: <hi>hath hee smitten him as hee smote those that smote him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Gods intention: his intendement in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the godly, is to lop off their superfluous boughs: <hi>In the branches thereof wilt thou contend with it?</hi> He saith not, with the root of it: But hee quite stockes vp the roote of the vngodly. In the one he intends purgation, by taking off fruitlesse boughes and <hi>branches, Ioh.</hi> 15. 2. in the other he intends punishment, &amp; <hi>to ouerthrow them with his rough winde in the day of his East winde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the issue and fruit of them. <hi>By this shall all the iniquitie of</hi> IAACOB <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit, the taking away of his sinne.</hi> In the one the sinne onely, in the other the person is destroyed. The Lord therefore doth not so punish the members of his Church, either as the enemies of the Church would punish it, or as himself punisheth them: As for example. The Deuils, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enemies of the Church, are punished without hope of all mercie, no time of deliuerance is set for them; but the Church is assured of a good and ioyfull end. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were terrible enemies to the Church; did God euer smite his Church as he smote them? though it was long vnder their oppression, yet it had a promise of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, a time set for it, and a ioyfull departure, when
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18743:157"/>
all Egypt was lasht with that terrible whip of ten cords, and drowned and destroyed in the Sea by Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand.</p>
                  <p>Here is then first of all a notable ground of patience in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> I.</note> sorrowes, God hath set the time how long they shall last, and shall not exceede the appointed time: yea, hee hath not onely set a time of duration, but also of exchanging thy sorrowes into ioy. Art thou in any trouble, or vnder any molestation of Satan or wicked men, vnder reproch, scandall, hatred, persecution, &amp;c? <hi>nubecula est, transibit;</hi> it is a storme too violent to last long; nay, it shall bee changed into a calme, into a faire and comfortable sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Suppose thou be in the night of disgrace, blacked and darkned by wicked ones, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was; suppose thou haue things laid to thy charge, that thou neuer knewest, and art forced to repay that which thou neuer tookest: yet waite still the good time; after thou hast endured a little scouring, all the soile will tend to thy brightnesse, and the time comes, that God will make thy innocencie to breake out as the light.</p>
                  <p>Art thou sicke in thy soule, or pained in thy body, and seest no way but present death? waite the time, and thou shalt meete not onely with perfect cure, but perfect health also: onely see thou makest Christ thy Physician. God had appointed a time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> tryall for three daies: but the third day turned his sorrow into ioy, in which he had the comfort, both of his sonne, and his owne obedience. <hi>Ionas</hi> had his appointed time of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the belly of hell, in the bottom of the Sea, when he was cast out of sight: but at the ende of three dayes he was cast on the drie ground, and his sorrowes and feares were turned into ioy and praises. The thiefe on the Crosse was euen in the hands of death, his paines and sorrowes increasing, as hee felt his life decreasing: how did our blessed Sauiour comfort him, and support him with patience, but with this assurance, that the ende was
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18743:158"/>
comming, and a time appointed, which should instantly turne that shame and sorrow into glory and ioy? <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. Lazarus</hi> was not onely in the hands, but in the house of death foure daies, yet a time was appointed, euen the fourth day, wherein the bands of death were to be loosed, and he restored to his former life. And thus shall it be with all the Disciples of Christ, whose troubles shall not last alwaies: the longest they can last, is but for this life, and while they doe last, they haue the comfort of both those petitions of Christ: first, that the Father would keepe them in the world, and secondly, that after they bee safely passed through the world, and the troubles and disgrace of it, they may bee where himselfe is, to behold his glory, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 15, 24.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in all troubles, learne to iudge and measure <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> thy selfe by this doctrine, not according to thy present feeling and comfort, which faith doth not alway mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: for that may be where there is no feeling. Looke out at the ende, and at that time which shall change thy state, and giue thee the fruite of this sorrowfull seede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Should an Husbandman measure himselfe by his seede-time, what is there but labour and losse? but, when he considereth, that without a seede-time, he shall neuer see haruest, and the more liberally he sowes, the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly he shall reapc, he is well contented to so we in all weathers: So if the godly could consider, that their sorrow shall not onely end in ioy, but that their ioy must rise out of sorrow, they would cheerefully sowe euen in teares, for the hope of a ioyfull haruest. How do men out of their sorrowes disquiet and vexe themselues, and thinke themselues cast off, whereas out of the quantitie and qualitie, the measure and manner of their sorrow, springeth their truest ioy?</p>
                  <p>Againe, in the maner of <hi>Dauids</hi> speech, saying, that the Lord would compasse him, not with mercies, but songs:</p>
                  <p>Note what the godly man must doe in the times and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:18743:158"/>
occasions of ioy, and in receiuing deliuerances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts <note place="margin">Songs of praise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of ioy.</note> from God, namely <hi>breake out into songs or speeches of thankefull praises.</hi> Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth elsewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered from danger, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 3. <hi>He hath put into my mouth a new song of praise:</hi> he neuer receiued a new mercie into his hand, but withall a new Song into his mouth: <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 20. <hi>Praised be the Lord, which hath not put backe my prayer nor hid his mercy from me: I called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with my mouth, and he was exalted with my tongue.</hi> It was the practice of the Church, after her deliuerance from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to compile a Song of praise: <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. and of <hi>Deborah, Iudg.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and of <hi>Ionah, chap.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>I will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto thee with the voice of thankes-giuing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, this is the returne that God lookes for of all his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> benefits, and is all that we can giue him for all, and, as it is as much as we can do, so it is as little as we can do: yea, it is the condition, vpon which he promiseth mercies, <hi>Ps.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call vpon mee in the day of trouble, and I will heare thee, and thou shalt praise me.</hi> Which the godly know so well, as in crauing mercies, they expresse this condition, and binde themselues the surer vnto it, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 14. <hi>Deliuer me from bloud, O Lord, and my tongue shall sing ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to thy righteousnesse.</hi> Hence sprung all those holy vowes of the Saints, as of <hi>Iaakob, Gen.</hi> 28. 20, 21. and that of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which hee would performe in the midst of the people: <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 14. This is the ende why God deliuers vs, the ende of his mercies, and therefore is better then the deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a good thing to praise the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 1. and it well becomes the iust to bee thankefull, <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 1. for first, hereby the Lord shall haue his due, which is a part of iustice. He is content that we haue the good of his creatures, but he reserues the praise of them to himselfe still. He is content we should haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, onely with this reseruation, that the glory of them be his still. Secondly, it is good for vs: for al the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18743:159"/>
benefit of our thankes comes to our selues, seeing by it we both retaine the old, and inuite new mercies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is impossible for such, as haue truely tasted Gods mercies, but to speake of it; sense of mercy in the <note place="margin">3.</note> heart will vntie the tongue, fire wil not be kept close, but will breake forth. And heere is a plaine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the godly and the wicked. They reioyce in the Lord for his mercy, whereas the most that these can do, is to reioyce in the mercy, not in the Lord, as a false friend that delights more in the gift of his friend, then in the giuer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godly know, that God doth require, not onely the heart to acknowledge him, but the tongue as <note place="margin">4.</note> well as that, whereby we doe not onely praise God our selues, but also excite and stirre vp others to the same. And then a mans tongue is his glory, when it can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily glorifie God, and this sometimes by bare voice and speech, and sometimes by singing out his praises, as in this place. Nay, the whole man which is so continuall a receiuer, is little enough to manifest the praise of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and because the mercies of God follow all the life of man, the whole life and conuersation ought to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the glorifying of God, and to expresse our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, vnthankfulnesse for mercies receiued, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemes a reasonable man, much more a Christian man. <note place="margin">5.</note> The vnreasonable creatures acknowledge their Masters, Feeders and Benefactors, as the Oxe and the Asse: nay, the senselesse earth yeelds all her burden to the tillers of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7. and the trees and plants all their fruit to the Gardner that trims them. Yea, this sinne of vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse leades a man to idolatrie, makes him sacrifice to his owne net, and ascribe things to his owne power, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and industry, thrusting God out of sight, and out of minde. It prouoketh God to take away euen his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall fauours, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 9, 10. When Israel said, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18743:159"/>
of his Corne, Wooll, and Oyle, <hi>These are my rewards that my Louers haue giuen me:</hi> the Lord answered in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, <hi>I will take away my Corne and Wooll, &amp;c.</hi> And at length the wicked seruant that doeth not trafficke with his Lords talent, for his Masters aduantage, hath not only his talent taken away, but himselfe cast into vtter darkenesse.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore take heede we depriue not the Lord <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> of this part of his honor, but prouoke our selues to thankefulnesse for so great mercies: Let no mercy slip vs without thankefull acknowledgement. And to this purpose vse these meanes:</p>
                  <p>First, learne to acknowledge Gods goodnesse to thy selfe with particular application, as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith here, <note place="margin">1. Meanes and helps to thankfulnesse.</note> Thou shalt compasse <hi>me</hi> with songs of deliuerance. Not only confesse his goodnesse to others, as to <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iaakob,</hi> nor only his deliuerances of <hi>Noah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Lot,</hi> but also his mercies to and deliuerances of thy selfe, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, Christ gaue himselfe for <hi>me,</hi> and dyed for <hi>me.</hi> This will exceedingly whet vp thankefulnesse, whereas only to acknowledge God good in himselfe or to others, and not to thy selfe, will make thee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, set before thee the number of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <note place="margin">2.</note> and muster them somtimes, &amp; take a view of them, or, because they are numberlesse, and so large as they reach vp to heauen, suruey them in their heads, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and spirituall, positiue and priuatiue, publike, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and personall, either continued or renewed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy seuerall necessities; and so, seeing thy selfe compassed with mercies, thy songs and praises may be in the same measure, as <hi>Dauid</hi> takes it vp for his practice. As he is compassed with mercies, so with songs of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance: and thou likewise, as the mercies thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest are innumerable, oughtest to renew thy songs and praises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:18743:160"/>
Thirdly, highly prize them according to their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 12. 13. <hi>Dauid</hi> valuing and weighing Gods mercies towards him, enters first into a delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what he might render to the Lord, and finding that the Lord was beyond all that he could recompence, in the second place he setteth vpon this determination, that when he could finde nothing else, he would take the cup of saluation, and call vpon the Name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And we shall much the better prize them, if, first, we <note place="margin">How to prize Gods mercies.</note> consider our miserie without these mercies, euen the least we enioy. Common mercies are commonly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or vnprized, because they be so ordinarie: the Sunne, the Aire, Meat and Drinke, are common and continuall mercies; how miserable were our life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of them?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our vnworthinesse of the least, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9. I am lesse then the least of thy mercies, saith <hi>Iaakob.</hi> Nay, seeing we haue forfeited all and deserued all the curses of the Law, it is Gods mercy that wee are not consumed, and a further and more liberall mercy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new mercy: but</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, especially if we can receiue them as loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens and pledges of further grace, sealing vp vnto vs the Couenant, and that spirituall Marriage betweene Christ and vs. A small token from a deare friend, but especially of a Louer to his Spouse, is therefore most welcome, because it assureth of the marriage and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellowship.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if we consider the greatnesse, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, the iustice, the wisedome, the power, and the mercy of all Gods workes, especially of his mercies: that a piece of bread should feed, not choke vs, is from this greatnesse of power, wisedome, and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, another meanes to become thankefull, is, to remember his mercies, and not let them slip from vs,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18743:160"/>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 2. My soule, praise the Lord, and forget not all his benefits: and our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. saith, Thou art made whole, goe sinne no more: as if he had said, Keepe this blessing in memorie, and let it euer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke thee to thankefulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to recall into our memorie Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <note place="margin">Meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Gods mercies into memorie.</note> is, first, by occasion of euery renewed mercy, to looke backe to the former, and account it as an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other. Tradesmen make a day-booke for dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receits, and by occasion of one, often looke backe vpon others: it were neither vnnecessary nor vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to haue such a day-booke to write vp our receits from God; assuredly it would much helpe our slipperie memories, which we are loth to trust in ciuill matters, and helpe the Lord sometime to his due. Therefore write and register the noble acts of the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we set speciall markes vpon them, and raise some monument or other of them in the heart. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes in the old Testament did the godly help their memorie, and keepe in minde the speciall fauours recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God: sometimes by compiling holy Psalmes, which are preserued in the Church, for the preseruing of Gods mercies in memorie, as <hi>Dauid</hi> wrote many, and the faithfull sang praises for their deliuerance out of the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. 2. sometimes by setting vp stones, as in Gilgal where the waters of Iordan were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the passage of the Israelites: sometimes by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Altars, as the Patriarkes did in those places where God specially appeared vnto them, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed them a gracious presence: sometimes by imposing new names or changing the old, as <hi>Abram</hi> into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob</hi> into <hi>Israel:</hi> so <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>Abraham</hi> called the place where he receiued a Ram, to sacrifice in stead of <hi>Isaac,</hi> Iehouah-ijreh, the Lord will see or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide. All these things were done either by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18743:161"/>
or inspiration from God, that the mercies of God might not be forgot, but might be declared from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to Children, and so might be continued in minde with all the Ages of the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this serues to reproue the carelesnesse of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> men in this dutie, few returne with the Leper to praise God: and Christ is faine to aske, Where are the other nine? <hi>Naaman</hi> would giue <hi>Elisha</hi> a reward when hee was cured, but the reward which men returne to the Lord, shewes they be not yet cured from their sinnefull leprosie. How doe men swallow the mercies of God, as the Swine doe mast, not looking vp to the tree, scarce blessing their meat? How doe we vnder-prize them, and the commonnesse of mercies lets vs not see the worth of them? as the precious Word of life, to say of it as they did, Oh this Mannah, we see nothing but this Mannah: and so concerning our dayes of peace, Oh it was better (say some) when we had Warres: the more Fooles we, that know not how to vse our peace, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie so great vnthankefulnesse for so great a mercy. The Saints of the primitiue Church knew better how to vse their peace, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. that Church had rest, and they were edified and walked in the feare of the Lord, and multiplyed in the comfort of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>How lamentably doe men abuse their wits, their strength and health to drunkennesse, surfetting, and vncleannesse? their wealth and calling to iniustice, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, couetousnesse? their meat and drinke to riot and excesse, as though the Lord required no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, or would require no other reckoning?</p>
                  <p>How doe men forget the great mercies of God, both common and priuate? We haue forgot the wonderfull deliuerance from those bitter and bloudie times of Queene <hi>Mary:</hi> we haue forgot the happy gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the blessed proceedings of the Gospell therein: we haue forgot the miraculous
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18743:161"/>
ouer-throw of the inuincible Nauie in the yeere 88. we haue forgot the peaceable entrance of His Maiestie, when we had cause to feare the dayes which many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for: wee haue forgot the fift of Nouember, the strangest deliuerance that euer God bestowed on any Nation, from the bloudie, fierie, and hellish plot of the Papists, by gun-powder: we haue forgot our freedome from the plague, which wasted thousands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in our streets. And no maruell, if we forget mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies past, when blessings present are not remembred: We forget that God hath created vs reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he hath giuen vs wisedome in our soules, proportion and strength in our bodies: We forget that wonderfull redemption wrought by Christ, which no creature was able to deuise, and the Angels <hi>desire to pry into;</hi> a redemption farre more glorious and victorious then that ouer <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> out of Egypt: We forget our day of visitation, our time and talents that our Master hath giuen vs to trafficke withall.</p>
                  <p>Oh, but we cannot forget these things. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, we can and doe, as the Israelites were no sooner <note place="margin">Answ.</note> gotten out of the Wildernesse but <hi>incontinently they for gate Gods wonderous workes, Psal.</hi> 106. 13. what workes were those? First, their preseruation in Egypt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing against <hi>Pharaohs</hi> power or policy. Secondly, their deliuerance at the Red Sea. Thirdly, the mightie miracles, by which he preserued them, in their Clothes, Shooes, and Mannah.</p>
                  <p>Why? how could they forget these, at least so soone? <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> they could discourse of them long after.</p>
                  <p>We are said to forget Gods workes: first, when we <note place="margin">Answ.</note> set not our mindes on them, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 11. Thou hast not remembred me, nor <hi>set thy minde</hi> thereon: and <hi>Deuter</hi> 32. 2. <hi>Remember the dayes of thy youth and consider:</hi> they knew and sometimes did remember, that such things had beene done, but they did not set their mindes on
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18743:162"/>
them, nor consider, for what purpose God had done all this. Secondly, wee are said to forget Gods workes, when, though we hold them in our vnderstanding and memorie, yet our practice shewes we remember them not, when our liues and courses are not answerable to his mercies, as, when Israel left the true worship of God and sought to Idols, it is said that they forgate God. Doe wee walke as redeemed from vaine conuersation? Doe we improue our day of visitation according to the light and meanes that we haue? Doe we trafficke with our talent to our Masters aduantage and not our owne? These things while we may be conuinced of, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so conuinced of forgetting God, not only in things past, but in present also.</p>
                  <p>Oh let vs take heede, and breake off this sinne by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <note place="margin">Motiues to thankfulnesse.</note> and expresse more dutifull thankefulnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and consider: first, how the Lord prizeth thankes and praise aboue all sacrifice, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 13. <hi>Will I eate the flesh of Bulls, or drinke the bloud of Goates? offer vnto God praise and pay thy vowes:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 30. 31 <hi>I will praise the name of the Lord with a song, and will magnifie him with thankesgiuing: This shall please the Lord better then an Oxe or a Bullocke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, consider what an intolerable hypocrisie it is, to be more earnest Suters for mercies, than thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Acknowledgers of mercies receiued.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider vvee how God preuents vs vvith mercy, and is first in goodnesse, and free in bountie, vvhich vvould make vs thinke vpon some returne, as the Saints haue done before vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, acquaint vve our selues vvith the life of Heauen, and hereby begin life eternall, vvhich vvhen the Saints vvere depriued of, how did they lament their estates? <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, must vve praise God for euill, and for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for taking away? and not for good, and for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? <hi>Iob</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:18743:162"/>
Now further, this dutie of thankesgiuing being so great a seruice, as that it is sometimes put for all the worship of God, it shall not be amisse to enter into our selues in particular, by a more narrow view of our selues, to take better notice of our estate, both by iudging our selues in the things we faile in, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking our selues with more cheerefulnesse to so holy a dutie.</p>
                  <p>Many wayes haue we erred: first, in not doing the dutie at all. <note place="margin">Many faile in not doing this dutie.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in doing it. First, in not doing the dutie many stray many wayes, as</p>
                  <p>First, how few of vs take notice of Gods mercies, <note place="margin">Enemies to thankfulnesse.</note> with which he compasseth vs, when (as we say) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see Wood for Trees, being beset with numberlesse <note place="margin">1. Carelesnes.</note> mercies, and yet see none or as good as not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not to any purpose open our mouthes in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing further then in generall termes, slubbering ouer the dutie, as hauing the heart vpon euery thing else? How few consider, how being dead in sinne they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to the life of God, how of Enemies they be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Friends, how they haue part in the first resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in grace, and assured hope of the second to glorie? How many sinnes are there, which God hath not let them know? How many, of vvhich he hath let vs know the pardon? How hath he kept vs from diseases? How restored vs out of sicknesse? How vvardeth he vs all the day long, feedes vs, and leades vs in our going in and out? How carryeth he vs in his armes, saues vs from danger, and maintaynes our peace of soule and body, our health and reputation? How keepes he vs and ours euery night, and refresheth vs with sleepe? For he giues sleepe to his beloued, draweth our curten, watcheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our houses from fire, from robbers, and from ruine, and euery morning, yea euery moment, reneweth mercy vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:18743:163"/>
These things while wee take no notice of, wee must needs faile in this dutie: for vvere there thankefulnesse, it vvould smother no mercies, but novv <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is vvith vs as vvith children, vvhose eaten bread is quickly forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Numbers of men count basely of, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Gods mercies, and then there can bee no thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing: <note place="margin">2. Slight regard.</note> So much as a man esteemeth a gift, so much he is thankefull for it; neyther is it hauing of things, but hauing them in estimation, which breedes thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Numbers</hi> 11. 6. The Israelites hauing Mannah, thought basely of it, and were so farre from giuing thankes for it, as they murmured and said, Wee see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this Man: and so men speake at this day of the spirituall Mannah, the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>We thinke it an ordinary thing to dispatch our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary businesse, as a iourney or the like, and esteeme not of Gods successe and blessing vpon it, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 27. saying, <hi>Blessed bee the Lord God of my Master;</hi> I being in the way, <hi>the Lord led mee to the house of my Masters Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee thinke it a slight thing to bee carryed day by day through our way, and not to bee surprized by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan or temptation; but <hi>Dauid</hi> otherwise esteemed of it, as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32. <hi>Blessed bee the Lord, and blessed bee thy counsell, and blessed bee thou that hast kept mee from doing this thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee count it no great matter to bee drawne out of weaknesse or sicknesse of bodie: Oh it is but an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing; whereas, if wee did esteeme rightly of it, with the Leper wee would glorifie God with a lowd voyce. Wee thinke it a common thing, and neuer prize the benefit to bee fed and clothed euery day, to be able to enioy these creatures to our life, health, and strength: whereas, if a man bid vs to supper or meate once in a yeere, or quarter, wee will then thanke him, and after meeting him againe, thanke him for our kind welcome,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18743:163"/>
or checke our selues if we forget it, and will bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make no neighbourly requitall: but God gets not so much thankes for his continuall spreading of our Table, and furnishing it, and filling of our Cups daily, as a man doth for one meales meate, as though GOD were more bound to vs then a man, or wee lesse bound to him then a man to his Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>And when men haue thus vnderualued Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings while they haue them from him, how iustly doth hee depriue them of them, till they know the price and worth of them, and in their restraint make them enioy a small thing more thankefully and comfortably, then when their plentie hindred them from being daintie? Hunger were good sawce, and would giue rellish and taste to courser things then men now contemne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, others are discontented with their estate, <note place="margin">3. Discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and then can neuer be thankefull; Oh, God giueth them not what, and when, or how much they would haue, or, others haue more then they, or, they deserue more then they haue or, their troubles are aboue the fauours they haue; and thus they enioy nothing eyther thankefully, or comfortably. But alasse! First, how little doe wee see what vnprofitable seruants wee are, when wee haue done all wee can? <hi>Luc.</hi> 17. 10. and how we deserue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but stripes, like Whelps vnder the Table of our Lord, not deseruing the crummes? Secondly, how doe wee harpe vpon our wants more then our receits, so to depriue God of his glorie, and our selues of comfort? as <hi>Ahab</hi> was vnthankefull for a whole Kingdome, and sicke because hee wanted <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard. Thirdly, how doe wee rather repine at that which others haue, then consider what is our owne need? as if a bitter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine were not as good in season as the sweetest dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Fourthly, how doe we cast our eyes onely on that, which God can giue, and not vpon that hee hath giuen, or we can receiue? Fiftly, how doe wee gnabble vpon
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18743:164"/>
the shell, which is the gift, and neglect the meat, which is the goodnesse of the Giuer, which were it once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the soule, would bee thought sweeter then life, and would make it breake forth into prayses?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, others peruert and blaspheme Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and in stead of thankefulnesse load him with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">4. Abuse of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> and vngracious behauiour. Some haue receiued gifts and talents of learning and knowledge; but in stead of employing them to his prayse, they eyther hide them in a Napkin, and doe no good as the vnprofitable seruant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 25. liuing as drones and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burdens in the Church and Common-wealth, and as corrupt trees, fruitlesse themselues, and keeping the ground barren: or else they doe much hurt with their learning, opposing the truth and goodnesse and good men, defending corruptions, maintaining corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and making bridges to Poperie or prophanesse: or else they corrupt others by making filthy Poems, and such like. Some haue receiued wealth and a large estate of earthly things; some honours, fauour, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; of whom GOD may looke for more because they haue receiued more: But how for mercies returne they rebellion in all their liues, and dissolutenesse in their whole course? How peruert they authoritie to iniustice, wrong, oppression? How doe they by meanes of their wealth swell in pride, and arme themselues to contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to contempt of inferiours, equals, and betters, and to tumble in all voluptuousnesse and lusts, so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themselues against God? Some blaspheme GOD in his goodnesse, in stead of thankes, as the Israelites did, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 27. saying, Because <hi>the Lord hated vs,</hi> hee brought vs out of Egypt, to destroy vs: What could bee greater blasphemie then this? yet this is our horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinne also, to receiue good things of God and repay euill.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as many of vs faile in doing the dutie: <note place="margin">Others faile in doing it.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:18743:164"/>
First, when wee can vse some common tearmes of thankefulnesse, as many can thanke God for all, but first, without all <hi>affection</hi> beseeming the dutie, there is no heartie acknowledgement nor glad entertainment of the mercie, wee are farre from these <hi>Songs of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> we tell not of Gods goodnesse as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 14. <hi>Come and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my soule;</hi> and as <hi>Moses told Iethro what God had done for them, Exod.</hi> 18. 8. If a friend should doe vs a kindnesse, wee would reioyce in it, and tell others what such a one hath done for vs, and according to our ioy in it, would our care be to testifie thankefulnesse, and our sorrow and accusing of our selues to bee backeward herein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, without <hi>all action,</hi> as though wee would pay all our debt to God with good wordes, whereas soundnesse of thankefulnesse is seene in actions, and the life of the dutie is not in a sound of wordes, but in the carriage of the life and course: <hi>Dauid did loue the Lord, because he had heard him, Ps.</hi> 116. 1. Euerie new mercie is a new testimonie of Gods loue, and a nevv spurre of our loue to God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> (in the same place) <hi>would pay his vowes to God, which hee made in affliction: to set forth Gods prayse, he would keepe his iudgements and doe righteously al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, Psal.</hi> 106. 3. see <hi>Psalme</hi> 111. 1. 2. to the 10.</p>
                  <p>This is that, which GOD requires of his people, when hee hath giuen them the good land and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished all his promises, that they should not forget him, but <hi>feare him and walke in his wayes, Deut.</hi> 6. 10. 11. If a Land-lord should come to demand his Rent, and the Tenant thinke to please him with good words, but neither pay him his due nor regard any of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Lease, agreed vpon, should not hee both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himselfe and cause the Lord to re-enter for not paying? Would God we were so wise to acknowledge, that the Lord lookes for another manner of Rent then
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18743:165"/>
words, and that, as wee will not let Leases goe for not paying of Rent to man, so wee would giue the Lord no iust cause to straine vpon vs and all that wee haue, for breaking our conditions with him! To him that doth vs a great pleasure, we professe our selues in his debt, and acknowledge our selues at his command to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our power: Oh let vs blush and be ashamed to be so superficiall in actuall and substantiall thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards our God!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a number make shew of many thankes, but all is in pride and hypocrisie, and can thanke God for that they neuer had, and much lesse the sense of it. The Pharise praysed God for that he neuer had, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. 11. Oh he was neuer so bad as the Publica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no Extortioner, nor an vniust person like others. Ciuill men will thanke God they doe no man harme, come to Church, liue in compasse and good fashion: they thanke God they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as well as the best, without all doubting, they be good subiects, and they loue God with all their hearts: Here is a Pharise iustifying himselfe, but hee goes not away so, he departs not iustifyed. But the poore Leper fell downe humbly on his face at Christs feet, praysing God, and the Publican at the Church-doore: <hi>Iaakob</hi> is lesse then the least of Gods mercies, and <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is but dust and ashes.</p>
                  <p>The Papists make shew of thankes to God for their saluation, which yet they can merit for themselues: all one as to thanke God for nothing; for they must come to Heauen by their owne good deeds, and what needes then the mercie of God? Some of our ignorant people thanke God they can serue God and say their Prayers as well as any: but what Prayers? the tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Creed, the Aue-Mary: A Popish thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, when there is not a word of prayer in them all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euen the best of vs are infinitely wanting in this dutie, when wee set our selues to the best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18743:165"/>
of it, as appeareth by these things.</p>
                  <p>First, in our prayses wee cast our eye chiefly on tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <note place="margin">Failings in our best perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this dutie.</note> things, and are more feeling and feruent in our prayses for them, then for spirituall mercies: wee dote too much vpon them as the Israelites did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 5. saying, Wee remember the Fish which wee did eate in Egypt freely, the Cucumbers, Leekes, Onyons, and Garlicke that wee had there: but now our soules are dryed away, and there is nothing but this Mannah: Whereas the Apostle counted all things but doung for Christ and in comparison of spirituall blessings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he beginneth his prayses, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Blessed be God, who hath blessed vs with all spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in heauenly things:</hi> and so he goeth on in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as one that cannot get out of it. Wee had cause of comfort in our affections, if wee could forget the things that are below, in comparison of heauenly blessings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how partiall are wee in our thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing? for a great blessing wee can giue some thankes, but those that wee count smaller, wee passe sleightly, whereas, were our eyes so cleere as they ought, wee could not but see God in the least of them. Besides, wee can sometime giue thankes for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent mercie with some affection, but wee forget eaten bread; whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue thankes as well for the promise made to <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the accomplishment of it to himselfe, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 10. but the great workes of GODS mercie are to vs but nine dayes wonder.</p>
                  <p>Further, whereas wee are bound to thankefulnesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for those mercies, which GOD hauing promised hath in store for vs, how doe wee confine our thoughts to the present, not looking beyond the day to prouoke our selues to this dutie? <hi>Dauid</hi> goes further, and sayth, <hi>Oh how great good things hast thou laid vp in store for them that feare thee!</hi> especially, seeing they are such as eye
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18743:166"/>
hath not seene, nor eare hath heard, neyther can enter into the heart of man to conceiue.</p>
                  <p>3. When we set our selues to be thankful, how sleight, how short are we in this dutie &amp; part of Gods worship? we can in the grosse &amp; lumpe turne ouer a great heape of mercies, not willing to trouble our selues with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular recounting of fauours, which would bee a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall helpe to the dutie. <hi>Iaakob</hi> farre otherwise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>of the least of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant: for with my staffe I passed ouer this Iordan, and now I am become two bands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to conclude, how little are our hearts stirred to thankesgiuing vnder crosses and afflictions? whereas our Commandement is, <hi>In all things giue thankes, euen</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>in crosses and losses.</hi> We can receiue good from God, but no euill; whereas our dutie is with <hi>Iob</hi> to blesse God as well in taking away as in giuing.</p>
                  <p>Thus seeing how farre wee are from our dutie, let vs iudge our selues, and take our selues tardie in the slips, and amend what we haue failed in, and for time to come so frame this dutie to this Doctrine, as God may haue his prayse, and we his mercies continued to vs and ours.</p>
                  <p>There is yet remaining a third point of Doctrine, namely, that the matter of the godly mans songs, &amp; ioy <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.</note> must be spiritual and heauenly: as here, the ditty of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The matter of the godly mans songs must bee spirituall.</note> songs are Gods deliuerances &amp; praises of God for deliuerances: And this his practice elsewhere. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 25. <hi>My prayse shall be of thee in the great Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Psal.</hi> 59. 16. 17. <hi>I will sing of thy power and prayse thy mercie:</hi> see the place. <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 8. <hi>I will sing vnto thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations.</hi> And in respect of this argument of all his <hi>Psalmes, Dauid is called the sweet Singer of Israel,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1.</p>
                  <p>First, the Commandement enioyneth vs this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Speaking vnto your selues in Psalmes and Hymnes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:18743:166"/>
                     <hi>and spirituall songs:</hi> therefore our songs must be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: first, for matter not prophane. Secondly, they must proceede from Gods spirit as the Author of them. Thirdly, they must be framed with honest and gracious wordes, beseeming the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to a spirituall end, which is, first, Gods glorie: and secondly, our owne and others edification. And in the same place it followes: <hi>Singing and making melodie in your heart to the Lord,</hi> euer looking and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your Psalmes to God, as the right obiect of them and our ioy. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. 17. there is required, first, that our songs come from the Word dwelling plentifully in our hearts. Secondly, that they be spirituall, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer causes. Thirdly, that they be to the Lord, that is, first, before the Lord. Secondly, to his praise, as <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Whatsoeuer yee shall doe in word or deede, doe all in the name of the</hi> LORD IESVS, <hi>giuing thankes to God and the Father, by him:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 4. <hi>Delight thy selfe in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the godly ought euer to giue testimonie <note place="margin">2.</note> of that heauenly ioy, vvhich delighteth their soules, and vvhich is a fruit of the spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. seeing they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to be led by the spirit; and by this they notably incite themselues, and inuite others to pietie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is fit there be a difference betweene wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">3.</note> and godly mens songs. They sing like themselues, either vvickedly, vvantonly, and filthily, or the best of their songs, vvhich they sing with any feeling, are but vvorldly, vvhen their Wine and Oyle are increased, and they enioy temporall prosperitie: But the godly must be in another tune; they must sing, because God hath lifted vp the light of his countenance vpon them: they haue a peculiar ioy, the ioy of Gods people, vvhich <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> desireth the Lord to visit him vvithall, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 5. The Stranger enters not into this ioy, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14. 10.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the godly should not make their songs of <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:18743:167"/>
God, he should haue little or no praise on earth for all his mercies, seeing the vvicked cannot praise him, the dead (in sinne) cannot praise him, they can reioyce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in eating, drinking, sporting, building, and such props of the flesh, yea and are neuer so glad as when God is farthest off, out of sight and out of minde: Now if the Christian man, vvho hath a true sense of God, should not sing vnto God, he should haue no praise at all of all his goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the songs of godly men on earth are best, when <note place="margin">5.</note> they be the same for kinde and matter with their songs in heauen, seeing the same heauenly life and ioy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun on earth, vvhich vve must haue in perfection in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there is no difference but in the degree. And this vve see plainely in the Scripture, both vvhat is the matter of that new song of the Saints in heauen, vvho had gotten victorie ouer the Beast, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 15. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the song of the Lambe, saying, <hi>Great and maruellous are thy workes, Lord God Almightie,</hi> iust and true are thy wayes, King of Saints: And, that the songs of the godly haue commonly beene of the same argument and matter, is cleere by the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in the speciall members of it. The Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. 2. sang this song vnto the Lord, and said in this manner, <hi>I will sing vnto the Lord, the Lord is my strength</hi> and my song, he is become my saluation, &amp;c. My song:] that is, first, the matter of the song, the Lord, to whom all praise belongeth: and secondly, he in whom the Church reioyceth and glorieth all the day long. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>I will sing to my beloued:</hi> Christ is the song of the Church; the whole booke of Canticles is a song of Christ, and the Church, which singeth out his beauties, perfections, and affections, and describeth him in excellent manner from top to toe. So for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members of it: <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth it, saying. My song shall be of thee all the day long: the like we may see of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18743:167"/>
                     <hi>Hanna, Zachary, Simeon, Mary, Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barak, Iudg.</hi> 5. All whose songs record how they made God their glorie, and the matter of their Psalmes and praises; in a word, they were no other then songs of deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, let a man turne his face any way else from <note place="margin">6.</note> God, let him sing of his wealth, of his pleasure, or any of the delights of the sonnes of men, his song shall be but a short one, and as vnsound as short. <hi>Salomon</hi> tryed his heart, and tyred himselfe in worldly pleasures, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, honors, and all kinde of earthly happinesse, but he comes at length to a recantation, and sings a new song, and tells vs, that all that is vnder the Sunne, is but vanitie and vexation of spirit. And trie it after him who vvill, hee shall surely change his note as hee did, vvhen his laughter shall be no better in his owne eyes then madnesse; and the reason is, because nothing out of God can afford matter of sound ioy.</p>
                  <p>We see hence what to thinke of musick in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, of which kinde songs are. In the old Testament it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> was of diuine institution, and a part of the ceremoniall Law. In the new Testament God requires a more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worship, and yet we are allowed vs that musicke, whether naturall or artificiall, whereby the heart is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp and prouoked to glorifie God. Is any man mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, saith <hi>Iames,</hi> let him sing Psalmes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
                  <p>The conditions of this musicke must be these: first, it must tend to edification, and therefore it must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. Secondly, it must not carry away the heart or eare, either of the Singer or of the Hearer, but stirre it vp. Thirdly, it must not consist more in <hi>fragore quàm feruore,</hi> more in contention of voice, then intention of heart. Fourthly, it must be orderly, not wasting the time of preaching: for the better must take place and take vp more time. Here therefore is not approued that practice of the Papists, in turning out of the preaching
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18743:168"/>
of the Word, for their chanting of Masses and musick, which is, first, in Latin, and therefore cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nor edifie. Secondly, superstitious: for all of them hold, Masse sung to be more holy and meritorious then Masse said. Thirdly, they sing to Idols, and God is not the matter of their songs. The best Organe in Gods seruice is a Christian and faithfull mans heart: set that in tune, and there will be sweet musicke. But as for our singing of Psalmes in publike and priuate, the vse of them is excellent, if vsed aright: first, to celebrate the Name of God in the acknowledgement of his mercies. Secondly, by singing to awaken our dull hearts, and raise them towards God. Thirdly, as to testifie our owne thankefulnesse, and shew our affection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce our selues in him, so also to stirre vp others to zeale and feruencie, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 3. O magnifie the Lord <hi>with me,</hi> and let vs exalt his <hi>name together.</hi> Fourthly, to comfort and refresh our sorrowfull spirits, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> being in prison sung <hi>to God</hi> euen at midnight, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25. Fiftly, to learne by the examples of the Saints to feare God, to trust in him in aduersitie, and so to confirme our selues in pietie. Sixtly, to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Psalmes, and learne them by heart, in which is a most artificiall anatomie of the soule of a Christian, shewing most liuely his whole state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the matter of our songs be best when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> diuine, it condemnes all those wanton songs and tunes, which misse-tune the heart and affections, and tend to nothing but corruption: <hi>Dauids</hi> songs were of God; but, how vaine and vile are the songs of our common people? How happily might they make exchange of their wanton Sonnets and filthy Ballads with these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Psalmes? first, doth not the Apostle include such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous &amp; lewd songs vnder iesting or foolish talking, which he aduiseth Christians to exchange with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing?
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18743:168"/>
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 4. Secondly, must we giue an account of euery idle word? and not of euery idle song, which is hurtfull to our selues and others, and keepes out bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Thirdly, it is a manifest note of a carnall man, to be delighted with wicked or foolish songs: Doth not want of spirituall affection argue the want of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? And doth not want of spirituall songs argue want of spirituall affection? And if it be so, our eyes see a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall decay of godlinesse, and increase of Atheisme and prophanenesse among our people, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally decayed in singing Psalmes, and delight to sing nothing but prophane Ditties, barring grace out of the heart.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot passe ouer the practice of wicked Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who make it their profession, and get their liuing by the daily poysoning of many with themselues, by most filthy and ribaldrie songs, shamelesse and vnchaste Ditties; setting themselues to please the foule and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hearts and eares of men, to the displeasure of God, and their owne damnation without timely repentance. I may not name <hi>Dauids</hi> songs almost the same day with these detestable Ditties. But, if filthinesse and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to be named among Saints; then should there be no place for such Teachers of filthinesse, whose mouthes were better be without tongues, then filled with songs of any such kinde: for as these doe much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and poyson others, so any better vnbeseeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                  <p>Cannot we by all our labour and best endeuours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with men, while wee prouoke them to puritie of heart and life, such is the gulfe of naturall vncleannesse and filthinesse? And is there any neede of such fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and incentiues of lust? Doe men neede spurres and prouocations to vnchastitie and filthinesse? If it be not in the power of Christians, to stop the mouthes of such Satanicall Factors, yet let them be wise to stop
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:18743:169"/>
their owne eares, lest hereby the Deuill cast a sparkle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Gunne-powder.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let vs learne to checke our selues, when we <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> finde our selues heauie and wearie in talking of good things, and of our gracious God, seeing the godly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a refreshing and matter of godly songs, and when we finde want of Spirit, and coldnesse of heart in singing Psalmes, publike or priuate: for this argues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in godlinesse, and coldnesse in Religion, seeing the heart must leade the tongue, and a ioyfull tongue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies a gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>Meanes to help forward our songs in God, are these: First, make vp thy peace with God: Acquaint thy selfe with him, then shall the Almightie be thy delight, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21, 26. Grow vp in the knowledge of God; the more thou knowest him, the more full will thy ioy be: especially get assurance of the pardon of thy sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, delight in his Word and Ordinances, as in the deedes of thy saluation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 54. <hi>Thy Statutes haue beene my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, get sinceritie of heart: for, <hi>Can an hypocrite delight himselfe in the Almightie? Iob</hi> 27. 10. No, hee cannot.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, beware of intangling thy heart with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or worldly pleasures: for these are as water cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauenly heates; keepe out carnall ioyes, and labour to make thy ioy more heauenly.</p>

               <p>These three Verses contayne, first, a <hi>Preface</hi> to the exhortation, in the eighth Verse. Secondly, the <hi>exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it selfe, standing of a graue and sharpe counsell or aduice: <hi>Be not like the Horse or Mule;</hi> that is, be not so indocible as thou wast, neither stand out stubbornely with God as thou didst before thy iustification. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Reasons</hi> or inforcements of the counsell, drawne, first, from the plagues of God vpon indocible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible persons: <hi>Many are the sorrowes of the wicked.</hi> Secondly, from Gods great good wil towards his own, who haue got assurance of remission of sinne: <hi>Mercy,</hi> or goodnesse, <hi>shall compasse him on euery side.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wordes of the Preface contayne, first, the person that speakes: 1. Secondly, the person, to whom hee speakes: <hi>thee.</hi> Thirdly, the matter of the speech, in three particulars. First, <hi>I will instruct thee:</hi> that is, make thee to vnderstand. Secondly, I will <hi>teach thee the way:</hi> that is, not only by precept, but also by example I will leade thee into the practice. Thirdly, <hi>I will guide thee with mine eye:</hi> that is, I will watch ouer thee, lest thou stray out of that good way, to set thee in againe.</p>
               <p>1:] the person vttering these wordes is not God, as some thinke, but <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the title of the Psalme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, A Psalme of <hi>Dauid</hi> to giue instruction: so here he fitly professeth himselfe an Instructer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:18743:170"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was a King, how then commeth he to professe <note place="margin">Quest.</note> himselfe a Prophet or Teacher in the Church? Can one man carry both Magistracie and Ministrie? Yes:</p>
               <p>In the old Testament, the Sword and the Word did <note place="margin">Answ.</note> sometime concurre in one person for these causes.</p>
               <p>First, because the Church was a long time shut vp in one Familie, and then the same man might sufficiently performe both. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> was a Gouernour and a Priest in his house. Thus the Patriarke <hi>Abraham</hi> was a great Prince and Magistrate, as appeared by his rescue of <hi>Lot,</hi> by a band of men, gathered out of his owne house, and yet a Prophet too, as the Lord told <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> and appeares by sacrificing his <hi>Isaak. Iob</hi> was a great man, and a Magistrate, and yet offered sacrifices as a Priest, for his sonnes. And thus it was all the while the Church was in Families.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after the people of the Iewes were settled into a Kingdom, the Scriptures were the positiue lawes of the Iewes, so as the Leuites were both of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and their Lawyers, and then one man might more easily performe both: but this was a proprietie of that Common-wealth of the Iewes; for neuer any other but that had the Scriptures for their positiue written Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, sometimes for necessitie they did concurre in one man, as when there was an vniuersall corruption or ruine of the State, God stirred vp some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man to take vp both, for the repaire of the Church and Common-wealth. Thus <hi>Eli</hi> the chiefe Priest, also iudged Israel fortie yeeres, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 18. and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of those times, and the generall discontent of men both in matters of Gouernment, and of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, appeare manifestly in the Historie. After <hi>Eli,</hi> when Gods worship was broken vp at Shilo, the Arke in the Enemies hand, and a wofull confusion was in the state of the Iewes, the Lord stirred vp faithfull <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was a faithfull Prophet of the Lord, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 20. and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18743:170"/>
also iudged Israel all the dayes of his life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, some by way of type were both Kings and Priests: before the giuing of the Law, <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was the King of Salem, and a Priest of the most high God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. so <hi>Dauid</hi> here, and his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> after him, were notable types of Christ, who would in those darke shaddowes be in some particular men declared to be both the King, Priest, and Prophet of his Church. And this is the reason here, why <hi>Dauid</hi> being a King, doth take vpon him to teach others: and for this, Christ is often called the Sonne of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come neerer to our Text: <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing after a long conflict obtayned mercy at Gods hand, earnestly desireth and endeuoureth, that others may be partakers of the same grace also, and he, hauing found the way to comfort, wil set others in the way also: Hence note, that <hi>A man that hath true grace, earnestly wisheth that all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                  <hi>others did partake in the same grace with him.</hi> Ps. 34. 8. 11. <note place="margin">True grace is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatiue</note> Come children, harken vnto me, I will <hi>teach you</hi> the feare of the Lord: and, Oh, <hi>taste</hi> and see how good the Lord is! a man cannot taste of Gods mercy, but he wisheth all did taste with him. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1. the first note of the sound conuersion of the people, was, that they call one another, saying, <hi>Come, let vs turne to the Lord:</hi> and it is indeede a marke of true repentance, to take one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by the hand, and leade one another towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. As in a naturall body, one member seekes the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and well-fare of all; so is it in the mysticall body of Christ.</p>
               <p>First, this is one condition of our owne conuersion, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> I.</note> euen to conuert others. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. 32. <hi>Thou being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, strengthen thy brethren.</hi> Neither is there any man that receiues any grace for himselfe alone, but that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may share with him: neuer had any man any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but a charge also with it, <hi>Occupy till I come.</hi> And hence are those Commandements in generall, As euery
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18743:171"/>
man hath receiued a gift, so let him minister; and, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and <hi>cause others</hi> to returne: and those speciall charges, to exhort one another, admonish one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to conuert one another, to comfort one another with the comforts receiued from God, to prouoke one another to the loue of God and good workes: all which shew, that euery one, as he is borne in the Church, so he is borne also for the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a propertie and an assured signe of <note place="margin">2.</note> sound saith to worke by loue. And this loue is first set <hi>vpon God</hi> and his glorie, it earnestly desireth that his Kingdome may come, and that his will may be done in earth, of men as of the Saints and Angels in Heauen: and this it endeuoureth in a mans selfe and in others. Secondly, this loue lookes out <hi>vnto others,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserateth the estate of <hi>vnconuerted</hi> persons, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to releeue them: true sense of their owne change and former estate, mooues them to compassion for such as are still in their sinnes, and surely none are so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as those that haue obtained mercie. One that loues another, will pull him out of danger if he can: So will a beleeuer bemoane another, and plucke him out of the fire, as <hi>Iude</hi> speakes. Thirdly, it looketh to such as are <hi>conusrted,</hi> and for Gods sake loues his Image, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially renewed: it loues him that is begotten for his sake that begat, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 1. and, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did good to <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> for <hi>Ionathan</hi> his fathers sake, so doe good men to Gods children for Gods sake their heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fourthly, this loue, which is the life of faith, at least the pulse of it, is cleane opposite to selfe-loue, which is of an hard and niggardly nature, and enuious of any good to any about him; but it is like Gods loue, which communicates it selfe and is liberall for the good of all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where there is any sound grace of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there is zeale for God, which worketh the heart <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:18743:171"/>
to the cherishing and setting vp of grace and vertue, and to the hatred and resistance of sinne and vice in a mans selfe and others, it will shew it selfe for God: as <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 29. <hi>Paul said to King Agrippa, I would that not onely thou, but also all that heare me this day, were as I am, sauing my bonds.</hi> His sound zeale wished that all were sound Christians. And hence are all those Similitudes, wherein grace is compared to such things as are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest kept in any compasse, as</p>
               <p>First, to <hi>fire:</hi> Quench not the spirit: if there bee but sparkles of fire vnder the ashes, lay on wood, and it wil kindle and turne it into it selfe: let grace meet but with fewell and matter, it will worke vpon it, to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all the house.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to <hi>water,</hi> which is of a flowing nature and is hardly contained within bankes or bounds; so Christ sayth, <hi>He that drinketh of this water, out of his belly shall flow Riuers of water of life, Ioh.</hi> 7. 38.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to a <hi>sweet smell,</hi> or precious ointment, which spreds into the ayre and cannot bee smelt of any one, but also of euery one in the same place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to a leauen: <hi>The kingdome of heauen</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is like a little peece of leauen,</hi> it will quickly worke through a whole lumpe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, to a light in a Candlesticke, which lightneth the whole house, yea, which cares not to consume it selfe, so it may comfort and inlighten others.</p>
               <p>First then, examine hereby the truth of grace and thy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> conuersion, euen by thy desire and endeuour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of others. <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 17. <hi>Iron sharpens Iron: so doth one friend sharpen another,</hi> that is, <hi>quicken vp another;</hi> a sparke of zeale in one Christian will kindle a flame in another, yea, it will stirre vp some good inclinations and motions euen in lewd persons. If <hi>Andrew</hi> find <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> he will bring him to Christ; and if Christ find <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, Philip</hi> will find <hi>Nathaniel:</hi> the woman of Samaria
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18743:172"/>
was no sooner toucht a little, but she called the whole Citie to see Christ. Doe we lacke motiues?</p>
               <p>First, if wee looke at the wicked, wee shall see them <note place="margin">Motiues to forward one another in grace.</note> call one another, to goe together, and haue all one purse, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 14. they can spread and infuse their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse one into another suddenly, as mischiefe is very nimble. See wee not Iesuites and Papists compassing with great danger of their liues all the parts of the World, to corrupt and infect with the deadly poysoned Cup of the Whore of Babel, all the Countries of the Earth? and shall not wee labour to make men loue and like the truth? Shall their blinde zeale carrie them so farre beyond vs, who, while wee professe wee hold the truth against them, our care is not to plant or spread this Religion as they doe theirs? Oh then our loue is but small, if it bee any at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is no Saint that liueth out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints: a righteous man is described to bee one, <hi>whose lips feed many:</hi> nay, a gracious woman <hi>opens</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>her lips with wisdome.</hi> And why doth not the Lord giue one man all graces, or to all a like measure, but diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that he intendeth the mutuall good of each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? It was anciently prophesied of beleeuers, <hi>(Isay</hi> 2. 3.) in the new Testament, thus, <hi>Many shall goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord,</hi> and say, <hi>Come, let vs goe vp to the house of the Lord, and he will teach vs his wayes: and how glad was Dauid, when he could get men together to goe vp to the Temple of God? Psal.</hi> 122. 1. 2. The grace of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious persons must be discouered by the grace of their lips.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if wee consider the blessed fruit of this care for others conuersion, it will be a strong motiue to take it vnto vs:</p>
               <p>First, we shall notably glorifie God in furthering his Kingdome in our selues and others: this was the care of them, who were taught in the Apostles Doctrine,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18743:172"/>
that in two yeeres it was carryed from Ephesus ouer all Asia, <hi>and many were partakers of it, Act.</hi> 19. 10. hereby Gods glorie was exceedingly enlarged.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee shall hereby edifie our brethren, and bring Gods glorie into request with them. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 17. when the Church had liuely set forth the beauties and perfections of her loue and Lord, Iesus Christ, others which before had no sense and feeling of it, by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are now rauished with desire after him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Whither is thy beloued gone? turne aside, that wee may seeke him with thee.</hi> Yea, being as weake as we are, may be a means of conuerting and sauing our brethren, and so bind their hearts for euer vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee shall not onely set a-worke our owne graces, but increase them, and bee gainers by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of our talents: wee read not of any seruant, that vsed his talent, but to increase: and this is by a secret blessing of God, who giues bread to the Sower, as the two Disciples, going to Emaus, talking of good things, Christ himselfe ioyned to them and went with them; yea, and although for a time at our first conference of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten we see but little fruit, yet after a while it is with vs as it was with those Disciples, Their eyes were holden for a time, that they could not know Christ, but, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in their communication, Christ lodgeth with them, sits downe at table, opens their eyes, and reueales himselfe vnto them: euen so it is here.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we shall not onely further our reckoning, to giue it vp with ioy, but euen increase our glorie and reward in Heauen, as hee that had gained fiue talents, was made Ruler of fiue Cities, and the other of tenne. What can mooue to this dutie, if this doe not mooue vs?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this serues to reproue many sorts of men, as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use.</hi> 2.</note> First, such as content themselues with a conceit of their owne conuersion and good estate, but they are
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18743:173"/>
wise and politique, they will looke euery one to one, but as for others, who made them their brothers Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? What haue they to doe whether they sinke or swimme? euery vessell must stand on his owne bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, they must shift for themselues. Yes, yes, GOD hath made thee euery mans Keeper, and giuen thee the charge of euery man within thy power to do him good, to further his saluation. Neyther canst thou haue any comfortable assurance of thy owne charge, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest and endeuourest not the conuersion of others: Slender is the sense of mercie, and little loue of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse in thy owne soule, if there bee in thee no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of drawing others to the same: Therefore lay aside this conceit, that thou art to care onely for thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, such are hereby reprooued, as can frame themselues to please all companies they fall into, are ashamed or afraid to minister or entertaine such speech as sauoureth of this desire, and thus passe the time in idle speeches, or vnsauourie communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not onely to the hindering of that comfort, which would rise out of sauourie and fruitfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but to carrie with them a checke and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of conscience for neglecting so comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a dutie. Oh, therefore, finding our selues tardie in these things, let vs checke our selues, and know, that though wee cannot gaine others to goodnesse by our speech, yet wee shall lose nothing by it, but be gainers our selues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, such are reprooued, as eyther neglect or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to communicate their graces in furthering the growth of grace in such as they ought. A Magistrate should see all within his power, keepe the two Tables as well as himselfe: good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would see all the Citie keepe the Sabbath, and set forward all the good he could for the Temple, by his authoritie and example. Masters of Families also and Gouernours should be as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18743:173"/>
great wheeles in a Clocke, whereof if one bee set a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee will mooue his fellow, and that the next vnto him; not one must bee idle: <hi>Abraham</hi> will teach his Family, and <hi>Ioshua</hi> his house; and <hi>Cornelius</hi> cals his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke to heare the Doctrine of life.</p>
               <p>Others enuie the graces of God, where they should reioyce most, as <hi>Cain</hi> did the grace and goodnesse of <hi>Abel,</hi> and this was yong <hi>Ioshua's</hi> fault, to enuie <hi>Eldad</hi> &amp; <hi>Medad</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> his sake. Master, forbid them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie: but what said <hi>Moses?</hi> he was of another temper, and said, Dost thou enuie for me? would God all the Lords people were Prophets, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 29. It is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to speake, but more wofull to practise, that men should bee wearie of their seruants, because they are good, and say of their good and towardly children, Yong Saints old Deuils; also of the wife, that she is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting of some strange matters, when shee will doe that good in her house, which her husband will not: Satan that can get this aduantage of men, will get a greater before hee hath left them. True grace would delight in building vp others, and is glad when any comes on well or out-strips it in goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, those are reprooued, which not onely not instruct or help forward, but also hinder others &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from their godly courses, which reproch or persecute good wayes, men whom the Deuill hath taught to bee cunning in besmearing all the wayes of Gods children. Oh (say some) they are all Hypocrites, all Dissemblers, as bad as who is worst, yea (if wee will beleeue such) as blacke Deuils. Much more are those in a wofull case, which corrupt and peruert others, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What? will you bee so precise and foolish? will you in a kinde of singularitie lose both your pleasure and reputation? But marke the seuere reproofe of such in <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, who laboured to turne away the Deputie, <hi>Paulus Sergius,</hi> from the faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 8. 9.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18743:174"/>
10. O thou enemie of righteousnesse (sayth <hi>Paul)</hi> full of subtletie, the childe of the Deuill, full of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, &amp;c. like indeed to the Deuill, who is the greatest disswader of goodnesse, and would driue all holinesse out of the earth if he could: <hi>Elymas</hi> is the Deuils child, because his workes he did. Oh, let vs take heed of these errours, and bee more diligent in this fruit of conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If in the Spring-time a Plant bee without leaues or buds, when others sprout and blossome, we say, Surely it is dead: so if the Spring of grace bee returned vpon thee, let all the World see it in this sprout; if thou beest a Plant of righteousnesse, thou wilt shew thy life and fruit, that euery one may plucke somewhat and bee the better by thee.</p>
               <p>The second point in this Preface is the Scholer or person to be taught:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thee]</hi> that is, euery man particularly, to vvhom this <hi>Psalme</hi> shall come to be heard, sung, read, or any vvay v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Whence vve may learne tvvo things:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That no man naturally vnderstandeth the things of God without a Teacher.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</p> 
                     <p>No man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the things of God without a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p> 
                     <p>See <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
                  </note> Secondly, <hi>that Doctrine is not sufficient to be deliuered in generall, but must bee particularly applyed to all.</hi> The first is manifest by Scripture and reasons. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The natur all man vnderstandeth not the things of God. Act.</hi> 8. 31. When the <hi>Eunuch</hi> read the Prophesie of <hi>Esay,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> asked him if hee vnderstood the place, <hi>How can I</hi> (sayd he) <hi>without a guide?</hi> The case is with euery natural man as it was with <hi>Samuel; God cals once, and againe, Samuel still runnes another way,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Thus did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> (sayth the Text) <hi>before he knew the Lord, and before the Word of the Lord was reuealed vnto him:</hi> Which is true as well in respect of that ordinarie diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is common to all the seruants of God, as the extraordinary, which was peculiar to the Prophets.</p>
               <p>The reason hereof is not, as Papists say, the obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18743:174"/>
of the Scripture, which is a light to our feet and a Lanthorne, but</p>
               <p>First, nothing can goe beyond its owne nature and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> kind, nature cannot reach to diuine things, flesh cannot reach aboue flesh, and before Regeneration the whole man is flesh, his bodie is flesh, his soule is flesh, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions flesh, his actions and all is flesh; And as for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, he can no more reach them then a beast can reach to reasonable actions. <hi>No man knowes the Father but the Sonne, and hee to whom the Sonne reuealeth him.</hi> No man knowes the heart of a man, till himselfe make it knowne: much lesse can any man know the minde of God, but God himselfe and hee to whom the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueales it, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas by our innocencie wee were of large hearts and Eagles eyes for clcerenesse of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <note place="margin">2.</note> and iudgement in the things of God, by the fall a vayle is come ouer our hearts, and the scales of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance are come vpon our eyes, and the cloudes of darkenesse are betweene vs and our Sunne; nay, an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man is not onely in darknesse, but euen dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 8. and the child of night and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 7. that as <hi>Paul</hi> being blinde must haue the scales taken off his eyes before he can see; so no man can haue any sauing knowledge, till his naturall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance bee remooued: And as this was the first thing in <hi>Pauls</hi> Conuersion, and the first worke of God in the Creation, to seuer light and darknesse; so the first worke of this second Creation is the illumination of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if euery regenerate man need a Teacher, much lesse doth any naturall man vnderstand without one: but euen the best haue ignorance in them, though not raigning, it being with the godly in this life as in the twilight, much darknesse is mingled with their light: and therfore euen the Apostles themselues prayed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18743:175"/>
for increase of spirituall vnderstanding. And the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we haue here of God, is but as in a mysterie, or in a mirrour: In a mystery] wherein something is seene, something hid, as in the Sacraments for that cause so called, because we see the Elements, but not the things signified by them: In a mirrour] as in a glasse, and not face to face, <hi>we know but in part,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>First, Let vs hence acknowledge our naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> it being with vs as with the blind man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. who was borne blinde, and neuer saw any thing, till Christ had opened his eyes; wee being naturally blind, cannot see though the Sunne of righteousnesse shine vpon vs. And, if wee cannot see our spirituall good, euen by our best naturall graces, much lesse can wee imbrace it, or by the power and strength of nature or will, follow it, against the Papists who teach that we can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, learne to pitie naturall men as <hi>Dauid</hi> here <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> doth, who as blind men, first, see not the way to Heauen, secondly, and are in danger of harmes, though they thinke themselues safe enough, thirdly, and are soone mis-led, (for who but ignorant persons are a prey to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and such like?) fourthly and lastly, they haue no comfort of the Sunne, no light of grace or of glorie. And a wofull condition are such in, as liue without the meanes of knowledge and grace: who would liue in a soyle, where the Sunne neuer shines, or if hee were sure to bee made blinde in it? yet many men leaue good meanes for a little pelfe: who, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, runne out of the blessing of GOD into the warme Sunne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee see hereby how little need there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> to remooue the Word and Sacraments from the people, as the Papists doe: the light of the Sunne being not so necessarie to the World, as the vse of these.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let vs doe as the blinde man in the Gospell <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> did, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. 35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> First, let vs acknowledge that Christ
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18743:175"/>
must open our eyes, that he must giue vs eye-salue, nay both eyes to see, and light to enlighten vs. Secondly, let vs pray as he did, saying, Lord, our desire is that our eyes may bee opened, that wee may haue insight into heauenly things. Thirdly, let vs with him stand in the way where Christ comes by; in the Temple and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Saints, in the Tents of Shepheards, or among the seuen Golden Candlestickes. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed, he praysed Christ and leapt for ioy; so if we see the things of God better then wee did before, wee should reioyce exceedingly with hearty thankesgiuing. Fiftly, hauing his eyes opened, he followed Christ, and would not bee beaten from him: so if wee can get the eyes of our minde opened, wee must prayse our good God in word and in deed, walke answerable to this mercie, become his Disciples, <hi>sinne no more, lest a worse thing befall</hi> vs, and <hi>walke worthy of the light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much of the first point: the second followes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> namely, that <hi>The word must not onely bee taught, but</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gods Word must bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</note> 
                  <hi>also specially applyed to euery particular person. Dauid</hi> saith not, I will teach the Church, or, all men, in generall, but euerie one in particular, <hi>thee.</hi> After <hi>Adam</hi> had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how plainely and personally doth the Lord deale with him, both in amplifying his sinne, that hee might be strucke downe with it, and in publishing the promise of saluation, to rayse him againe? herein teaching eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Minister and Preacher how to carry the Word home to euery sonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> seeing they are to speake the same wordes, which, hee whose Messengers they are, would speake. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, sent to <hi>Dauid</hi> while yet hee lay in his sinne, was directed by God what to say, and he must not onely in a Parable make <hi>Dauid</hi> condemne the sinne to the death, <hi>He shall dye that hath done this thing,</hi> but by plaine dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him, saying, <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and confesse, <hi>I haue sinned.</hi> Our Sauiour Christ
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18743:176"/>
thus carryed his Doctrine, applying it home to the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons it concerned: to the Iewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>O ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flye from the wrath to come?</hi> to the Pharises; <hi>Woe bee to you Scribes and Pharises, Hypocrites.</hi> And his Apostles, being to deale with wicked people, vsed the same course; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Whom yee slew with wicked hands, and hanged on a Tree:</hi> and Chap. 8. 22. <hi>Thy monie perish with thee, repent of this thy malice, thou art in the gall of bitternesse: It may bee, thy sinne may bee done away.</hi> Hence their Sermons were called exhortation, which is application of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and inforcing of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15. And their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are of the same manner; euer after Doctrine they vsed exhortations, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. hauing deliuered the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, Iustification, Sanctification, and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination in the former Chapters, begins there his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and so continues in them to the end: The like may be seene in other Epistles.</p>
               <p>First, the vse of the Scripture is to exhort, reproue, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> correct, and instruct to make the man of God absolute: the vse of it is not onely to teach and enlighten the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, but also to worke vpon, conuince, quiet, and direct the conscience and whole course. Doctrine is but the laying of a ground, application is the building vp of a Christian.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the life of Ministerie is in application, <note place="margin">2.</note> without which the Word is a Sword, but without an edge, not in it selfe, but to vs; but, being specially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it is a two-edged Sword, cutting deepe, diuiding betweene the marrow and bone, and piercing betweene the soule and spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. Application of the Word is that, which leads it to the thoughts and intents of the heart, to discerne them, to high thoughts, to deiect them, to the affections, if sinfull, to captiuate them, if set right, to enflame them, to seuerall temptations and lusts, to sub due them, and to the whole life and wayes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:18743:176"/>
Thirdly, our owne constitution and weaknesse stands in need of speciall application: <note place="margin">3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, because our hearts are naturally asleepe, and we are couered ouer with the spirit of slumber, spoken of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 10. and need to bee wakened by a voyce lift vp like a Trumpet from some sonne of Thunder. <hi>Dauid</hi> by his grosse sinne had cast himselfe into a fast and dead sleepe, therefore <hi>Nathan</hi> must goe to waken him, and say aloud in his eares, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, our hearts by the neglect of good meanes or securitie are easily hardned, and lose their softnesse or tendernesse: now, the word in speciall application must bee as an hard wedge, to our hard knots; this makes the Word an Hammer to knocke and breake our flintie hearts, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 29.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as wee cannot apply the Word our selues, so wee will not apply it: commonly men skip ouer the Law, and catch at the Gospell, and so, being neuer soundly humbled, their whole life is led carelesly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this bad disposition of ours can neuer bee reformed without this speciall application: for the <note place="margin">4.</note> Word neuer becomes ours, neyther can wee taste any sweetnesse of it, without this; no fruit of the Law in our humiliation, no comfort of the promises in our restitution, no vnderstanding of the true meaning of eyther without our owne faith mingling and truely applying both; no worke of the Spirits sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our hearts, but in applying the Law and Gospell; no action of our liues warrantable but by faith, which is a speciall application of the Word vnto them.</p>
               <p>First then, we that are Ministers must labour herein: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> A good Steward giues euery one his part, and then it is the wholesome Word of life, when euery one hath that portion vvhich is fit for him; this makes the Word dwell plentifully in Christians; by this, holy doctrine
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18743:177"/>
is fastned as by nailes by the Masters of Assemblies. If a man should set a great browne Loafe before Children, vvhat good vvould it doe them? they may starue vvell enough, vnlesse it be diuided: Gods Word is in it selfe nourishable, but, being not diuided, it vvill not be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing to vs. Away then with Sermons, if they be afraid to come neere by application; away vvith idle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate discourses, further then to lay them as grounds for exhortation, herein is learning and the life of the Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, people must learne to cleaue constantly to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> an effectuall ministrie, vvhich hath life and stirring in it, and praise God for it, seeing their necessitie requires it: In hearing the Word apply it to thy selfe, not to others, mingle it vvith thy faith, helpe the Minister in his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paines-taking. Oh, what a deale of labour vvould it saue vs, if men vvere able and vvilling to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply doctrine to themselues?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, vve must all learne to suffer the Word to be applyed in particular vnto vs. A man that hath a sore or <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> fester, vvould be loth to be put to paine by a sharpe plaister; but vvithout it there is no cure: vvhat vvill it helpe him to haue it lye on the cupboord, or on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Before thou canst be a liuing stone in Gods temple, thou must suffer hewing and squaring; nay, so long as thou art here in the Mountayne, thou must be hewne as the stones were for the Temple. <hi>Obiect.</hi> What? must Gods children heare the Law applyed? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, to condemne their sinnes, not their persons; and vve know, that rods, which are prouided for seruants, are laid in the sight of children to feare them.</p>
               <p>But here is all the quarrell, that we reproue speciall sins. Oh (saith one) he hates me, it is I that he reproues; What needes all this adoe? What hath he to doe with my pleasures and dealings? What neede these fellowes make Pulpit-matters of euery thing? And were it not
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:18743:177"/>
for speciall application, we should please men well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but, first, are we enemies for speaking the truth? Secondly, is not the Word a Sword? And can a man be strucke or thrust thorow with a Sword, and not feele it? Is it not Gods sacrificing knife? <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Kill and eate: Peter</hi> was commanded with the sword of the Spirit, to prepare the Gentiles an acceptable sacrifice, and ioyne with them in the communion of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And can a man be sacrificed without paine? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth not euery man desire, that the strong man were cast out of his heart? yet we must not shake his Towres, he vvill not let any of his holds, which are his owne sinnes, to be touched. Fourthly, vvee may not preach mercy to him, that stands in no neede of it; for then we shal preach false doctrine, by misse-applying that which in generall is true. Fiftly, the Saints of God haue beene contented to beare particular reproofe: <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon admonition confessed his sinne euen before <hi>Nathan;</hi> why, he might haue said, Get thee going, silly fellow, tell me of no such matters, goe deale with your equals. Our great men vnder Kings vvould haue said so, but <hi>Dauid</hi> put it vp; and indeede, where had he beene but for <hi>Nathans</hi> plaine dealing? If vve had <hi>Dauids</hi> heart, we vvould be contented to say with him elsewhere, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me; for that is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and let him reproue me, and it shall be a precious Oyle that shall not breake mine head. Beloued, if it were profitable for you, it vvere peaceable for vs, to speake at randome; but both our dutie, and your edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation calls for particular application.</p>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>In the way that thou shalt goe:]</head>
                  <p>THis is the third point in the Preface, the matter wherein the Prophet promiseth to instruct the Christian man, namely, in the way wherein he is to goe: the most necessarie, difficult, and profitable discipline
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18743:178"/>
that a man can teach or learne. By <hi>way</hi> here is meant the <note place="margin">Why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly course is called a way.</note> course and conuersation of a godly man; called a way. First, because God hath laid it open and allowed it vnto vs as an <hi>high-way</hi> betweene vs here, being in a strange Countrie, and our home whither we trauell. Secondly, God directs &amp; approueth it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 6. The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>way</hi> of the righteous. Thirdly, as in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way there is a continuall motion of Trauellers, who in the way are at no rest, till they come to their wayes end: so a Christian man is still moouing and proceeding in godlinesse, forgetting that which is behinde, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hard to the marke that is before him, and doth not finde this World his resting place. Fourthly, as a way leades to some desired place, and if a man keepe in it, it will bring him home, or to some great Citie where his businesse lyeth: so godly life leades a man home to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the great Citie of the great King, the end of which is rest and glorie. Thus it is called Gods way: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught vs by God. Secondly, tending to God. Thirdly, approued of God: and fourthly, ending in God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>going in this way,</hi> is, the ordering of our whole course, and euery action of it, so as we be daily neerer our ayme and perfection. As in a way a Traueller ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues and orders euery step, that he may come to his iourneyes end; so the heauenly Pilgrime makes right steps to his feet, and seeth that euery seuerall duetie, which is as a step in our <hi>way</hi> to heauen, be an obedience of faith, performed in the <hi>way</hi> either of his generall or speciall calling.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may learne this lesson, that, Euery godly <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> man must be carefull, that his course be a going and <note place="margin">Godlinesse is a going in Gods way.</note> proceeding in the wayes of God. <hi>Prou.</hi> 4. 26. Ponder the <hi>path</hi> of thy <hi>feet,</hi> and let all thy <hi>wayes</hi> be ordered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walke</hi> before me, and be vpright: the sonnes of faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> must keepe a course of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18743:178"/>
in Gods <hi>wayes,</hi> as he did. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 32. I haue considered my <hi>wayes,</hi> and turned my <hi>feete</hi> to keepe thy Commandements.</p>
                  <p>First, this is the only true wisedome, to make God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> our guide in our way. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6. Keepe his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for this is your wisedome, and men shall say, Only this is a wise people. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. 2. I will doe wisely in the perfit <hi>way:</hi> where marke how <hi>Dauid</hi> tyeth wisdome to the perfit way, and giues vs to vnderstand, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer refuse to walke in it, let them seeme neuer so wise Politicians, yet we may say of them as the Apostle did of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Professing themselues wise, they became starke fooles:</hi> without this way, all is but folly and meere craft, and shall be turned to a mans hurt. If a man or people will reiect the Word of God, what wisedome can be in them? <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 9. When <hi>Dauid</hi> had but stept out of the way, in numbring the people, out of the pride of his heart, (for otherwise <hi>Moses</hi> might number them, <hi>Num.</hi> 1. 2.) being conuicted, he said, <hi>I haue done very foolishly,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a description of a man in the state of <note place="margin">2.</note> corrupt nature, vnconuerted, to be out of this way. <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 3. They are all <hi>gone out of the way.</hi> And it is a dangerous estate, when a man is giuen vp to his owne wayes, or to walke in a broad way, that leades to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; wherein because so many wander, a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an must be so much the more carefull to auoid it. And it is a way most vncomfortable: for, can a man meete with the comforts of God, while his way is contrarie to Gods? Can he euer looke to come where God is, and not walke in Gods way?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if wee compare this way with all other wayes, it will whet our care to enter into and continue <note place="margin">3. Gods way compared with all other waies.</note> in it: for, First, this is the Kings high-way, in which we haue promise of protection, <hi>Ps.</hi> 91. 11. The Angels shall keepe thee in all thy wayes: In all other wayes we
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18743:179"/>
be as vagrants without a passe, subiect to the whip e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery-where; Israel was stript starke-naked to Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere strokes, when they left this way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. <hi>Moses</hi> had much adoe to saue them from finall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods wayes are the cleanest of all. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 31. The vvayes of God are vncorrupt and pure: and <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. 8. There shall be a path and a way, <hi>the way shall be called holy,</hi> and the polluted shall not passe by it. Now who would goe plodding in deepe and durtie vvayes, in danger euery step to be plunged and laid fast in the mire and clay, when there is a cleane path before him?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods wayes are the rightest wayes. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>The wayes of the Lord are right, and the iust shall walke in them. Act.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Thou ceasest not to peruert the straight wayes of God.</hi> Now euery man desireth to goe in the right way that will lead him directly to the place, which he would be at. All other wayes are crooked ones, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 8. They haue made them <hi>crooked pathes;</hi> whosoeuer goeth therein, shall not know peace. And being rightest, they be also the shortest wayes: (for a right line is the shortest betweene the termes, saith the Geometer:) vvhereas the wicked toyle and wearie themselues in the wayes of vvickednesse, and lose themselues in euery by-lane of lusts and fleshly deuices; they are distracted in inextricable mazes &amp; labyrinths; in a word, they take more paines to goe to Hell, then the godly to get to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods wayes are most lightsome and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Prou.</hi> 3. 17. Her wayes are the <hi>wayes of pleasure,</hi> and all her pathes prosperitie: those that walke in these wayes, are sonnes of the Day, to whom the Sunne of righteousnesse is risen and shineth on them, and they walke in the light: Whereas, whosoeuer are out of this way, there is no light to them, but they walke in the night, their feet are in continuall danger of stumbling.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18743:179"/>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 19. The way of the wicked is <hi>as darkenesse,</hi> they know not vvhere they shall fall: If a man be in the darke and in the durt, hee knowes not vvhere hee shall lodge: so the wicked know not vvhat shall become of them: see <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 21, 22. Marke the confession of sinnes, made <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 9. We grope for the vvall like the blinde, and stumble as without eyes: vve vvaite for light, but behold obscuritie, for brightnesse, but vve vvalke in darkenesse.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Gods vvayes being the safest, cleanest, rightest, shortest, and lightsomest vvayes, vve must be carefull to vvalke in them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, only the end of this course and vvay vvill <note place="margin">4.</note> make vs happy: the Deuill himselfe confessed, that these are the vvayes of saluation, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 37. marke and consider the iust man; for the end of that man is peace. <hi>Ps.</hi> 1. 1. Blessed is he that walketh not in the counsell of the vngodly; whereas the vvay of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked shall perish, that is, leades to perdition; destruction and calamitie <hi>are in their wayes, Rom.</hi> 3. 16. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth them in plaine termes <hi>damnable waies,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Both these are concluded, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 5. As for such as turne aside vnto their <hi>crooked wayes,</hi> the Lord shall leade them forth with the workers of iniquitie; but peace shall be vpon Israel.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine serues to let many men see their folly; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> they hope to be saued, and make full account when they die to goe to God, but yet shall neuer come there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not in the wayes of God. If a man should say he would goe from Yorke to London, and yet shall hold the direct way to Barwicke, would not euery man laugh at him? So is it with him that walkes in the path of perdition, and yet saith he will come to heauen. Aske them what way they walke in, and they must needs giue themselues the lie if they say it is Gods way: and in this conceit thousands are deceiued, and slip into their place
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18743:180"/>
before they would; or bee aware: for,</p>
                  <p>First, some walke in the <hi>blinde</hi> way of ignorance, a <note place="margin">Many by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beaten by many.</note> darke and vncomfortable way, as men walking in the night, in which is no safety nor direction: Numbers care not for the lanthorne of the word, and walking in the night, know not whither they goe, nor where they shall lodge. Aske Papists what way they are in; Oh they are in the way of Catholickes, in the way wherein the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confessors died, in the way of their forefathers, what way soeuer it be: and I would this ignorance were among them onely! but alas! it is the way of too many, who professe the light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, some walke in <hi>the crosse</hi> wayes of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mens deuices, as many of our people, who thinke common prayers better in Lent then all the yeere after: and some can bee deuout on high dayes, and come to Church, but other dayes Gods seruice is not so affected: and some receiue the Sacrament at Easter, and they were damned if they did not, but all the yeere besides, the Sacrament hath no sweetnesse. These are superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wayes, whereas Gods wayes are alwayes the same and to be walked in with the same affection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, some goe in the <hi>crooked</hi> wayes of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, will, policy, and affections, and cannot yeeld to the wisedom of God; their owne lusts are their lawes; who should controle them? Heere is an infinite number of rodes, all of them full of wanderers from God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Gods way is but one, and of Gods describing, cleane contrarie to mans corrupt reason, will, affections, and conuersation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, some goe in the detestable and <hi>damnable</hi> wayes of wilfull spurning against the trueth. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Many shall follow their <hi>damnable</hi> wayes, by whom the way of trueth shall bee euill spoken of. Is it not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable enough for men to walke on in the vvayes of damnation themselues, vnlesse they raile at the way of trueth and life?</p>

Fiftly, some walke in the <hi>filthy, myrie</hi> wayes of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse and profanenesse, as foule fornicators, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, gamesters, gluttons, Epicures, dainty and delicate persons, who seeme to be made for nothing but idlenes, and effeminate care of their skinne, and fruition of their owne sensualitie and appetite. To such, <hi>Salomon</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the person of the yong man, <hi>Walke in the sight of thine eyes, and in the lusts of thine heart, but know that for all this thou must come to iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, numbers walke in the <hi>rugged, stonie, thornie,</hi> and <hi>clayie</hi> waies of earthlinesse, couetousnesse, vsury, and oppression, setting themselues fast in the gall and guile of earthly-mindednesse, not hauing power ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to stirre hand or foote to heauen-ward: where their treasure is, there haue they locked vp their hearts too, or rather burying them (for so they may being dead:) in the earth and earthly desires; the heauen that they wish for, they haue; what then care they for any way that leads to another?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs to learne the way that wee are to goe in: We can walke in the wayes of sinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> a teacher, and can of our selues inuent all such wayes, but in Gods wayes wee cannot mooue, vnlesse God set them open vnto vs, and set vs in them. This way lyes open to none but him that is taught of God: hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisedome teacheth it not, nor reacheth it, neither will beleeue it is the way.</p>
                  <p>How may I know which is the right way to goe in?</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt know it, then, first, vse the meanes to <note place="margin">Quest.</note> come to know it. Secondly, take good notice of the <note place="margin">Answ.</note> eye-markes, by which it may be discerned.</p>
                  <p>First, The meanes to know the way, are, first, diligent <note place="margin">Meanes to know the markes of Gods way.</note> conuerse in the <hi>Scripture. Ioh.</hi> 5. 39. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for they witnes of me, <hi>that is,</hi> of the way. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour tells the Iewes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 37. that they sought to kill him, &amp; were in <hi>the way of Cain,</hi> because his word had no
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18743:181"/>
place in them: Whatsoeuer thou hast a word for, that is the way, or else thou art out of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Prayer</hi> that God would teach vs his way, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 33.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> doeth often pray, and giue vs the spirit to leade vs into all necessary trueth. <hi>ler.</hi> 10. 23. I know, O Lord, that it is not in man to dispose his way, it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>change</hi> in our selues; if it leade vs out of ourselues, out of our naturall lusts and the practice of sinne, and bring in vnderstanding of Gods will, new desires, motions, affections, &amp;c. then it is Gods way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, obseruation and experience of Gods <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> or <hi>cursing,</hi> of inward peace, or accusation of ioy and confidence, hope and patience, which in the way of God is assured; whereas in any other way the greatest ioy is but in the face, and peace is but a truce with God, and an vnfeelingnesse of mens estate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>markes</hi> of this way, are, first, an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">The markes themselues.</note> 
                     <hi>profession</hi> of religion, which is called the way of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 9. Speaking euill of the <hi>way of God.</hi> Those that cannot away with the profession of pietie, haue not stepped one step in the way to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>life of</hi> profession, which is a faithfull apprehension of Christ, who is called the way: <hi>I am the way,</hi> no man commeth to the Father, but by me, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 6. Euery sound marke of a sound Christian is a marke of this way: euery man in euery religion goes not in the way to heauen, but hee onely that goes by Christ, the right and onely way, and this, not onely by outward profession, but inward apprehension of Christ with all his merits.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>straitenesse</hi> of this way: <hi>straite is the</hi> gate, and <hi>narrow is the</hi> way that leads vnto life: the straitnesse of it is, in that it is a way all strawed with crosses; the beginning of it, is repentance and selfe-denyall; the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18743:181"/>
continuance of it, is mortification, temptation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</p>
                  <p>The way of the world is a faire, broad, and easie way to the flesh: If wee finde our selues prosecuting things pleasant to the flesh and nature, wee may iustly suspect that we are out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>fewnesse</hi> or smalnesse of company in the way; <hi>few finde it:</hi> Not many mighty, noble, worldly wise, but a few poore ones receiue the Gospel; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the world are in the broad way that leades vnto death.</p>
                  <p>Foolishly therefore doe the Papists make vniuersali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a note of the Church: Wee must not follow multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to doe euill, nor doe as the most doe; for then certainly we are out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the <hi>employment of</hi> all such as are in the way, who are neuer but doing some of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore called, <hi>The way of Gods precepts.</hi> Christ, whom we haue before vs in this way, was obedient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the death. Goe without or against a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, thou art out of the way: as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. they are <hi>all gone out of the way:</hi> euery sinne is a stepping out of the right way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when we haue learned this way, then goe in it: for here it is called the way, <hi>wherein we must goe;</hi> so as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> wee must in our whole course carrie our selues as those that are in the way to heauen. To this purpose ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these rules:</p>
                  <p>First, consider what way wee haue entred into, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Directions how to go in the way of God.</note> we haue chosen our owne way, or walke in the way which God hath prescribed: the best must often consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his way and course; <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer considered of his way, but he found somthing or other that needed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse. This doe not they that goe at all aduentures, not examining their way, nor the end of it, as if they did not know, that there is a way which seemes good in a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18743:182"/>
mans owne eyes; but the issues thereof are the issues of death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, forecast what may befall vs in our way, and prepare for it. <hi>Elias,</hi> when hee had a great way to goe, prouided himselfe accordingly. If a man be going to warre, had he not need cast his accounts, and prepare all necessaries, and fit himselfe against all difficulties? we must forecast what temptations, trials, and dangers may meete vs in our way, what may bee our expence or losse: many are the slips, scandals, offences, and trials, which will encumber vs in this way, if we be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to forecast them, either to preuent them, or prepare patience and strength to beare them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, walke on in this way; for it is not a way that can bring a man to any desired place, but his walking in it: And then a man walkes on in this way, when, first, he neither goeth backe, nor standeth still, as vpon <hi>Iaakobs</hi> Ladder the Angels were ascending or descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, none stood still: he that goeth not forward here, is going backeward. <hi>Remember</hi> Lots <hi>wife.</hi> Secondly, when a man is sure euery action of his life is performed at the call, and within the compasse of his calling, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or speciall. Thirdly, when he doth all that he doth in the Name of the Lord, looking at Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beginning the same with inuocation, and ending it with praise and thankesgiuing, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Whatsoeuer ye doe in word or deede, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing thankes to God.</hi> Fourthly, when all is done to the glory of God, to the honour of our profession, and to the prouoking of others, seeing our good workes, to glorifie our heauenly father, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer yee doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> And thus shall euery good duetie in our hands be a step in our way to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, beware of turning to the right or left hand, <hi>Prou.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Turne not to the right hand:</hi> seeking or stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18743:182"/>
our righteousnesse in our selues, or in merits, with the Papists: for the way of inherent righteousnes leads from Christ, who is the Way: nor to any way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of orders deuised by men, as of <hi>Francis</hi> or <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke,</hi> of Pouertie, Chastitie, and Counsel-keeping or of <hi>Iesuitisme,</hi> which is the perfection of Rebellion and Treason. <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 101. <hi>Psalme</hi> professeth, that hee will walke in the perfect way, diuers thousands of yeers before the Deuill had hatched any of these vncleane birds in the world. Neither turne <hi>to the left hand,</hi> turning grace into wantonnesse, and imboldning our selues to sinne, because grace hath abounded, as profane Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines doe. Turne not to the world or earthlinesse; these two waies can none walke in together, vnlesse one man could serue two Masters, or serue God and <hi>Mammon.</hi> Our profession to God must be the same, that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, going towards Canaan, made to <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the Amorites, <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 21. <hi>Let me goe through thy Land, wee will not turne aside into the fields, nor into the vineyards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drinke of the waters of the wells, we will goe by the Kings high way, vntill we be past thy Countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, let vs be circumspect both to preuent, and to recouer our selues out of our falls in this way. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">What to bee done in our falls.</note> of Satans fierce temptations, the weaknesse of grace, and the frailty of the flesh, many are the fals and knocks of the best: <hi>In many things we sinne all,</hi> saith S. <hi>Iames:</hi> and, <hi>Who knoweth his errors? Psal.</hi> 19. 12. Now if wee will preuent these, we must beware of occasions of sinne, as a traueller steps ouer stones and rubs in his way: <hi>Eue</hi> preuented not the occasion of her fall, when shee entred talke with the serpent. We must make a couenant with our eyes, not to looke vpon a woman, nor on the wine in a cup: we must watch ouer our selues, both alone, and in company, and not runne into bad company, lest wee come home by weeping crosse, as <hi>Peter</hi> did. Secondly, we must not lie in our falls: a man in his iourney, if hee
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:18743:183"/>
fall, and lie still, shall neuer come to his wayes ende; and if hee rise quickly, though it hinder him a little, it shall not much. The Saints all of them recouered themselues out of their fals, as <hi>Dauid</hi> in this Psalme, by confession, conuersion, suing for pardon, and renewing their faith and repentance. A man out of his way must come backe againe, the sooner he returnes, the lesse is his labour: <hi>Peter</hi> presently went out and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and so was restored to Christs fauour. Thirdly, suppose thy falls bee grieuous, and often into the same sinnes, yet let them not hinder thee still out of the way. For as the childe of God must neither presume nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose sinne, so must hee not despaire of rising, hauing fallen into sinne, seeing the promise is, that if a mans sinnes for hainousnesse bee as red as Scarlet, vpon his true repentance they shall be made white as Snow: and the parable teacheth, that if a sinner offendeth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty times seuen times in a day, and as often truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he shall bee as oft forgiuen. Fourthly, after such fals we must be more wary and careful, lest we fall in the same manner. A man, yea, a beast will be more carefull when it comes by the same place where it caught a fall, yee cannot get it into the same hole againe. <hi>Dauid</hi> no doubt would not count the Tribes againe, after that fall in numbring them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, hold on in this way constantly with perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance; for the end of a worke crowneth it, and the end of a way gladdeth and resteth the weary traueller, and this rest is without end. Many set foorth on this way, but are discouraged by the hardnesse of the entrance, whereas, if they were a little entred, the way would bee pleasant, and the yoke of Christ easie and sweete. Others haue gone yet further, but at length looke backe, yea, go backe, when a man would haue thought they had escaped the filthinesse of the world: and these haue lost a great deale of labour and comfort.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18743:183"/>
Others yet farther then then they, as the bad earth, euen so farre as a man could perceiue no difference between them and sound Christians; and apparent difference was there none but in perseuerance, and yet, wanting soundnesse, haue suffered shipwracke euen at the hauen, and so their former righteousnes is all forgotten: a great deale of way they had gone, and much worke had they ridde, whereof they shall neuer see crowne nor comfort: Oh beware of wearinesse and relapse: as towards the end of his way the traueller is most cheareful, so should wee, and the rather; because, first euery one affects a good end, euen <hi>Balaam;</hi> and will we not endure a little difficultie for it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Satan is most fierce in our end to hinder vs of the crowne, and therefore wee should bee more watchfull and diligent to goe through.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we can labour a while, wee shall bee euer safe, neuer feare him any more, neuer lose that crowne, which the righteous Iudge shall giue vnto vs, who loue his appearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will instruct thee, I will teach thee, I will guide thee with mine eye:]</hi> These three particulars teach vs three properties of a good Teacher: First, to make a people to vnderstand their way. Secondly, to goe before them in good example in this way. Thirdly, to haue a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye ouer them, to guide and gouerne them in that good way, which they teach and walke in. <hi>Dauid,</hi> a good Instructer, professing all these, propoundeth himselfe a patterne for all good Pastours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
                  <p>First, Teachers must make the people vnderstand the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.</note> word of God, and from thence their owne estate, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Teachers must make the people to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Word and their owne way.</note> 8. 8. <hi>Ezra read the booke of the Law distinctly, and gaue the sense, and caused them to vnderstand.</hi> The summe of a good Teachers office is in teaching pure doctrine purely: first, hee must chiefly tye himselfe to the word
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18743:184"/>
of God; his principall scope must be, not to make men vnderstand Latine or Greeke, or the sayings of men, but the word of God. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 28. <hi>The Prophet that hath a dreame, let him tell a dreame, and he that hath my Word, let him speake my Word faithfully:</hi> what is the chaffe to the wheate, saith the Lord? 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. The Word that <hi>thou hast heard of mee,</hi> deliuer to faithfull men. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, these words must hee propound to a plaine and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Audience, in no other then a plaine and simple man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, auoiding as much as he may vnknowne sentences, and darke speeches, which flye aboue low conceits, that by this familiar handling of the Word, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a light in the darke corners of ignorant mens hearts.</p>
                  <p>First then, It were to be wished, that a Minister were <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> more then a bare reader, hee must bee <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, apt to teach, able to diuide the Word of trueth aright, and must labour for the truely-learned tongue, to bee a prompt Scribe, an <hi>Ezra,</hi> causing men to vnderstand the reading. For if the blinde leade the blinde, both fall into the ditch.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, people must diligently attend to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> things that are taught, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. and not giue ouer till they vnderstand the grounds of Religion. For, first, Faith commeth by hearing and vnderstanding of the Word: the Word truely vnderstood is the seede and parent of faith. Secondly, without this knowledge of God and Christ there is no saluation: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they know thee the onely true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> Thirdly, great is the excellencie of knowledge: <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 13. As the day is aboue the night, so knowledge excelleth ignorance, and wisedome folly: without it there is no walking in the day or in the light; knowledge is more necessary then the day or the Sunne, therfore resist not the means whereby it may be gotten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:18743:184"/>
Thirdly, we must not thinke that we then vnderstand, vvhen we know, or teach men to know that which they <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> did not before: for true vnderstanding stands not onely in speculation, but, first, in the change of the heart. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. then wee behold the glorie of God in the Word, vvhen we are <hi>changed into the same Image from glorie to glorie,</hi> by the Spirit of God. Secondly, in the change of the life to new obedience. <hi>Psal.</hi> 111 10. The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, a good vnderstanding haue all they <hi>that doe thereafter:</hi> whereas without obedience vnderstanding doeth but conuince and lay open to many stripes. Thirdly, when it mingles the word with faith. <hi>Psa.</hi> 119. 66. <hi>Teach me good vnderstanding and iudgement, for I haue beleeued thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Fourthly, when knowledge sets vs forward in glorifying God: for else it is no better then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the heathens, which made them excuselesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause knowing God, <hi>they glorified him not as God, Rom.</hi> 1. 21. and if the heathens were iustly condemned for not glorifying God according to that darke knowledge they had, how much more should our knowledge mooue vs to glorifie God, which else maketh vs more inexcusable, if wee glorifie him not, by giuing him his worship, praise, and honour, and by making vse of all his attributes and mercies, but especially those in his Christ?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A minister must not onely be an instructer by his doctrine, but a leader also by his practice: for <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2.</note> else, first, hee is no guide: for he is a guide, whom wee <note place="margin">A Minister must be a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his life, and example.</note> take with vs to direct vs in a dangerous way: what? a guide and not able to guide himselfe? Secondly, else Gods worke shal neuer go happily forward: for he shall not build so fast with one hand, but he shal destroy with another. Thirdly, their doctrine, which may saue others, shall bee a bill of inditement against themselues; the curse is already vpon them; that seeing, they perceiue
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:18743:185"/>
not; and speaking the word to others, they heare it not themselues; and their doome shall be, Wicked seruant, out of thine owne mouth thou shalt bee iudged. Thou that teachest another, doest not thou teach thy selfe? thou that preachest against couetousnesse, art thou a griper neuer satisfied? or is there a graue in thy heart, neuer full? doest thou preach against drunkennesse, and art an intemperate person, a companion of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards? against lyars, and yet there is no trueth in thine owne wordes? Fourthly, it is a notable marke of an Hypocrite, to doe the same things which commonly he reprooueth in another; and of a bold wicked man, that dares take the word of God into his mouth, and yet hates to be reformed, and if it be in a teacher, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not onely a wicked agent, but also a teacher of iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>All which shewes, that a good Minister must be more then a Preacher, he must bee a doer also, a guide, a good <note place="margin">Vse.</note> man, not a directer onely, but a guide too. Singular holinesse must be written in Ministers foreheads, and special graces in their hearts; they must haue about them not onely the sound of Bells, but the sweet smell of Pomegranates also; they must bee neither bleare-eyed, nor blemished, nor any way defectiue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A faithfull Minister <hi>must euer haue his eye on</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>his flocke, to guide them, and watch ouer them, for their good;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A Pastor must haue his eye vpon his flock to guide them.</note> as a tender mother will not let her weake and tender childe bee neere a place of probable danger, but her eye shall bee ouer it to saue it from perill. From this care Ministers are called watchmen, and are set in their places as watch-towers to espie and preuent danger and enemies: and,</p>
                  <p>First, the estate of men requires this duty from Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, who are weake when they are at the best, apt to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> turne aside out of the way, ready to be seduced and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by others, and prone to be carryed away head-long
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:18743:185"/>
by their owne lusts, if there were no enemie else with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their owne calling enforceth it, being set <note place="margin">2.</note> as Ouerseers of their Congregations, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersee the wayes of their people. Their charge is, to warne the wicked, and to admonish the righteous, if he turne from his righteousnesse; which they cannot doe without the obseruing of both.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they must imitate the chiefe Pastor and shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <note place="margin">3.</note> of soules: the good shepheard calls his sheepe by name, and findes it out if but one of a hundred be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, he seekes out the lost sheepe, bindes vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and strengthens the feeble knees; he loued his sheep to the death, and so true loue is desirous not to leaue a man till it haue set him safe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the danger of not admonishing the people <note place="margin">4.</note> is exceeding great, for they communicate in their sinnes and the curses due vnto them; God wil require the bloud of a sinner that is not admonished, at the watch-mans hand, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18, 20. And hereunto adde the blessing and reward of him, that turnes a man from iniquitie: hee saues the soule of his brother, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 20. and shall shine as the starres in the firmament for euer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine serues to reprooue sundry both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <note place="margin">Use.</note> and people.</p>
                  <p>First, the sin of non-residency is a great sin where there is no iust cause of absence. A minister is tyed to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people, because he must euer haue his eye ouer his flocke: but how can he guide them with his eye, who is continually absent? The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> whose calling made him necessarily absent from some Churches, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he had no rest in himselfe, when he was thus forced to be absent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the peeuishnesse of men is hence discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that will not haue their liues marked, nor their
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18743:186"/>
actions scanned, the Minister must set no eyes vpon them, they will endure no obseruing, no reproofe. Oh, what hath he to doe with me? I will doe what I list for all him. Nay, but he must obserue thy wayes, he must guide thee with his eye, hee must ouer-see thy course, and warne thee out of thy speciall sinnes, and if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder or preuent thy damnation, he must preuent his owne by warning and admonishing thee. Nay, if God haue made euery Christian anothers watchman, and all the godly mutuall Keepers of each other, which is a speciall fruit of the communion of Saints, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in those exhortations, to obserue one another, to prouoke to loue and good workes, and, Let euery man looke on the things of another, &amp;c. much more must the Minister obserue the wayes of his people.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, see hence both the necessitie of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, which God hath erected in the Church, as a guide to heauen, and how vvee should entertayne it: How kindly do Trauellers recompence faithfull guides? How barbarous were it for a man to abuse him that gently guideth him through a dangerous and vnknowne way? and yet, what good guide in the Ministrie meeteth not with such vnnaturall dealing from naturall and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men? so much of the Preface; Now followes the Exhortation.</p>

               <head>VERS. 9. <hi>Be not like the Horse or Mule, &amp;c.]</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN these wordes is contayned the third generall vse of the former doctrine, of Gods free mercy, in iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and sauing the humble and penitent sinner, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon inferring the dutie of humble subiection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto God. This is propounded in a precept de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatorie, disswading from brutish senselesnesse and peruerse obstinacy, which are two mayne lets to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and godly sorrow: and the Prophet layeth it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:18743:186"/>
downe by way of dissimilitude betweene man, to whom God hath giuen a reasonable soule; and Beasts deuoide of reason and vnderstanding, especially such as are in a further degree of stupiditie and dulnesse, then sundrie other of the Creatures be, of vvhich sort he nameth two, the Horse and the Mule, from vvhose nature, Nature it selfe hath taught vs, not to depart onely, but also to abhorre, because vvee are made after the Image of God in knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>The things wherein vve must be vnlike these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are two: First, they are vnteachable; <hi>which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not,</hi> saith the Text; Creatures they are vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of instruction, you can perswade them vvith no Reason or Eloquence. Secondly, they are vntractable, and therefore it is said, <hi>Thou bindest them with bit and bridle, lest they come neere thee:</hi> they are wilde by nature, and if they be not well watcht and hampered, they will bite and strike their owners. Herein must euery man, professing the feare of God, be vtterly vnlike them.</p>
               <p>For the further opening of the wordes, sundrie que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions are to be answered, as,</p>
               <p>First, Why is the Prophet so harsh and sharpe vvith <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1.</note> his Scholers? Are wee not commanded to be soft and gentle vnto all men, and to instruct them with all meekenesse, considering our selues were once deceiued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was directed by a good Spirit, and went vpon <note place="margin">Answ.</note> a good ground: First, he speakes out of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, hee knew vvhat himselfe was a little before, while he hardned himselfe in his willingnesse to keepe his sinne. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22. I was foolish and ignorant, <hi>euen as a beast</hi> before thee. Hee knew the strength of other mens corruptions, the hardnesse of their knots by his owne, and sees they haue neede of as hard vvedges as hee, and yet after a sort makes himselfe a copy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this sharpe reproofe: Be not as I vvas, euen
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18743:187"/>
like the Horse or Mule. Secondly, hee manifests a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fruit of his owne true repentance, that hauing left his sinne, he cannot speake of it but with disgrace, and testification of the lothsomnesse of it; as it is a bad signe of impenitency, when a man can speake any thing friendly of his sinnes past. Whatsoeuer hath much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vs in time past, we cannot name it or thinke of it without dislike. And as hee be wrayes his owne zeale against his owne sinne, so doth he assure himselfe, that all that are truely touched, care not how disgracefully their sinnes be dealt withall. Thirdly, he would checke the pride of sinners who thinke so well of themselues, but in the state of nature are not only like, but farre worse then any of the brute beasts. True humilitie will make a man thinke of himselfe as of the basest creature: Christ gaue the Woman of Canaan diuers checks, and at length he called her a Dogge: Truth, Lord, said shee: shee thought no better of herselfe then so. Fourthly, though our softnesse and meekenesse must moderate our heate towards the sinner, yet must it not abate our heate and zeale against the sinne it selfe: againe, wee must so haue compassion on some persons offending, considering the circumstances of sinnes, as others wee must saue with feare. Further, we must so consider our selues in times past, as wee forget not our selues for the present: Are vvee now healed? then our zeale is more against sinne then euer before, and as zeale increaseth, so doth our hatred of sinne daily. Lastly, whom deales <hi>Dauid</hi> withall, but obstinate and wilfull sinners, vvho are no better then corrupt and brutish nature made them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why doth he name these creatures, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2.</note> Horse and the Mule, and not the Lyon or any other?</p>
               <p>First, because these are best knowne vnto vs, that his <note place="margin">Answ.</note> true meaning might appeare to the meanest, and breake out sensibly in his comparison to the simplest Hearer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:18743:187"/>
Secondly, that in their properties naturall men might see their owne, as, first, these creatures are led by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie, not by reason; no more are naturall men, but led by the same guide. Secondly, euery man sees these crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures lower then that they can rise vp to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and iudgement of humane actions; and so are they in the things of God, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. Thirdly, how often doe these creatures, especially if better fed, lift vp the heele against their Feeder, &amp; neuer or seldome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Owner of their fat pasture? they cast off their Rider and grow insolent; so doe they, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 32. 15. Fourthly, the Horse, longer then the spurre or bit is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, is in no awe: so wicked men, neither spurre nor bridle auailes them to amendment. Fiftly, the Horse, wanting reason to his strength and courage, rusheth fiercely and fearelesly into any danger; so euery wicked man turneth to his race, as the <hi>Horse into the battell,</hi> Ier. 8. 4, 6. Sixtly, the Mule is a creature, not of the creation of God, but against his institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 24. and a wicked man is a degenerate creature, not of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but against his Law, a Mule arising by strange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with Sinne &amp; Satan: there was neuer a wicked man, when God said of all the works of his hands, that they were exceeding good. But we wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fine our speech to those two properties in the Text, of which an on.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas it is said, <hi>Be not like the Horse or Mule.</hi> Whether hath a man free-will and power to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 3.</note> change and conuert himselfe? or else it seemeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is idle.</p>
               <p>Such exhortations argue neither vniuersall grace nor free-will, as the Lutheran Diuines and the Papists hold; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> but haue manifold vses besides, first, in regard of the wicked; to restraine their wickednes, or to harden them as <hi>Moses</hi> his ministry did <hi>Pharaoh, Exo.</hi> 7. 2, 3. or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and make them inexcusable, in that they cannot plead ignorance. Secondly, in regard of the godly, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18743:188"/>
these eyther <hi>vnconuerted:</hi> for with the exhortation, the Lord putteth forth a power to enable them to doe the Commandement in some measure, as when <hi>Peter</hi> spake to the Creeple, and bade him stand vp, at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, a new and fresh power and life came into his ioints and ankles, by which hee was able to rise and walke. or <hi>conuerted:</hi> and then they serue, First, to shew them what they could doe in ADAM, but now are disabled by their owne fault and folly. Secondly, what they can doe in the second ADAM in some measure. Thirdly, what to striue vnto, because God commandeth. Fourthly, to blow vp grace receiued, which is often weake as a smoking flaxe, or as a sparkle vnder greene wood. Whereunto one obseruation serueth, cleane contrarie to the Papists opinion, namely, Wee neuer read of any exhortation, but somewhere it hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise or prayer for it, both which send vs out of our selues: As for example; <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new spirit:</hi> but it is the Lord, that promiseth to giue an heart of flesh, Chap. 11. 19. and DAVID prayeth, <hi>Create in me a new heart, Psal.</hi> 51. 10. So, <hi>Feare God and keepe his Commandements, Eccles.</hi> 12. 13. but it is the Lord that promiseth <hi>to put his feare into our hearts, Ier.</hi> 31. 33. &amp; 32. 40.</p>
               <p>Now from the former propertie of these creatures, which is vnteachablenesse, being <hi>without vnderstanding,</hi> we learne, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a brutish qualitie not to learne our dutie by the Word</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> 
                  <hi>of God:</hi> for <hi>Dauid</hi> here speakes out of his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <note place="margin">A brutish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie not to learne by Gods Word.</note> who while he cherished his sinne, prouoked God to deale with him, as wee doe with Horses and Mules, which being vncapable of perswasion, wee deale not with them with words or arguments, but with bridles, spurres, and roddes; we can make them feele vs, but not vnderstand vs: and this is the brutish propertie of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and of the godly sometimes in desertion, not
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:18743:188"/>
to bee ruled by the voyce of GOD, till his hand set it home. <hi>Prou.</hi> 7. 22. the yong man being taken with the Harlot, and not vnderstanding his way, followes her as <hi>an Oxe to the slaughter,</hi> and as a Foole to the Stockes for correction; till a Dart strike through his Liuer, he sees and knowes nothing. <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22. not hauing learned in the Sanctuarie by the word that point of heauenly wisedome, which might haue sustained him in a sore temptation, confesseth of himselfe, that he was in this point ignorant, <hi>as the beast without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> would not heare the Word of God, while <hi>Daniel</hi> admonished him to breake off his sinnes by repentance: and to shew what a brutish practice this was, <hi>God changed him into a brute beast, not in forme or shape of bodie, but in his vnderstanding and behauiour; hee ate grasse with the beasts, and sorted himselfe with them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeeres, till his vnderstanding came againe, and then hee knew it was the most High that beareth rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balaam</hi> would not bee taught to sit downe by Gods Word, but still hee would assay if in this place, or that, he could curse the people of God: To shew what a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish propertie this was, the Lord by the brute beast, which was vnder him, reprooued him, which saw more then his Master: 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>He was rebuked for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; for the dumbe Asse, speaking with mans voyce, chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the foolishnesse of the Prophet. Ier.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>The Pastors are become beasts, hauing no vnderstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the chiefe part of that glory, which God dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> man withall at the beginning, and wherein his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie was aboue the beast, was in the light and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of his minde: for, being created in the Image of God, which (as the Apostle sayth) stood in knowledge; he did acknowledge God in himselfe, in his word, and workes; he had communion with God, and delight in his will: But now by his fall spoyling himselfe of his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18743:189"/>
vnderstanding, and falling out of his right minde, hee degenerates into the nature of the brute beasts, which neyther doe, nor will vnderstand the will of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. The same speaketh the <hi>Psalme,</hi> 49. 21. <hi>Man being in honour, became like a beast without vnderstanding;</hi> plainely shewing, that his honour aboue the beast was his right vnderstanding, which departing from him, hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and degenerate into the dishonourable ranke of brute beasts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, since the fall, euen the worst men retaine the specificall and common difference betweene man <note place="margin">2.</note> and beast, which is reason it selfe, suppose neuer so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, which when a man forsakes, hee becomes bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, like the brute beast, following lust and appetite, and no other perswasion: and euen so doe they, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they heare the reasons and exhortations of the Word (all which reasons are diuine and of Gods fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,) yet as if they were beasts in the shape of men, their actions proceed from sense and appetite, and haue a brutish beginning; they will not liue by rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, especially renewed; enemies they are to perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; words no more preuaile with them, then with the Horse or Mule which vnderstand them not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, who can deny, (that doth but looke on the externall shape of man and beast) but that GOD <note place="margin">3.</note> hath put a plaine distinction betweene them? One hee hath made with his face vpright, to looke vpward, as hee that should haue his continuall dependance vpon God, and as hee that should communicate with God in his counsels, and attend the wordes of his mouth, and, being of an intelligible nature to receiue and know his will, should yeeld him franke obedience: The other, the beast, the Horse and Mule are made with their eyes and countenance fixed vpon the earth, aboue which they cannot rise or consider any thing: A beast cannot looke beyond things present, or any thing but those that are
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18743:189"/>
                  <hi>ante pedes,</hi> before the feet; it vnderstands not any promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or threats further then it feeles: and is not this the propertie of many men, who are no better then beasts in their vnderstanding? tell them of GOD, of their Creation, their Fall, the Curse of Sinne, the meanes of their Restitution, the promises of Life, and the torments of Sinners, their eyes are fixed wholly vpon earth, and cannot see or discerne any such thing.</p>
               <p>The beast may heare the sound, when wee speake of such things, and these men heare no more, or to no more purpose but to make their damnation iust; they liue for the present; if they feele nothing, they are well enough; nothing that they heare troubles them: And if this be not a brutish propertie, aske the brutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and they will tell thee.</p>
               <p>This teacheth vs to take shame to our selues, and be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> humbled when wee see this to bee our disposition, that wee haue not vnderstood, nor beene warned by the Word of GOD, nor considered of his wayes, but as brute beasts haue been led by lusts and sensualitie while the Lord hath spoken vnto vs; whereby in Gods repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation wee are worthily cut from the account of men, nay thrust farre lower then they; as the Lord often sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his owne people by the brute beasts themselues, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Asse his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Crib;</hi> that is, by much sense and daily good-turnes may bee brought to know their Benefactors; wherein he preferreth them before his people, that by no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, neuer so great or constant, would bee brought to know him. Yea, and whereas nature hath taught the silly birds, <hi>the Crane, Storke, and Swallow, to know their seasons, Ier.</hi> 8. 7. neither nature nor grace hath taught such as professe themselues GODS people, to know God a. right.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this sheweth what men may thinke of such as are vnteachable, and vnwilling to learne the will <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:18743:190"/>
of God: If we frame our iudgement to Gods, wee are to thinke no better of them then of the <hi>Horse or Mule.</hi> Numbers will not bee taught, and as many, who are capable enough in earthly things to reach them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reach others, yet are altogether vncapable of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: both of these, as they haue liued without GOD and his Word all their liues, so they liue still: Well were it for them they were no worse then Horses and Mules; when they dye, their miserie ends; when these dye, their vnhappinesse begins, when Christ shall appeare in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire to render vengeance to all them that know not God, nor obey his Sonnes Gospell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if wee would retaine not the place of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians only, but euen of men, wee must bee perswaded <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> to be vnlike the Horse and Mule, who are without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: We must labour to vnderstand what is the good and acceptable will of God: for which purpose we must vse the meanes to get out of our naturall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and they be these:</p>
               <p>First, because God teacheth by his Word, we must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably <note place="margin">Meanes to get vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> frequent the Ministerie; I say not customably, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scionably: if you should bring your Horse &amp; Mule as your little Dogges to the place of knowledge, you may make them stand or lye quietly, you can make them learne nothing: and doe you your selues no more? the more you heare and frequent meanes without profit, the liker you make your selues to the Horse and Mule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God speakes by his Spirit which makes the Word effectuall, wee must therefore heare the voyce of the Spirit; not the sound of the wordes so much, but the meaning of the Spirit. An Horse or Mule can heare a sound of wordes, but haue no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct sense: and if a man come and heare wordes, and endeuour not to bee led into the meaning of GODS Spirit, hee goes not beyond his Horse in hearing. A beast by much paines may bee taught something of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18743:190"/>
man, which runnes into the senses; and if thou beest onely taught by man, and not by God, that thine eares heare, but the heart which God must teach, bee vnperswaded, thou art not beyond thy beast in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Therefore pray for Gods Spirit to teach thee, hee is the Spirit of illumination, the Spirit whose office is to <hi>lead into all Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, thou must lay vp instruction, hide the word in thy heart, lay vp and binde vp the Lessons in thy soule, not to lose or depart from them: The Horse or Mule by sense will conforme for the present, and doe that they see they must doe, but want vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make vse of that knowledge for time to come: Like to the Horse or Mule are they, that for the present heare, and bee affected, and seeme desirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Doctrine deliuered; but no sooner out of the place but all is forgotten; and all good motions quenched; all the vse of their instruction is confined to the present time, and for time to come is as meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost, as wordes and perswasions vpon an Horse or Mule.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, thou must grow vp in the similitude of the Word thou hearest: the Word must make thee of a man a new man, of a good man a better man; thou must be changed into the Word: It is a Word of Faith, and must make thee a Beleeuer, yea, and the more thou fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentest it, thou must rise in the degrees of Faith. It is a Word of light, and must inlighten the darke corners of thy heart, and giue direction to euery one of thy steps. It is a Word of life, and must quicken thee in the wayes of God, and make thee mooue and actiue in pietie. It is a word pure and holy as God is, and must make thee grow vp in holinesse of heart and life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which thou shalt neuer see God.</p>
               <p>Thus if thou growest not like the Word, thou art not
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18743:191"/>
yet better then an Horse or Mule, who, let them heare neuer such good reasons and perswasions, and by maine strength be brought to conformitie, yet abide the same they were, without any change of themselues: Horses and Mules they were, and so they abide: be not thou like vnto them, let the Word make thee another man, or else thou art; to these ends take with thee a few motiues.</p>
               <p>First, consider God hath made thee a man, and wilt <note place="margin">Motiues to get vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> thou by this propertie debase thy selfe, and equall thy selfe with beasts? Wilt thou being a man put off man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and lay aside thy minde and the powers, which God hath giuen thee to distinguish thee from a beast? Secondly, he hath called thee into his Church, he hath set open his Schoole, he hath sent out his owne Spirit to teach the Elect, so that now thou art willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as they, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. worse then an Horse or Mule, who would know their dutie, but cannot, thou canst, but wilt not. Thirdly, he hath afforded thee his blessed Word, a Word full of wisedome, resembling himselfe, furnished with such varietie of perswasion, as Men and Angels cannot deuise the like; that if this will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee, thou must be no better then an Horse or Mule without vnderstanding, nay worse: for reason cannot perswade them being vnreasonable creatures, but thou being reasonable, the reason of reason cannot perswade thee. Fourthly, if thou wouldest haue a note of thy owne conuersion, thou must put off thy brutish nature, and grow vp in the knowledge of God: <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1, 2. so soone as euer Gods people were conuerted and returned to God, they professe this as a necessarie consequent. Then shall we haue knowledge, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or proceede to know the Lord. And indeede an vnconuerted man is an Horse or Mule, vncapable of this knowledge, it is too high for him, nay, he hates it and spurnes against it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:18743:191"/>
The second propertie, from which we are disswaded in these creatures, is, vntractablenesse: for before these creatures be broken and tamed, they are in their nature wilde and fierce, and can neuer be so tamed that they will obey without bit or bridle: which teacheth vs, that</p>
               <p>The propertie &amp; nature of a wicked and <hi>vnregenerate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                  <hi>man, is, to be obstinate and stiffe against God and his Word,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Euery man naturally is obstinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and his Word.</note> whom nothing but bit and bridle can tame and hold in order. This rebellion and obstinacy is noted in <hi>Cain,</hi> who notwithstanding the Lord spake vnto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued him for casting downe his countenance vpon <hi>Abel,</hi> yet went on stubbornely in his sinne, and could not be reclaymed till he slue his brother. The like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is noted in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whose inuincible stiffenesse was such as no word of God, no plague of God could moue longer then they were as a bit or bridle vpon him: God raysed him vp as an extraordinarie example of an hard-hearted wretch, on whom he would declare his power, to whose degree of rebellion euery wicked man riseth not, but it teacheth expresly what is in euery mans nature, which would discouer it selfe, were it not for Gods grace, either renewing or at least restrayning. The same brutish propertie the Lord taxeth in his own people of Israel, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 16. who for rebellion is called an <hi>vnruly Heyfer,</hi> which, as it is vntamed, rebelleth and suffereth not it selfe to be brought into order by the herd-man, nor abideth among the other Cattell, but breakes out: so Israel would not suffer her selfe to be ranged in the same Orders and Ordinances of God, which he had set vp at Ierusalem, but rebelled, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe, and deuised a new kinde of worship, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing herselfe more like an vnreasonable Heyfer, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of minde and iudgement, then a people whom God had euer chosen to himselfe.</p>
               <p>Hereunto serues the common phrase of Scripture, whereby the cruell &amp; sauage Oppressors of the Church
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18743:192"/>
are resembled by beasts, as the foure great Monarchies, of the Assyrians, Medes, Grecians, and Romans, with beastly crueltie oppressing &amp; eating vp one another, are figured vnder foure great beasts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Lyon, a Beare, a Leopard, and a strange beast with ten hornes: and the vision is expounded, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. These great beasts, which are foure, are foure Kings which shall arise out of the earth. So Rome, being restored by the Pope vnto the tyrannie of the persecuting Emperors, obstinately resisting Christ and his Church, is set out by a great and strange <hi>deuouring beast,</hi> Reuel. 13. 1.</p>
               <p>First, the naturall corruption and power of originall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> sinne, most manifestly discouereth it selfe in a stonie and hard heart, which euery man bringeth with him from the wombe, and by which a man naturally not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth from Gods Image and Will, but stubbornely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth it. This obstinacy is notably described, <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 4. <hi>Thou art obstinate, and thy neck is as an yron sinew, and thy brow as brasse:</hi> Sinewes are instruments of motion, hard indeed, but flexible; but so refractarie is the naturall man, and auerse from God, that he is no more mooued and bended towards him, nor can no more be bended, then if for euery sinew in his body hauing a plate of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, he could moue or bow the parts: And to this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall euill of yron sinewes, come the browes of brasse, which hardneth the wicked, and makes them impudent in euill, as the former makes them impotent and auerse from God: From both which the Scripture denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth naturall men to be <hi>sonnes of disobedience.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, besides naturall corruption there is an habituall hardnesse, and obstinacy, contracted and arising from sundrie causes, as, first, from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of sinne; and as hardly can an habituall and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomable sinner change his course as a Black-Moore his spots. Secondly, custome of sinne takes away both feare and feeling of sinne. Thirdly, want of sense and feeling
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18743:192"/>
of sinne, brings a delight and pleasure in the fruition of it. Fourthly, this delight holds out of the heart all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to get out, nay it holds it in a purpose of retaining the sinne still. Fiftly, this purpose of retaining sinne, doeth purposely resist the meanes, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to encounter and subdue sinne: as, first, the <hi>word</hi> of God: They haue <hi>hated knowledge,</hi> and chused not the feare of God; and <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 11. they haue refused <hi>to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> and <hi>pulled away</hi> the <hi>shoulder.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: so <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Steuen</hi> tells the Iewes, that they had euer <hi>resisted the holy Ghost,</hi> striuing with them in publike instructions, &amp; priuate motions. Thirdly, the <hi>corrections</hi> of God, notwithstanding all which the wicked man falls backe more and more: And commonly these goe together, the <hi>hating</hi> of counsell, and not <hi>profiting by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> as appeares, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
               <p>By these meanes the wicked man hardneth himselfe in euil, and, wheras naturally his heart is of the nature of a stone, himselfe hardens it by these meanes to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the hardest stone: for so it is, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 12. Yea they made their hearts as an <hi>adamant stone,</hi> lest they should heare the law, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Oh then take notice of this hardnes of heart and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> against God and his word, which resisteth and rebelleth against the light of grace.</p>
               <p>God forbid we should be rebels against God. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This obstinacy is in euery man by nature; in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate <note place="margin">Answ.</note> it continues <hi>totall</hi> and <hi>finall,</hi> in the elect <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>partiall,</hi> euen after their calling and conuersion, and it cannot be otherwise: for so long as we carry any carnall wisedome about vs, there will be enmity against Gods wisedome; and so long as pride raigneth, as in the wicked, or moueth and breatheth, as in the godly, it will be lifting it selfe vp in high thoughts against God; and so long as the conscience is euill, as in the wicked, or but in part good as in the godly, it will be desirous to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18743:193"/>
peace with euill, and warre with the word of grace, when it would disturbe it. In a word, so long as any sinne hath any command or power, and so long as the flesh is not wholly mortified (as it cannot bee in this life:) the Spirit shall bee resisted by the lustings of the flesh, because (as the Apostle saith) these two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Great cause we haue therefore to mourne vnder this our miserie, by which we cast off the yoke of God and his gracious regiment, euen as the horse casteth his rider and riseth vp against him. And it will bee a good meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when we see an horse or other brute creature resist and rebel against vs, to think, Oh thus doth my cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nature rise vp against Gods teaching and handling of mee; nay he hath farre more strength then he putteth foorth against me: but I haue no strength, which I haue not vsed against God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs labour to get out of this obstinacy and stiffenesse betimes, lest the Lord giue vs vp to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> by perpetuall rebellion. This we shall doe by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our selues tractable, and laying aside obstinacie in sinne, and by giuing vp our selues to be ruled by Gods word and spirit. This point is so much the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, because the great sinne of these dayes is obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of heart: men cannot plead ignorance, nor want of good means to helpe them out of their sinnes; and yet few or none leaue their sinnes, but wilfully perseuere in them against the word and their owne consciences. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, God hath giuen vs many warnings of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, by many plagues of the highest kind <hi>threatned,</hi> and not a few, and those not insensible, <hi>executed</hi> with seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for all this, we are in generall senselesse, and are resolued to hold our sinnes without humble sorrow and suing to God for reconciliation. And this is rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, of knowledge to depart from the knowne trueth in whole or in part.</p>
               <p>Now to helpe vs out of this sin of obstinacy, consider <note place="margin">Motiues to lay aside obstinacy in sinne.</note> these motiues: first, neither Gods couenant of mercy nor
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18743:193"/>
the least part of it belongs to that man, that obstinately goes on in sinne: for the first condition in the tenor of the new couenant, is, to take away the <hi>stony heart, Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. It is a brand of a man in the state of death, to bee hard and brawnie-hearted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all the hope and expectation of such a man is, euill and mischiefe to meet him at euery corner. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28. 14. He that <hi>hardneth his heart,</hi> shall fall into euill: he may with <hi>Balaam</hi> shuffle from one way into another, but cannot auoid the Angel with a drawne sword ready to kill him. Now what a fearefull and desperate estate is it for a man to goe vnder Gods curse continually, as a man vpon whom sentence of death is passed, and knowes not, but expects euery moment execution? yet so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are some, who harden themselues, that when the parts of this curse are in executing vpon themselues and theirs, they are further hardned still.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, euery sinne is damnable, but yet, not so much sinne, as obstinacie and impenitencie in sinne condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, especially where all good meanes of softning haue been vsed: nothing but repentance cuts off sinne, and that is the only remedy, which by the hardnesse of heart being reiected, the wounded soule dieth irrecouerably.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, while hardnesse and obstinacy continue, no means can helpe or auaile a man to saluation: He cannot pray, because he turnes away his eare from hearing the law: Hee cannot heare the word to doe him any good; for, <hi>To day if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts:</hi> The Sacraments are bane and poyson to him, because he comes with a wicked heart: In a word, no Seruice or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is acceptable but from a broken heart, which hee hath not: therefore hee is like a sicke man giuen ouer by the Phisician.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the longer a man continues in obstinacie, the more he increaseth the wrath of God vpon him. <hi>Ro.</hi> 2. 5. Thou through the hardnesse of thy heart, which cannot
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18743:194"/>
repent, <hi>treasurest vp to thy selfe wrath</hi> against the day of wrath. As if a great malefactor should for twenty or fortie yeeres euery day be carrying a faggot, to make a fire to burne himselfe withall: so the sinner, the longer he continues in his sinne, the greater wrath is layd vp for him, as the more faggots, the greater fire: What a wofull condition were this? but nothing to the fire of hell, the burning of which is fire and much wood, and the wrath of the Lord as a riuer of brimstone kindles it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 33. Is it not a lamentable thing for a man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in that estate, in which hee is continually carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, a faggot to hell-fire to burne himselfe withall?</p>
               <p>Oh but I will repent in the end of my dayes. <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Doe not trust vpon that: for, first, late repentance is <note place="margin">Answ.</note> seldome true repentance; he that repents not till hee be dying, it is to bee feared lest his repentance dye with him. Secondly, the longer a man perseuers in sinne, the longer and more he increaseth the hardnes of his heart, and it prooues daily the harder to repent: euery day addes something to hardnesse of heart; as in the body, a sore, the longer it is delayed, the more incurable it is, so is it in the soule. And thirdly, this thy speech makes as if a man would bee sure to pay his debts by running further in: Know this for a certaintie, that the soules sweruing from God, is like bones out of ioynt, which, the longer they are let alone, are the hardlier set.</p>
               <p>Notes of a man gotten out of his obstinacie, are <note place="margin">Notes of a man gotten out of obstinacie,</note> these: first, pouertie of spirit all our liues for sinne, which is an humble sight and sense of sinne and misery, when a man findes a want of all goodnesse in himselfe, and in an holy despaire of himselfe hee flies wholly to the mercie of God in Christ, longing after it aboue life, and hungring after it aboue all things in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a trembling at Gods word; for these two are ioyned, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. I will looke to him, that is of a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18743:194"/>
contrite heart, and trembleth at my Word; and yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the sharpest reproofes of it; which is ioyned with the former, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 119. 120. I <hi>loue</hi> thy testimonies; My <hi>flesh trembleth</hi> for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy iudgements.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, silent submission to Gods corrections, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 9. I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, because thou diddest it: <hi>Micah.</hi> 7. 9. I will beare the wrath of God, because I haue sinned: we must get into our hearts a patient waiting in all iniuries and wrongs, till God plead our cause.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a mourning vnder the grudgings of our owne hardnes of heart, and that we cannot mourne and get them to through subiection: so did the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou hardned our hearts</hi> from thy wayes? returne for thy seruants sake, and for the tribes of thine inheritance.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a feare of the occasions of sin, and hatred of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of euill, &amp; of the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>Whose mouthes thou doest binde with bitte and bridle:]</head>
                  <p>OVt of these words we may note; that, If a man wil <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> continue indocible and intractable, <hi>God hath his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">God hath a bridle for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                     <hi>bitte and bridle for him, to curbe and hamper him:</hi> If men will be as Horses and Mules, God will deale with them as men doe with Horses and Mules. <hi>Prou.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Unto the Horse belongs a whip, to the Asse a bridle,</hi> and a rod to the fooles backe: God hath rods enough in store, to whip the folly of sinners, otherwise incorrigible: <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 27. If yee will yet walke stubbornly against mee, <hi>I will walke stubbornely against you</hi> in mine anger, and will chastize you yet seuen times more according to your sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Now then, a man walketh stubbornely, when hee regards no admonitions, nor precepts, nor corrections and iudgements to bring him to amendment, as a child
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18743:195"/>
or seruant is then stubborne, when hee will haue his owne wayes, notwithstanding all meanes the Father or Master can vse to the contrary; he intreates faire, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and layes on a loade of stripes, but the other stands close to his owne disordered will; and to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience addes a wilfull and peruerse frowardnesse. But what gets a man by his obstinacie and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against God? why, God walkes frowardly in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against him; his hardnesse of heart hardeneth God against him, his stonie heart brings vpon him Gods brazen hands. And then God is said <hi>to walke stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> when he doth as a stubborne and peruerse man, being mooued against another, vseth to doe: as, first, a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne man seekes all the hurt hee can to him, whom hee spites: so God findes out plagues against sinners, but all in the way of iustice, as the froward man doth not. Secondly, he shuts his eare to all prayer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and will not heare of any reconciliation: so doth the Lord in sinnes of this nature. Thirdly, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to see his harme, and the Lord laughs at a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans destruction, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
                  <p>What be the bridles, wherewith God curbeth obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">Quest.</note> sinners?</p>
                  <p>Diuers: first, his owne <hi>will</hi> and good pleasure, by <note place="margin">Answ.</note> which he lets them sometimes go with the reine in their <note place="margin">Gods bridles what.</note> neckes; and sometimes againe reines them vp at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: for as men by an halter or bridle leade an Horse and other vnruly creatures whither they would not: so the Lords <hi>will</hi> ouer-rules the sinner, and orders him this way or that. <hi>Iudas</hi> was often warned of his sinne of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes, yet he went on obstinately in it; the Lord suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to perfect it, but instantly the Lord ouerma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered him, put his halter about his necke, and made an end of himselfe and his sinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>law,</hi> a part of Gods wil reuealed, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bridle: the law is added because of transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saith
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18743:195"/>
the Apostle, and is giuen, not to the righteous, but to the lawlesse and disobedient, namely, by feares, threats, and the cursings of it to represse and restraine them; that looke as harmefull and vnruly beasts, as Lyons, Dogs, Horses, are tyed vp and chayned that they doe no hurt, so vnruly sinners are hampred by the Law, the doctrine of which is as a Tedder, and the threats as a Curbe to contayne them within some bounds.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods <hi>hand</hi> and power in iudging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging, is another bridle to tame wicked persons, and keepe them from rising vp against him or contemning him. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who would not know who the Lord was, was onely by this bridle ouer-mastered and subdued. This bridle sometime the Lord hampreth the <hi>inner man</hi> and conscience withall, vexing the wicked man with horror, accusation, and despaire, as <hi>Cain;</hi> sometimes the <hi>outward man</hi> with visible iudgements; often by <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> he lets them fall into the hand of the Magistrate, and so he cuts them off; not seldome by <hi>themselues,</hi> by quarrelling, drinking, or intemperance insensibly to slay themselues; and often in desperate impatience and wickednesse, he makes their owne hands their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, to cut off the thred of their liues, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Achitophel.</hi> Nay, this bridle doth not only in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life curbe and hamper the wicked, but eternally in the life to come, and shall neuer be drawne out of their mouthes, to giue them the least ease or hope of an end, when it shall be made as sharpe and cutting as GOD himselfe can deuise.</p>
                  <p>The reasons, why God hath these bridles for indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note> and incorrigible sinners, are these.</p>
                  <p>First, because he is a iust Iudge, and rendreth to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his workes. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 26. With the froward thou wilt <hi>shew thy selfe froward:</hi> that is, thou vvilt by the effects declare another carriage to the wicked then to the godly. Wilfull sinners must
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18743:196"/>
reape as they haue sowne, and drinke as they haue brewed, and haue returned to them according to their owne measure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the declaration of his mightie power vpon the wicked. <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. 29. Senacherib, <hi>Because thou hast raged against me, and thy tumult is come vp before me, I will put my hooke in thy nostrils, and my bridle in thy lips:</hi> that is, because as a wild Horse thou hast tumultuously rebelled against me, <hi>I will bridle thee, and with shame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough leade thee against thy heart from thy enterprises.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, necessitie calls for it: for if God should not bridle and restraine the malice of the Deuill and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, there would be no liuing in the world: for sinne is of that spreading nature, that it would neuer know bound or banke. Neither hath any sinner any bridle or stay in himselfe; therefore God vseth this bridle for the preseruation of the world, and humane societie in it: he hath set vp his solemne Ordinances, of Magistracy in the Commonwealth, and Ministrie in the Church, to represse and bridle sinne and sinners: but when these ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile, or are contemned, his owne hand holding the reynes, checks and controls those who will know nothing else.</p>
                  <p>This should moue vs further to beware of standing out with God, while he gently calleth vs by his Word: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> If we will not heare his fatherly voyce, wee must feele the hand of his seueritie: <hi>If we will not be bended with the rod of his mouth, we must be broken with the rod of yron that he holds in his hand.</hi> Here consider, first, how bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish it is not to heare reason, not to be capable of perswasion, but all that is done must be with bit and bridle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that there is no resisting of God by force and armes, by warre and weapons, but by humilitie, faith, and repentance. Were it not better then, to take the rod of mortification betime into our owne handes,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18743:196"/>
and beat our selues gently, then force the Lord to take the rod of his indignation against vs?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, consider God is the same in his dealing with his Church, and his manner hath alway beene first to warne and admonish the sinner, and wait with patience his amendment, but, not attayning his purpose, he hath alway turned to seueritie; when his <hi>vocall</hi> Word could not be heard, his <hi>reall</hi> Word must. <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 4. 12. how many meanes vsed the Lord to reclaime <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that is, the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi> from her Idolls and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions? but <hi>vers.</hi> 4. they will not giue their mindes to turne vnto their God; hereupon the Lord turnes him to his reall Word, that is, his iudgements, but as one slow to wrath, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. therefore I will be to <hi>Ephraim, as a moth,</hi> &amp; to the house of <hi>Iudah</hi> as a rottennes; that is, by leisure and smaller iudgements beginne to consume them: and if <hi>Ephraim,</hi> now seeing his sicknesse, will goe away still and seeke to others beside me, then I will be vnto <hi>Ephraim</hi> as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and as a Lyons whelp to the house of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (not as a moth:) but in rage teare and spoile, and none shall rescue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 12, 13. the skumme of Ierusalem went not from her, therefore her skum shall be consumed with fire: But why did it not goe from her? Did shee want meanes? No, <hi>I would haue purged thee,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>and thou wast not purged:</hi> therefore now thou shalt not be purged till I haue caused my wrath to light vpon thee.</p>
                  <p>The same is Gods dealing, whether with people or persons: if his Word cannot separate the skum from thee, his fire shall, and if the meanes of purging cannot preuaile, thou shalt haue thy will a while, thou shalt not be purged, but then God will haue his will, his wrath shall light vpon thee. Thou that by Gods Word wilt not be perswaded to leaue thy vaine swearing, the bridle of the Law and the menaces of it, restraine thee
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18743:197"/>
neuer a whit, God hath another bridle of his reuenging hand and power, which will make thee know, that though his patience for the present be great, ye hee wil not euer hold him guiltlesse that taketh his Name in vaine. Thou that art in league with thy drunkennesse and drunken companie, hearest the Word say, that Drunkards shall not come into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: this is no bridle for thee, thou runst vpon head without rule or reynes of moderation and sobrietie; Gods hand and power will bridle thee well enough, when thou shalt drinke the cup of his wrath, mixed for his enemies, and thou being one shalt not auoyd. Thou that art an enemie to the Word, because it is an enemie to thy sinne, and scoffest the profession and professors of Religion, vnder the titles of Heretickes, hearest the Word cursing those that curse GODS people, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> 12. 3. yet this is no bridle nor stay to thee, but thou pleasest thy selfe still in disgracing them: know that God hath his bridle to hamper thee with, and hee will binde thee if thou wert as fierce as a Beare, and thou shalt know it, when Christ shall bee ashamed of thee, and say to thee standing without: In that thou hast scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed one of these that beleeued in mee, thou diddest it to me. Remember <hi>Iulian;</hi> when the Lords bridle was in the mouth of that Monster, hee cryed, <hi>Vicisti, Galilaee, vicisti:</hi> the like shall bee vnto thee, and vnto Sabbath-breakers, Vsurers, Lyars, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, consider the vncertaintie of our liues, no man hath a lease of his life, and if death take vs away in our obstinacie, we perish for euer, as the tree fals so it lyes, as death leaues vs, so the iudgement finds vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this consideration perswade vs to wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and free subiection to God and his Word, lest God <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> bee inforced with the bridle of his might to tame our fiercenesse and senselessenesse: for this is the threatning, that the Lord will walke stubbornely with his owne
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18743:197"/>
people, till their vncircumcised hearts be humbled, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
                  <p>And to the effecting hereof, consider: First, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a reasonable seruice of thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, like that of vnreasonable creatures that doe all by constraint, by the rod and the spurre, but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and cheerefull: All sound obedience to God must proceed from sense of his loue, and this puts life into it; for that which is forced and constrained for feare, is hypocriticall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the subiects of Christ are called <hi>a willing people, Psal.</hi> 110. 3. and those that are inwardly taught of God, worke and obey not by the compulsion of the Law (although the best need sometimes not onely threats, but rods aso, and bitts, and bridles to keepe vnder their lusts:) but the Spirit hath in their generall purpose and course freed them to a voluntarie subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods acceptance of our dutie, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our comfort is in the willing and cheerefull manner of performance: A wicked man may doe the same things with the godly, and go beyond him in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the difference is in the manner and end. God loues and accepts free-wil Offrings; If a man giue, God loues a cheerefull giuer: If a man doe any dutie of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, let him say as <hi>Paul</hi> sayd of himselfe, <hi>If I doe it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, I haue a reward,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17. It is not thanke-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but the worke is lost, when a man is drawne to the duties of pietie or charitie, as a Beare by the ring in his nose, or an Horse by the rod and spurre to his wayes end: GODS loue must bee our spurre, and then wee may looke at the recompence of reward.</p>

               <p>NOw follow the reasons or enforcements of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer precepts, to lay aside brutish senselessenesse and peruerse obstinacie, and they are drawne,</p>
               <p>First, from the great and manifold plagues, which are reserued for indocible and incorrigible persons, <hi>Many sorrowes shall bee to the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from the infinite loue and good will of God towards penitent sinners, <hi>But he that trusteth &amp;c.</hi> And these two reasons are the two parts of this verse, which containes in it the summe both of all the curses of the Law; and of the sweet promises of the Gospell: And <hi>Dauid</hi> as a good Teacher takes the right order, first, hee preacheth the Law, to terrifie the dull and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and then offereth the sweete and gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Gospell to beleeuers: thus <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> makes way vnto Christ, and thus the Lord by Earth-quakes and Thunders prepares men to his still voyce: he that hath felt the breakings of the Law, feeles the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the bindings of the Gospell: If therefore we preach the Law, it is to prepare men for the Gospell, and little know men that shunning the Law they flye from the Gospell.</p>
               <p>First, of the commination or threatning; <hi>Many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes shall bee to the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first we must know what is meant by this <hi>wicked</hi> man: hee is not euerie sinner, but as the Text it selfe notes him out,</p>
               <p>First, an ignorant and indocible person, who is as the Horse or Mule without vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an obstinate person in his sinne, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible person, one whom Gods Word nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18743:198"/>
withall, nor can bee ruled without bitt or bridle. Thirdly, a man that trusts not in the Lord, as the words following shew. The handling of this text is fit in our congregation, wherein not a few of all these sorts be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this man shall haue <hi>sorrow;</hi> the wicked man is euer miserable, though seldome or not euer sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that is, sensible of his misery. Now the wicked tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and seeme the happyest men vnder the Sunne, and it hath troubled the godly, that they haue all to their hearts desire, <hi>Iob.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 1. the rich glutton goes in skarlet, and fares deliciously euery day: But their sorrowes shall bee as the sorrowes of a woman, their delights shall be turned into torments, their laughter into teares. Now all our working on them, cannot bring them to take knowledge of their misery, but they shal one day be afflicted with sorrowes, and shall not so easily turne them off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many sorrowes,]</hi> because of many plagues, and many plagues, because of many sinnes: Many sorrowes in number, many in kinde, many in this life, many moe in the life to come, many within him, many without him, and many on euery side, as the next branch in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition shewes, that God on euery side compasseth his children with goodnesse and mercy. Whence,</p>
               <p>Note the <hi>vnhappy and cursed estate, of euery wicked and</hi>

Behold, my seruants shall eat, and yee shall bee hungry; my seruants shall sing for ioy of heart, and and yee shall <hi>cry for sorrow of heart,</hi> and shall <hi>howle</hi> for vexation of minde, and yee shall leaue your names <hi>for a curse</hi> vnto my chosen. <hi>Reu.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>One woe is past,</hi> and <hi>two are to come:</hi> and Chap. 8. 13. The Angel fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow the midst of heauen, cryed, <hi>Wo, wo, wo to the inhabitants of the earth:</hi> All these many woes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against the wicked of the world, cleauing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Kingdome of Antichrist in the West: or of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:18743:199"/>
Mahomet in the East, Turkes, Saracens, Arabians, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians; and after them to all the wicked that cleaue not to God in the purity of his worship, and in obedience of his word.</p>
               <p>And, that they are onely denounced against them, appeares, Chap. 9. vers. 4. because the children of God are sealed and exempted from them. <hi>Deutron.</hi> 28. 58. 59. If thou wilt not obserue to doe all the wordes of this Law, then the Lord will make thy <hi>plagues wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and the <hi>plagues of thy</hi> seed, <hi>euen great plagues,</hi> and of <hi>long continuance,</hi> and <hi>sore sicknesses and of long continuance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But many are the woes and miseries of the godly, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> and therefore what is it better to bee a godly man then a wicked?</p>
               <p>There is great difference betweene them: for, first, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> these are all mingled with mercy. Indeed a child that is <note place="margin">1. Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wickeds misery.</note> deare to his father, if he runne another way with <hi>Ionah,</hi> must bee whipt and fetcht backe againe; yet the Lord puts not off fatherly affection but remembreth mercy in iudgement, and smiteth with the rods of men, but his mercy he taketh not away: Whereas the sorrowes of the wicked are destitute of all mercy; and no maruell, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their blessings are leuened and sowred, and tend to their bane; through a secret curse of God blowing on them, and blasting them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the godly call not their miseries on them by <note place="margin">2.</note> a trade and course in sin, as the wicked do; but, when for tryall or correction of some slip, God leads them where they would not, they follow him, taking vp the crosse, thereby learning the will of God, prouing what is in themselues, amending that which is amisse, &amp; confirming themselues to euery good work: this cannot the wicked do, who, whatsoeuer they suffer, fall from euill to worse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord deliuers the godly out of all, putteth vnder his hand, and reares them vp, and leaueth them not <note place="margin">3.</note> in the sorrow, till hee haue enlarged their feete, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18743:199"/>
brought them where all teares shall bee wiped away: Whereas he leaues the wicked in sorrow, laughes at it, and suffereth the fire of his iealousie to seaze on them to the bottome of hell.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Lord recompenseth the light afflictions of his seruants with an exceeding weight of mercy, first, in this life, iustifying, sanctifying, beautifying, teaching, feeding, protecting them and theirs. Secondly, in death, bringing their soules to heauen, and laying vp their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies safe till the resurrection. Thirdly, at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bringing both body and soule into the glory of the iust: But these sorrowes of wicked men are farre other, both for number and measure, in this life and afterward much more, all of them void of all mercy.</p>
               <p>And to conceiue aright of them, consider, first, the kindes of them. Secondly, the causes or reasons of them. Thirdly, the vse.</p>
               <p>For the first: these sorrowes are partly <hi>in this life,</hi> and <note place="margin">The kinds of the wickeds sorrowes.</note> partly <hi>after it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, In this life these sorrowes are partly in the <hi>present practice</hi> of sinne, and partly in the <hi>consequent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. In this life.</note> 
                  <hi>fruits</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the very course of a sinner, although Satan present it to him through a false glasse, and it seeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and care to be quite away, yet indeed it is a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and heauie course: for the laughter of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is but in the face, not in the heart, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in laughter the heart is heauie, or hath cause so to bee.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes of a voluptuous course (which most agreeth with the flesh:) is true euen in the passing of it, <hi>It striketh as a Dart through the liuer, Prou.</hi> 7. 23. The same is true in the purchase of other sinnes, as, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. the Apostle noteth of the course taken vp in earthlinesse and carking care after the things of this life, that this man, though hee seeme
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18743:200"/>
to liue merrily, yet <hi>he pierceth himselfe through with many sorrowe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The intemperate person meetes with many diseased dayes and houres of paine and sorrowes, as the Gowt, Dropsie, Palsies, Surfets, which make his life a burden vnto him, so as though the sinner see it not, yet in the practice of sinne there is more gall then honie, and at the best it is but a bitter-sweete: But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, after the sinne is committed, comes a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and more sorrowful sence of it: for, if the best fruits of sin euen in the godly that are renued by repentance, be shame and sorrow; no maruell if the wicked be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and hunted with horrors of conscience, desperate feares, restlesse torments, and be as the raging Sea, which cannot rest: for there can bee no peace to the wicked man, so long as his conscience hath any sense: but, let him goe and ride where he wil, he pursues himselfe with hue and crie; and so long as he cannot runne from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee carries his accuser and tormenter with him; as <hi>Cain</hi> did; and <hi>Baltasar</hi> euen at his Feast was pierced with feares and sorrowes, that made his ioynts loose, and his knes knocke together: so shal Gods hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be on the walles of profane consciences. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorrowes after his sinne, ouertooke <hi>Iudas,</hi> and so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed him, that his heart being not able longer to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine him, his best ease was to hang himselfe? a wofull remedy, not much better then his disease; but such shifts are the wicked sometimes put to, when their sweete meates are recompensed with sowre sawce.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after this life is the consummation of his <note place="margin">2. After this life.</note> sorrowes, euen in Christs appearance: for, all that this life can load him with, is but the <hi>beginning of sorrow.</hi> The parcels of this sorrow shall especially bee in these particulars:</p>
               <p>First, they shall waile and sorrow to see him come in the clouds, whom they haue pierced; he shall bee their Iudge, whose lawes and person all their villanies haue been committed against.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:18743:200"/>
Secondly, in that wofull separation, first, from God in the losse of glory and happinesse; and then, from Gods people; when they shall see <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> and all the Saints in the kingdome of heauen, and themselues shut out; <hi>There shall be weeping and gnash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, Luc.</hi> 13. 28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the punishment of sense, when they shal be wrapped in that cursed sentence, <hi>Depart from mee, I know you not,</hi> when they shall be bound hand and foot, and <hi>cast into torments,</hi> prepared for the deuill and his Angels: which torment is amplified, first, by the place, a prison, a lake of fire and brimstone, a dungeon for the darkenesse, blacker then that of Egypt, where shall bee a perpetuall night; in a word, an hell. Secondly, by the company, the deuill and his Angels, with all the rout of reprobates, Gods deadly enemies, and whom God is a deadly enemie vnto; such as they chose for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in this world, and would not bee separated from, now they shall not. Thirdly, by the exquisitenesse of torment, set out by fire and brimstone, and that which is most terrible to sense; yea, not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but inward also, described by the worme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which as a gnawing griefe, shall eate and fret the heart of the sinner in memorie of ancient and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinnes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in sinfull concurrences, as hatred of God, blasphemie, despaire, cursings; for all the parts of soule and body shal curse the day of their wretchednesse and confusion, when the fire of Gods iealousie, and his hot wrath shall seaze vpon them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in seeing all mercie and pittie excluded, nay, God, and his Saints (whose affection shall be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his:) shall reioyce and laugh at their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this shall breake the caule of their hearts with sorrow.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, in the eternity of their sorrowes, the worme
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18743:201"/>
within dyes not, their fire neuer goes out, but the wrath of God abideth vpon the sinner without all remission or abatement, without any intermission or release, without end or mitigation, not one drop of water shal coole their tongue, and so long as God is God, the smoke of their torment shall ascend vp night and day continually. This is <hi>Tophet,</hi> prepared for the wicked, in which one word how many sorrowes be there?</p>
               <p>Now the reasons to cleare Gods iustice in all these <note place="margin">Reasons of all these sorrowes of wicked men</note> sorrowes of the wicked, are these:</p>
               <p>First, where many sinnes are vnrepented of, there must needes be many sorrowes, euery sinne hauing sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">1.</note> enough belonging to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where an infinite God is offended, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite law transgressed, and an infinite iustice prouoked, <note place="margin">2.</note> there must needes an infinite reuenge be returned vpon the sinners head, and sorrowes in infinite measure bee conceiued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Infinite mercie hath been reiected, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed meanes of saluation neglected and despised, good <note place="margin">3.</note> meanes without in the ministerie, counsell and example of the godly, inward motions of the spirit quenched, yea, some checks of conscience contemned, and some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions deaded and vnfollowed: All these yet bring on more stripes and sorrows, especially in remembrance of hatefull sinnes against knowledge, meanes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is now too late to repent, when these sorrowes haue beset the sinner on euery side; hope of <note place="margin">4.</note> mercie is cut off, the Sunne is set vpon him, the doore of grace is shut against him: now hee can heare no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voice then that <hi>Reu.</hi> 18. 6, 7. <hi>Giue him torments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his sinnes.</hi> Here is an Ilias, an vpheaped measure of infinite sorrow, a mercilesse sorrow without sparke of hope or ioy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, now hee sees with horror and despaire that <note place="margin">5.</note>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:18743:201"/>
which he would not heare of, first, that he hath in his whole course piled vp wrath against himselfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God, whom he thought to be made all of mercy, is a God of infinite iustice, and a consuming fire, and how dreadfull it is to fall into his hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the sentence of death is passed irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerably, and the heauie doome of damnation for such sinnes as he thought to be lighter then a feather.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that himselfe is a vessell of wrath, filled with Gods indignation, that shall seaze on him so long as God is God, seeing Christs bloud can be shed no more, and teares of repentance come now too late, a Sea of them is not able to quench one sparke of this fire.</p>
               <p>First then, let this be a motiue to restraine all men <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> from sinne, seeing it brings such after-claps. If there be any that like the Horse or Mule, wil not vnderstand, nor be perswaded to seeke the Lord, but will obstinately persist, hardning his heart against the Word, for such a man are all these sorrowes prepared. Thou that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in any sinne, open or secret, that wilt drinke with the Drunkard, sweare with the Swearer, and breake the Sabbath after so many admonitions; thou that liuest in pride, wantonnesse, idlenesse, vncleannesse, contempt of God and his Word and Seruants; thou that euery way multipliest thy sinnes, remember what <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 4. Thou multiplyest and <hi>heapest vp thy sorrowes,</hi> euen wrath and fuell for thy selfe against the day of wrath. Thou that canst with a bold face braue out thy sinnes, and glorie in that thy hand is strong to practise vngodlinesse; and canst triumph when thou canst bring others to thy bent; thou shalt one day crie for sorrow of heart, and howle for vexation of spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 14. and curse the day that euer thou knewest thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and with bitter lamentation shalt waile and gnash thy teeth at thy vnhappy condition, and all this in all eternitie. Oh, consider these terrors of the Lord,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:18743:202"/>
and be perswaded to turne to the Lord, seeke in time thy blessednesse in the pardon of sinne, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est escape all these things. Consider the end of all sinne in that one, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. 3, 4. Though it be as an hony-combe in thy mouth, the end will be <hi>bitter</hi> as <hi>wormewood.</hi> And if now thou seest thy danger, but wilt runne on head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vpon all these sorrowes, excluded from all pity and mercy: say thou wast warned; the time commeth, wherein thou mayest be pitied but not helped, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither pitied nor helped, the Iudge hath said it, Behold, I come shortly, and my reward is with me, to render to euery man according to his workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if so many sorrowes, and they of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, belong to euery wicked man, then it followes, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> no sinne is small in it selfe, to euery of which all these sorrowes belong. Our Text plainely teacheth, that they belong not only to Murtherers, Theeues, Adulterers, Lyers, Swearers, but also to ciuill honest men in the worlds account, if they be ignorant of the Word or wayes of God. To him that liues obstinately in any knowne sinne, that holds on for his profit or pleasure any practice condemned in the Word, and in his owne conscience, let him be neuer so ciuill, sober, sociable, peaceable, and harmelesse, all his ciuilitie cannot keepe off these sorrowes, if there be not knowledge of God, softnesse of heart, a teachable disposition, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after Gods mercy in Christ alone aboue all things in the world.</p>
               <p>Where be the Papists, that teach some sinnes to be veniall in their owne nature, when as all these sorrowes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quoad reatum omnia peccata sunt paria, nisi fiat reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> Luther.</note> are the wages of the least? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>vlt.</hi> What meane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their ridiculous distinction of Gnats and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells in the matter of sinne, as though any were in it selfe a Gnat? some indeede in comparison of others are lesser in degree; and lesser in respect of disturbing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie then others; but in respect of God offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:18743:202"/>
the Law, and the Curse, which are all infinite, the sorrowes due to the least are infinite; which Christ must sustayne before he could remooue the least sinne. If a Gnat can be infinite, then some sinnes may be esteemed so many Gnats. How profanely and ignorantly doc they speake, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide these scrupulous fellowes that straine at Gnats and stand vpon such nice points, as if they were the greatest matters, &amp;c? But vvhere Gods Word bindes the conscience, he shall haue least sorrow that stands most strictly in the least things: He that is vnfaithfull in small things, will neuer be faithfull in great; and obserue these fond Haters of strictnesse in small things, ye shall see them stand neither vpon small, nor great things to make any conscience of any, for the most part. Let no man aduenture on any sinne, because it is little: say not as <hi>Lot</hi> did of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one,</hi> and my soule may liue in it? for, let it be neuer so small a mote in thine eye, Gods law makes it a Mountayne: and thy presumption makes it swell, and thy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it vpon that ground, makes increase both of sin and of sorrow; no hole is so little, but vnlookt too will sinke a ship.</p>
               <p>We weigh our sinnes often in a false ballance, and foolishly esteeme them by the matter wherein the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is done: to eate an apple, oh, that is but a small thing, to sweare little oathes, to lie in small things, a little worke on the Sabbath, or a little play and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Lords day, or to gather a few sticks, oh, this is but a trifle. No, take heede of such resolutions, looke into the true glasse, and there see, first, that the person against whom the sinne is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, is infinite in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">A true glasse to see thy sinne in.</note> and power: now a smal thing against a Prince is high Treason.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that thy owne malice and presumption makes a small thing great, as appeares in him that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered sticks on the Sabbath. Wilt thou in so small a
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18743:203"/>
thing incurre the Lords so high displeasure? in other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes we heare often, The lesse the thing commanded is, the greater is the contempt: besides, Thirdly, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the price paid for the least sinne, is the precious bloud of Iesus Christ. Fourthly and lastly, consider the weight of vengeance, and the gulfe of sorrow, into which the least sinne casteth the sinner, being vnsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and vnvtterable. Any one of these, well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, argues no sinne to be small, and much lesse to be ventured on vpon that conceit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if this be the miserable estate of a wicked <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> man then we see plainly that the wicked are not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as they thinke themselues. They thinke themselues the happyest men vnder the Sunne, because of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prosperity, and others flatter them, and <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15 We count the <hi>proud blessed,</hi> and they that worke wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse are set vp, and they that tempt God are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: thus the prosperitie of wicked men often vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settles and offends the godly themselues; but little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should stagger at it: If we can hold the truth of this doctrine, wee shall haue little cause to enuy his happinesse that is a wicked man, vnlesse we can account him happy, for whom the Lord hath prepared such changes and armies of sorrowes. And to see this truth more cleerely, we must know that nothing in the world can make a wicked man happy: for,</p>
               <p>First, it is an error to say or thinke, that iniquitie and <note place="margin">Why no wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man can be happy.</note> peace, sin and prosperitie, can dwell together, seeing the Lord hath said, There is no <hi>peace to the wicked</hi> man, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 21. &amp; the tenor of the promise, is, Acquaint thy selfe with God, and so shalt thou haue prosperitie, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all their happinesse is in outward things. Now all the parts of temporal felicitie are only good in them, which can vse them, as helps and instruments to eternall happines, and that good which is independing. Neither doth the matter, but that which giueth a forme
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:18743:203"/>
to happinesse, make a man happy. Neither is it the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of things, but the happy enioying of them, that can make a man truely happy; which no wicked man can haue.</p>
               <p>Why then doth God giue these things to wicked men? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, to shew his bountifulnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Secondly, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> to shew that these be not things to be esteemed much. <note place="margin">Why God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth outward things to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</note> Thirdly, to be as snares to themselues, and scourges for some others. Fourthly, to reward that little good that is in many of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly notwithstanding this temporall happinesse, a wicked man is for the present the Deuills prisoner: his fetters are indeede of gold, but he is chained to the day of iudgement, which commeth apace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all his flourishes are vnhappy, in that they end in teares and sorrowes: God shall turne his meat in his belly, and make his Sunne to fall at Noone-day: for euery graine of externall ioy, he shall be sure of a talent of eternall sorrow, when the sword of the Almightie shall pierce him. Tell me now, whether if thou sawest this his estate with the eyes of thy body, as thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test now with the eyes of thy faith, thou wouldest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire or pitie such a one. Well were it, if wicked men would weight their present estate with the future: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be a meanes to afray them from many sins, and preuent many sorrowes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if such be the vnhappy state of the wicked, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> what great cause haue the godly <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

How thankefull would
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18743:204"/>
we bee to that man, that would put himselfe betweene vs and some deadly danger? but neuer was there such miserie as this escaped <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 1. The Iewes were so glad of their deliuerance out of the Babylonish capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and their returne thence, that they scarce could beleeue whether it was not a Dreame: Our captiuitie was farre greater, being vnder the Curse of the Law, sold vnder sinne, Bond-slaues vnto Satan, and Sonnes of Wrath: which bondage could wee rightly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our deliuerance would bee farre more gratefull then it is. Our Deliuerer was not <hi>Moses,</hi> not <hi>Ioshua,</hi> not <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> but the Sonne of God, of whom they were Types, both in the first induction of that people out of Egypt into that Land, and in their second reduction backe againe. He by putting himselfe into the Prison of our flesh, and in that flesh by suffering that execrable death, and all the sorrowes of it, freed vs from the guilt of sinne, appeased the wrath of God, abolished eternall death, and destroyed the Deuils Kingdome: Now, the Sonne thus freeing vs, we are free indeed. Oh! the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this deliuerance should astonish vs, whereby we auoid those great and insuperable euils, which otherwise had for euer oppressed vs.</p>
               <p>Now in way of thankefulnesse, First, beware of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe to the seruice of sinne, and obey the precept giuen to the blind man, <hi>Thou art made whole, sinne no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, loue him much, who hath forgiuen so much, <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. 47.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Studie to please him in all things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116 8. <hi>Because thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feet from falling; I will walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the Land of the liuing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, magnifie and speake of this great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and saluation, as the Church did, <hi>Psalme</hi> 126. 3. <hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>io</hi>

               <div type="commentary">
                  <head>But hee that trusteth in the Lord, mercie shall compasse him.]</head>
                  <p>THis is the second motiue or enforcement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian obedience, wherein first consider the meaning of the wordes, <hi>Hee that trusteth in the Lord:]</hi> here is a description of a godly man by a <hi>Periphrasis:</hi> A godly man is not hee that wants all sinne, but he, that being a Beleeuer, manifesteth the fruit of faith in reposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon Gods mercie as the rocke of his safetie.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Church is described, comming out of the Wildernesse, <hi>and leaning on her well-beloued, Cant.</hi> 8. 5. And the people of Gods delight are such as feare God, <hi>and attend vpon his mercie. Mercie]</hi> hee sayth not, <hi>ioy,</hi> as in true opposition he should haue said: for ioy is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed to sorrow, not mercie: but in this Word, First, he both includeth that; and Secondly, he noteth also the ground of the godlies reioycing, which is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, not merit. Thirdly, mercie also vpholds and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues this ioy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall compasse him]</hi> opposed to the many sorrowes of wicked ones: and it noteth, First, a full and complete fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of the godly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the large goodnesse of God towardes them, not giuing them onely one blessing or mercie, or of one kind, but besetting them and meeting them at euery corner with mercies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Dauid</hi> had here tasted abundantly of mercie, and hauing assurance of the pardon of sinne, had experience in his owne person, and here speakes of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant sense of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that being now compassed with mercie, hee would allure and perswade euery godly man to get the pardon of his sinne also, and that is mercie enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:18743:205"/>
                     <hi>Out of this exposition ariseth this instruction, namely, that Hee that trusteth in God, shall haue a plentifull part in the</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Hee that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in God, shall haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> 
                     <hi>mercies of God: mercie shall compasse him. Psal.</hi> 103. 11. As high as the Heauens are aboue the Earth, <hi>so great is his mercie towards them that feare him. Psal.</hi> 125. 2. <hi>As the Mountaines compasse Ierusalem, so the Lord is round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his people. Zach</hi> 2. 5. The LORD promiseth to the Church, <hi>to bee a wall of fire round about her, and her glorie in the midst of her:</hi> Here are euery where mercies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without. And the reasons of this point are these:</p>
                  <p>First, the godly are vessels prepared for mercie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> 9. 23. <hi>Whom God hath chosen to declare the riches of his glorie vpon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, where Gods comfortable presence is there are great mercies, because he is <hi>great in mercie, Isa.</hi> 55. 7. <note place="margin">2.</note> and <hi>rich in mercie, Ephes.</hi> 2. 4. Where the Sunne is, there is abundant light, and where the Sea is, there must bee abundant water. Now Gods promise on his part, and the faith and trust of the godly on their part, holds God present with his people at all times.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the mercie that God sheweth to the godly, <note place="margin">3.</note> is great in kind, because it is a speciall mercie, which is peculiar to them, flowing from speciall loue. True it is, that the Lord is good to all, and his mercie is ouer all his worke, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 9. that is, there is no worke of his hands, which receiueth not from him some mercie: But that is but a generall mercie, as when the Sunne shines on the good and bad, and the raine fals on euery mans ground: by this hee sends away the worst men with good gifts. But there is a speciall mercie reserued for the Elect, and reseruing the Inheritance for them: to these hee is not only a mercifull Lord, but a mercifull Father, a Father of mercies, rich in mercie: <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 3. <hi>As a Father pities his Children, so the Lord pities them that feare him.</hi> A mercifull man pities his beast, much more his brother; but if his childe bee in distresse, his
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18743:205"/>
pitie is more inward and working as his affection is: such is the compassion of God towardes his Children, who is therefore sayd to haue <hi>bowels of compassion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, GODS mercie is great in quantitie and measure, it filleth all the space betweene the Earth and <note place="margin">4.</note> Heauen, and all the distance betweene East and West; <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 11. 12. so as if a man bee betweene Earth and Heauen, or within the quarters of eyther, this mercie must compasse him. <hi>Dauid</hi> shewes the vnmeasurable measure of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 5. O Lord, thou hast made thy wonderfull workes <hi>so many,</hi> that <hi>none can count in order</hi> to thee thy thoughts toward vs: I would declare and speake of them, but they are more then I am able to expresse.</p>
                  <p>For the better cleering of the point, although wee can neuer set out the infinite mercies, with which God compasseth his Elect, yet wee may point at some of them, especially those speciall ones, which are peculiar to the godly, and which like the childrens bread, are not cast vnto Dogges: it faring with the godly, as with a mightie rich man, that knowes no end of his wealth; Though hee cannot haue his eye ouer it all, yet his thoughts sometimes are vpon his goodliest Mannors, his Treasury, his most precious Pearles and Iewels.</p>
                  <p>The kinds of this mercy towards the godly concerne eyther this life, or the life to come.</p>
                  <p>The first and chiefe mercie, the fountaine of all, is, that euen in this life God hath pleased to afford vs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Mercies intay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the godly.</note> the chiefe good; that himselfe is become our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 5. and that the soules of his people can rest and stay themselues in him alone, and ioy in the light of his countenance, when the World doth what it can to make them miserable. <hi>Psalme</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom haue I in Heauen but thee? and whom haue I in comparison of thee? My flesh faileth, and my heart also, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer.</hi> Now can an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:18743:206"/>
euer reioyce in God? or, what comfort can he haue in God, who is not in couenant with him? heere then is a speciall mercy, without bound or banke, euen infinite as God himselfe is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from hence flowe all other mercies that we enioy as streames of it: first, <hi>temporall,</hi> concerning this <note place="margin">1. Temporal.</note> present life, as health, life, liberty, wealth, peace, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, good name, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Oh but the wicked haue all these.</p>
                  <p>True, but, first, not in a right tenure, they are vsurpers, <note place="margin">Obiect. Answ.</note> they haue no right in themselues, no part in Christ to recouer it. Secondly, not by vertue of any promise or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. Thirdly, not in any holy or sanctifyed vse: for, To the impure all things are impure. Fourthly, none of their prosperity is ioyned with Gods loue, but his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, which is a secret poyson in them: whereas, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 27. the Lord loueth the <hi>prosperitie of his seruant;</hi> he ioynes them both together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>spirituall things;</hi> euen in these also how hath <note place="margin">2. Spirituall.</note> God compassed vs with mercies euen for the present?</p>
                  <p>First, What a world of mercy was, and is in that one gift of his Sonne, to bee our reconciliation, when we were firebrands of hell, that the blessed Sonne of God would descend from the glory of heauen, and giue himselfe to the death of the Crosse, and the paines of hell, to redeeme vs from all iniquitie? The Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues of this as of a rich mercy, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. by whom (saith he) we haue redemption through his bloud, euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes according to his <hi>rich grace.</hi> This is the com passing mercy meant in our text, euen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from sinne by Christ, both from the guilt and punishment of it; a free mercy, a full mercy, an Ocean of mercy, drawing vs out of a gulfe and bottomlesse sea of sorrowes euerlasting. <hi>Dauid</hi> amplifyeth this mercy, <hi>Psa.</hi> 86. 13. <hi>Great is thy mercy towards mee: for thou hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered my soule from the lowest hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:18743:206"/>
Secondly, What an infinite mercy, peculiar to the godly, is that of his spirit to take vp our hearts for his temples, when wee were spiritually possessed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? by the same spirit hee doeth daily cleanse vs, and wash vs, and beautifyeth our soules with heauenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; teacheth vs, leadeth vs into all trueth, comforteth vs with heauenly consolations in all distresses. What a great mercy was it, when Christ opened the eyes of the blinde, or healed the deafe and lame, yea or when hee raised <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead? but God, regenerating vs by his Spirit, doeth all these for vs: he giues sight to vs being blinde, sayth to our deafe eares, Be open, yea restores vs to life being dead in trespasses and sinnes, and makes vs able to mooue and stirre in good wayes. Those great workes of the Sonne of God were all mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; but heere is a miracle aboue them all, yea one mercy consisting of many miracles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What a mercy is it, not onely to giue them his word (as hee doth also to the wicked) but also to make it the <hi>immortall seede</hi> of their new birth, and the <hi>syncere milke</hi> to feede them? to make it a preseruatiue from many great sinnes, which the wicked daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, open and secret? to put it into their handes as a sword to cut off Satans temptations? to make it vnto them a rule of faith, and a rule of life, able to make the man of God perfect to euery good worke? to make it a sound stay and comfort, to support them in all their troubles; wherein else they must needs sinke? In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the child of God is compassed with a multitude of mercies, all which the wicked are strangers vnto.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What an inexhaust treasure of mercy is it, that the godly enioy? that whereas God heareth not sinners, that is, wicked ones, he not onely giueth them leaue to come freely to the throne of Grace, to aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good thing for them, but also much assurance in their soules of obtaining any thing they aske, because of his
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18743:207"/>
promise, <hi>Aske, and yee shall haue.</hi> If earthly fathers can giue good things to their children, much more will our heauenly Father giue, not onely what we aske, but euen abundantly <hi>aboue that we are able to aske or to thinke, Ephes.</hi> 3. 20. Can that man bee other then beset with mercy, who hath a meanes to get within Gods store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and treasury when hee will? Can hee, that is able by the prayer of faith with Israel to preuaile with God, want abundance of blessings? Great is the power of feruent prayer for mercy: It can obtaine and force the sunne to stand still; It can commaund the cloudes to raine, or not to raine; It can get children for the barren, and life to the dead; and if our prayer be weake, Christs intercession hath power enough for vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 22, 42. Oh that wicked men knew the power of prayer! how quickely then would they come to Gods mercy-gate?</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, What a mercy is it, peculiar to the Saints, to haue peace of conscience, and ioy of their estate? that whereas wicked men are often vexed; euer lyable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite horrors, feares, and inward torments, which are the beginnings of hell, they beeing iustified by faith, haue peace with God, the spirit of bondage and feare and tumult is gone, and the spirit of adoption dwells in their hearts, which makes them cry, Abba, Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. And whereas the wicked haue no peace, but a senslesse vnfeelingnesse of their estate, the godly haue peace in them, which (as the Apostle saith) passeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; because, first, neither can the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of man sufficiently conceiue it. Secondly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the vnderstanding of man sufficiently esteeme or prize it according to the worth and value of it: plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying it to bee such a mercy, as for the greatnesse ouerwhelmes him that hath it, an infinite and vnboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mercy, called the <hi>peace of God,</hi> which hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and maintaineth heere, and perfecteth and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for all eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:18743:207"/>
But how standeth this with all those euills and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with which the godly are beset in this life? Can they <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> be beset both with misery and mercy too?</p>
                  <p>This is a sixt and last mercie therfore special to them, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> that they are neuer more compassed with mercie, then <note place="margin">Godly neuer more compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed with miserie.</note> when they seeme most miserable. <hi>Habak.</hi> 3. 2. The Lord in <hi>iudgement remembreth mercie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, first, nothing is properly euill but that which comes from diuine reuenge: but nothing comes so vpon the godly: Christ hath carried away all the reuenge of their sinnes; so that their crosses come from mercie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are attended with mercy; for God hath first fitted his seruants for afflictions, before he brings them: Religion hath patience, which, if the house be not filled with plenty, makes a sallet of green herbs more daintie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sweetest dishes of wicked men; it hath strength, aboue which the triall shall not be; it hath subiection and silence to God, and can blesse him both in giuing, and in taking away. Thirdly, Gods mercy reioyceth in iudgement against iudgement, three waies; first, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himselfe: secondly, training his chosen: thirdly, teaching others: and all by the troubles of his children.</p>
                  <p>The first in two respects: first, when iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at Gods house, he declares his hatred against sinne, and mercifully by them forewarnes the wicked of their danger: For, if iudgement begin there, where shall the wicked appeare? Secondly, hee most manifesteth his power in his childrens weakenesse, in supporting their soules and bodies: Now if his power and mercie were not aboue the iudgement, they should perish in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he traines and betters his children, which is great mercie by the iudgement: first, he scowres and purgeth their sinne; afflictions are as Gods laundrie, wherin his children by beating, scowring, and rubbing are made whiter and whiter. Venimous creatures breed not in winter, nay, a sharpe winter kils the Vermine; so
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18743:208"/>
afflictions nip and stay our corruptions: This is another mercie aboue the iudgement. Secondly, by them hee exerciseth and stirreth vp the grace that is in them, as the winde blowes vp the sparkes of fire, yea, manifests the synceritie of their hearts to themselues and others; for a man is that indeed which he is in triall. Thirdly, he fits them by afflictions, to comfort others in triall with the same comforts wherewith hee hath comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. A great mercie to fit them to mercifulnesse, and to set out Gods mercie to others: See <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 9. Fourthly, he teacheth them to esteeme more of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in the want of them.</p>
                  <p>Is there not an ouer-ruling mercie in all this, that whereas afflictions are in themselues euill, and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of sinne, yet they make the godly better? now, whatsoeuer makes vs better, is from a hand of mercie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord by his seruants trouble would <note place="margin">God offreth to teach vs many things by the troubles of his seruants.</note> teach all: first, that the euils, chiefly esteemed so in the world, are not so indeed; for the godly are exempted from the greatest euils; if only wicked men were blind, blindnesse would bee thought a fearefull iudgement, therefore (to confute that) <hi>Isaac</hi> must bee blinde. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how such euils should be borne. It is a mercie, that by the godly the world may bee taught how to beare the hand of God. Thirdly, an infallible marke of the resurrection, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. 25. Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy good things, and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> euill things, therefore now hee is comforted, and thou art tormented. Fourthly, that all their miseries end in mercie, and are turned to their best: Marke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the godly man, for his end is peace; his light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are recompensed with an eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. From all which we may conclude, that if godly men in the midst of their miseries, bee so compassed with mercie, in the beginning, carriage, and conclusion of them, that the doctrine propounded is most true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:18743:208"/>
But if we turne our selues to the second branch, and <note place="margin">Mercies mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs in the life to come.</note> consider those kindes of mercies which shall meete vs in the life to come, we can looke no way but we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched with such mercies, as eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither can enter into the heart of man to conceiue, much lesse can wee speake of them as they are, but must breake out into <hi>Dauids</hi> admiration, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 9. <hi>O how great is that goodnesse which thou hast layd vp for them that feare thee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet as <hi>Moses</hi> wee may see the good land a <hi>farre off,</hi> and with the searchers let you see by a cluster or two, and giue a taste of the good things therin: If God loue vs (sayd they) he will bring vs vnto it; so many as God loueth, shall be brought to it, and, not onely taste (as here) how good and gracious God is, but shall drinke plentifully of the riuers of his house: for with him is the Well of life, and in his light wee shall see light.</p>
                  <p>First, how can the Elect but be compassed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">1. Priuatiue.</note> when all the miserie and sorrow, with all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and effects, wherewith they are now compassed, shall be abolished, and vtterly chafed away? Now we are vexed with the remembrance of euils past, with the sense of euils present, and with the feare of euils to come: but all these first things must passe away, and all teares must be wiped from our eyes. In our bodies, all weakenesse, naturall infirmitie, sickenesse, labour, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and corruption shall bee remooued: they shall need neither meate nor cloth, for which here we toyle so much, nor Marriage, nor Physicke, nor sleepe: there shall be no care for the familie, no toyle in the calling, (for they rest from their labours:) no labour spent in teaching or learning, in preaching or hearing: morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath put on immortalitie, and death being destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it can dye no more. The soule shall be from all sinne and sinfull passions, from ignorance, vnbeliefe, pride,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:18743:209"/>
enuie, and all the workes of the flesh; yea, not onely from sin, but from the power of sinning; the will hath no freedome to euill, being perfectly freed to good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the affections set themselues vpon any other obiect. In our names we are now lyable to many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, and reproches, and slanders, as our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was numbred among the wicked. Hee was not knowne, no more are wee: but then shall our innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie breake out as the light, and it shall be manifest what we are. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>When Christ our Head shall appeare, we also shall appeare with him in glory.</hi> Now wee are in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall combat, but then wee shall bee perfectly freed from the deuil, from his Angels, from sinne and sinners, from the world and the lusts that are in it, and God shall fully and finally tread Satan vnder our feete.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If wee be so happie in Priuatiue mercies, <note place="margin">2. Positiue.</note> what shall we be in Positiue? how shall we be compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them?</p>
                  <p>First, how shall wee be beset with mercie, yea, and glory, in enioying the immediate fellowship and vision of God, in whose face is fulnesse of ioy, and at his right hand pleasures for euermore? If a man had all the paines of hell vpon him, this blessed vision of God would make him an happie man. We see God now, but as in a glasse, and yet that sight of him vpholds vs in all our troubles: how much more shall we be fully happy, when we shall see him as he is, face to face? euen so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as, being glorified, we shall be capable of: So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mercies compasse the Elect in this one, as, if I had a thousand tongues, and should doe nothing but speake them till the day of Iudgement, I could not recount them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what a wonderfull mercie shall compasse vs in our immediate vnion and coniunction with Christ our Head, by which we shall be like him? not like him as he was a man of sorrowes, and in the shape of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18743:209"/>
(for thus he was like vs:) but like him as hee is now, the glorified Head of his Church; not equall to him, but like him, both in soule and body. Our soules <note place="margin">Similes non pares.</note> perfect in knowledge, holinesse and righteousnesse, and standing in a perfect image of God, like to the perfect holinesse of Christ himselfe. Our bodies clothed with beauty, strength, shining, agilitie, and glorie as his is; He walketh in white, so shall wee; His face is shining and glorious, so shall ours; As hee sits on his Fathers Throne, so shall we sit with him in his Throne, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 21 If the hungring after this vnion make vs blessed, what shall the enioying of it doe?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Who can tell or reck on the summe of those mercies that we shall enioy in respect of that glorious inheritance of the Saints in light? when wee shall bee heires annexed with Iesus Christ, not of a House, or Mannour, or Lordship, but of a Kingdome; and that not an earthly Canaan, flowing with milke and honie, but of a Kingdome passing all earthly Kingdomes and inheritances, in those foure properties which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expresseth, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. first, Immortal; secondly, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled; thirdly, Not withering; fourthly, Reserued for vs in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Here is the crowne of all mercies, amplified in these respects: first, in that it is prepared by God from the beginning of the world. Secondly, from the place, which is the pleasant Paradise of God, the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, the Citie of God, full of peace, sweetenesse, and safetie. Thirdly, from the company, God and Christ, the holy Angels, the Spirits of iust and perfect men that euer haue liued or shall liue. If it bee an honour to liue in the presence and fellowship of honourable persons vpon earth; how much more, to enioy the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious presence of God, and the glorified Saints of God in heauen? and yet this honour haue all his Saints. Fourthly, in respect of the conueniencie and sufficiencie
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18743:210"/>
of all things to be be desired; there can be no want; for <note place="margin">The absolute sufficiencie of future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> God shall be all in all: as,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Stately habitation, Ioh.</hi> 14. 2. In my Fathers house are many Mansions, and I goe to prepare you a place: it is a lightsome Citie; for the Lambe is the light thereof, <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Foode</hi> fit for great personages; the Tree of life which is in the middest of the Paradise of God; they shall eate of that <hi>hidden Manna, Reu.</hi> 2. 17. and their drinke shall be of the water of the <hi>Well of life;</hi> so as, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 6.</note> being without all bodily meate and drinke, they shall neuer hunger not thirst any more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Apparell;</hi> long <hi>white Robes,</hi> washed in the bloud of the Lambe, such garments, as great Princes vse. Their Pysicke is the leaues of the Tree, which cure the Nations.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and sweete repose in the bosome of our Father, where children take greatest delight, and ioy in the presence of the Lambe. If the wise men, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the Starre of Christ, reioyced with great ioy, how much more shall wee, seeing himselfe, and that in his glory and aduancement? oh, what ioy and delight shall there bee in the Kings marriage, and in the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of so many good friends together? Adde hereto the testification of ioy, when, as at such meetings there are the voyces of singing men and singing women; the Saints shall sing a <hi>new song,</hi> euen the song of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the Lambe, <hi>Reu.</hi> 5. 9. and there shall be the musicke of Harpes, and Viols; that is: all kinde of heauenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie and harmony, such as the sweetest musicke may not be compared vnto: through our peace with God, and his Angels and Saints, and perpetuall peace from Satan and wicked ones. Our ioy shall not be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by losse of any friend, nor feare of any enemie.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Wealth.</hi> In Salomons dayes gold and siluer were as the stones in the streets of Ierusalem, but heere
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:18743:210"/>
the walls and pauement of this new Ierusalem, and all is beaten gold: no Saint shall know the end of his wealth, euery one shall confesse his lines to be fallen in a goodly ground, and that he hath a goodly heritage, euery child of God is now in Gods treasure-house, and what can he want? Oh that our eyes were open to see the riches of this glorious <hi>Inheritance of the Saints!</hi> as the Apostle prayeth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Authority</hi> and glory, noted by sitting on <hi>Christs Throne,</hi> by the <hi>Crowne</hi> of righteousnesse, a <hi>Crowne of life,</hi> the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of our Father, the <hi>Kingdome vnshaken,</hi> wherein all shall bee Kings and Priests to God.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Continuance</hi> of all: it is an eternally weight of glory; for quantity a weight, for quality eternall, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. I will make him a <hi>pillar</hi> in the house of my God, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 12. I will not <hi>blot out his name</hi> out of the Booke of life, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. Heere is eternall soundnesse, and sound eternity.</p>
                  <p>Doeth the Lord thus compasse the godly with such <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 1.</note> mercies? Oh then labour to be godly men, and such as trust in God, to whom all these precious promises are made. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 6, 7. Oh how excellent is thy mercy? therefore the children of men shall trust vnder the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thy wings.</p>
                  <p>Oh but then all shall bee well, if all these mercies <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> shall compasse him that trusts in God; for, who trusts not in God?</p>
                  <p>Take heed thy trust prooue not presumption, try thy trust before thou trustest vnto it, try it by these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, It hath a constant course and proceeding in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, which no trouble can dismay or breake off. <hi>Psa.</hi> 44. 17. 18. All this is come vpon vs, yet do we <hi>not forget thee,</hi> our heart is not turned backe, nor our stepps gone out of thy paths. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Therfore we <hi>labor and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, because we trust in the liuing God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:18743:211"/>
Secondly, a faithfull endeuour in the meanes that serue Gods prouidence, there are none so diligent therein as they that trust in God.</p>
                  <p>If thou trustest in God as thou sayest, then thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, beleeuest, and practisest the word; thou shewest thy selfe a child of God and of the Church: else, say what thou canst for thy selfe, and compare thy selfe with the best, thou trustest not in God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if thou trustest in God, thou withdrawest thine eyes from thine owne, and all other inferiour meanes, and canst as quietly waite vpon God in want of meanes, as in hauing them, and hauing them, art as if thou hadst them not: Thou art farre from leaning vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine owne wisedome, if thou trust in the Lord. <hi>Prou.</hi> 3. 5. Bee not <hi>Wise</hi> in thine owne eyes, but trust in the Lord: thou art resolued, that if the Lord helpe thee not to thy hearts desire, all the helpes in the world cannot doe it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if thou hast not the meanes, thou thinkest the Lords mercifull promise is meanes enough, thou discomfitest not thy selfe; nor in defect of meanes fretst thy selfe how to compasse them: as the eye of the maid is vpon the hand of her Mistresse, so thy soule atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and waiteth vpon the hand of God. If thou trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, thou first beleeuest, and if thou beleeuest, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest not haste.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, looke what it is, in which thou trustest, that hath thy heart, thy affections of loue, ioy, and desire aboue all things; if it be God, then thou hast made God thy God, and onely portion: the voice of the Church is, This <hi>is our God,</hi> and <hi>wee will waite on him. Abraham</hi> trusted in God, when he preferred the commandement of God before <hi>Isaaks</hi> life: so if thou preferrest the pleasing of God before thy chiefe ioy, and grieuest most when thy heart is ready to make any thing thy portion but God; and when by sinne thou hast prouoked him to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18743:211"/>
hide his face or stand aloofe from thee, then say thou trustest in God, and not before. True it is, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue some failings, and slidings from these rules, but yet hereunto they striue, and in some comfortable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure attaine.</p>
                  <p>Now if these bee the practices and qualities of such as mercy belongs vnto: wee see easily by the contrary, that there bee sundry kindes of men, to whom the Lord doth couenant wrath, as,</p>
                  <p>First, many ciuill men who content themselues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of God: they say they meane well, and doe no man harme, liue in peace with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and follow their Church as others doe; yet haue no care of religion but for fashion; they say they trust in God, but doe not, because they vse not the meanes, nor walke in the way of faith and repentance, nor in the conscionable hearing and obeying of the word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, such as walke stubbornely against God, and the meanes of Saluation, mercy belongs not to these.</p>
                  <p>How know you that?</p>
                  <p>Well enough: first, out of the text, which saith, Mercy belongs to him that trusteth in God: Now he that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in God, walketh on in a course of godlinesse, and cannot stand out against God. Secondly, by an expresse text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 20. He that heareth the curses of this law, and yet blesseth himselfe, saying, Though I walke in the stubbornnesse of my heart, the sword shal not come neer me, <hi>I will not be mercifull to that man,</hi> saith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, heere is a great comfort for the godly, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> who haue no small security hence, that whatsoeuer their outward estate is or may bee, Gods mercy compasseth them as the hilles compasse Ierusalem: see it in some instances:</p>
                  <p>First, If Satan assault vs on euery side with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to vex and disquiet vs with inward feares, he shall
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:18743:212"/>
not haue so nimble eyes to spy our weaknesse, as the eye of the Lord to spy meanes to strengthen vs. Let him obiect the greatnesse and infinite number of our sinnes; yet hee shall but amplifie the great mercie of GOD which is greater and more large then all the sinne and miseries in the world. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> comforteth GODS people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 31. <hi>The Lord thy God is a mercifull God, he will not forsake nor destroy thee, nor forget the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of thy Fathers, which he sware vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If vnmerciful men compasse them and come about them like Bees, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 12. and sharpen their stings, yet the mercies of the Lord are neerer them, then that they can hurt them. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 14. 15. <hi>O, Lord, the proud are risen against mee, but thou Lord art strong, and mercifull, gracious and long-suffering, and a pitifull God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If a man should conflict with Gods owne hand, by inward temptations or outward tryals, of sicknesse, pouertie, persecution, if hee were so beset as hee could see nothing but troubles without, and feares within, now is the time to mound and fence himselfe with this comfortable Doctrine, that euen now GODS mercies doe guard and compasse him; seeing he cannot deny himselfe, nor faile of any of his promises. <hi>Dauid</hi> when he was to chuse one of the three Rods of GOD, the Sword, Famine, or Plague, he chose to fall into the hands of God, because he is mercifull, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
                  <p>Hee may afflict and chasten vs a while, and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seeme to forsake vs, but with great compassions he will gather vs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 7. 10. For, Hee chides not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, neyther retayneth hee his wrath for euer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If a man were in the hands of Death, and the Messengers thereof had already taken hold on him, as on <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> yet, euen then hee need feare none ill, seeing Gods mercies compasse him: this is euer our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:18743:212"/>
though wee cannot alwayes see it, as <hi>Elisha</hi> his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant saw not the great mercies of God compassing him and his Master; euen then when we know not, GODS mercie is all about vs, there are still more with vs then against vs, our Mountaine is alway beset with Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Warriours.</p>
                  <p>Was <hi>Ionas</hi> euer more compassed with mercies then when he was in his owne sense cast off, and compassed with Waues and Weedes? Was Israel euer more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with mercie, then when they were compassed with Mountaines, Sea, Enemies, Death, and deadly things? these our extremities are Gods oportunitie.</p>
                  <p>Nay, fiftly, suppose a man were in the house of death, in the graue, yet, euen this separates not from GODS mercies, which being eternall leaue vs not in death, but, when we are most compassed with dust and corruption, shall then bee most abundant and mightie for vs.</p>
                  <p>Oh, therefore let so many as trust in God flye in all their straits to this Sanctuarie, which can make not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deaths forerunners, but euen Death it selfe welcome, which depriues vs of all things else but this mercie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the full estate of which it setteth vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, labour aboue all things in the World to get <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 3.</note> part in this mercie, by getting assurance of the pardon of sinne; get this, and thou gettest a mercie reaching vp to Heauen, a Crowne of Blessings, a plentifull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Our Prophet here cals it a compassing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: for a godly man thinkes not himselfe compassed whith mercie, when hee is compassed onely with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blessings, when GOD hath hedged about his house, and hee hath wealth to tumble in (though the World breathe after nothing else:) but when he hath a voyce telling him, that God in Christ is mercifull to his sinne, and hath couered his iniquitie: oh, now thinkes <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe compassed with mercie, and not before, although hee was a King, and had all outward things
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:18743:213"/>
to his hearts wish. <hi>Zacheus</hi> had mercie enough when sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation was come to his house, hee neuer got so fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as now hee forgoes and restores, hee was neuer compassed with mercy till now, though he was a great rich man, neuer so rich as now when hee was impoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing himselfe to entertaine Christ in his house and heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iaakob</hi> when hee saw <hi>Iosephs</hi> face, his best beloued sonne, <hi>Now</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>I haue enough, let mee now dye, seeing I haue seene my sonne Iosephs face:</hi> How much more shall wee haue enough to see the face of the well-beloued Sonne of God, yea and of God himselfe, in that wel-beloued one, appeased and fully pacified! <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> hauing seene Christ with his eyes, and held him in his armes, <hi>Now, Lord,</hi> (sayd hee) <hi>let thy seruant depart in peace; for mine eyes haue seene thy saluation:</hi> But to see Christ by the eye of faith, and hold him in our hearts, will make death much more welcome to vs; we shall thinke we haue enough: the sweet sense of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in will frame the mouth to speake plentifully of it, as our Prophet doth in this place. Neyther can any good heart eyther lightly account or speake slenderly of such a mercy, neyther content it selfe with slight meanes to get it, or with superficiall phrases in holding it. In a word, if once we can claspe hold on this mercy of God in pardoning our sinnes, we could desire euen to liue no longer in this World, were it not to come to a more full sense and fruition of it.</p>

               <head>VERS. 11. <hi>Bee glad, yee righteous, and reioyce in the Lord, and bee ioyfull all yee that are vpright in heart.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THese words containe the fourth and last vse of the generall Doctrine, and a conclusion worthy the <hi>Psalme,</hi> to which it is notably fitted: for seeing the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:18743:213"/>
whole <hi>Psalme</hi> hath taught vs, that hee is a blessed man, whose sinnes are remitted and couered, then may and must that man, who hath this Doctrine sealed vp in his owne heart, reioyce with great and vnspeakeable ioy. And as it notably concludeth the whole <hi>Psalme,</hi> so is it most aptly knit to the former wordes, which haue layd downe the diuers estate, both of the godly and wicked man, and how, when as sorrowes eate vp and consume the vngodly man remedilessely, the portion of GODS people shall bee his owne compassing and infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and therefore vpon those premises hee inferreth this sweet conclusion, that the godly hauing so sound cause of Christian ioy, must mind, yea and ouercome all their sorrowes with an holy and Christian reioycing in the LORD.</p>
               <p>In the Verse are three things to bee considered: first, the persons to whom this precept is directed, described by two titles, first, <hi>righteous:</hi> secondly, <hi>vpright in heart.</hi> Secondly, the Commandement, <hi>to be glad, to reioyce, and be ioyfull.</hi> Thirdly, the obiect of their ioy, and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>In the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, of the meaning. Hee that is called in the sixt Verse a godly man, and in the former Verse one that trusteth in God, is here also set forth by two inseparable properties; first, hee is a <hi>righteous man.</hi> And secondly, <hi>vpright in heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who is this righteous man?</p>
               <p>A man is righteous by righteousnesse, eyther <hi>Legall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quest. Answ.</note> or <hi>Euangelicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Legall</hi> righteousnesse is that perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in nature and actions, which the Law of GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, euen perfect and full conformitie with the whole rule of righteousnesse, as it was first written in mans heart by the law of nature. By this was neuer man righteous but the <hi>first Adam,</hi> in the time of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and the <hi>second Adam</hi> the innocent Sonne of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:18743:214"/>
God, in whom, besides the righteousnesse of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature and life, wee read of the righteousnesse of God, that is: the same righteousnesse, being in a person that was God, was so farre aduanced, that it was able not onely to fulfill, but to satisfie the rigour of GODS most righteous Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Euangelicall</hi> righteousnesse is that, which the Gospell reueales, and that is, when a man being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, iustified by faith, deliuered from all the guilt and punishment of sinne, and inwardly sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Gods Spirit, is accounted of God righteous by the righteousnesse of Christ imputed vnto him, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Christ is made vnto vs of God righteousnesse.</hi> And although this bee in part and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this life, attended with much frailtie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of flesh, yet because,</p>
               <p>First, they are perfectly iustified euen in this life,</p>
               <p>Secondly, haue begunne in a righteousnesse, which shall be perfected,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, haue a will and endeuour, striuing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, are accepted of God as perfect for Christs sake, in whom all their vnrighteousnesse and defects are couered: therefore they are called euery where <hi>righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So our Prophet here calleth such, as according to his former Doctrine haue made sure their discharge with God, and gotten euidence of remission of sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God through Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This person is <hi>vpright in heart,</hi> that is, sound and sincere, without guile, <hi>verse</hi> 2. and this is, when the heart is set right towardes God in doing all duties of pietie and charitie towardes GOD or men; truely ayming at the pleasing of GOD, and not at by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respects: this is straightnesse of heart, called truth in the inward parts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 6. Thou louest truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18743:214"/>
parts. And although no man is indeed vpright without some crookednesse, and declining from the straight rule, yet because heere is, first, a drawing neere and endeuour to full perfection: Secondly, a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue rightnesse, in respect of the vnregenerate, whose course is wholly crooked:</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the acceptance of a mercifull Father: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called <hi>vpright:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And vpright in <hi>heart,</hi> first, because there is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of soundnesse: for the first worke, by which God distinguisheth betweene man, and man, is the <hi>purifying of the heart by Faith, Act.</hi> 15. 9. and the worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion is called the <hi>circumcision of the heart,</hi> which the Lord promiseth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because all outward shewes without this ground are vnsound and deceitfull, and whatsoeuer we doe, must haue this ground to make it acceptable, euen a sincere and honest heart. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. all obedience to the trueth, all loue to our brethren, must come from a pure heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because if the heart be vpright, it will from thence shine into all the actions: for a righteous man must be vpright also in <hi>his way, Psal.</hi> 119. 1. Now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of heart is like a great wheele in a clocke, that sets all the other a mouing, or like a light in a lanthorne that shines through euery side of it. A wicked man may bee vpright in some one action, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> pleaded for himselfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>With an vnperfect heart haue I done this:</hi> but the generall vprightnesse of the whole life is peculiar to Gods people, it must issue from the heart, where if there be a liuing fountaine, the streames will euer runne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Commandement,</hi> enioyning spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, hath diuers branches, as there are diuers words in the originall, which are to be distinguished.</p>
               <p>First, Bee glad: the word <hi>Shimen</hi> comes of <hi>Shama<gap reason="illegible: blurred" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:18743:215"/>
which properly signifyeth inward and harty ioy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the presence, or hope, at least opinion of some good or desirable thing, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 26. Let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that reioyce at my hurt: now none of <hi>Dauids</hi> subiects durst make show of this ioy in his hurt, onely it was conceiued in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Reioyce: <hi>Gila</hi> riseth of <hi>Gil,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to expresse our ioy by some outward gesture, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vsed for dauncing, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 12. The hilles <hi>skippe</hi> for gladnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Bee ioyful: <hi>Harninu</hi> of <hi>Ranan, vociferatus est prae laetitia. Isa.</hi> 35. 6. The dumbe mans tongue shal sing: <hi>Vetaron.</hi> So as vpright men are commaunded not onely to conceiue and conceale their inward ioy, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it in their actions, in their speeches, and euery way they can.</p>
               <p>And this Commaundement runneth vp these three staires for sundry causes: First, to shew that there is great cause why the righteous should reioyce. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that where sound ioy is within, it will not be hid, but made manifest. Thirdly, to shew that Christian ioy is not perfect at first, but riseth by degrees, first within concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and then by little and little expressed, as the degrees in our text teach vs.</p>
               <p>So much of the Commaundement. The thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is ioy and gladnesse: Ioy is the soules delight, or solace in the presence of some good thing, in deed or in hope. It is twofold: either naturall and worldly, when the good, of which it riseth, is so: or supernaturall and heauenly, about some spirituall good which is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: This supernaturall ioy is twofold: First, the ioy of grace. Secondly, the ioy of glory: the former is heere meant, which is the inheritance of the Saints here, and a forerunner of that of glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the obiect or limitation of this ioy, <hi>In the Lord:</hi> the matter of our ioy must be the Lords goodnesse
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:18743:215"/>
vnto vs, especially in keeping his promise faithfully, in pardoning our sinnes, and gracious receiuing of vs. For so not onely the context, but the word <hi>Iehoua</hi> puts vs in minde, properly signifying God hauing being of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and giuing being not onely to all his creatures, but to all his promises also. And then wee reioyce in the Lord,</p>
               <p>First, when our ioy is a <hi>fruit of the Spirit</hi> of the <note place="margin">How we reioice in the Lord.</note> Lord, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 22. therefore called the <hi>ioy of the Holy, Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when it looketh to God and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him the true God, and in his Sonne whom he hath sent, his God, reconciled, appeased, and well pleased, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. being iustifyed by faith, wee haue peace with God, and reioyce, &amp;c. Our Prophet here cals the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reioyce, vpon this ground. When a man reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in Gods fauour, forgiuing sinne, and in fellowship with God and Iesus Christ, then hee reioyceth in the Lord. This <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth the <hi>ioy of Saluation, Psa.</hi> 51. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it respecteth the speciall pledges of Gods fauour, as the worke of regeneration, the happy change we finde in our selues, the shining and beautifull graces of Gods holy Spirit, with the daily increase of them: thus to reioyce in the Lords image renewed, is to reioyce in the Lord himselfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when our ioy is set vpon Gods ordinances and word, in which the Lord reuealeth himselfe, and communicateth himselfe more freely vnto vs, when in them we get a faster hold of God, and grow vp into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellowship with him, especially when his gracious promises feede our hearts, and we reioyce in his trueth and faithfulnesse, making them good not onely to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but also to our owne selues.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when we reioyce in the hope of eternall glory, both in soule &amp; body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. Hoping, and expecting, and reioycing, that we shall fully enioy him as he is, and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:18743:216"/>
drinke freely of that water of life, which wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tasted.</p>
               <p>And thus to reioyce is no easie thing, and therefore he calls on vs, againe and againe, and the third time, to reioyce in the Lord, as <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 4. Reioyce in the Lord, and againe I say, reioyce: for though it be easie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in a carnall manner, and most men lose themselues in such merriments, yet to reioce in the Lord is not so easie; the obiect, the matter, and manner, and end are hard to force on our selues, which is the reason of such earnest inforcing of the precept. So much of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The words being thus expounded, wee come to the doctrine of them, &amp; first from the persons, <hi>righteous men</hi> and <hi>vpright in heart:</hi> These are the same persons that are spoken of in the fixt verse, The godly man shal pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; whence we may note, that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A godly man is an vpright man;</hi> that is, of a simple and <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> true-dealing and true meaning heart, with God and <note place="margin">Euery godly man is an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man.</note> man; hauing a minde ready to learne of the Lord both what to doe and for what, and so, doing what hee doth for no other cause in the world, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20 3. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, O Lord, that I haue walked before thee <hi>in trueth, and with a perfect heart. Ier.</hi> 12. 3. Lord, thou knowest mee, thou hast seene mee, and <hi>tried my heart</hi> towards thee. <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> a godly man, was a true Israelite in whome <hi>was no guile:</hi> so, all other good men are called <hi>vpright men</hi> in their generation.</p>
               <p>First, because Gods image is renewed on them in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> part, a part of which is to bee simple and true, as he is most single and true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because they are daily conformed to Christ, who was the vprightest of all creatures, in whose mouth <note place="margin">2.</note> was found no guile.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because they haue receiued the Spirit of Sanctification, who daily heales and impaires naturall <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="403" facs="tcp:18743:216"/>
crookednesse and hypocrisie; and reneweth the minde, and the man to think and speake, and act things in truth and soundnesse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they onely are true worshippers, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <note place="margin">4.</note> God in spirit and trueth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 24. they are that good ground, which brings forth fruit out of honest hearts: a good man must be without hypocrisie, at least reigning hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>Let him therefore looke to the vprightnesse of his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use.</hi> Reasons to looke to the vprightnesse of our hearts.</note> heart, whosoeuer would haue an euidence of godlinesse. None but would be counted godly; not any would be thought an Atheist, or an hypocrite, or a neuter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let men looke to the vprightnesse of their hearts. And it stands vs in hand so to doe:</p>
               <p>First, because such a heart is Gods delight: whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">1.</note> comes from vs, is hence accepted, because it comes from a pure heart, euen the mite of a godly man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when as the wickeds sacrifice is reiected, and his talent accursed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because we can haue no other comfort in <note place="margin">2.</note> the workes wee doe; in the world we finde our best du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties traduced; <hi>Dauid</hi> dancing before the Lord is moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; but hee was sure hee did it before the Lord in the puritie of his heart, and that was his comfort, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20, 21. Besides,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not the quantity of our worke, which we can stand vpon, but onely the qualitie of it. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> could not iustifie the quantity of his loue, when Christ asked him this question; <hi>Peter,</hi> louest thou me <hi>more then</hi> these? onely he appeales to Christ of the qualitie of it, Lord, thou knowest that I loue thee: if wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues that wee doe a thing of a good heart, and according to the proportion of grace receiued, wee may cheare vp our selues, we shall bee accepted by the qualitie onely.</p>
               <p>How shall I know the vprightnesse of my heart? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:18743:217"/>
By these notes or rules: <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, that is right which is tried so to bee by a right <note place="margin">Notes of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse.</note> line, and stands in correspondence vnto it: The right line is Gods word, the precepts of the Lord <hi>are right, Psal.</hi> 19. 8. and then the heart is vpright, when it is made straight by the word, and is squared in all things by it. Euery man boasts of the rightnesse and goodnesse of his heart, that cares but a little for Gods word: but wee must be farre from standing in our own righteousnesse, which is as a filthy clowte, and take the square of Gods word, and lay our hearts and affections vnto it, that they may be ruled by the line of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a right line doth euer discouer that which is crooked; a good signe of a right heart is to descrie and discouer, but not without true sorrow and griefe, the crookednesse and hypocrisie of it, and to labour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reforme it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 80. Let my heart <hi>be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> in thy statutes, <hi>that I bee not ashamed:</hi> a right line shames a crooked; crooked legges are ashamed to bee seene: when a man feares, and is ashamed of his hypocrisie and crookednesse, and euer tendeth to straightnesse, it is a good note of some rightnesse of heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, consider the things which flow from the heart: if they be single and pure, warrantable and right, then a man may know his heart is vpright; for such as the fruit is, such is the tree; if thou feedest on forbidden fruit, thou art a bad tree, and thy heart farre from vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse; an vpright heart suffereth not rotten spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the mouth, idlenesse in the hand, iniustice in the life, drunkennesse in the braine, and disorder in the course.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider the ends and aimes of our actions; the vpright heart aimeth directly at Gods glory in all things, but the crooked heart propoundeth euer some crooked end and sinister respect vnto good actions; as
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:18743:217"/>
many come to Church, get knowledge, and professe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for vaine glorie and vaine ends; some thrust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong godly persons, and into good companie, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are good or would be good, but because they would be thought so.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, consider if thy heart be the same in priuate as it would be thought in publike. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101. <hi>Dauid</hi> will walke wisely in the perfect way, in the <hi>midst of his house:</hi> and the conuersation of the Saints hath beene alwayes like it selfe. <hi>Abraham</hi> walked in vprightnesse before God according to the Commandement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. how did he reforme his house, teach his familie, instruct his seruants, and take God with him in prouiding a wife for <hi>Isaac,</hi> and in all things? <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. <hi>Isaac</hi> was the same in the field as he was in the house, he went out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field to pray, saith the Text. <hi>Daniel</hi> was the same after the dangerous Law that he was before, he opened his windowes thrice a day as he was accustomed. So vpright was <hi>Paul</hi> in his whole course, as he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himselfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>A good heart sets God often in sight as well in the Chamber as in the Church; <hi>Dauid</hi> set the Lord euer in his sight, and at his right hand. It is as seuere and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against his owne crookednesse as any other; and will not swallow small sinnes no more then great, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods pure eyes are set vpon and against both. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse is in euery thing alike, without and within; it is not worse in substance then in shew, nay, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: It seekes to approue it selfe before God and al men, first to God, whose eye is more respected then if all the world looked on, and then to all men, but so as if none but God looked on them: It desireth to purge it selfe from all filthinesse of flesh and spirit, and to grow vp to full holinesse in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>That man, that findes these notes in him, may be a glad man, nay, he must be a glad man, according as it

followes in the Text, <hi>Be glad yee righteous:]</hi> from the connexion of the persons to this duetie we may note, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Only the godly man can truely reioyce with sound and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting ioy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 13. My <hi>seruants shall reioyce,</hi> and yee <note place="margin">Only the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can soundly reioyce.</note> shall be ashamed; my <hi>seruants shall sing for ioy</hi> of heart, and yee shall crie for sorrow of heart, and howle for vexation of spirit. The stranger shall not enter <hi>into his ioy, Prou.</hi> 14. 10. and it is called the <hi>ioy of Gods people.</hi> Thus the Scriptures euer limit this ioy to the faithfull: <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 16. Let them that <hi>seeke the Lord, reioyce:</hi> and <hi>Prou.</hi> 29. 6. In the transgression of an euill man is his snare, but the <hi>righteous doth sing and reioyce.</hi> The reasons of this doctrine are these:</p>
               <p>First, because none else are commanded to ioy but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1.</note> the godly, none else haue warrant to reioyce: where doe we reade, that a wicked man is bid to ioy? and indeed, what cause is there, that he should be so bid? What troubles him? his sinne troubles him not, it is his hearts delight; not temptations, for he swallowes them all; not his conscience, for it is asleepe; not the world, for it is his Darling; not the Deuill, for he is not cruell in his owne house; not outward afflictions, for he will not endure any: al things are at peace with him, he mournes not, and therefore needes not be called to comfort: the promise is, Blessed are they that mourne, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and persecuted for the name of Christ; for they shall be comforted. Nay, he is called from ioy to how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 1. he is alreadie glutted and drowned in worldly delights and carnall ioy, from which he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerywhere called, yea, a woe is pronounced on him, <hi>Luc.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>Woe be to you that reioyce now:</hi> for yee shall mourne and weepe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, onely the godly haue cause to reioyce: <note place="margin">2.</note> for,</p>
               <p>First, they only haue the presence and fruition of the <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:18743:218"/>
chiefe good, which is God himselfe; and are in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">True causes of sound ioy only among godly men.</note> with God, by vertue whereof they are interessed in all the good things of heauen and earth; as a wife in the goods of her husband. Here is a great cause of ioy indeede; a godly man hath gotten this cause of ioy, and therefore he may lawfully reioyce.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they only know that their names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">2.</note> in the booke of Life, which is a truer cause of ioy by our Sauiours testimonie, then if by the gift of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they were able to subdue the Deuills, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 20. Reioyce not in this, but that your names are written in the booke of Life. And then the godly know their names to be written in that booke, when they write their owne names in Gods booke by becomming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers; for faith giues them priuiledge to be the sons of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they only haue escaped, and are set free from the infinite euills, and sorrowes of sinne, with which all <note place="margin">3.</note> other besides themselues are beset, and bound ouer to damnation: And therefore as Israel, hauing escaped the Sea, the Mountaynes, and Egyptians, and gotten out of Egypt it selfe, sang and reioyced, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. so haue all the Israel of God, being set free from hell and sinne, and sinners, and the curse of sinne, iust cause of ioy and gladnesse, which all but they want.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, only they haue the Spirit of God, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">4.</note> and Preseruer of this ioy, which is therefore called the ioy of the Holy Ghost: only they are anointed with the oyle of gladnesse, and clothed with the garment of gladnesse; and haue the Spirit of comfort sent into their soules, who is the Moouer of this ioy; and not so much maketh our Spirits reioyce, as himselfe reioyceth in vs; as he is said, not to make vs make requests, but to make requests in vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, only they know, that Christ is theirs with all his merits, and thus attayne the ioy of beleeuing. He <note place="margin">5.</note>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:18743:219"/>
that sold all to buy the field, went away with ioy that he had gotten the field: So he that knowes he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Christ, and groweth vp in him as a member in the head, and liueth and moueth by him, will reioyce in his purchase of naked Christ. How did <hi>Simeon</hi> reioyce, when he had Christ in his armes? How much more will a sound Christian, who carries him in his heart?</p>
               <p>Sixtly, only they sucke and draw their ioy out of the <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>Wells</hi> of sound consolation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. 3. that is, out of the Scriptures, which are written, that their ioy may be ful, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. The priuiledge of Gods testimonies, is, that <hi>they reioyce</hi> the heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 8. These make knowne to vs, the things giuen vs of God, these contayne the glad tydings of saluation, and the precious promises of grace and glorie, which belong only to godlinesse: here be the deedes and conueyances of their eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, only bequeathed to children; these be the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the Spirit, who yeeldeth no argument of ioy and comfort but from the Word, and all ioy elsewhere sought is carnall and presumptuous.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, only they enioy the sweet peace and ioy <note place="margin">7.</note> of a good conscience, excusing and acquitting them in the sight of God, which it selfe is a continuall feast; and makes them glad and cheerefull, <hi>Prou.</hi> 15. 15. This was the true cause of the heauenly ioy, which the Apostles in their labours and persecutions enioyed, euen the <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of a good conscience,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, only they haue the hope of glorie in soule <note place="margin">8.</note> and body, which is a fruit of iustification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. and a sound cause of ioy; We reioyce, saith the Apostle, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hope of the glory of God,</hi> and hope maketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed. And not only this, but a grounded assurance also, that all things in earth, which may seeme to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their hopes, shall be turned to the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
               <p>All this may be a meanes to bring godly life in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> seeing it is the only ioyfull life, and none haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18743:219"/>
any sound cause of reioycing, but the godly. And here we are to meete with two obiections, which terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie men from godly life that lyes now a dayes like refuse wares, vnaskt for and vnregarded.</p>
               <p>First, that the world accounteth the slate of Gods <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1.</note> children most lumpish, heauie, and solitarie, yea, most vncomfortable; it thinkes that no ioy, nor mirth, nor pleasure of their liues belongs vnto them, but if once a man beginne in truth to liue godly, he must bid a dieu to all mirth and gladnesse, and betake himselfe to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish heauinesse and sadnesse.</p>
               <p>But this is a grosse and foule deceit of the father of lyes, whereby he hath much aduantaged his Kingdom, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> and by a supposed want of ioy, exceedingly puts god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse out of countenance. Yet, first, true it is, that God helpeth and draweth Christian ioy out of godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and no man can attaine this sound ioy, but hee that is soundly humbled at the sight of his sinnes; and herein the World sticketh; not seeing the powerfull worke of GOD, who out of this darknesse bringeth light; who soweth light to the righteous, and out of this sorrowfull Seed-time brings forth a white Haruest of ioy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because now the heart being regenerate cannot carnally reioyce as before, nor in carnall things, hauing better obiects and causes of ioy, on which it feedeth, the stranger that cannot enter into this ioy, thinkes he hath no ioy at all, onely because worldly ioy is vnsauourie to him in comparison of spirituall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the World and wicked men set themselues to vnsettle the peace of the godly, and doe often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them, and will let them haue as little ioy as may bee. Yet;</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all this: First, the godly, euen when they doe not reioyce, haue iust cause to reioyce; else our Sauiour would not haue pronounced the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:18743:220"/>
blessed, euen for the present: Blessed are they that mourne; nor haue said to the Disciples, In the world ye shall haue affliction, but in mee yee shall haue peace, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 33.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if they sorrow, they shall out-grow their sorrow, and their sorrow shall bee turned into ioy, as Christ promised the Apostles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 20. The redeemed of the Lord shall returne, and come to Sion with praise, and euerlasting ioy shall be vpon their head, they shall obtaine ioy and gladnesse, and sorrow and mourning shall flye away, <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. 10. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 3. Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto them that mourne in Sion, beauty for ashes, the oyle of ioy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heauinesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, our Text teacheth, that God would not haue the hearts of his children at any time so possessed with sorrow, no, not for the most iust causes, but that they must support themselues, and rise out of it with heauenly and spirituall ioy, to which end serue all these commandements so thicke (as we say) and threefold, which were all idle and to no purpose, if their liues were still to be led in a lumpish and sowre manner.</p>
               <p>Here therefore I would aduise such as feare God, to looke to two things: First, to prepare their hearts by fulnesse of godly sorrow to be filled with ioy; seeing it riseth out of serious sorrow for sinne, and out of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart: we tune our harpes and musicall instruments to sweete musicke, by wresting the strings: neither must we (as we are too ready to) conceiue these two as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies destroying, but rather as constitutiue and conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing causes one of another. Then, secondly, let Gods people bee aduised to looke into their priuiledges, which are such as may well, not onely affect, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish them with ioy; and consider of their happie estate and translation into the fellowship of GOD and his Saints: and that for these causes; first, that they may
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:18743:220"/>
yeelde obedience to Gods commandement, both here and elsewhere: secondly, manifest the presence of the Spirite in their hearts, who brings with him peace and ioy, and settles the Kingdom of the euerliuing God in the heart, which consisteth in these: thirdly, that they may not onely take away this scandall, which Satan and the wicked make aduantage of, but also encourage others to get part in the same grace, which keepes them in a cheareful and constant course of wel-doing; when they see that no trouble nor affliction can interrupt their ioy: fourthly, without true ioy wee can neuer praise God heartily, or serue him chearefully; for no ioy in God, none in his ordinances, none in our dueties of either of our callings; but we must needes be lumpish, and heauie, and soone weary of our prayers, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, and the speciall actions of our calling; wherein if we had delight, we would not easily be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from them, but count much time imployed therein, as <hi>Iaakob</hi> did an hard prentiship of many yeeres, but a few dayes, because of his affection of loue and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in his <hi>Rahel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another obiection, which terrifies many from god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> is, that the godly are so beset and compassed with troubles, sometimes inward and sometimes outward, in themselues and theirs, in their goods, names, and persons, as they cannot see what ioy they can haue in their liues.</p>
               <p>No maruell if the world can see no cause of ioy in the godly estate, especially when the Sunne and heate of <note place="margin">Answ.</note> persecution tanneth and discoloureth them, seeing the godly themselues are often out of loue with their owne condition.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> they haue a true sense of sinne, and rather then they should not haue it, God himselfe will hide his face from them, and they are troubled. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 51. <hi>Psalme</hi> had by his grieuous sinnes lost
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18743:221"/>
the <hi>ioy of his Saluation,</hi> which hee desires the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store vnto him once againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Church sometimes forfeits in a manner <note place="margin">2.</note> Christs presence, and by vnkinde answeres makes him goe away in displeasure, and then her beauty and ioy is faded; and seemes blasted, as plants are in the absence of the Sunne or farre distance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> sometimes presence of naturall corruption, and strength of rebellion in the heart carryes a godly <note place="margin">3.</note> man as a slaue to execute the lusts of the flesh, whereby the Spirit is grieued, and quenched, and seemes quite gone; and this is a great cause of sorrow and heauinesse of heart; as we may see in <hi>Paul,</hi> crying out, O miserable man that I am! &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in all this there wantes not some cause of ioy:</p>
               <p>First, Seeing Christ goes not away, but he leaues some <note place="margin">Godly in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, want not cause of ioy.</note> pledge of his comming againe; he puts his hand by the hole of the doore, that the heart of the Church may bee affectioned towards him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4. and this is that, which makes her in his absence <hi>sicke of loue;</hi> which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues some delight in him while he is farre off; and this delight and desire after him giues her no rest till she find him againe, and then shee layes better hold, and makes more of him then euer before. Neither doth <hi>Dauid</hi> so lose all ioy by his sinne, but that hee still desires and longs after it: which argues the Spirit not to bee quite gone; who onely worketh such vnspeakeable groanes after himselfe in the hearts of such as he hath once taken for his mansion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ioy of the godly is often ouercast with the mist of affliction, and this dazles their owne eyes, that sometimes their ioy is hid from themselues, and much more from others: But as it is in the heauens when a cloud hinders the sunne-beames; or the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the earth makes an eclipse for a time, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Sunne shal breake out and shine gloriously:
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:18743:221"/>
so is it heere: first, the promise is, <hi>Yee shall weepe for a time, but your sorrow shall bee turned into ioy, and your hearts shall reioyce, Ioh</hi> 16. 20. Secondly, afflictions from the world for well-doing cast not ioy out of a godly heart, but feede it <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>My brethren, count it all ioy when yee fall into diuers afflictions:</hi> and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Wherein yee great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyce, though now for a season</hi> (if neede bee) <hi>yee are in beauinesse.</hi> The Apostles therefore reioyced, when they were whipt and set in the stockes and vsed like rogues for Christs sake: and the Saints reioyced in tribulation and suffered with ioy the spoyling of their goods, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. Thirdly, those afflictions were comfortlesse and iustly to be sorrowed for, which could separate vs from God, and from Christ the onely fountaine of our true ioy, but all afflictions helpe the godly neerer vnto God and Christ, working repentance, feare, shame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse for sinne, and reconciliation, and so helpe our ioy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the godly haue oftentimes lesse comfort of <note place="margin">Why the godly haue lesse ioy in their estate then they neede.</note> their life then needes, because they mistake their estate, two wayes especially: First, when they are not able to distinguish between nullytie and imperfection of grace: Oh they finde no faith in their hearts, no feare, no brokennesse of heart, when they (I will not say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Spirit, but) vnthankefully deny his worke in themselues: I grant heere is imperfection of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but, that they are quite shaken out where euer they were in trueth, is not to be graunted. Secondly, when they will measure their estate by sense, and not by faith, whereas faith stands not by sense and feeling, but is a secret force beyond these. A man in a swoone or in a sleepe feeles not his life, and yet is a liuing man, and a sounder man if the qualme or sleepe bee ouer: it is one thing to haue grace, another to feele grace; one thing the life of faith, another the life of sense.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the godly are often too hastie, and loth to stay their time of preparing to their glory; this troubles them much that God delayes them so long, they feare
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:18743:222"/>
he hath vtterly forgotten them: But hee that beleeues makes not haste: and, Marke the iust man, his end is peace; not alwayes his beginning: If God delay long, yet he will come at last; let thy faith grow in strength, and thy ioy shall be abundant; thou shalt not feare but that (as in <hi>Sampsons</hi> Parable) out of the eater shall meat come, and out of strong afflictions sweetnesse. By all which we may see the blindnesse of the World, that can see nothing at all in the godly life worth the taking vp, and who to auoyd the troubles of godly men, refuse to partake in their ioyes, which are so sure and sweete as that no affliction or sorrowes can befall them, in which they may not reioyce, if it be not by their owne default. But let the godly themselues reioyce in their portion, that God hath seuered them from the base brats and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi> of the World, whom hee sends away with some gifts, but hath bestowed the peculiar liueli-hood of his owne <hi>Isaacs</hi> vpon them: Let them bee glad in the euils they haue escaped, in the good procured them, within and without them, here and hereafter, the least dramme of which hath more true cause of ioy in it, then if they were heires of the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, see hence the vnhappy estate of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. Wicked men haue often some ioy, but neuer any sound cause.</note> seeing they are without all found ioy, or cause of it: for,</p>
               <p>First, what ioy can he haue, that is, a dead man, dead in sinne, without the life of God, without Christ the fountaine of life and ioy? surely, a dead man that lyes rotting in his graue, hath as much cause of ioy in that estate, as he that is dead in sinne hath in his.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what ioy can hee haue in GOD, whose conscience continually vexeth and accuseth him; in whom the spirit of feare and bondage ruleth; which keepes and barres out peace with God; and much more the ioyes of the Holy Ghost? A sound of feare is euer in his eares, <hi>Iob.</hi> 15. 20. True it is, a wicked man may
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18743:222"/>
labour to forget the troubles that haunt him, or to brawne his heart, not to feele them, and set himselfe on some merrie pinne: to face out the matter, as if hee were at good ease; when all this is eyther a senselesse estate, more void of comfort then of feeling; or a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the face, when the heart is heauie; or the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fooles, (as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth) whose propertie is to laugh most, when they haue least cause.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what true ioy, or cause of ioy can he haue, on whom the sentence of condemnation is passed, the execution of which sentence hee may daily expect? Surely, the greatest Monarch aliue, if hee were in chaines vnder his greatest Enemie, and condemned to dye, could take no ioy of his wealth, greatnesse, or of any earthly delight: but wicked men are in the chaines of the Deuill, and abide vnder the sentence of death, euer readie to feed vpon them. <hi>Baltazer</hi> indeede was merrie, and in his Reuels with his Princes: but what cause had hee, when the Hand-writing appeared on the wall? So <hi>Amnon</hi> was merry in his brother <hi>Absoloms</hi> House, but what cause had hee, seeing men were appointed presently to kill him? Let a wicked man be as merry as hee will, sure it is, his estate giues him no leaue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what can minister true ioy to him, that hath no part in any of Gods Ordinances, which begin and perfect the ioy of Gods people?</p>
               <p>First, for the <hi>Word</hi> of God, hee refuseth the ioyfull tydings of his saluation; the doctrine of free Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes, which onely bringeth lasting ioy, he hath no part in, nor in that Redemption purchased by Christ, and published in the Gospell: thus the word is a bill of Inditement to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> seale nothing to him, but are as seales set to blankes: for, hauing no part in the Couenant, hee hath nothing by the seales; onely hee
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:18743:223"/>
makes himselfe guilty of the bodie and bloud of Christ, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and for want of faith eates and drinkes his owne damnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prayer</hi> from him is not onely not heard, but euen abominable: besides, hee hath no helpe of Christs intercession (for he prayes not for the World:) nor of the Prayers of Gods people, because he is not of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>duties of his calling</hi> are sinne to him, To the impure all things are impure, euen his best actions exclude him out of heauen, neyther can a man haue any ioy of his actions, till he can reioyce that his person is a member of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the <hi>creatures of God</hi> hee can no more truely reioyce in, then a Thiefe can of a true mans purse: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that be true ioy in the creature, that riseth from the creature, resteth in the creature, and goeth no higher then the creature; but such is the wicked mans ioy.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, lesse ioy can hee haue in his <hi>sufferings or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,</hi> because, their nature being not altered, they are no tokens of loue, nor tend to their good (as in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:) but are punishments in part and in hand, and flashes of Gods euerlasting wrath, and beginnings of Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Lord.]</hi> from this limitation, which is the third part of the verse, we may learne this instruction, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the reioycing of godly men ought to bee in the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doct.</note> that is, spirituall and Christian, a ioy worthy the Lord. <note place="margin">All the reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of godly men ought to be in the Lord.</note> And then it is spirituall and Christian, when it hath two conditions:</p>
               <p>First, when it is <hi>in the Lord,</hi> as the authour and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all the good wee can enioy, or ioy in, yea the matter of our ioy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, according
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:18743:223"/>
to the will of the Lord, and not against it: so the phrase is vsed, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. Let her marry, onely <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that is, according to Gods Word and direction, and not against it.</p>
               <p>First, God must be the authour and matter of our ioy, as <hi>Dauid</hi> made the Lord his Song all the day long: for, First, how great reason haue wee to make him the matter of our ioy, of whom wee are all that wee are, both in our first and second Creation? He is the Potter and we are the Clay: nay, we are his new Creation and workemanship, regenerated, iustified, sanctified, and saued: are become his by a new couenant in which hee accepts vs as children, reconciled by the death of his Sonne, in whom wee may reioyce as in a mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea as a wife married to a most louing husband, by vertue whereof she hath interest into his person and whole estate. Of this the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Wee reioyce in God through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom we haue receiued the atonement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this ioy is most perfect, which riseth of the presence of that which is most perfect; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the good enioyed is, the greater is the ioy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Heauen it shall be most perfect and glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee shall perfectly enioy God, and see him as hee is, in whose face is fulnesse of ioy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to make God the matter of our ioy, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate our ioy, and make choise of that which shall neuer faile vs: for as GOD himselfe is euerlasting, so shall the ioy of his people bee like a streame, which continually runs &amp; knoweth not the yeere of drought: yea it shall hold out in dangers, troubles, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 3. as the Martyrs reioyced in the verie flames.</p>
               <p>What? may wee not ioy in outward things, as meat, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> drinke, wife, children, wealth, honour? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yes, but neuer out of God, or without reference vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:18743:224"/>
him, neyther in outward nor inward things: we hold all in <hi>capite,</hi> and must bee Homagers of all vnto him; hee must haue the glorie of all, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 23. 24. <hi>Let not the rich man reioyce in his riches, nor the wise man in his wisedome, &amp;c. but herein let him glorie, that he knoweth mee to be mercifull and righteous:</hi> this must be the chiefe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, honour, riches, and wisedome of a Christian, to know God reconciled, and to hold all in this tenure.</p>
               <p>We may also reioyce in the meanes of saluation, but, if wee reioyce not onely in Gods fauour, but desire to bring something of our owne towards it, as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or wilfull Papists doe, This is not to reioyce in the Lord, but in our selues. We must reioyce in our <hi>Prayers,</hi> but onely because God is a God hearing Prayer, in our <hi>hearing, reading,</hi> and receiuing of the Word with ioy, but in this respect to God, that hee teacheth and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the soule: in <hi>the duties of our callings,</hi> but because we are in Gods Worke: in <hi>the duties of loue,</hi> but because we lend to the Lord, and feed and cloath Christ: in all <hi>the comforts of life,</hi> in the wife of our youth, in gracious children, in prosperitie, &amp;c. but because and so farre as these are pledges and fruits of Gods fauour in Christ. Yea more, we must reioyce <hi>in aduersitie and tribulation,</hi> because it is that estate, which God sees best for vs: yea in <hi>death</hi> it selfe, but as it is a going to GOD, to enioy him more immediately then wee can in this present World.</p>
               <p>Thus enioy all things in God, and God in all things, and ioy as much as thou canst: for all this while wee reioyce in God performing his holy promises vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must reioyce in the Lòrd, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Lord: now God's will mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and limits our ioy, first, in respect of the matter, secondly, of the manner, thirdly, of the measure: For the matter, it restraineth our ioy from all vnlawfull things: For the manner, our ioy in lawfull things must
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:18743:224"/>
not be vnlawfull: For the measure, the best things must <note place="margin">How Gods wil limiteth our ioy.</note> haue the best measure of our ioy.</p>
               <p>For the first: it suffreth not men to reioice in sinne or such things as chase God and his spirit away; as in swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, excessiue drinking, vncleane and filthy speeches, <note place="margin">1. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> cursed and blasphemous language, in wantonnesse and whoring; this is the deuils mirth and musicke, a mirth and laughter which is madnesse, like the laughter of a thiefe vpon the ladder ready to be turned off. The like may bee said of such as reioyce in railing, reuenging, quarrelling, disgracing and reproching of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Can such men reioyce in the Lord? nay, there is none of all this cursed crue, or the former rabble, that can be glad, but when God is furthest off, or forgotten and set out of sight: For let a man now put them in minde of God, and the true causes of ioy in him, by any sauoury word, they presently with the deuils in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel thinke, and perhaps crie out, They are tormented before their time.</p>
               <p>For the second; Gods will permitteth not men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the most lawfull things vnlawfully, whether <note place="margin">2. Manner.</note> necessary or indifferent.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Indifferent things</hi> are meate, drinke, recreation, wealth, prosperitie; in all which, and the like, if God be not still kept in sight, the ioy in them is vnlawfull. And if God be in the eye, then first, hee will be inuocated to blesse all the comforts, euen the least: Secondly, men would know measure and moderation; that is, they durst not sit at the wine, nor be brought vnder the power of the creature; durst not be louers of pleasure more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, durst not spend out so much precious time in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, and so little in priuate exercises of pietie: no man hires a seruant to doe nothing but play all the weeke and yeere: and thirdly, if God be in the eye, in the end of all the ioy in the creatures he would be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be he that giues power to get and vse substance;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:18743:225"/>
hee should haue the praise of his mercie returned him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 5. It is thou that feedest me, sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest my table, fillest my cup, and anointest mine head. The most ioy in the world is in those things wherein men are most excessiue, because they diuorce the ioy in the creature from that in the Creator: And a generall error poysoneth the common reioycings of men, who thinke they cannot bee merrie and serue God too. But of all such mirth as is seuered from Gods feare, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour saith, Woe be to you that now laugh, that is, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, excessiuely, without God or his word: remember the Apostles Canon, <hi>Reioyce with trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Things lawfull,</hi> and necessary, must not take vp our hearts so, but that we reserue the chiefe roume for God, and ioy in him: as for example, Many reioyce in their callings and diligent exercise of them (which is good and commendable:) but herein they faile, that they bury themselues in earthly businesse, and forget their generall calling of Christianity, Gods Kingdome, Word, Workes, and Sabbath; whereas, were the ioy in the calling sound, it would be herein, that suppose thy calling were neuer so base, yet thou art in Gods worke, and in thy way, yea, in a course, which must bee so farre from hindring thee in pietie, as wherein thou mightest (as thou oughtest) hold God alwaies in thy sight.</p>
               <p>For the third, namely, the measure of our ioy, Gods word and will is, that our chiefe ioy bee on the chiefe <note place="margin">3. Measure.</note> good; and as things in the degree of their goodnesse approach vnto, or decline from that, so must our ioy be to them in greater or smaller measure: and here,</p>
               <p>First, God must be our glory and our ioy all the day <note place="margin">1.</note> long, that the blessed Father is our Father, the beloued Sonne of God our Sauiour, and the holy Spirit our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier and Comforter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, next to God, we must reioyce in his Image <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:18743:225"/>
for his sake; and first, because <hi>Christ</hi> is the expresse I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Father, wee must reioyce in him aboue all men and Angels, euen as the chiefe of 10000, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that we conceiue him in our hearts, as the blessed Virgin did in her wombe, for which shee is bidden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce: Secondly, his <hi>Word</hi> carries his image, in trueth, holinesse, light, eternitie; we must therefore with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> reioyce in the Word, because there God and Christ, and the blessed Spirit meete vs with light and abundant comfort. The wise men seeing the <hi>Starre,</hi> that led them to Christ, reioyced with <hi>exceeding great ioy:</hi> The Word is to vs this Starre, which leades vs to Christ, first, in the Manger and on the Crosse in his humiliation, and then to his Crowne and Throne in his aduancement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation: Thirdly, The <hi>Saints of God</hi> carrie his image, and therefore all our delight must be in them that excel in vertue, <hi>Psa.</hi> 16. 2. and <hi>Psa.</hi> 137. 5, 6. <hi>Dauid</hi> considering the Church as the collection of the Saints, wisheth his hand to forget his cunning, and his tongue to cleaue to the roofe of his mouth, if hee preferre not <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to his chiefe ioy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, next to Gods image, wee must reioyce in <note place="margin">3.</note> such things, as by which God is most glorified; as first, when the Church inioyes prosperitie, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is magnified, his Scepter lifted vp, and set vp in the hearts of men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.</p>
               <p>First, I reioiced (saith <hi>Dauid)</hi> when they said vnto me, <hi>Let vs goe vp to the house of God.</hi> We reade of <hi>Iethro,</hi> that seeing all that God had done for Israel, he reioiced <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 9.</note> much, and so must wee when the Gospel hath free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, the ministerie established and entertained, and the ruines of the Church are repaired, more then when we growe rich and wealthie in the world: therefore Christ teacheth vs first to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when men are conuerted from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, when the lost sheep, the lost groat is found.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:18743:226"/>
If the Angels in heauen reioice when a sinner repenteth; much more must we, who are in more entire fellowship one with another, then the Angels are with vs. So the parable teacheth, <hi>Luc.</hi> 15. 32. It was meete we should be glad and make merrie; for thy brother was dead, but is aliue, was lost, but is found. How did <hi>Paul</hi> reioice, and wish <hi>Philemon</hi> to reioice with him, when his runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate seruant <hi>Onesimus</hi> was conuerted?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when our selues or others increase and grow in grace: The Apostles in all their Epistles, breake out into exceeding ioy and thankesgiuing, for graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon beleeuers, that their faith was published abroad, their loue abounded, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3, 4. and the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Philem.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 4.</note> Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> reioiced greatly to see the elect Ladies children walking in the trueth, 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>If a man thus bestow his ioy for matter, manner, and measure, hee shall finde little roume left for carnall and vaine ioyes, which are not more short in holding, then bitter in forgoing them.</p>
               <p>All this admonisheth vs to rectifie our ioy, and thus to <note place="margin">Use.</note> order it, by which onely wee put difference betweene our selues and the brute beasts, who reioyce in fulfilling their appetite, but can reioyce in nothing higher then themselues. Accursed is all that ioy in the creature, which is not begun, continued, and ended in the Lord and for the Lord. <hi>Diues</hi> enioyed wealth and pleasure, went in Purple, and fared deliciously euery day, but he is now in hell, and his tongue that called for nothing but pleasure, calleth now for a drop of cold water, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue it.</p>
               <p>By what markes may I try my ioy, whether it be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <note place="margin">Quest.</note> and in the Lord, or no?</p>
               <p>Know it by these rules: First, thy person must bee in <note place="margin">Answ.</note> Christ, thou must bee a beleeuer; if thy name bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Markes of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ioy.</note> in heauen, thy ioy is godly ioy: no part in Christ, no part in this ioy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:18743:226"/>
Secondly, thou gettest and holdest it by the right hand of faith, and therefore it is called the <hi>ioy of faith, Phil.</hi> 1. 25. Christ for the confirming of his Disciples ioy, commaunded them to beleeue in him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 1. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. After <hi>yee beleeued, ye reioyced</hi> with ioy vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious: more faith, more ioy; no faith, no ioy, small faith or desire to beleeue, small ioy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, diligent study in Gods word: for faith finds not ioy euery where, but onely in the Word. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. These things haue I said, that my ioy may abide in you. The two Disciples going to Emmaus, and Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with them, said afterward one to another, Did not our hearts burne within vs, while he talked with vs? Heere then is a plaine difference betweene Gods word and the writings of men: all the words of Philosophers are legall, and knew no Euangelicall ioy; for, which of them euer taught concerning remission of sinne or sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Christ? Therefore accursed are such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hell-hounds as hold the word of God as a policy, and say there are as good sentences in Poets and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers as in it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, examine what thy conuersation is, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vpright men must reioyce: for sinne grieues the Spirit and extinguisheth ioy, but piety and care of good conscience not onely cheareth him, but also is a sweet feast within, and that continuall.</p>
               <p>Fistly, and lastly, examine thy proceeding in mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: for as it is 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 31. By our reioycing which I haue in Christ Iesus, I die daily: the ioy of faith makes a man labour and long to bee disburdened of sinne the cause of sorrow, and willing to goe to God, at whose right hand is fulnesse of ioy for euermore.</p>
               <p>Thus haue wee by Gods grace finished this worthy <hi>Psalme,</hi> which begun with sorrow, but ends in solace; we went foorth mourning, carrying out our seede, but now we bring in our sheaues with reioycing; wee haue
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:18743:227"/>
sowed in teares, now wee reape in ioy. For which blessed fruit, the forerunner of our full haruest of ioyes, at Gods right hand for euermore, and for all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts accompanying the same; To God the Father and Fountaine; and to Iesus Christ the Meriter and restorer; and to the holy Spirit of consolation, the immediat applyer, and sealer of it to the hearts of the Elect: be all praise and honour, in all Churches for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
