            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOw great the force of <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> is to draw Men to good or evil, is evilent to the World by daily experience.

And most look rather to their <hi>doings</hi> then their sayings. Hereupon the Oratour tells us,
<q>Non solum obsunt superiores, quod illi ipsi corrum patitur, sed etiam quod cotrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt: plusquam exemplo quam peccato no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</q>

            <p>The mind of man like <hi>Jacobs</hi> sleep, receiveth the tincture and colour of those objects that are presented to it.

If Children and Servants will play by that Candle which is given them to work by, no wonder if he who set it up, put is out, and leave them in the dark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I do here present to thy view in this little Treatise, a great examples of Godliness, one that did not only <gap reason="foreign">

So I may speak of this ma<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> God without flattery (that is impossible, he being dead) or falshood (many a live can attest it) that

O what a lively pattern of <hi>zeal, love, faith, humility, Heavenly mindedness, courage</hi> for, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> in the Truth did he set before you, who had the happiness to live under his Ministry. <hi>Be you followers of him as he was of Christ,</hi> let his <hi>zeal</hi> inflame you, his <hi>love</hi> draw out your hearts more to your God and his People, let his <hi>humility</hi> make you low in your own eyes. His <hi>Heavenly mindedness</hi> lessen your esteem of the World and all therein and his <hi>magnaminity</hi> of Spirit, encourage you in the ways of Truth and Holiness against all the opposition that you meet with. Look often on him with the eye of your minds, till you are transformed into his likeness. Can you not remember how often your Spirits have burned within you, whilst be hath been opening Scripture to you; Have not your hearts sometimes been carried up to Heaven in his Prayers. Were you never above in the Mount with him at a Sacrament? when your souls spake with <hi>Peter, Lord 'tis good to be here, O let us build a Tabernacle, and no more go down to a vain empty World. O they are blessed that dwell in thy House, they do ever</hi> (and me without infinite cuase) <hi>praise thee.</hi> Beware

            <p>I believe many of you are ready to say with <hi>Job, O that I were as in the days of old, as in the days when God preserved me, when his Candle shined upon my head, when the Almighty was yet with me, Job 29.28</hi> O that I were as in the days of ola, as in the days when I sate under Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> Ministry; O that I could hear such Sermons, joyn in such Prayers, partake of such Sacraments, enjoy such seasons for my soul, and see such gracious examples. When you are wishing thus; consider what a mercy it was that you enjoyed him so long; Alas, how many Parishes never had such a Pastor one Month? then bewail your folly in making no better use of him while you had him. Let all your complaint be of your selves, for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness and unprofitableness under such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means, and Spiritual opportunities; And let you care be to make the most of him, more by practising those wholesome precepts, which you remember he gave you, and by writting in your lives after that Copy which he hath set you. I know his memory is dear to you, and your love was great to him, I beseech you, manifest the truth of your love by doing that which (you know) he loved so much. Did he not tell you often. <hi>I have no greater joy then to see my Children

                  <hi>THomas Wilson</hi> was born at <hi>Catterlon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cumberland</hi> in the year 1601. His Parents were sober and honest, and of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Estate, being of the best sort of Yeomen in those parts. As soon as his Age would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102536:8"/>
permit, he was sent to School at <hi>Blentow</hi> i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the saith County, where under Mr. <hi>Wilkinson</hi> his School-master, he profited beyond, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; and far excelled all his fellows. He was observed in his youth to have a sharp wit, large memory, and to be very much given to his Book; whereby his friends had hopes that he would in time (as indeed he did) prove a great instrument of good.</p>
               <p>His great proficiency at School, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his Parents to send him to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity before he was seventeen years of Age, where (<hi>viz.</hi> at Christs Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi>) he spent not his time as too many do, <hi>male, alind,</hi> or <hi>nibil agendo,</hi> but devoted himself wholly to his Studies, in so much that he was taken notice of by the Master and Fellows, for his diligence and industry: It might have been written over his Study-door, <hi>Nulla diel sine linea.</hi> And though he did imploy his time most there, about Academical Learning, (his acuteness in which did appear above <unclear>20</unclear> years, after he had left <hi>Cambridge,</hi>) yet he did not neglect Divinity, but in order to his design of serving God in the Ministry, (if he saw fit) read both Positive and Polemical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: But of all Books none was so dear to him, or read so much by him, as the Holy Scriptures, for as the great Apostle saith of <hi>Timothy,</hi> I may say of him, <hi>From a Child he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102536:8"/>
knew the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make wise to Salvation.</hi> Before he was Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Arts he had read (as he told me) <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi> and <hi>Iun.</hi> on the whole Bible, three times over.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. His removal from the Vniversity, with the occasion.</head>
               <p>SOmetime after he had Commenced Batchelor of Arts, he was removed from the University by this Providence. Mr. <hi>Iohn Bristow</hi> a Reverend Minister of <hi>Chawswood</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> desired Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> (that eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Piety and Learning) his Tutor, to send him an able Religious Scholar, to teach School in his House. Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> presently pitcht his thoughts upon his Puple Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> not knowing how to pleasure Mr. <hi>Bristow</hi> better, and glad he could answer his request so well.</p>
               <p>At Mr. <hi>Bristows</hi> he continued four years or there about, instructing the Lads committed to his charge, with great diligence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, being far from the temper of <hi>Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> who boasted (as <hi>Plato</hi> reports) that having lived sixty four years, he had spent fourty of them in corrupting and debauching young persons, No, he made conscience of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102536:9"/>
his time, and his trust, and gave his Scholar more cause to bless God for their education under him, then <hi>Socrates</hi> did <hi>Plato</hi> for his bringing up under such a Master. He hath sometimes told me, that he knew no Calling, except the Ministry, wherein a man might be so serviceable to God as in teaching youth. And is clear that oftentimes Lads are made men at School; If there they suck in ill principles, it will be hard to remove them, if good, they continue with them, <hi>Quo semel<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> est in buta,</hi> &amp;c. It is noted by some as one cause of <hi>Iulians</hi> profaneness, that he was bred under two Heathenish Tutors <hi>Libanius</hi> and <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> Because he saw the Christians so easily to confute the Idolatrous Gentiles, by reason of their good Education, he made a Law, <hi>That no Christian should train up his sons with humane Learning.</hi> But it was the happiness of <hi>Chawswood,</hi> that their Children were edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by one who had both a dexterity and fidelity, to teach them Humane and Divine Learning. But Mr. <hi>Bristow</hi> observing Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> fitness and ability for a greater work then instructing Children; and how his heart was set upon the work of the Ministry, (to prepare himself for which he made use of all his vacant hours from the School) did not judge it convenient to deprive the Church any longer of so worthy a Labourer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

though it were a considerable loss to himself and his Parish, to so go so good a man; yet he preferr'd the publick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Church before his own, and wisht Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> take himself wholly to Preach.</p>

               <p>THe first <hi>Candlestick</hi> in which this <hi>light</hi> was set, was <hi>Capel</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> where he continued some time, directing others by his holy pattern and judicious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Preaching, the way to eternal Life. Though the Parish gave him little or nothing for his pains, yet he was never the less faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and labourious, for the welfare of their souls, for he sought not <hi>theirs</hi> but <hi>them,</hi> not their temporal <hi>good,</hi> but their spiritual <hi>good.</hi> Here he had the love and esteem of all Godly persons, both Ministers and people round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and indeed by his holy, Heavenly, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conversation, he was such a <hi>Loadstone,</hi> as where ever he came he drew the hearts of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christians after him.

               <p>HE continued not long at <hi>Capel,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some reasons, by means of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Mr. <hi>Bristow,</hi> he was removed to <hi>Farlington</hi> (nigh <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi>) an ignorant Heathenish place, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured so long as he stayed with them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and reform. Though there was little of Religion in his Parishioners, nor scarce any savour of good, yet whilst he abode there the Church was much frequented (Christians flocking in to hear him divers miles round,) and when he was called thence he was much bewailed.</p>
               <p>He stayed not long in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> and though I am ignorant of the grounds of his frequent removals, (which I suppose were weighty) yet by the sequel I perceive that God intended so able and useful an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for more publick and general service, and thought not good to confine such great gaifts and graces, to such small Parishes.</p>

               <p>HIs next change was to <hi>Tedington</hi> near <hi>Kingston</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> in which place he continued some years, and through the blessing of God with great success of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and much acceptance amongst them that feared the Lord. During his abode at <hi>Tedington,</hi> he (being twenty six years of Age) had a desire to visit his native Country, where his Relations and Friends lived, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God so to assist him in his labours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that his journey became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Conversion of many. While he was in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> he was requested to Preach in <hi>Penroth,</hi> a great (if not the greatest) Market Town in the County, where, time out of mind there had been a considerable Market for all sort of food kept every Lords Day, till nine a Clock in the morning. But after he had Preached two or three Sermons, he prevailed so far with the Ministers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Town, that it was Proclaimed on <hi>Tuesday</hi> their Weekly Market day. That no person for the time to come, should bring any Victuals or Ware whatsoever to be sold

on the Lords day, but that <hi>Saturday</hi> should be the time for the Sale of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. And for many years after, the people did forbear to sell any thing on the Lords-day in that Town.</p>

               <p>HIs next removal was from <hi>Tedington</hi> to <hi>Otham,</hi> within two or three miles of <hi>Maidstone</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> The occasion is this, there were many serious understanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in <hi>Maidstone,</hi> much troubled and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the deadness and dulness of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, under which they lived. Alas, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>asked bread,</hi> and their Spiritual Father (by Profession and Office) gave them <hi>stones,</hi> that their souls were ready to famish for want of food. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Robert Swinnoche</hi> an active Godly person, one of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Jurats of the Town, got the presentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Otham,</hi> upon the death of the Incumbent, and consulted with his friends and Christian Neighbours, how he might procure an able Minister for that place, aiming herein not only at the benefit of that Parish, but also of the Christians at <hi>Maidstone,</hi> who might with a little trouble and travail reap the fruit of his

In pursuance of this they repaired to <hi>London,</hi> where they heard of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> to whom they presently take their journey, hear him Preach at <hi>Darking</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> to their great satisfaction. After Sermon they acquainted him with the cause of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the sad condition of the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in those parts, where they lived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to accept the presentation of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> He who was never hasty, especially in matters of such weight, asked the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Neighbour Ministers in the Countrey, and others of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who did concur and agree in this, that-in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the necessities of those that feared God about <hi>Maidstone,</hi> and the great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he should enjoy there, of doing good to many souls he ought to embrace the Call.

Many a one hath come to him, as the Gaolor to the Apostle, trembling and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Sir, what shall I do to be saved</hi>? To whom he <hi>was a Barnabas, a son of sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi> and could so display the exceeding abundant riches of Divine grace in the Lord Jesus Christ, as to draw and attract their hearts to a cheerful compliance with it, and hearty acceptation of it.

                     <hi>Towards the close of the Book.</hi>

               <p>Whilst he was at <hi>Maidstone</hi> he still was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the good of his people at <hi>Otham,</hi> and therefore to encourage them to unity, and a Gospel conversation; as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his adversaries, who had causelesly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to be a savourer and a better of Schisms and Divisions; he wrot a Letter to his Parish, wherein the exhorted them to fear

the Lord and the King, and to walk in love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to nourish in themselves any dislike of Government, or contempt of those whom God had set over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Letter was read on a Lords Day in his Congregation by Dr. <hi>Tucke,</hi> (that all his Parishoners might know his judgement, and the advice he judged necessary to give them) without the appointment of Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> The tidings of this Letter and the publick reading of it was soon carried to <hi>London,</hi> and gave such a distast, that both Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tucke</hi> were cited to appear before the High Commission Court, and answer what they had done. Both of them appeared several times to their great trouble and cost, and were notwithstanding all they could alledge in their own defence, forced to continue their attendance on the Court, for the space of three years. In this business Dr. <hi>Tucks</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the greater, because (his body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear riding) he was necessitated to make these long journeys of thirty miles and better on foot.</p>
               <p>During Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> suspension, a Neighbour Minister greedy of his Living, commenced a Sute against him, to eject him wholly out of <hi>Otham</hi>; but his Patron Mr. <hi>Swinnoche</hi> made good his Title, and so disappointed his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.</p>

               <p>But upon a serious weighing the reasons for and against their appearing, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they would appear, and submit to the will of God, however he should please to dispose of them. Mr. <hi>Edward Bright</hi> of <hi>Gondburst,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Inne, where Sir <hi>Nathaniel Brent,</hi> the Arch-Deacon, and some inferiour Officers sat. They no sooner appeared but Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> was pointed out by one present to the Arch-Deacon that knew him; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently asked him his name, and whether he had read the Prayer against the <hi>Scots</hi> or no? Mr. <hi>Bright</hi> answered, <hi>No</hi>: Whereupon the Arch-Deacon suspended him <hi>ab Officio &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficio,</hi> without admonishing him, or giving him any time to consider of it; which sudden act was deemed even by the Favourites of that Court, to be neither prudential nor Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Though Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> stood by when his Brother was suspended, and perceived the service much hotter then he expected; yet he did not flye from his colours, or retreat in the least; But being called, answered to his Name, and being asked whether he had read the Prayer? gave a Negative answer, with this reason: Because in the Rubrick before the Common Prayer, it was enjoyned <hi>that no
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102536:15"/>
Prayer should be publickly read, except those that were in the Book of Common-Prayer</hi>; but this Prayer against the <hi>Scots</hi> was not there This unexpected answer puzzled the Arch-Deacon (being none of the readiest or accuted to reply) and caused him to apply himself to Sir <hi>Nathan Brent,</hi> who upon information of Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> reasons, very ingeniously left the Arch-Deacon to himself, and refused to meddle in it. Upon which the Arch-Deacon (the edge of his fury being somewhat abated) proceeded more considerately with Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> then with Mr. <hi>Bright,</hi> and gave him four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days time to consider of it, and then to appear again at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and answer it.</p>

               <p>After he had shewed his Order, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Mr. <hi>Butcher</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> to assist him in the search of the House for Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> But notwithstanding his diligent search, he mist his desired prey.

Accordingly, he thus clad came forth, not knowing but that the Waiter was still at the door, but Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so ordered it, that the Waiter espying a Maid whom he Loved and Courted, walking on the other side of the way, stept over to her, just at Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> came forth, so that though the Messenger stayd a very little while with her, but returned again, Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> was gone; and when the rest came with power to search the house, the person they sought was not to be found.

As soon as the way was opened to his induction into <hi>Maidstone,</hi> (through the ejection of the old Incumbent, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Plundered Ministers) his old Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there, whose hearts were close knit to him, long'd for his settlement among them. But the Parliament ordering that Plundered Ministers should first be provided for, where any Livings were vacant, they could not at present obtain their desire: For one Master <hi>Smith,</hi> an able holy man, of the number of the foresaid Ministers, was by the Committee of Plundered Ministers sent down to <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had not been long in <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> but a rumour was spread, that eminent persons should be removed to great Towns and Cities, that they might be capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more good, and that Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> should be removed from <hi>Otham,</hi> to some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place. At which news the people of

                  <hi>Maidstone</hi> were much startled, fearing they should lose their beloved Pastour. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, they apply themselves to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> desiring him to accept of some other Living, that <hi>Maidstone</hi> might be free for Mr. <hi>Wilson.</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> considering the vehement desires of the good people after Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> yielded to refer the business to six judicious Ministers of the Assembly, whereof three to be chosen by himself, and three by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of <hi>Maidstone.</hi> The Ministers met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and having heard what could be said on both sides, and weigh the matter throughly, gave their advice that it would be best for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to resign the place to Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> which also he did, and having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable place, some six or seven miles from <hi>Maidstone</hi> provided for him, <hi>viz.

               <p>BUt though he left <hi>Otham,</hi> he did not leave off to care for the souls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, but kept his Title to the place still, (least the Patron should put in an insufficient Minister, in case he had resigned) and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them a pious learned faithful man, to whom he gave the whole profits of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for he held not his right to the place upon any carnal account, or for any self ends, but only for the good of the people.</p>
               <p>When he had been some time at <hi>Maidstone,</hi> he took care about the Reformation of the Church, and due administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to the Word of God, to which end, he did first in his Preaching disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them the necessity of Church Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Discipline, the nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then God accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diligent endeavours (notwithstanding the obstacles he met with, not onely by the prophane, but also some that professed the fear of God) he brought it to a good issue, and put it in practice, to the great comfort of them that were Godly.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. His great diligence and labouriousness on the Lords Day.</head>
               <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> nights he would usually continue at his Study very late, often till midnight, to prepare himself the better for his task on the Lords Day. On the Lords Day morning he would rise by two or three a Clock ordinarily, and was much displeased with himself, if at any time he did oversleep his hour. About seven a clock he came down to his Family, call'd all together, read some part of Scripture, expounded it, caused those present to give an account what they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of his Exposition, Sung some part of a Psalm, Prayed with them, and concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine a Clock that they might all be ready to attend publick Ordinances. About nine a Clock he repaired to the Church, and commonly begun with singing two Staves of a Psalm, after which he prayed briefly for assistance in, and a blessing on the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102536:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ordinances of God, then he read some part of the old Testament, and expounded (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three or four, sometimes more Verses, as more or less matter was contained in them) for the space of an hour, for he had an Hour-glass in his Desk for that end. He had as excellent a faculty in expounding as any I know of. His custom was first to analise the Book, then the Chapters, as he came to treat on them, then he gave the several readings and expositions of the Verses, which he handled. He had <hi>Iun. Tremel. Piscator. Beza. Calvin.</hi> and several others <hi>ad rugnem,</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in the assembly of Divines (as Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> sometime of <hi>Black-friers</hi> told me, he heard it of his Father one of the Assembly) if at any time they doubted what was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any of the aforementioned Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> was called to satisfie them. After he had delivered the several readings and judgements of Expositors, as there was occasion, he drew observations for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, dependance and matter of the Verses, which he very briefly illustrated and applied. Mr. <hi>Hutchison</hi> on the Gospel of <hi>Iohn</hi> comes the nearest him of any Comment that I read in <hi>English,</hi> but he was fuller and larger then Mr. <hi>Hutchison.</hi> I believe, if his expositions on the whole New Testament, and the far greater part of the Old had been Printed, it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102536:21"/>
would have been an useful Treatise, and more serviceable for the enabling ordinary Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to understand the mind of God in his Word, then any Comment that is extant. After he had expounded, he spent about an hour in the Pulpit. When he came home to his Family, he constantly went to Prayer with them before Dinner, and begg'd that the truths delivered out of the Word, might be written by the Spirit of God upon all their hearts. After which he went to his Studdy, (eating little or no dinner usually) till after his Family had dinn'd, then he spent some time with them in singing and other religious exercises. In the afternoon in publick he did as in the Morning, onely his exposition was then on some part of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>After the Evening Worship in publick, many Neighbours came to his house, where he called his Family together, asked of them and others present, an account of his Sermons preached that day, most of them present would speak somewhat, one what the Text was, another the division of it, another the Doctrine of it, another the reasons, so others the explications and uses methodically as he had delivered them, all whom he would help and encourage. Hereby their understandings and memories were much advantaged, for they knowing before hand his custome, were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102536:21"/>
the more attentive in hearing, and the more careful to remember what they heard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when the Master of the Family repeats all himself, Children and Servants (who have a natural aversness to, yea hatred of all good) are usually heedless in hearing, and mindless both in publick and private of what they hear. After repitition he sung a Psalm and concluded with prayer. Then he went to his <hi>quondam</hi> Patrons house Mr. <hi>Robert Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocks</hi> to Supper. By that time he had supped, there would be hundred or more gathered together to Mr. <hi>Swinnocks</hi> house, to joyn with him in the conclusion of the day.</p>
               <p>Many times to my comfort, I have seen two Rooms, one considerable for largeness, through which persons of all ranks, (the Mayor, Jurates and their Wives by their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns encouraging others) to worship the great God. After Supper he came among them, begun with a short prayer, then would read the Verses he had expounded in that day, ask what observations were raised from such a Verse, then proceed to the next, so through all the Verses he had expounded forenoon and afternoon, then enquire what the Text were, the Doctrines, the Explications, Reasons, Uses, all in order as preached, seldom named one head himself, but still heartned them to speak, and assisted them when they were at a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102536:22"/>
loss, then they sung a Psalm, and he ended the day with prayer about ten a clock at night.</p>
               <p>Once a month he administred the Lords Supper to a considerable number of solid seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Christians, with that life and warmth in prayer and opening Scripture, that some of his Communicants have thought themselves in the Suburbs of Heaven, when they have joyned with him in that Ordinance, in which he spent an hour and half commonly. Thus he Sanctified the Lords Day, spending nine or ten hours in publick and private Worship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side what time he spent in secret duties, in which he was never niggardly; so that the Sabbath, which was a day of rest to others, was a day of great pains and labour to him, yet it was easie, yea delightful to him; and at the end of the day, when those who took not half his pains, have complained of their weariness, he would be exceeding lively and chearful; such was his great love to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the souls committed to his charge. The Sabbath day to him was a day of light and gladness, and a good day.</p>

Every <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> their Market-day he preached a Lecture, to which many Ministers came, and with much delight sat under him. On <hi>Frydays</hi> he met in private with as many of his people as would come together, when sometimes he expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scripture to them, sometimes preached and always sung and prayed with them. And also <hi>Mundays</hi> or <hi>Tursdays,</hi> for his day was altered as he saw occasion) he appointed a Conference in the publick Meeting place, where the question being before propounded and known, (<hi>ex gr.</hi> what was the nature of repentance or faith, or what the sighness, or what the means, or what the motives to it) his people prepared to speak to it, and he by his wise courteous carriage and language won their hearts, and drew them to Study the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102536:23"/>
Scriptures and good Books, that they might be able to speak to the purpose. As they spake when he saw occasion he would help and assist them, yet still take care to keep them in the way of Truth, and that none did go beyond their bounds, or incroach upon the Ministry. After they had spoken, he would gather together their scattered notions, bring them into an orderly method, apply to them sutable Texts of Scripture, add what of his own he thought necessary, and so ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meeting exceeding profitable and comfortable to his flock. I have heard him at one of these Meetings, when the question was about one of the petitions in the Lords Prayer, to my great advantage and delight, for Christian Communion, mannaged with prudence, is that which keeps our Religion in breath, and without which it would be ready to die.</p>
               <p>When he laid down this way of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, instead thereof he set up Catechising on the Week-days in publick, and this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till he had gone through the whole Town, except some Families in the out bounds, which Families he intended also to have Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thechized, but was prevented. He did work the work of him that sent him into the world, spend himself as the Silk-worm to cloath, and as the Lamp to direct others, not to bury the

Seldom were any in his company, but they might (if it were not their own fault) receive good by him. He was neither vain in ostentation, nor niggardly in reservation, some might think he did ill to take so much pains on the Lords Days, and on the Week-days constantly, and on all occasions, to the shortning of his life; but he was sensible he could never labour enough for his Lord, and that God make no difference between <hi>nequam &amp; nequaquam,</hi> an idle and an evil servant. Hence it was that when he was often advised by his friends to be mindful of his body, and

               <p>St. <hi>Austins</hi> wish was, that Christ when he came to call him by death, might find him <hi>aut precautem aut predicautem,</hi> either praying or preaching. Truely, such seem'd to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> by his indefalligable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriousness about his Masters business. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew him given to any recreation (though never so innocent) but exceeding provident he was of his time, A little after dinner he would sometimes sit and discourse, but usually if he was at home, his Study was his place of abode. He was <hi>Hellno librorum,</hi> an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futigable Student, stealing time from his sleep (even when his body call'd for it) for his Book. Its said of <hi>Bradfrod</hi> that he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102536:24"/>
slept not above four hours in the night, and that his Book went not out of his hand till sleep came, and that <hi>Latimer</hi> Winter and Summer at two a Clock in the morning; and of another Martyr that he was spare of meat, sparer of sleep, out sparest of time. Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> made much conscience of his time, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Lords Day.</p>
               <p>If he were invited to a Feast, he was so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his God, that he commonly after dinner called for a Bible, sung a Psalm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded some Verse of Scripture, and prayed with his friends. Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> that eminent servant of Christ, meeting him once at Mr. <hi>Butchers</hi> house, was so extreemly taken with his active chearful Spirit for God and Godliness, that he said to Mr. <hi>Butcher,</hi> I am ashamed of my self, to see how Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopeth towards Heaven, and I do but creep on, a Snails pace.</p>
               <p>Though he was a good Linguist, well read in modern and ancient Authors, yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he preached (though always rationally and with evidence of reason,) yet in a plain clear stile, by Doctrine, reason, and use, that he might be understood by the meanest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. His constant preaching discovered him an able Workman; his Doctrines were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways clear from his Text, his heads pertinent to his subject, and he had a rare faculty in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102536:25"/>
sutable Scriptures (which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal way of convincing the judgement; for 'tis the authority of God must do the work) to all his heads. On the Lords Day in the afternoon for a considerable time (I suppose till he had gone through all) he preached on the Heads of Divinity, but therein he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered so much Learning and judgement in his plain preaching, that if his Sermons had been preached at the University, they must have been highly approved.</p>
               <p>He was so much valued for his abilities, that there was scarce any publick occasion of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the County, but he was chosen to be the person to preach them, sometimes he preached before the Judges at the Assize<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XVII. His carriage in his Family, and his exemplary conversation.</head>
               <p>HE was not of the number of them, who are zealous <hi>abroad,</hi> that they may be well spoken of, but careless <hi>at home,</hi> what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of their Families; but as <hi>David, he walked in the midst of his house with a perfect heart,</hi> and brought up his Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> saith of <hi>Quintus Maximinus,</hi> that he was not good only in the sight of the people, but he was better out of their sight: truly he was as good within, as without doors, each morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening he read some part of Scripture expounded it, sung part of a Psalm, and prayed with his Family. He would often ask his Children questions about the Principles of Religion, examine them about his Sermons on the Lords day, and cause them to learn the Scripture without Book.</p>
               <p>As it was said to Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> he governed his house, so that in every corner of it, there was some sinal of vertue, good example, honest conversation, and reading of the Scripture. I am sure if Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> house was not so, the fault was not the want of a good Governour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102536:26"/>He prayed often with his wife apart from the rest of his Family, and spent much time in secret prayer, knowing a truth in what <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> saith, <hi>Non est vera Religio quae cum Templo relinquitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very watchful to set a <hi>good example</hi> before his Children and Servants, knowing that such are led more by the <hi>eye</hi> then the <hi>ear,</hi> and more observant of what their Superiours <hi>do</hi> then what they <hi>say.</hi> And indeed his whole conversation was a living exposition upon the Gospel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that what he taught on the Lords Day in his Doctrine, he preached over all the week in his life. O how unlike was he to those Ministers that are lovely in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but loathsome in their practices, whose lives give the lie to their Doctrines. He was exemplary in his converse with all men, and spake much by his carriage, even when he spake not a word. His good works were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable, syllogismes invincible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations to convince his Neighbours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he stole their hearts, and won their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after the beauty of holiness. What <hi>Ruffinus</hi> saith of <hi>Gregory Naziaenzen</hi> is true, of him, <hi>Gregorius vir per omnia incomparabilis qui verba &amp; operibus clarus, splendissimum lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men scientiae Ecclesiae prebuit; dum ea decuit quae ferit,</hi> &amp;c. He practized what he preached, and did according to what he saith; Such

Ministers only can make their people believe, that when they disswade from sin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to holiness, they are in earnest, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they speak.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. The Reformation which was wrought by his means and Ministry in <hi>Maidstone.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAidstone</hi> was formerly a very prophane Town, insomuch that I have seen Morrice dancing, Cudgel playing, Stool-ball, Crickets, and many other sports openly and publickly on the Lords Day; I have heard them jeer, and deride, and mock at those who professed Godliness, and went to hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Lords Day abroad, when they had none at home. Commonly after the Evening Service, many of them went to the Ale-house, many to walk idly in the Fields. It was their constant custom to ply the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits on the Lords Day for the drawing of water. The former vain sinful customes of sports were reformed before his coming, but by his preaching he prevailed with them to forebear vain walking, idling at their doors, also to draw their water on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, which they should have occasion for on the Lords Day. Though the Town was large and full of people, yet you should hardly see one person in the street after the Sermons on the Lords Day, and I have known when the Mayor hath searched the Innes and Ale-houses
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102536:27"/>
he hath scarce found one of the Town there. One of the Judges at an Assize was pleased to say, That in all his Circuit he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to a Town where the Lords Day was so strictly observed. I must say that I scarce ever knew any man so strict as Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> in the Sanctification of the Lords day. He so much wrought upon the people there, that in the house where I lived, all Pot hearbs were gathered and made ready on the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> night, and whatsoever for their Dinners put into a readiness, for the fire on the day before, not a Rose or Flower suffered to be gathered on the Lords Day. He was much of the mind of the primitive Christian, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked <hi>Servasti Dominicum,</hi> answered <hi>Christianus sum, omittere non possum.</hi> The San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of that day is exceeding useful to keep up the power of Godliness in our hearts and lives. And as God on that day bestoweth great blessings on them, that humbly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently worship him on that Queen of days, that Market day of our souls, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 13, 14. So he hath inflicted dreadful Judgements on the profaners of that day, and when men have neglected to punish them, he hath taken the Sword into his own hand, and done it himself. One example whereof there was in <hi>Maidstone</hi> when I lived there: In former time
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102536:28"/>
that day was much prophaned, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and children were wont to play in the streets on that day. One Sabbath as children were playing near a wall, against which Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen-wheels were set up, on a sudden there arose a great wind, which blew down a wheel upon one of the Children, and crusht it to death. <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides on week days (such was the blessing of God upon his preaching and example) many Families Morning and Evening did set up religious duties, who never minded them before. You might there, if you walkt in the great street about nine and ten a clock in a morning hear singing in many Families, for they commonly sung Morning and Evening, when they read the Word and Prayed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. His great Courage.</head>
               <p>HE had a strong and undaunted Spirit, not discouraged by any obstacles, which were laid in the way of his duty. He feared God and none else. He was like that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> that when a threatning message of death was sent him, bid the Messenger tell the Empress, <hi>Nil timeo nisi peccatum, I fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but sin</hi>; Or <hi>Rowland Taylor,</hi> who being intreated to flie the <hi>Marian</hi> days, said, <hi>I know the cause so good, and the truth so strong on my side, it will by Gods grace-appear before their Beads, resists their false doings for I believe I shall never be able to Good so good a service as now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He discovered much courage in reproving sin, for as Christ said of the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, he could not bear those that were evill,</hi> were they never so great. <hi>Elijah</hi> durst speak to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> to the highest person, by way of reprehension, when there was cause for it. If men were bold in sinning, he was as bold in telling them of it, and giving their sins their due accents, yet as wise Physitian, he could distinguish between Pimples and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102536:29"/>
Plague sores, between infirmities and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, accordingly apply himself to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of his Zeal.</head>
               <p>HE was one that abundantly discovered his zeal for God in embracing all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do him service, in his great care where ever he came for the strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and right Sanctification of the Lords Day, in his sense of the dishonour done to God by the prophaness and contempt of the ordinaces of God by some, and by the errors and wilful withdrawings from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances by others; which he bewailed bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to his dying day. Some who its hoped had the <hi>root of matter in them</hi>; questioned his call to the Ministry, nay suspected his call to be Anti-christian and seperated from him, though they themselves acknowledges that he was their Spiritual Father, and <hi>had begotten them through the Gospel,</hi> and he might say to them as the Apostles to the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are the Seal of our Ministry, do we need as some others Letters of Commendation to you, ye are our Epistle, known and read of all men; For asmuch as ye are</hi> manifestly declared <hi>to be the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102536:29"/>
Epistle of Christ Ministred by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of stone, but in fleshly Tables of the heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. How frequently and affectionately did he urge that upon them, that separated in my hearing, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11, 6, 7, 8, 9. This causeless sinful separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay near his heart, even when he lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his dying bed. The great danger of their souls, as also of those that wholly cast of the care of their eternal good, caused him in the course of his Sermons and Expositions, when the Scriptures led him to it, to reprove their sins sharply, and indeed according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Holy Ghost, he could do it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>cuttingly that they might be sound in the Faith. Tit.</hi> 1. 13. Its reported of <hi>Bazil</hi> that one hearing much of him, had a great desire to know what manner of man he was; hereupon in a Vision was represented to him a flame of sire, with this motto, <hi>Talis est Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius, such a man is Basil.</hi> And truly such a man was Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> meek and cold, when at any time himself was reproached and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but as <hi>hot as fire</hi> in the cause of his God. <hi>The zeal of Gods house burnt him up.</hi> Errors and Heresies were very odious to him, such was his love to the truth. It might be said of him as of <hi>Austin,</hi> that was <hi>Malleus Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum, The Hamer of Heresies and Schismes,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:102536:30"/>
I have heard him often quote and comment on those Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. With much warmth and vigour, that if it were possible he might reduce those that went astray. And though such as were toucht in their sores were angry, and said, it was passion, and his natural heat was <hi>Kitchin fire,</hi> the effect of his natural Spirit, yet the judicious knew otherwise, that it was a coal from the Altar, true zeal, the fruit of Gods Spirit, in him knowing that he was set <gap reason="foreign">

He met with much opposition, (as is before declared) in the work of Ministry from all sorts of persons, both from open enemies and seeming friends, for Satan knowing him so great an enemy to his Kingdom of darkness, both by his life and Doctrine, raised great winds and storms, if it were possible to put out this <hi>burning and shining light</hi>; But he was undaunted in the midst of all, <hi>not moved by any of those things, neither counted he his life dear unto him, so he might finish his course with joy, and the Ministry which he received of the Lord Iesus, Acts</hi> 20. 24. He minded his own work, consulted his duty, left Gods work) the issues and events thereof) to God.</p>
               <p>He was a Rock immovable, though the Waves beat sore upon him, and had often
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102536:31"/>
that saying of <hi>Luther</hi> in his Mouth, Mallem ruore cum Christo quam regnare cum <hi>Caesare,</hi> I had rather fall with Christ then stand with <hi>Caesar.</hi> He knew God could and would take care of his own cause and interest, what ever became of him and other instruments. His <hi>Lutheran</hi> Spirit could argue,
<q>Si piam &amp; justam causam defendimus, cur Dei promissis non confidimus? praeter vitans hanc misellam Satanas &amp; Mundus nobis etipere nihil possunt.

If the cause be good that we defend, why do we not trust God who hath made us such gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises? The Devil and World can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us but the miserable life, but Christ lives and reigns for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man that lived much above the World, the great things therof were very little in his eyes, though his habitation was on <hi>Earth,</hi> his conversation was in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Indeed he had but a small estate, especially considering his great charge, but a poor man may be Earthly and covetous as one that is rich, for covetousness doth not lie in the <hi>Chest</hi> or <hi>Bags,</hi> or <hi>great Mannours,</hi> but in the <hi>heart.</hi> But he was <hi>Master</hi> of, not a <hi>Slave</hi> to that little he had. His mind was fitted to his estate,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102536:32"/>
and notwithstanding he had many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and advantages for the getting riches if he had sought them, yet he never made use of them for that purpose. He was wholly taken up with <hi>his Treasure in Heaven,</hi> and was so far from <hi>minding</hi> Earthly things, that he seldom or never <hi>meddled</hi> with Earthly things; but left all to his pious and prudent yoke fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I have often admired his indifferency of spirit to the things of this life. O how far was he from the number of many in our days who trouble themselves with Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Sowing, and Reaping, (unnecessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and worldly concerns, all the Week, and on the Lords Day, and set their people off with raw indigested confused discourses, and sometimes little better then non-sense. A little before the insurrection in <hi>Kent</hi> in the year 1648. one hundred pound was brought into Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> house, (being a Legacy given his eldest Daughter, by a gracious man Mr. <hi>Iohn Bigge,</hi> one of the Jurates of <hi>Maidstone,</hi> and I believe the greatest portion any of his children had) which money in the time of the insurrection was by the Souldiers (when they searched the house for Armes) discovered and taken away (though quickly restored again) Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> being then at <hi>London.</hi> When the Countrey was quiet, and Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> returned again to his dwelling, I asked him whether he

Though he was careful to write down his Sermons, Heads, Proofs and explications (as he himself told me) yet I never saw him use any Notes. And he made a good use of his memory, it was not as a childs pocket stuft with <hi>trash,</hi> but as the <hi>Ark</hi> wherein the <hi>two Tables</hi> were laid up. He had scarce his equal for his remembrance of the Scripture; he was (as I have heard)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102536:33"/>
tried a long time together. One took a Bible, and read a Verse in one Chapter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Verse in another, went forward and backward, both as to the Books and Chapters, and Verses of the Scripture, and all along he told the Reader the Verse, Chapter, and Book, without any mistake. And to the best of my remembrance, himself told me that he believed, he could tell the Book, Chapter, and Verse, which any should read to him all the day long. Much appeared in his Prayers. I have heard him of a fast-day pray an hour together, and most of the time in Scripture Phrases. The Word was dear to him, his daily delight and meditation.</p>
               <p>That which made all his parts useful and amiable, was that he made <hi>Hagar</hi> to wait on <hi>Sarah,</hi> and as <hi>David</hi> consecrated the spoils taken from the Gentiles to the Temple, so he Dedicated his natural accomplishments to his God, and made them serviceable before the advancement of his honour.</p>
               <p>But for all his great natural and gracious accomplishments he was cloathed with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; None thought so low of him as he of himself. His <hi>face</hi> like <hi>Moses shined,</hi> that all his judicious friends observed it, and admired it, but <hi>he knew it not.</hi> He had not the least affectation or shew of oftentation in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage or language, or any other thing.</p>

Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Pride, emptiness and arrogancy are usually concomitants. He knew much, yet the more he knew, the more sensible he was of his ignorance, and nothingness, and unworthiness, and walked the more humbly with his God; as a Bough laden with Fruit, or an Ear with Corn, the fuller and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, the more they bend down-ward; he as the Violet hung down and hid his head, though his fragranacy and sweetness disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him what he was.</p>
               <p>In his cloaths he was always grave and sober, never minding the whimsical modes or fashions, but ever keeping to the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his attire. I stood once with him at his door, when a great Gallant antickly drest went by, upon which he secretly said, <hi>I have made a Covenant with mine eyes, why should I be hold vanity.</hi>

               <p>WHen he was about twenty six years of Age, he married a Daughter of Sir — <hi>Zinzans,</hi> who being in a consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before she married him, (and as I have heard for love of him, her Parents judging him much below her) died within seven or eight months after her marriage.</p>
               <p>About a year after her death he married Mistress <hi>Damaris Cable,</hi> (Daughter of Mr. <hi>Iames Cable</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Merchant,) who was a meet help to him in his Civil and Spiritual concerns; by her he had eleven children, one whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> his eldest son <hi>Samuel</hi> who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord in his youth, died young, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ten he left at his death with his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Widow. He had little of this world to leave his many Children, (about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a piece, as I have heard, after their Mothers death) but he hath left them much, if we consider the many fervent prayers, which night and day he poured out before the Lord on their behalves. I have read of one that when she came to die told her Children: <hi>I

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. His Sickness and Death.</head>
               <p>THat piety which did shine so brightly in his life, did wonderfully sparkle in his death. The messenger which God sent to call him hence, (for <hi>morbus est via ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>) was a violent Feaver, which he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as knowing it was sent by a gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to call him home to his Fathers House. No guest comes at any time a miss to him that keeps a constant Table, no providence, no not death it self comes at any time amiss to him that is always ready, and dieth dayly while he liveth. His Lamps were burning, his Oyl was ready in his Vessel, when the Bridegroom came.</p>
               <p>His Feaver had continued but a little while, before his friends did Prognosticate, that it would prove mortal, and remove him from thence, whom they loved as their own souls, and under whose Ministry they had sat with so much delight. But what he had been in the course of his life, the same did he continue to be to his death; Though his desease was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and his fits often acute and sharp, yet he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102536:36"/>
never complained, he might <hi>groan,</hi> but he never <hi>grumbled</hi>; his pain might cause him to <hi>mourn,</hi> but it did not make him <hi>murmur</hi>; he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the rod in the hand of his Father, and that Cup which his Father gave him to drink he submitted to. In his extremity his Faith and patience would eminently shine forth to the honour of God and comfort of those that visited him.</p>
               <p>Being sensible of his approaching death, he was exceeding solicitous for the Town and Parish, whereof he was Minister. Its a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy speech of <hi>Laelius in Cicer. de Amicit. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi non minori Curae est, qualis respublicae post mortem meam futura sit, quam qualis bodis sit. My care is as great what shall become of the Common-wealth when I am dead, as what it shall do while I live.</hi> So this good man was very anxious what should become of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when God should call him away. As <hi>Moses</hi> before he died, was careful to appoint a Successor, that might lead Gods people (whom he had brought into the borders) into the Land of Promise the Earthly <hi>Canaan.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> before he died took care for a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor that might further that good work which he had begun through grace, in many of them, and be helpful to conduct them to their Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> To this end he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led some of the Town, who were wise and

gracious) to him, and advised them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of some able good Minister to succeed him, and he commended Mr. <hi>Iohn Crump</hi> a worthy Minister to them as the fittest that he knew to be their Pastour. Afterwards Mr. <hi>Crump</hi> did succeed him not only in his place, but also in his faithfulness, and diligence, and serviceableness, to the comfort and advantage of the people.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Iacob</hi> before his death called his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together, to direct and advise what should befall them, so he called his Wife and Children to him; desiring his Wife <hi>not to be discouraged at his death:</hi> or <hi>to sorrow as they that have no hope, but to continue to serve God in Christ, to trust God, and to be chearful in him,</hi> adding this for her comfort. <hi>Though now we are parted for a time,</hi> yet <hi>there is a time coming that we shall be joyned again, never to part more.</hi> His children were most little, but those that were capable, he exhorted to fear God be times, and directing his speech to his eldest daughter, he said, <hi>Look to it that you meet me not at the day of Iudgment in an unregenerate estate.</hi> He commended all his Children to the Lord, and left them with him, in much Faith in the Covenant, which God had made to him and his.</p>
               <p>When Christian Friends came to visit him, he always laboured to require their kindness
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102536:37"/>
in Godly counsel and exhortations: he wisht them <hi>to be frequent in reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to prize highly and meditate much on the promises, to be holy and blameless in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, by no means to forsake but to stick close to ordinances, and to hold on in communion with the people of God in the Town.</hi> When <hi>Epictetus</hi> broke his leg (its reported of him) he discoursed as if his soul had been in another mans body. And when the bones of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> were sore vexed with the violence of his disease, he would discourse in such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Heavenly manner, as if he had ayled nothing.</p>
               <p>When one or two of those who had sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from communion with him, came to see him, he did with much affection bewail their Schism, prayed that God would bring them back again, and told them that <hi>he could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lay down his life, so they might joyn in Communion with the other Godly people in the Town.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was dying worshipped, leaning on his staff, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 21. So he on his dying bed was frequent in praying to and praising his God. It was but two nights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, though he were very sick, yet he made his bed his Pulpit, out of which he preached to some that came to see him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102536:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the preciousness of the promises, bid them look the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding rich and precious promises, we are made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and concerning the preciousness of Christ to Believers, desired them to turn to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Vnto you that believe he is precious</hi>; And oh, with what affectionate expressions would this Minister and Member of Christ Commend his head, the Pearl of great Price, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he had purchased, saying to his visitors, that <hi>one Promise was more precious then a World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He kept a pure conscience while he lived, and through mercy had a peaceable conscience when he died. Its said of <hi>

Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> when he came within two miles of the place of Execution leaped, saying, <hi>God be praised I am almost at home, and have not past a mile or two: and I shall be at my Fathers House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wilsons</hi> apprehension that Death drew near, was very comfortable to him. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of his society coming to take her leave
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102536:38"/>
of him (being to remove out of the Town) he pleasantly said to her, What will you say good Mistriss <hi>Crisp,</hi> if I get the start of you and get to Heaven before you get to <hi>Dover.</hi> When another came to see him, he asked her what she thought of him, who answering truly Sir, I think you are not far from your Fathers House; he replied, <hi>Oh that is good news indeed, which would make one to laugh for joy.</hi> When others spake to him of his death in a mornful way, he said to them, <hi>I bless God who hath suffered me to live so long, to do him some service; and now after I have done the work appointed me, is pleased to call me away so soon.</hi> Thus in the breathings of his Faith and hope he departed this Life, and commended his Spirit into the hands of him that redeemed it, and that on the Lords Day; that day on which he was wont to work so hard, was the day of his entrance into eternal rest, to keep an endless Sabbath.</p>
               <p>He needed no Picture or Monuments to preserve his Memory. His good works (though transient in themselves, are yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in the hearts of many, and) praise him in the Gate, for as <hi>Agesitaus</hi> dying said, If I have done good, that will be my Monument: if ill, all the Statues you can make will not keep my good name alive.</p>

                  <p>4. Reasons against pluralities,
<list>
                        <item>1. Plurality men cannot do their duties, which be mentioned in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not hold the place.</item>
                        <item>2. They that have pluralities, feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and not their Flock, therefore they be base Shephards, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. 1. 8.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102536:52"/>3. A good Minister is to feed by example, which requires residence and presence, I <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. Take heed to the Flock in your own person, as <hi>Zyra, Acts</hi> 20.28. And so I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that place.</item>
                        <item>4. They that love Christ themselves, must feed the Flock of Christ themselves, for loving Christ and feeding his Sheep, be spoken both to one person, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15. Now a personal duty may not be put of to another, as praying, hearing, reading, receiving Sacraments, and doing good works, and I cannot see how feeding the Flock of Christ in a mans own person, can be put off with the manifesting his love to Christ.</item>
                        <item>5. If our Church or Flock may need many Pastors, then one Pastor is hardly sufficient for three Churches or Flocks twenty miles distant, but one Church or Flock may need many Pastors, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1.
