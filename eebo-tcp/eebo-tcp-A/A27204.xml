            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And plain truth, but if you'le needs do things of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, do but loose your selves, not any part concerns your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, for then you are Meacocks, fools, and miserable, march off amain, within an inch of a Fircug, turn me oth' toe like a VVeather-cock, kill every day a Sergeant for a twelve moneth, rob the Exchequer, and burn all the Rolls, and these will make a shew.</p>

               <p>Considered to a VVidow, empty nothings, for here you venture but your persons, there the varnish of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, your discretions; why tis a monstrous thing to marry at all, especially as now tis made, me thinks a man, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing man, is more wise to me, and of a nobler tie, than all these trinkets, what do we get by women, but our senses, which is the rankest part about us satisfied, and when that's done, what are we? Crest fallen Cowards. VVhat benefit can children be, but charges and disobedience? VVhat's the love they render at one and twenty years? I pray die father: when they are young, they are like bells rung backwards, nothing but noise and giddinesse; and come to years once, there drops a son, byth' sword in his Mistresses quarrell, a great joy to his parents: A daughter ripe too, growes high and lusty in her blood, must have a heating, runs away with a supple ham'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingman: his twenty Nobles spent, takes to a trade, and learns to spin mens hair off; theres another, and most are of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will you marry?</p>

inherits, which she can neither law nor claw away to that, but little flesh, it were too much else; and that unwholsom too, it were too rich else; and to all this contempt of what she do's I can laugh at her tears, neglect her angers, hear her without a faith, so pity her as if she were a Traytour, moane her person, but deadly hate her pride; if you could do these, and had but this discretion, and like fortune, it were but an equal venture.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
               <p>It is well bestowed then.</p>

               <p>Your fair self, or your sister as it seems, for what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert I dare not know, unlesse a handsome subject for your chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or aptnesse in your noble will to do it, have showred upon my wanrs a timely bounty, which makes me rich in thanks, my best inheritance.</p>

               <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
               <p>I pray no more sir, if I may perswade you, your onely aptnesse to do this is recompence, and more than I expected.</p>

               <p>And for me further to be acquainted with it, besides the imputation of vain glory, were greedy thankings of my self, I did it not to be more affected to; I did it, and if it happened where I thought it fitted, I have my end; more to enquire is curious in either of us, more than that suspicious:</p>

to pious use and tender sighted, with the blown face of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, it blasts it, had you not come at all, but thought thanks; it had been too much, 'twas not to see your person.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
