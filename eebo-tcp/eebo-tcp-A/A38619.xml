         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had lately
with-drawn my
ſelf from publick
employments, &amp;
reprieved my Soul from the
dangerous attendants of a
<hi>COURTIER</hi>'s life, and
<pb facs="tcp:104552:3"/>
had now ancor'd my thoughts
in a bleſt retirement, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
had reſounding the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
of that poetical paſſage in
mine ears:
<q>
                  <l>Here is the Freedom the
Soul gains,</l>
                  <l>Enfranchiz'd from her
golden Chains.</l>
               </q>
Now began I to feel thoſe
thoughts of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie,
alwayes foſtered by
me, though till now, as it
were ill attended, to give a
freſh and ſprightly Spring in
my Soul. I could not but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their return, give them
a wonted and merited Well-come,
<pb facs="tcp:104552:3"/>
that I might by the
gain of this inward and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Light, repair my vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
reſsignment of that
outward and deceitfull ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour:
Beſides, by this courſe,
I had hopes to wipe off a
publick guilt, for now did
I apprehend the charge of
a deſertour of publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and of the Laws
of my Countrie likely to fall
upon me, therefore leſt this
might iſſue a deep cenſure,
I fled to that Sanctuarie, the
Studie of the Occult, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
unſearchable Laws and
Cuſtomes of Nature in the
Univerſe, the common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="tcp:104552:4"/>
of all, hoping a ſecuritie
in this ſtudie, and a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from this Policie. For
certainly civil Conſtitutions
will not decree any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Amercement upon him,
who laying down the burden
of thoſe Troubles, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
himſelf to the general
ſervice of the World.</p>
            <p>Now was my Soul rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within it ſelf thought
concerning the Sovereigntie,
Lawes, Order, Government,
Harmonie, Effects, Cauſes,
yea, the unconceiveable Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Nature; now indeed
was I loſt in admiration of
theſe, which aſtoniſhment,
<pb facs="tcp:104552:4"/>
though it be an evidence of
ignorance, yet it is alſo an
incentive to knowledge, for
it cauſeth the Soul to ſoar
above, by which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled
with a burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to know what it is, as
yet ignorant of, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to.</p>
            <p>My Soul being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
brought ſeveral phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
Conſtitutions to a
ſevere Text, and upon the
touch, aſſented not to their
Veritie, becauſe Nature did
ſeem to dart ſome weak and
waining Light, as it were
breaking forth upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
and border of a ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:104552:5"/>
diſcerned Truth, till at
length, the Light began ſo
to riſe, as to break through
the encompaſsing Fogs, and
to break into my Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was not onely made
more reſplendent, but alſo
more confident, not onely to
view the ground, but alſo to
dig for the Treaſure.</p>
            <p>The firſt Errours of the
Ancients, and which are the
worst and radicall Errours
that came into my thoughts,
were thoſe concerning the
Principles of Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the firſt Matter and
that Univerſal Form, from
which all things flow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:104552:5"/>
the Number of the
Elements, their Qualities,
their Oppoſition, Scituation,
Reciprocation; when I had
ſeriouſly turned theſe within
my thoughts, I layed hold of
an Opinion different from the
Current; neither was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
nor their ingenious,
but unſatisfactorie reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
able to divert my mind
from that perpetual devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which it ſtood to the
light of Nature. So now
what I firſt admired, I now
affected, yea, that Love,
which hath no weapons but
fierie rayes, strook my ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:104552:6"/>
a flame, to enter into the
moſt ſecret and ſacred rooms
of Nature.</p>
            <p>But I was long in a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Diſpute with my ſelf,
whether it were my dutie to
communicate to you, <hi>the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Philoſophie,</hi> thoſe
ſecrets I have found, ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
leſt it might prove a
diſguſt to you, a danger to
my ſelf; for I found Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
the beſt Counſellour
to give me warning to be
wiſe by the folly of others,
and to learn to ſtand by their
falls; for I alwayes was mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
how many had wrackt
their credit by ſcribling, how
<pb facs="tcp:104552:6"/>
our modern Wits are cloſe in
their commendations, but
laviſh enough in their detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of other mens labours,
how attempting their ſouls
are in fancying and foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
follies, how obſtinate in
the retaining a conceived
Truth; yea, I conſidered it
was not onely a project of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie,
but alſo of danger,
to pull up a received and
an acknowledged Opinion,
and to implant a new and
divers.</p>
            <p>But in this Conflict, (Ye
moſt ingenious Aſſertours of
Natural Light) the victorie
fell upon the love of you, and
<pb facs="tcp:104552:7"/>
of Truth, ſo that I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
that ſince thoſe
had been the Motives to the
Diſquiſition of theſe Truths,
they ſhould alſo be the Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to their publication.
Yet let me have this Boon
granted, that if you will be
competent or juſt Judges,
let not the ſwoln names of
<hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and of any
other prime Philoſophers, be
ſummoned as convicting wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
or empannell'd as a
condemning Jury, but lay
aſide their nominal, though
ſeemingly real authority, and
bind not your ſouls to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
credulity of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
<pb facs="tcp:104552:7"/>
but preſerve your
Souls free to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>In the reading of the
learned Monuments of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Ages, let not the popular
fancy of their general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
bewitch you into a
blind Belief of all their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Far be it from me to
ſtain their Credit, or detract
from their Learning, who
alwayes had exhibited by me
almoſt a Divine Adoration,
there is no earthly glory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible
to theirs: they were
the Men that firſt took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Philoſophie into their
arms, and nouriſhed it up to
ſo incredible a ſtrength and
<pb facs="tcp:104552:8"/>
ſtature, that thoſe lofty ſouls
ſeemed to have cut off from
ſucceeding Ages, the hope
of an Addition to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning.</p>
            <p>Yet as for the deep ſearch
of the winding creeks of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and for the exquiſite
knowledge of her concealed
Myſteries, the growing Age
of Philoſophie, even in its
own judgement, did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them, theſe were
brought forth by the fertile
Brains of future Times, they
brought to light Obſcurities,
they poliſh'd rough-hewn prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
they propt up perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities.
<pb facs="tcp:104552:8"/>
So did Knowledge
get its accompliſhment by
Age, and Truth its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Time, which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
the vigour of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
years, and that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of things we know, is
far leſs than of thoſe of which
we are ignorant.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy is not like a
Garment, as that age ſhould
wear it or worſe it, and they
that pretend a gray head to
their errours, by this ſeek
not ſo much to patronize it,
as to diſcredit it.</p>
            <p>Forbear I beſeech you, by
an unadviſed cenſure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
me without plea, if I
<pb facs="tcp:104552:9"/>
ſhall ſeem to unſettle the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries
of Philoſophy, be not
angry, and accuſe me as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious,
but conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I do not aym at their
ſettlement rather than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?
whether I do not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirm than weaken her
priviledges? whether I do
not rather honour than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr
her Royalty? upon which
grounds I hope She will, as
by way of requital, not deny
me her aſsiſtance, as a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
againſt the deluſions of
Sophiſters, and a breaſt-plate
againſt the environed darts
of either Envy or Ignorance.
Theſe Beaſts will bark, the
<pb facs="tcp:104552:9"/>
firſt pining at anothers good,
the ſecond raging in its own
clouds, both break into the
cultivated Gardens of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the delightfull
paradiſe of Philoſophy, and
either ſnip or blaſt the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of a more fortunate Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
Theſe to no purpoſe
ſtrive to ſtop my courſe by
their frights, I am ſeated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their higheſt reach; as
long as I can ſee the Deity of
Truth, under her patronage I
walk, I work ſecure. Onely
be you pleaſed to accept theſe
ſprinklings of my retirement,
with the ſame ſoul it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
if any thing ſeem in
<pb facs="tcp:104552:10"/>
it to diſrelliſh, deal ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as that you may ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to comply, than
wholly to refuſe. I ſhall in
the interim reach my end, if
my pains ſhall cauſe you to
fall upon greater attempts
with better ſucceſs.</p>

the ſubtile from the thick, and
as it were a thin ſpirit from that

from the Word of God. For
light, which is a fiery ſpirit, by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
things of a diverſe nature, did
drive down the thicker darkneſs from
the neareſt and higheſt Region, and
uniting the matter of one and the
ſame kind, being of a thin and a more
ſpiritual ſubſtance, inflamed it as an
unquencheable oyl, to burn before
the Throne of the Divine Majeſty.
This is the <hi>Empyraean Heaven,</hi> ſeated

of the Heavens and of the reſt of the

For it is the property of moiſture to
flow, and the continuity of every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

For moiſture is the glue and joynct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure

fire acting upon moiſture by heat,
doth rarifie, for heat is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

proceeds a congregation of things of

            <p n="22">22. The Architectonique Spirit
of the world began the work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
from two univerſal principles;
the one formal, the other material,
for otherwiſe what is the meaning of

created the Heaven and the Earth?</hi> &amp;c.
unleſs that in the beginning of the

information of the matter, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
it into two chief principles,
a formal and a material Heaven and
Earth; by the word <hi>Earth,</hi> is to be
underſtood that dark, and as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaped
maſs of the waters and Abyſs,
as is apparent by the ſubſequent
words, <hi>(The Earth was void and
without form, and darkneſs was upon

Creatour did ſhut in and compriſe
within the higheſt, to wit, the <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean
Heaven,</hi> which is Natures firſt
formal, though fartheſt principle.</p>
            <p n="23">23. For the Spirit of God, which
is the brightneſs of the Deity, being
poured out upon the Waters, that is,
upon the moiſt and large ſurface of
the depths, in the very moment of
creation, light preſently broke up,
which in the twinkling of the eye,
ſurprized the higheſt and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
part of the matter, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
it as it were with a fringe, and
border of light, as that lightening is
which is darted from the Eaſt to the
Weſt, or like a flame which fires the
ſmoak. So was the birth of the firſt
day, but the lower portion of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
devoid of light, continued night,

            <p n="24">24. Concerning that firſt Heaven,
that formal Principle, it is not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have been void, empty, and

evidence, that that Heaven which
was firſt ſpread out, was forthwith
ſevered by the light from the ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
dark Maſs, by reaſon of the
nearneſs of the Glory and Majeſty of
God, and the preſence of that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Spirit flowing from it.</p>
            <p n="25">25. There was therefore in the
beginning two Principles of all
things created, one full of light, and
bordering upon the ſpiritual Nature,
the other wholly corporeal and dark;
the firſt, that it might be the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of motion, light, and heat; the
ſecond, of a drowſie, dark, and cold
being: the firſt active and maſculine,
the other the paſſive and feminine
Principle. On the part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
comes a motion in the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
world to Generation, from
whence proceeds life; from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part comes the motion to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
the principle of death. So that

and acts without from it ſelf, the
Divine Nature impatient of its ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and taken with its own beauty
in the light already created, as in a
Mirrour, and earneſtly deſirous to
enlarge it, and to multiply his image,
commanded that light to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſprung forth the ſecond day, and
there was ſeen the ſecond manſion

all the airy Region, in whoſe

kindled and ſcattered: In the lower
are ſeated the ſeven wandering Stars
according to their order, that they

and that ſhade that lay under

of the Heavens was enlightened,
which we rightly term <hi>Air,</hi> or the

did overcaſt the whole face of the

was ſo thickened by reaſon of
the ſtraitneſs of the room, and the

paſſed into a huge maſs of a watry
Nature, the Kernel and Centre of
the whole workmanſhip, as it were a
dale and heap of darkneſs, being
poiz'd in the middeſt of the waters,
and bound up of the dregs and thick

Man the lord of all, and provide to

the like to be in the other globous

<hi>That the ſoul of the World was in the

that the body of the Sun ſhould have

            <p n="31">31. Before the Contraction of this
light into the body of the Sun, the
earth ſpent an idle time in its ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
looking for a male, that being
impregnated by his copulation, it
might bring forth all ſorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for as yet it had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely of abortives and Embryoes,
to wit, of Vegetables onely. For the
weak and faint heat of that ſcattered
light, could not get the conqueſt of
that moiſt and cold matter, nor put
forth its virtue in any higher actings.</p>
            <p n="32">32. From the light therefore the
Elements, as well as the firſt matter,
had their information, and ſo attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a joynt nature of light, and by
kindred a faſt friendſhip betwixt
themſelves, not according to the
vulgar opinion, an hatred and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
they embrace each the other

that they may joyn themſelves to

the making up of ſeveral mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
according to their ſeveral kinds.
But the light of the Sun being of a
far greater power than this former,
is the Form of all forms, or the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
form which doth convey all
natural forms in the work of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
into the diſpoſed matter and
ſeeds of things. For every particular
nature hath within it a ſpark of light,
whoſe beams do in a ſecret ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with an active &amp; motive power.</p>
            <p n="33">33. It was neceſſary that the
entire portion of the firſt matter,
allotted to this lower Region, as well
as the Elements who did flow from
it, ſhould be ſeaſoned from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with a light tincture of that
firſt Light, whereby they might be
the better fitted to receive that
greater and more powerfull light in
the information of mixt bodies. So
fire with fire, water with water, light
with light being <hi>homogeneous</hi> bodies,
have a perfect union.</p>
            <p n="34">34. From the ſight &amp; efficacy of the
Sun, we may inferre that he is in the
ſtead of an heart to the Univerſe, for
from him is life derived to all parts,
for light is the Chariot of life, yea,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104552:22"/>
the fountain and next cauſe, and the
ſouls of creatures are the beams of
that heavenly light, which do breath
life into them, exempting onely the

            <p n="35">35. God hath imprinted in the
Sun a threefold image of his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the firſt in his unity, for Nature
cannot away with a multiplicity of
Suns, no more than the Deity can
with a plurality of Gods, that ſo one
may be the ſpring of all. Secondly,
in its Trinity, or his threefold office.
For the Sun, as Gods Vicegerent,
doth diſpenſe all the benefits of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by light, motion, and heat: from
hence is life, which is the ſupream
and moſt accompliſht act of Nature
in this world, beyond which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Light and Motion iſſues heat, as the

the firſt and the ſecond Perſon. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God, who is the Eternal Light,
Infinite, Incomprehenſible, could
expreſs and demonſtrate himſelf to

therefore wonder, why the Eternal
Sun did beautifie that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Creation, the third day of the Suns
riſing, did man riſe out of the Earth:
by the time of his production, and the
number of the days is ſhadowed
forth a great myſterie. For as upon
the fourth day of the Creation the
whole light of the Heaven was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
into the ſingle bodie of the
Sun, and on the third day from the
making of the Sun, which was the
ſixth day from the beginning of the
Creation, the Clay of the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the breath of life, and was
formed into a living man the image
of God: So on the fourth Millenary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104552:23"/>
day from the beginning of the world
the uncreated Sun, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine
Nature, infinite and never before
comprehended within any bounds,
was willing to be comprized, and in
a manner ſhut into the cage of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodie. Upon the third day or
millenarie (for a thouſand years with
God are but as one day) after the
firſt riſing of that Sun, and about
the end of the ſixth day, to wit, of
the millenarie from the Creation,
ſhall fall out the glorious Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Humane Nature in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming of that ſupream Judge,
which was alſo praeſignified to us by
his bleſſed Reſurrection on the third

roul up the ſecret age and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinie
of the world.</p>
            <p n="39">39 Although the Almightie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his pleaſure, created the
World, yet could have brought it out
of darkneſs into light (if his will had
ſo been) in a moment, and by a beck:
for he ſaid, and it was ſo. Yet the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Creation of principles, and
ſucceſſively of the natures according
to their times, was ſet in the mind of
God, which order, rather than the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104552:24"/>
work it ſelf of Creation, that ſacred
Philoſopher ſeems to deſcribe in his
Geneſis.</p>
            <p n="40">40 There ſeems to have been in
the beginning a threefold way of the
information of the firſt matter. For
in what portion of the matter there
was an irrational lightſom form, and
without proportion above the reſt, as
in the Empyrean heaven, where the
light firſt ſeized upon the matter,
then the form having as it were an
infinite virtue, did ſwallow up its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and tranſlated it into a nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſpiritual and free from any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p n="41">41 But where the virtues of the
form and matter did meet in an equal
poyz and a juſt equallitie, according
to which, the aetherial heaven, and
the celeſtial bodies are informed,
there the action of the light, whoſe
force in acting is of greateſt power,
did proceed ſo far, that it did reſcue
its matter from all original blemiſhes,
as alſo from the loathſom infection of
corruption after a wonderfull ſort,
by illumination and attenuation, and
this is to be accounted as a truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
information.</p>
            <p n="42">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:104552:24"/>
42 The third way of informing
the matter is, in which a weaker form
remains, as it often happens, though
after divers ways in this our Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
region, in which the appetite of
the matter, which is an evidence of
weakneſs and imperfection, luxuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and laviſhly ſpringing in its baſis
and root, cannot be ſufficiently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
by the reaſon of its remotion and
diſtance from its former principle,
neither can this weakneſs be cured.
Hence the matter not being fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
according to its deſire, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
under the deſire of a new
form, which having attained, it doth
bring to it, as to its husband, the
dowrie, a large wardrobe of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and faults. This ſullen, perverſe
wrangling and inconſtant matter,
doth always burn for new beds, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
wooing all forms which it longs
for if abſent, hates, if preſent.</p>
            <p n="43">43 By which it is evident, that the
leaven of alteration and corruption,
and at length the fatal venom of
death do happen, not from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie
of qualities, but from an
infected Matrix, and from the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous
poyſon of a dark matter, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104552:25"/>
this cauſeth it ſo to fall out both in
elements and in the mixt bodies of
this lower region: becauſe the form
weakned and inſufficient by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement
and imperfection, and being
not of a juſt poiz and aſſize, could not
purge it out in its firſt and radical
union. This is confirmed by holy
Writ, in which we may obſerve our
firſt Parent was not created accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his matter immortal, but that
he might be guarded from the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and corruption of the matter,
and therefore God ſet in Paradiſe a
Tree abounding with the fruit of Life
which he might make uſe of as his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertour
&amp; guardian from the frailty of
his matter, and the bondage of death,
from the preſence and uſe of this he
was ſequeſtrated after his fatal fall,
and final ſentence.</p>
            <p n="44">44 Two there were therefore firſt
principles of Nature, before which
were none, after which all, to wit the
firſt matter, and its univerſal form,
by the copulation of which iſſued
the Elements as ſecond principles,
which are nothing elſe but the firſt
matter diverſly informed; out of the
mixture of this is made the ſecond
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104552:25"/>
matter, which is the neareſt ſubject
of accidents, and doth receive the
various turns of Generation and
Corruption. Theſe are the degrees,
this the order of the Principles of
Nature.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Thoſe who annex to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Form, a third Principle,
<hi>viz.</hi> Privation, do blaſt Nature with
a Calumnie, far from whoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it is to admit a Principle that
ſhall go counter to her intention,
but her end in Generation being
to obtain a Form, to which Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is adverſe, certainly this
cannot be part of Natures aim:
They had ſpoken more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
if they had made Love a
principle of Nature, for the matter
being widowed in its form, covets
eagerly the embracing of a new.
But Privation is the meer abſence of
a form, upon which ground the
honourable title of being a principle
of Nature, is no way due to it, but
rather to Love, which is a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
betwixt that which deſires, and
that which is deſired, betwixt what is
beautifull, and what is deformed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
matter and form.</p>
            <p n="46">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104552:26"/>
46. Corruption is far nearer than
Privation to the principle of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſince that is a motion diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the matter to generation by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
degrees of alteration; but
Privation acts nothing, is of no work
in generation, but Corruption doth
both promove and prepare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it may be put in a capacity
of receiving the form, and as it were
a mediatrix, doth act Pander-like,
that the matter may the more eaſily
get a ſatisfaction for its luſt, and by
his help may the ſooner obtain the
copulation of a form: Corruption
therefore is the inſtrumental and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
cauſe of Generation. But
Privation is nothing elſe but a meer
vacancy of an active and formal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:
<hi>and darkneſs was upon the face
of the depths,</hi> to wit, of the uninform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and dark matter.</p>
            <p n="47">47. The harmony of the Univerſe
conſiſts in the diverſe and gradual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the matter. For from
the poized mixture of the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and its form, flows both the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Elements, and of the
Region of the world, which is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but truly ſet out by <hi>Hermes,</hi> when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104552:26"/>
he ſaid, <hi>That whatſoever is below,
hath an aſsimulation with ſomewhat
above.</hi> For things above and below,
were made of the ſame matter and
form, differencing onely in reſpect
of their mixture, ſcite and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in which the diſtinction of the
parts of the world, and the latitude
of all Natures, are handled.</p>
            <p n="48">48. We muſt believe that the firſt
matter, after it had received inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
from the light, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by it into ſeveral things,
did go wholly out of it ſelf, and was
tranſmitted into the Elements, and
that which was compounded by
them, and was wholly exhauſted in
the conſummation of the work of the
Univerſe, ſo that thoſe things which
were cloſed in her, being brought
forth, and expoſed to view, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
wholly to lie hid in them, and we
muſt acknowledge it is not to be
found in a ſeparation from them.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Nature hath left us a ſhadow
of that ancient confuſed Maſs, or firſt
matter in drie water, not wetting,
which riſing out of thoſe impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes
of the earth or Lakes, doth
ſpring forth big with a manifold ſeed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104552:27"/>
being alſo volatile by reaſon of its
lightneſs through its heat, from
which being coupled with its male,
he that can take out and ſeparate,

Elements, he may well

The Earth, Water, and Air, may be

thick, impure, and indigeſted, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from the right of perfect ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
for they are rather the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows

true Elements.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Thoſe Elements which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and in making bodies, although
they are not to be found out before

their parts have a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Elements for the generation of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
alone knows how out of them to
make all particulars, and to reſolve
them, being made, into them again.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Let not them therefore refuſe
the Light, who working about the
Elements of Nature, either in the
production of ſome body from them,
or the reſolution of ſome into them,
create their own trouble, ſince theſe
Elements are onely ſubject to the
dominion of Nature, and delivered
to her onely from their beginning,
altogether unknown to all our art,
and not compaſſible by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p n="55">55. The Element of Nature may
be termed the moſt ſimple portion
of the firſt matter, diſtinguiſhed by
its peculiar difference and qualities,
conſtituting a part of the eſſence in
the material compoſition of mixt
bodies.</p>
            <p n="56">56. By the Elements of Nature,
are denoted the material principles,
of which ſome have a greater purity

and perfection than others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greater Power and Virtue
of that form that gives the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They are for the moſt part
diſtinguiſhed according to their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or denſity, ſo that thoſe that are
more thin, and approch nearer to a
ſpiritual ſubſtance, are therefore the
more pure and light, and ſo are the
more fit for motion and action.</p>
            <p n="57">57. Upon this ground it was that
reverend Antiquity did ſeign, that
the whole Empire of the world was
divided between the three Brothers,
the Sons of <hi>Saturn</hi> as coheirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it acknowledged onely three
Elementary Natures, or rather three
parts of the Univerſe. For by <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the Omnipotent, who ſhared hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as his portion, armed with his
treble-darted Thunder-bolt, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the reſt of the brothers, what
did thoſe profeſſours of myſteries
underſtand, but that the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Region of heavenly bodies,
do aſſume a priviledge of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over theſe inferiour beings. But
they placed <hi>Juno,</hi> wife to <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
to praeſide over the loweſt Region of
the Heaven, or our Air, becauſe this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104552:29"/>
Region troubled with vapours, being
moiſt and cold is as it were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
defiled and impure, and neareſt
approaching to a female tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as alſo becauſe it is ſubjected
to the orders of the higher Regions,
receive their effects, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
them to us, twiſting it ſelf with
more condenſed natures, and ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to the bent of Heaven. But
becauſe male and female differ one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in ſex, not in kind, therefore would
they not have the Air, or the lower
Heaven to be diſtinct in its eſſence
and kind, as another Element from
the higher Heaven, but onely diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified
in place and by accidents. To
<hi>Neptune</hi> the god of the Sea, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
a dominion over the waters.
By <hi>Pluto,</hi> the lord of the lower parts,
abounding in wealth, they denoted
the Globe of the Earth repleniſhed
with riches, with the deſire of which
the minds of men being inflamed, are
bitterly tormented. So that thoſe
wiſe men admitted of three parts of
the Univerſe, or if you pleaſe, of
three Elements, becauſe under the
Nature of Heaven they comprized
the name of Fire, and therefore did
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104552:29"/>
they draw <hi>Jupiter</hi> armed with his
Thunder.</p>
            <p n="58">58. We are Schollars to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in this, that all the bodies of
mixt beings, have their analyſis and
reſolution into drie and moiſt, and
that all the excrements of creatures,
are terminated by the ſame differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
from whence it is clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that their bodies are made up
onely of two ſenſible Elements, in
which notwithſtanding the other are
virtually and effectually. But Air,
or the Element of the lower Heaven,
is not the object of our ſenſe, becauſe
in reſpect of us it is a kind of ſpiritual
being. The fire of Nature, becauſe
it is the formal principle, cannot be
wrought to any ſeparation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
by any deſtruction by
way of reſolution, nor by any art or
artifice of man. For the nature of
Forms is not ſubjected to the cenſure
of the Senſes, becauſe of its ſpiritual
being.</p>
            <p n="59">59. The Earth is the thickeſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Univerſe, therefore is it
accounted the heavieſt and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of it, we muſt aſſert its nature
contrary to the received opinion, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104552:30"/>
be accidentally drie, becauſe it doth
retain moſt of the cloſe and dark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the firſt matter, but a ſhade
and darkneſs are the coverts of cold,
from whence they flie the light, and
are diametrically oppoſite to it, but
the Earth, in reſpect of its extream
denſity, is the mother of ſhade and
darkneſs, hardly paſſable by light
and heat, therefore roughly knit by
an heightened cold. And for this
reaſon black choller is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the coldeſt humour of all, becauſe
it is under the power of the Earth,
the Earth under <hi>Saturns,</hi> who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Authour of a cold and
melancholick temperature. Further,
thoſe things that are ingendered in
the bowels of the Earth, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Earth, as Marble and
Stones are of a cold nature, although
we muſt otherwiſe conceive of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
becauſe they are rather of an
airy nature, and have in them ſparkles
of the Fire of Nature, and a ſpirit of
Sulphur congealing their moiſt and
cold matter. Yet <hi>Mercurie</hi> ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the reſt in moiſture and cold, is
beholding to the Earth for his cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to the Water for his moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104552:30"/>
It is otherwiſe with thoſe things
that are produced in the Sea, as in
<hi>Amber</hi> and <hi>Coral,</hi> and many other
things that have their beings from
the Sea and freſh Waters, which as
it is apparent, are of a hot temper,
ſo that we have this inſtruction both
from reaſon and experience, that
the greateſt coldneſs is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Earth, not to the
Water.</p>
            <p n="60">60. But drineſs doth agree to the
Earth accidentally onely, and in a
remiſs degree; for it was created in
the middeſt of the Waters, and the
order of beings required, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its gravity, being ſunk in the
Waters, it ſhould never ſeparate from
them; but the Creatour uſing his
Prerogative, having removed the
Waters, gave to it an open ſurface,
that ſo there might be room made
both for the creation of mixed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and for their habitation. The
Earth therefore was enfranchiz'd
from its natural yoke of bondage and
ſubjection to the Waters, not by
any order of Nature, but by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of favour, that ſo having its
face wipt, it might lift up a dry viſage
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104552:31"/>
to the view of the Heavens, and
might partake of the welcome light
of the world.</p>
            <p n="61">61. Every cold and drie is averſe
from the faculty of Generation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be helped out by ſome etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
helps; therefore it was the will of
the Supream Authour of Nature, to
heat the cold womb of the Earth
with an heavenly fire, and adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the drie globe of the Earth
the moiſt nature of Water, that ſo by
the mixture of two generative cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
moiſt, and hot, the ſterility of
the Earth might be helped, and that
by the mediation of the concourſe
and mixture of all the Elements, the
Earth might be made a natural Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
for fruitfull Generation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Elements, and all qualities are
in the Earth.</p>
            <p n="62">62. The body of the Earth was
rightly created by the great God of
a ſpongeous nature, that ſo there
might be a receptacle for Air, Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and heavenly Influences, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that the moiſt vapours being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by the force of inward heat,
from the Centre to the Superficies,
through the porous paſſages of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104552:31"/>
Earth, might by a mean putrefaction
corrupt the ſeeds of things, and ſo
prepare for generation; theſe being
thus diſpoſed, receive that enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and heavenly heat. For Nature
hath ſunk in the depths a magnetick
love, by the actings of which they
draw down, and ſuck out the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and virtue of things above, which
do increaſe the ſtrength of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and haſten the ſweetneſs of
vital Air.</p>
            <p n="63">63. The heat that comes from the
inwards of the Earth, is moiſt and
impure, and doth corrupt by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the tainted mixture of Earth
and Water; But the moſt pure and
heavenly doth generate by excitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
dilatation, and furthering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
heat to life, even that inbred
heat which is hidden in the ſeeds of
things, and as Natures ſecret cloſed
in their centre. But becauſe both
theſe heats are of the ſame kind, they
have a joynt and amicable operation
in the act of generation, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
united, until they are
brought forth to life and large ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Water is of a middle nature,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104552:32"/>
betwixt what is thick and what is of
a thin nature, betwixt the Earth
and the Air; Natures <hi>menſtruum,</hi> a

            </p>
            <p n="65">65. The moiſt Element is <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
which ſometimes aſſuming the

receiving their inſtructions, doth
trade in commerce as their agent or
factor, amongſt the remoteſt natures
of the Univerſe, neither will he leave
his trafficquing till all the Elements
of the corruptible Nature receive
their fixation and purgation by fire,
and there iſſue upon it an Univerſal
Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Water, being the neareſt in
nature to the firſt matter, doth eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive her impreſs. The Chaos,
the ancient Parent of all things, was
a kind of ſubtile and dark vapour, a
kind of a moiſt dark ſubſtance, like a
thin ſmoak, from whoſe moſt ſubtile
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104552:32"/>
part the Heavens are drawn forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
order, which a three-fold differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
divides into a three-fold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
to wit, the Supream, which
is the nobleſt, the middle which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
the ſecond place of dignity
and honour, the loweſt is inferiour
to the other two both in ſcite and
honour. The thicker ſubſtance of
the matter went to the making of
that watry heap, which is a middle
nature. The thickeſt part, which is
as it were the dregs of the whole
Maſs ſate down to the bottom, and
was ſetled for the globe of the Earth.
The extremities of this artifice, to
wit, the Heaven and the Earth, did
recede more from the firſt ſtate of
their matter, and from their ancient
ſhape; the Heaven in regard of its
great rarity and levity, the Earth in
reſpect of its great denſity and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But the Water, which was a
mean betwixt them, continued a
nature more like the firſt formleſs
Abyſs from whence it proceeds, ſo
that with eaſe it turns it ſelf by rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
into ſmoak or vapour, which
is the image of the ancient <hi>Hyle,</hi> or
firſt Matter.</p>
            <p n="67">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104552:33"/>
67. Moiſture is more proper to
Water than Coldneſs, becauſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is of a greater rarity, and more

which communicate moſt of light

               </gap>
retained the ſymbole of moiſture
from the firſt matter the Abyſs, as
the Earth coldneſs. For the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
Spirit of the World divided the
more thick parts into thoſe two near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-allied
Natures.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Coldneſs wooes Drineſs, and
inveſts it ſelf with it where it is vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
predominant by the conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of moiſt beings, and by the
deſiccation of them, as is evident in
Snow, Ice, and Hayl. For it is the
work of Nature to bind and drie the
Water, than which nothing is more
humid by the proper inſtrument of
Cold; yea, the principal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſubject of Heat and Cold, is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity,
by both which it is ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſailed, till it be conquered: from
whence it falls out, that in <hi>Autumn</hi>
ſo many drie leaves fall at the firſt
cold, that the ſtalks of feeble Plants
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104552:33"/>
upon the ſtrength of Winter, in the
height of Drought, are void of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and drie away: The cold pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
doth ſo ſcorch, and makes
ſo furious an aſſult upon the vital
humours: hence proceeds flaggy and
withered age, at length death comes
and cuts down all with his well-ſet
ſickle, and ſweeps you into his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Granary. How then can any
one conceive Cold to be friendly to
Moiſture, and to be its inherent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty?
Since Nature ſuffers not the
Elements to act againſt each other,
leſt they ſhould deſtroy and oppoſe
each the others powers, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
Cold quickly would bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a remiſs and weak moiſture, and
would ſwallow it up all by a violent
conſtriction: ſo that by this means
one of the Elements being loſt, there
would neceſſarily follow an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the work of the reſt, and a
deficiency in the generation of all
things. It is therefore not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Law of Nature, to inveſt
Water with the property of being
cold in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Out of theſe ſolider Natures
of Earth and Water, doth Nature
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104552:34"/>
extract her Elements, by which ſhe
compacts Veſſels and corporeal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:
for out of the commixture of
both is made a clay, which is the
next matter of things in generation:
for it is in ſtead of the Chaos, In
which virtually and confuſedly are
all Elements. Out of this clay was
the firſt Father of mankind created,
and after all Generation iſſued from
it. In the Generation of creatures,
is a clay made of the ſeed and the
<hi>menſtruum,</hi> from whence proceeds
the living Creature. In the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Vegetables, the ſeeds do firſt
fall into a ſubtile clay by putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then are wrought up to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
body. In the generation of
Mettals, there comes forth a clay
from the perfect mixture of Sulphur
and Mercury, and their reſolution in
a fat Water, by which means the
mettallick bodies are indurated by
a long decoction. In the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
reſolving of mettals, and in
the creation of that Philoſophical
Secret, firſt is brought forth a clay
out of the ſeed of both parents pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and mixed.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Water is the baſe and root of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104552:34"/>
all moiſtures, yea, it is moiſture it
ſelf: from which all moiſt things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their denomination, therefore
Water may be rightly defined the
Fountain of the moiſt Element, or
the Spring of moiſture, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
it is to wet by its liquour. But
thoſe things are termed humid, which
do in themſelves according to a leſs
or greater degree, contain a moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
or a watry liquor. Moiſture is
receivable of all qualities, ſo bloud
and yellow choler are humours, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with their own heat, although
they have their foundation in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
of Water. <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and
the like are empowered with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and a fiery nature. The burning
Water, and many other eſſences
which are extracted from oyls and
water, do abound in heat, although
the root of them, which is Water, be
cold, becauſe Nature doth firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
in a moiſt eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t various reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
and ſignatures of its powers,
and doth in it en-root and infuſe its
principal and choice qualities. Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is the firſt ſubject of Nature,
upon which her prime care is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
her firſt charge layed out,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104552:35"/>
by whoſe liquour it doth dilute and

tinctures: To it firſt do the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

            <p n="71">71. The lower Waters being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into two, do occupy a double
ſeat, for one part of them brimming
the Earth, doth lean on it as it were
as its proper Baſe, and with the Earth
makes but one Globe: the other
part flying upward, doth range up
and down the Region of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Air, and there making to it
ſelf many maſqued fancies of bodies,
and various figures of ſeveral phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms
doth reave hither and thither,

            <p n="72">72. Always there is a great part of
the Waters that keep above, and
being driven to and fro by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roach
of the Wind, doth poſt over
divers parts of the Air, which was in
this manner ordered from the Day
of the Creation, by the enacting of
the Wiſdom of GOD, that ſo the

Earth, might be unmasked and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the generation of things. For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104552:35"/>
the Channels of the Sea and Rivers
were not ſufficient to receive the

break the confining Bars of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and come tumbling down, it
would not onely cover the plain face
of the Earth, but it may be, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top
the higheſt Mountains. Such an

we may gueſs, did occaſion the

            <p n="73">73. Water is not onely ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into a vapour by heat alone, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it onely bound up in a cloud
by cold, but to both the virtues of
the Sun and the Stars do contribute
their aids, not onely by multiplying
the vigours of the Elements, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
by a kind of Magnetick virtue, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
and retaining a moiſture
much or leſs, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
poſition, and the diverſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Heaven: from whence we
obſerve the various ordering of years
and times; for indeed that Maſs of
Waters is not kept in, ſo poized one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p n="75">75. They are much out of the
way, who do attribute to Air moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
in the higheſt degree, upon this
ground, becauſe it is eaſily kept in
within the bounds of another, but
hardly within its own; for this is the
property of light and liquid bodies,
not of moiſt, and ſo doth better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with fire and Heaven, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are more rarified, than with
Water and Air: for bodies that are
rarified, becauſe they of their own
will flow every where, cannot be
comprized within their own bounds,
and therefore ſtand in need of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Onely firm and ſolid bodies
are kept in within their own compaſs
and ſuperficies, which cannot be
done by thoſe things that are of a
ſubtile nature, becauſe by reaſon of
their thinneſs they melt and are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104552:36"/>
fluid, and ſo leſs conſiſtent. From
whence this flows that the Air is a
body of greater rarity, but not of
greater humidity.</p>
            <p n="76">76. The Air from it ſelf hath no

but ſometimes hath them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Air is a middle nature betwixt things
below and above, and ſo doth with

that border upon it, from whence it
happens that its inferiour Region, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

a variety of temper, which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
is occaſioned by the changes
of the neighbouring and thicker bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Water and Earth, whoſe ſtate
is eaſily altered by heat and cold.</p>
            <p n="77">77. The whole Air is the Heaven,
the floor of the World, Natures
ſieve, through which the virtues and
influences of other bodies are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
a middle nature it is that
knits all the ſcattered natures of the
Univerſe together: a moſt thin ſmoak
kindled by the fire of Heaven, into a
light, as it were an immortal flame:
the ſubject of light, and ſhade of day
and night, impatient of vacuity: the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104552:37"/>
principal tranſparent: the eaſieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
of almoſt all qualities and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
yet the conſtant retainer of
none: a borderer upon the ſpiritual
nature, therefore in the Tracts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Myſteries of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
it is called by the name of
a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="78">78. The lower Region of the Air
is like unto the neck or higher part
of an <hi>Alembick,</hi> for through it the
Vapours climbing up, and being
brought to the top, receive their
condenſation from Cold, and being
reſolved into water, fall down by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their own weight. So Nature
through continued diſtillations by
ſublimation of the Water, by coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
or by often drawing off the
liquour being often poured on, the
body doth rectifie and abound it. In
theſe operations of Nature, the Earth
is the veſſel receiving. Therefore
the Region of the Air that is nearer
to us, being bounded by the Region
of Clouds, as by a vaulted Chamber,
is of a greater thickneſs and impurity
than thoſe Regions above.</p>
            <p n="79">79. The middle Region of the Air
is not that, in which is the gathering
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104552:37"/>
of the Clouds, from whence are
Lightenings and Thunders, which is
onely the higher part of the lower
Region, and the border of it: but
that which is above the Clouds is to
be ſtiled <hi>The Middle Region,</hi> whither
the watry Being, by reaſon of its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
cannot reach, yet whither ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
exhalations, diſburthened
of the load of their Vapours, do climb
up, and there by a motion, either of
their own, or anothers, being kindled,
burn. Such are the flaming Meteors
of divers ſorts, which are viewed in
the middle Region, whence we may
gueſs, that it abounds with a hot and
moiſt, though not a watry, yet a fat
Being, which is the food of fire. In
this Region is much peace and a
good temperature, becauſe it is not
hurryed with the tempeſts of any
wind, and onely the lighter excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the inferiour Nature are
ſucked up hither.</p>
            <p n="80">80. The higher Region near the
Moon is all airy, not fiery, as it hath
been taken up, though falſely, in the
Schools. There is the peaceable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of the pureſt Air, and as it
borders upon the Heavenly Region,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104552:38"/>
ſo it approcheth it in nature, for it
is not defiled with the leaſt <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mut of
the lower Abyſs. There is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
in the higheſt, a purity but
little inferiour to that of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Heaven. In this place to
fancy a ſphear of fire, is the ſhame of
a Philoſopher, which breaking the
Laws of Nature, would have long
ere this ruined the Fabrick of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</p>
            <p n="81">81. The Fire, as a fourth Element
of Nature, was placed in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Region of the Air, as in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſphear, by the chief Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
being led by an argument,
from order and by conjecture, rather
than truth. For let no man fancy
any other fire of Nature than the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Light, therefore the bleſſed
Philoſopher in his <hi>Geneſis,</hi> makes no
mention of fire, becauſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told of the creation of the
Light upon the firſt day, which is
the genuine fire of Nature, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would elſe not have omitted
Fire, if it had been a principle of
Nature, having ſpecified Earth,
Water, and the Fowls of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
            <p n="82">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104552:38"/>
82. Let not any therefore fancy,
unleſs ſleeping, a Region of Fire
burning next the Moon, for the
whole Air would not be able to bear
ſo great an abundance of intenſe fire,
but it had long ago fed upon, and
ruined the whole Fabrick of the
World, for whatſoever it falls upon
it feeds upon and devours, being
the deſigned ruin of the World and
Nature.</p>
            <p n="83">83. Such a Devourer of Nature is
not lodged as an Element of Nature,
neither above the Air, nor below the
Earth. Onely he doth tyrannize in
the kingdom of Nature, either in
the height of the Air, or the depths
of the Earth, or elſe being kindled,
upon the ſuperficies of the Earth.
Therefore <hi>Lullius,</hi> a man of a raiſed
wit, did juſtly account it amongſt the
Gyants and Tyrants of the World. It
may alſo be termed to be an Enemy
to Nature, becauſe whatſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to Nature, is an adverſary of
Nature.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Our common Fire is partly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
partly artificial. It may be man
borrowed it for the accommodation
of life, and for his neceſſity, from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104552:39"/>
the Celeſtial, by an unition of the
beams of it, and a multiplication of
its vigour, or elſe by attrition or the
colliſion of two bodies, the Spirit
of God ſuggeſting the project to
man.</p>
            <p n="85">85. The Sovereign Creatour of
all things, did place the fiery ſpirit
of a kindly heat in the Globe of the
Sun to inſpire light, and an enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat to the reſt of the bodies in
the Univerſe, wherefore many have
thought him to be the heart of the
whole Fabrick, for from him ſprings
the principle of all generation and
life. He that ſearcheth for any other
Element of fire in the world, doth
ſhut his own eyes againſt the Sun.</p>
            <p n="86">86. The ſource therefore of the
Fire of Nature, is ſeated in the Sun,
whoſe heat is always of an equality,
and temperate in it ſelf, though it
be felt by us either greater or leſs,
according to his appropinquation or
diſtance, or according to his direct
or oblique beams, or according to the
ſcituation or nature of places. The
Sun hath been elevated by moſt
Philoſophers, as the Soul of the
World, breathing in motion, and a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104552:39"/>
faculty of generation to Nature.</p>
            <p n="87">87. The Sun is not the Eye of
the World, as ſome Ancients term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, but is the Eye of the Creatour
of the World, by which he doth
ſenſibly view his ſenſible creatures,
by which he conveys to them the
ſweetly-affecting beams of his love,
by which he renders himſelf view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to them: For ſcarcely could a
ſenſible Nature have comprehended
an inſenſible Creatour, therefore he
formed for himſelf, and us ſo noble
a body roab'd in his own glory, whoſe
rays, that neareſt approach Divinity,
are Spirit and Life.</p>
            <p n="88">88. From that univerſal Principle
of life, all the in-bred heat of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or mixed Beings is derived,
which hath gotten to be called by
the name of <hi>Fire,</hi> for whereſoever a
free heat, a natural motion or life
lodges, there Nature hath hidden
Fire, as the principle of them, and
the firſt mover of the Elements, by
which the ſenſible Elements, or the
Portions of the World are element<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and receive their animations,
yet doth it cleave cloſe to the womb
of the Earth, being bound up by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104552:40"/>
the Earths denſity and coldneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
an Antiperiſtaſis.</p>
            <p n="89">89. That Fire of Nature which is
ſeated in mixt bodies, hath choſen
the radical moiſture, as its proper
ſeat, the principal reſidence of which
is in the heart (although it be diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
through all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
as in the prime organ of life,
and the centre of this little world,
whence that Prince of Nature, as
commanding from its Caſtle, doth
move concordantly all the faculties,
and the reſt of the organs, and doth
in-breathe life to the humours of the
mixed Being, to the ſpirits, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to the whole Elementary Maſs.
And being the Sun, and Vicegerent
of the Sun doth act all in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that the Sun doth in that large
World.</p>
            <p n="90">90. As the Sun, being in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the reſt of the Planets, doth
enlighten them with his light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh
them with his influential vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
beget an harmony of life by
his enlivening ſpirit, ſo doth the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſpirit in the middle of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Nature, giveth it an influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
light, and gathers the Elements
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104552:40"/>
together in the work of Generation
and doth unite and enliven them.</p>
            <p n="91">91. The firſt Agent in the World
is the Fire of Nature, which being
ſeated in the Globe of the Sun, doth
diffuſe that vivifical heat by means
of his rays, through all the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature, working in the ſeeds
a power of activity, and ſetling in
them the principle of motion and
action, at the removal of which all
motion ceaſeth, and alſo the faculty
of life and action.</p>
            <p n="92">92. The heat of Nature, and the
light of Nature, are really one and
the ſame, for they have a continual
and uniform effluence from the ſame
Fountain, <hi>i.</hi> the Sun, but are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by their office, for the heat is
to penetrate into the moſt inward
parts of Nature, but light is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
and open the outward parts:
the office of heat is to move the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Natures of things, that of light,
to ſet before the eyes ſenſible acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
both of theſe is wrought by
the rays of the Sun. The Sun there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the firſt Organ of Nature, by
whoſe approach or diſtance, all the
operations of Nature are variouſly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104552:41"/>
governed, intended, or remitted, by
means of light and heat.</p>
            <p n="93">93. The ſecond univerſal Agent is
that ſame light; not ſo immediately
iſſuing from the Fountain, but refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from ſolid bodies, inlightened
by it as the heavenly, yea, the Earth
it ſelf: for the light of the Sun beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon thoſe bodies, gives a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their diſpoſitions and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and alters them, and diffuſeth
their ſeveral and different virtues by
the reflection of his rays, through the
whole frame of Heaven and of our
Air: for by thoſe rays, as by ſo many
conveyances, are the various effects
of ſeveral bodies diſperſed every
where for the benefit and harmony
of Nature, which are called by us
<hi>Influences.</hi> Theſe are the true and
firſt Elements of Nature, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſpiritual, do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
themſelves to us under ſome
airy, or alſo ſome watry Nature, to
whoſe good act, as to the roots of the
Elements, we are beholding for the
gift of every birth, and of all
life.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Love, ſtyled by <hi>Plato</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the gods, was breath'd into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104552:41"/>
begotten by the Divine Spirit,
and hath the place of a <hi>Genius</hi> in her
diſpoſitions. In the firſt Diviſion of
the World, betwixt the firſt brothers,
ſhe gave the judgement for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of their families, and after
had alwayes the Praefecture in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="95">95. The God of Nature did fix
the firſt bond of Love in the things
of Nature, between the firſt Matter
and the univerſal Form, the Heaven
and the Earth, Light and Darkneſs,
Plenty and Poverty, Beauty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
The ſecond degree of Love
from the firſt couple, which is as it
were the loving embraces of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
iſſued into the Elements, which
having a fraternal tye to bind them,
have divided betwixt them the whole
right of Nature. The third and laſt
degree, is compleated in mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which excites them by the in-born
and in-bred ſparkles of love, to
a propagation and multiplication of
their like. The Divine Love hath
appointed this treble Love-knot, as a
kind of Magical tye, that it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it ſelf by traduction into all and
every part of his workmanſhip. Love
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104552:42"/>
is the Baſe of the Univerſe, the Cube
of Nature, and the faſtening bond of
things above and below.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Let thoſe avaunt therefore,
who do attribute the concordant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nature to Diſcord; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is peaceable and pleaſant in all
her workings, yea, ſhe is delightfully
tickled in her actings. The very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
of things in their coition are
wholly loſt in love, that they may
knit themſelves together by their
mutual embraces, and of many be
made one.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Let the Academies ſtand up,
and tell us how the firſt Matter can
be the firſt ſubject of contraries, and
how Love can lye amongſt the brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and jarres of Enmity! or that
eager appetite, which the Prince of
Philoſophers acknowledgeth reſiding
in the heart of this Matter,<note place="margin">Cap. 9. l. 1. De Mat.</note> whereby
it doth as earneſtly luſt for its form,
as a man for a woman? Will not
thoſe enemies, conſtituting the ſeeds
of Beings and the mixt bodies, by
their eternal food, at length force
Love and Concord to yield to their
ruine.</p>
            <p n="98">98. They that placed a luſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104552:42"/>
the Matter and the Form, and
yet an hatred and repugnancy in the
Matter it ſelf, and in the Elements,
in making theſe contraries, have made
themſelves ſo: for according to the
dictates of their School, the Soul in
all things generated (onely man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
is brought forth out of the
power and privy virtue of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
But how can this be without
love? If the Matter radically doth
lye under the diſſentions of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
muſt not the Form, which ſprings
from her very root, feel the ſame por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Nay, would it not be ſtifled
by them in its firſt birth and cradle?
What man therefore that ſtood right
in his wits, would acknowledge the
rule of theſe bandetties, to be chief
in the nuptials of Love and Nature,
in the very juncture of the mixture of
the Elements, and of the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Matter? Yea, who would
expect an uniform, and not a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
iſſue from the heterogeneous
ſeed of oppoſite parents?</p>
            <p n="99">99. Let therefore the Philoſopher
ſurceaſe to place the cauſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Elements, of the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
and failing of mixt beings in

the repugnancy of the Elements, but
rather lay the fault upon the penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
weakneſs of the firſt matter. For
in the firſt Chaos.
<q>
                  <l>'Twixt moiſt and drie there was no
battel fought,</l>
                  <l>Nor any enmitie 'twixt cold and
hot.</l>
               </q>
It is indeed the Vulgar conceit that
there was, whereas onely two, no
way contrary, of thoſe four qualities,
to wit, Cold and Moiſture, agreed to
the female, &amp; the matter, and were in
it: The other two, which are Heat
and Drought, which are maſculine
and formal qualities, came forth out
of the part of the informing light.
And the Earth was not called <hi>Drie
Land</hi> before the drawing off the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the coming on of the light
Being, which was firſt moiſt and
covered with Waters.</p>
            <p n="100">100. Therefore certainly reaſon it
ſelf doth evidence, that thoſe four
qualities, which by the Vulgar are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
repugnant, are not extant
in the firſt matter, unleſs after infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
And leſt ſhe might endure
ſome contrariety in its ſolitude, ſhe
had other diſeaſes, to wit, Darkneſs,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104552:44"/>
Confuſion, Deformity, Coldneſs, &amp; an
indigeſted Moiſture, with an impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which are all evidences of a diſeaſ'd
and languiſhing body: Therefore
being infected from its creation with
that corruption, it derived it down
to its poſterity, lodged in this loweſt
and weakeſt Region of the elements.
Therefore it is not ſet down in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
of that Abyſs of Darkneſs, that it
was very good, but reſerv'd that grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Elogie for the Light, and for the
reſt that were created.</p>
            <p n="101">101. But who is there that hath
the leaſt dram of knowledge, will
conceive that this contentious repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
did flow from the form into
the matter, after the union of the
four qualities in the matter being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed?
Since it is eſſential to and
the intent of the form, to adde a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the matter, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to perfect it into an harmony and
conſent, and a temperament accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its ability.</p>
            <p n="102">102. The firſt contraries through
oppoſing qualities, were Light and
Darkneſs; Light hath two qualities
Heat and Drougth; Darkneſs as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Cold and Moiſture, wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104552:45"/>
each to other, becauſe of their
intention. But after thoſe two aged
principles of Nature came together,
and the dark material and female
principle was informed by the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
formal and maſculine principle,
and impregnated by the light, the
whole matter of the Univerſe; and all
the Regions thereof received this
priviledge of light, though diſtinct
in the degrees and differences: for
that fiery tincture of the Spirit of
light left nothing unpierced, and the
four qualities alſo at firſt being in
their higheſt degree, were brought
down to a remiſſion in the informed
matter, and ſo cloſing ſweetly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
a faſt friendſhip, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a temperature: and ſo being
made friendly, they were entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>homogeneous</hi> family of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that ſo there might nothing
of repugnancy or enmity lurk in the
generation of mixt bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the pleaſing motion of Nature
might be diſturbed.</p>
            <p n="103">103. Neither in nature are thoſe
four qualities contrary one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but onely divers and unlike
one to another, neither do they ruin,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104552:45"/>
but unite into a firm league one with
another: So Heat and Cold in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
degree, do amicably agree and
commix in one and the ſame ſubject,
that a middle and temperate quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to wit, a lukewarneſs might be
produced. But if in the intenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
they couple not without a fight
and combat, this proceeds from the
exceſs and tyranny of the intenſion,
which cannot endure two qualities e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
heightened and adverſe, to be
partners and ſharers of one and the
ſame Sovereignty, but there will fall
out a tumult. But indeed Nature caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out intenſe qualities, as baſtards
and ſtrangers.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Let not therefore any fancy
that Nature admits fire intenſe into
the family of her Elements, for ſuch
a fire would be fit for deſtruction,
not generation, would not be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to, but againſt Nature, which
avoids violent things, and delights in
a temperature, in which is no fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no contrariety. For the Rule
of Nature cannot away with the rage
of a ſcorching heat, or a waſting cold,
or the diſtemper of moiſt and drie,
but doth pleaſingly lye down in a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104552:46"/>
compoſed temperature. Let not any
therefore ſearch for the intenſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in the Elements of things; he
will find them in them either leſs or
more remitted.</p>
            <p n="105">105. He is deceived therefore who
ſays that hot and cold, moiſt and drie,
are ſimple contraries. For the Earth,
which by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is laid down as drie
in the higheſt, ſhould always quarrel
with the Air, which is ſaid by him to
be moiſt in the higheſt: Alſo Water
that is cold in the higheſt, according
to his opinion, ſhould be oppoſite to
Fire, that is hot in the higheſt: and
this repugnancy would incloſe by
force every one of the common Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or every Region of the World
within the verge of its ſphear, and
by reaſon of this antipathie, would
deſtroy all hoſpitality betwixt them.
But we are convinced of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
both by reaſon and experience.
For ditches and all hollow places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Earth, yea, the very bowels
and pores of the Earth are repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Air, and the intrinſical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Earth, by which, as with
their mothers milk, all Vegetables
are nouriſhed, is nothing elſe but an
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104552:46"/>
hot and moiſt Air, cleaving cloſe to
the Earth, and handing it as a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and nouriſhing faculty: the pores
of the Earth are the dugs, and the
airy moiſture the milk, by which, ſhe,
the Mother and Nurſe of things, doth
nouriſh her off-ſprings, and give them
growth.</p>
            <p n="106">106. They, who ſettle four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in as many humours, do grant,
that Nature being moiſt, is receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yea, is the ſubject of four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
qualities: how then can they
hold a contrariety in them, which

For though thoſe four humours
are diſtinguiſhed by their reſpective
differences, yet have they but one
baſe, one common root to all, to wit,
Humour: for yellow choller which
reſembles fire, is no leſs an humour
than flegm, which reſembles water:
and the ſame may be ſaid of aduſt
Choller and Bloud, although they
do not abſolutely, but comparatively
confound the four Elements in a

thoſe four firſt qualities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born

            <p n="109">109. Nature ſets up a Potters trade,

doth turn and work the matter
between theſe two: thoſe two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are neareſt the matter, becauſe
more ſubject to be paſſive, and to a
change. But the other two, to wit,
of Hot and Cold, are more of action,
becauſe by their turns they alter and
change the former; theſe are paſſive,
thoſe active, &amp; are as it were the active
inſtruments of Nature, working upon
her paſſive matter.</p>
            <p n="111">111. Let us therefore caſt off that

wrap it up in a cloud and dark mask,

Light, that he might make of the two
Extreams a moderate light, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

to call them the compleating parts

for the Elements of the world
do not lye under our view or ſenſes,
as ſeparated in their proper Regions,
but do lye hid and keep cloſe in
their wombs, till they come together
in the generation of mixt bodies, and
make up a body. But thoſe parts of

the compact frame of the World, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to a chance and motion, would
be in a perpetual fluctuation, which
we know is eſtabliſhed by God in a
certain and conſtant order and ſcite,
and diſtinction of parts: For Earth

by this the Centre ſhall run out to

truth too. For their diſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104552:50"/>
natures do diſagree from
ſuch a change, for the heightened
cold, thickneſs, and gravity of the
Earth are ſo oppoſite to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or heat, ſubtility, and levity in
Fire, that they can never be brought
to change. Beſides, the Earth, a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſlighteth its virtue, if we may believe
the opinions of Chymiſts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience, neither doth any
thing flie out from it, but a fat and
warry humour, both of them not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

is to be turned into elementary Fire,
it muſt neceſſarily be light and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that it may be tranſlated into
its Orb and Nature. The Earth
therefore being moſt weighty, and ſo
the Centre of all, being moſt fixt, and
ſo leaſt volatile, how can it be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Fire, and be carried up into
the Sphear of Fire, or how can Fre,
the higheſt and lighteſt of all, be
beaten down to be eſſentially united
with the Earth, contrary to the laws

121 They that believed, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
from the region of the earth
drawn up into the Air, and becauſe
kindled there, to be earthie, and
converted into the Element of Fire,
are far out of the way of truth, for
they are not earthie, but rather airie
natures: for our Air being moiſt,
through the contagion of water lying
in the drie boſom of the Earth, gather
a fatneſs, and by the conſortſhip of
the Earth, doth temper the moiſt
with the drie, but when it exhales
through the pores and creviſes of the
Earth being drawn by heat, or elſe
the abundance of the matter forcing
out, it breaks not forth out of its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
without a noiſe &amp; crack, whence
proceed earth-quakes and openings
not without much ruin; that exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
got looſe, doth flie up into the
region proper to light bodies, and
there is ſet on fire, being digeſted by
its errant motion and heat, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into a ſulphureous matter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that matter is not truly earthie,
ſince it is neither ponderous nor
cold, but becauſe it is made fat and
combuſtible by the concourſe of hot,
drie, and moiſt; it may more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104552:51"/>
be called the accidental food of
fire, than the Fire of Nature, or the
Elementarie Fire. That is a baſtard,
a ſpurious generation, which for that
very reaſon ought not to have been
placed amongſt the natures, or been
called by the names of Elements;
therefore theſe Firings are rightly
called by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> imperfectly-mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p n="122">122 Fire feeds upon fat and uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

terminated with drought, as our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
ſulfur, gun-powder, and the

outwardly drie, do cloſe within them
a fat moiſture, and upon the firing

            <p n="123">123 And truly they ſlip to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that have taken an opinion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104552:52"/>
and breaking of the clouds, that the
Fire turns to a ſtone, or is converted
into earth, or have a conceit, that the
Earth is carried up thither. This is
done far otherwiſe; for that hardened
matter was never fire or earth, nor
proceeded from the Orb of Fire (if
there be any) or from the bodie of
the earth, but an unctious and viſcous
humour, in a manner clayiſh, ſhut up
in a cloud as in a fornace, is ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
and decocted, as an earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

that it turns a ſtone: Hence
proceed thoſe darted Thunder-bolts.
Such meteors as theſe are the wens,

            <p n="124">124 The fire of nature is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from our artificial or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

either Univerſal and Particular, or
Individual. The Univerſal is diffuſed
through all the parts of the Univerſe,
doth ſweetly excite and move the
propenſive virtues of the celeſtial
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104552:52"/>
bodies, doth impregnate and ſupply
with engendering ſeed this Globe of

power of nature; mingles the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
informs the Matter; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
doth unlock the ſecret of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but the fountain of it is in the
Sun, who as the Heart of the World
doth ſtream forth his enlivening heat
as his love through all regions. But
the particular Fire of Nature, is in-born
and in-bred in every mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and individual, which flows as a
rivulet from that General, and doth
work all things in this Microcoſm or
little World MAN, according to
an Analogie with the Sun in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm
or greater World. But who
is there that would not ſtile our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

this change is acted in the lower regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

not the middle, much leſs the higheſt

vapour flies up, and is rather raiſed

of a multiplied, and almoſt number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
iſſue, which being reſcued in
the beginning of the Creation
from the power of the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Waters, and priviledged to it
ſelf, was made and remained drie
land; and her bodie being condenſed,
ſunk to the foundation and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the whole, and ſpread out her
lap as a Parent to all vegetables, and
all other creatures; yet did ſhe want
moiſture, whereby ſhe might be
made apt for a fruitful generation.
Gods providence ſet out a remedie
for this exigence: Therefore from
the beginning was the water made
volatile, that ſo it might be carried up
in vapours, which being frozen by
cold in this cloud, might by heat be
thawed again into Waters. By this
maſter-piece of Divine providence,
was this exigence of the Earth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and that drineſs, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
barrenneſs, was tempered with
a large moiſture, and the womb of
our mother conceived. Therefore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104552:56"/>
onely Water hath the circulation,
to the intent that it might moiſten
the boſom of the Earth, or more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is diſtilled in the lower region
of the Air as in its Alembick; that ſo
by often pouring in, and reiterated
diſtillations, it being abounded, and
having gotten virtues both from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
and below, and endued with
that celeſtial Nectar, it might more
effectually ſoften the boſom of the
Earth, and endue it with a prolifical
virtue. The chief worker of all, who
maketh uſe of the art of Nature, hath
added nothing ſuperfluous to his
work, nor left any thing defective
in it.</p>
            <p n="130">130 But the Water being the
menſtruum of the World, doth che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and contain in it the ſeeds of
things and their elements; but ſhe
having this circulation, the true and
genuine Elements of things which
are in the Earth, as in the matrix and
veſſel of Generation; and in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as in the menſtruum, are alſo
whirled about. In the vapour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are the Elements of the Earth,
the Water, and the Air, &amp; have their
ſublimation, and exuberation with it.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104552:56"/>
They are not the bodies of Earth,
Water, and Air, which have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſphears, and conſtitute the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Regions of the World, but they
are the very ſpiritual Elements of
Nature, which lye hid and inhabit in
them, out of which many bodies, as
ſtones may be generated and excoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Air. For where all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
well mixt, do meet, as they
do in a vapour, there bodies may be
generated; but when they find not a
convenient matrix, as in the Air, there
are ingendered imperfect mixtures,
not by reaſon of any fault in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in the Matrix.</p>
            <p n="131">131. The Water being ſeated as
middle, betwixt the Earth and the
Air, doth trouble both it by its flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and always moving inconſtancy,
infeſting the Air with a black ſoote,
and noiſom vapours, and often drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Earth by flouds; cauſing
tempeſts in the Air, ruines to the
Earth, and corruption to both; and
it doth aſſault the Region of the one
with its levity, and of the other with
its gravity; and doth croſs the order
of Nature, and the nature of Times
by its defect or exceſs, yea, doth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104552:57"/>
ſhake all her borderers with her ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
claps and tumultuous ragings.
Her nature being altogether female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſupream Creatour ſeems to have
beſtowed her on the World in the
nature of a Woman, or a neceſſary
Evil, even ſo doth ſhe arrogate all
things as ſubject to her, and turns
thoſe things that were given her for
a general good, to a publick ruin. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
it is the ſcourge of divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
revenging <hi>Nemeſes,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſigned to the vengeance of ſin,
doth break out to puniſh, and ſets
the hopes and wealth of many the
very roots of pride, under ſeveral
ſhapes of judgements, the ſcoff and
blaſt of the world.</p>
            <p n="132">132. The univerſal Natures, the
more thick they are, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
the more endued with tenuity;
the more purity. The Earth, becauſe
more thick than Water, therefore is
leſs noble, and ſo Water than Air;
and Air than Heaven: and ſo the
higheſt Region of the Heavens is the
moſt noble, becauſe it is moſt ſubtile.
For it is an undoubted truth, that
ſpiritual Natures are more excellent
than corporeal, and the more bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104552:57"/>
upon the ſpiritual Natures,
the more they draw nigh to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="133">133. The foundation of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Corruption is in Moiſture,
for in both the travails of Nature,
Moiſture, of all the Elements, is the
firſt patient, receiving the firſt ſeal
of the form. The natural Spirits are
eaſily united with it, becauſe flowing
from it, do lightly return to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the root of them, in that, and
by that, are the reſt of the Elements
mixed. The moiſt Element hath its
circulation no leſs in mixed and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
bodies, than in the World,
both in the work of Generation and
of Nutrition, for it was Natures plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that both theſe works ſhould be
performed by the ſame inſtruments of
condenſation and rarefaction, and by
the ſame means, to wit, Spirits.</p>
            <p n="134">134. The Earth is the Veſſel of
Generation, Water the menſtruum of
Nature, containing in it the formal
and ſeminal virtues, which it borrows
from the Sun, the male and the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
univerſal Principle; from him is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
into all things the influence of
the fire of Nature, and of formal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104552:58"/>
in which are all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for generation, the in-bred heat
being wrapt up in the moiſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> did rightly affirm,
That theſe two Elements,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Diae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia.</note> Fire and
Water, could do all, contained all
things in them: For from them do
iſſue two maſculine qualities of Hot
and Drie, from the other two more
of Cold and Moiſt, being the female
qualities, which ſo concurring and
mixing, perfect the generation of
mixed bodies. Over thoſe two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Elements, the two greater
Lights were ſet, the Sun the authour
of Fire, and the Moon the Lady of
Moiſture.</p>
            <p n="135">135. Nature perfects the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the volatile Element, by a
three-fold action or inſtrument, by
Sublimation, Demiſſion or Refuſion,
and by Decoction, which ſtand in
need of a divers temperament. So
doth the rightly ordered intention
of Nature, wandering through vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
motions, directeth her interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
actions to their deſigned end, and
attaineth the ſame mark, though it
trades through divers wayes.</p>
            <p n="136">136 Sublimation is the converſion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104552:58"/>
of a moiſt and a ponderous nature,
into a light, or the exhalation of it
into a vapour. The end and benefit
of it is three-fold: Firſt, that a groſs
and impure body might be munde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by attenuation, and might by
degrees be drawn off the dregs; then
that by ſublimation it might gain the
higher virtues, which continually
flow down. Laſtly, that by ſuch an
evacuation the Earth might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened
of its ſuperfluous and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
humours, which ſeizing upon
its paſſages, do hinder the action of
the heat, and the free paſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſpirits, yea, do violently choak
them. This drawing away of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
moiſture, takes away the
cauſe of obſtructions, and gives eaſe
to the ſqueazy ſtomach of the Earth,
and makes it more fit for digeſtion.</p>
            <p n="137">137. But the Moiſture is ſublimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the impulſive operation of
heat. For Nature uſeth her fire as
its proper inſtrument for rarefaction
of moiſt bodies. Therefore the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
that generates Clouds &amp; Rain,
are moſt frequently drawn up in the
Fall and Spring, becauſe then the
womb of the Earth doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104552:59"/>
with hot and moiſt; now Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is the material, and Heat the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cauſe of exhalations. Nature
doth ſhew a kind of intenſe heat in
ſublimation, whileſt it is bound in
within the terms and latitude of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature.</p>
            <p n="138">138. Demiſſion is the ſecond wheel
of Nature; in the work of Circulation
is the returning of the ſpirituous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
into a groſs and watry body: or
the Refuſion of a rarefied and ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
humour, being again conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and its deſcent into Earth, that
it may dilute it of its exuberant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour,
and ſuck it up by a ſweet and
celeſtial draught.</p>
            <p n="139">139. Nature doth intend three
things by irrigation. Firſt, that it
might not pour out, but by degrees
diſtil its abundant humour, leſt there
fall out a gulf, and by the abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of water, the paſſage for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vifical
ſpirit in the bowels of the earth
be dammed up, and the intrinſecal
heat of the Earth be extinguiſhed,
for that wiſe and righteous Governeſs
doth diſpenſe all her benefits in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
weight and meaſure. Secondly,
that it might diſtribute the humour
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104552:59"/>
by divers drops, and by a various
manner, to wit, a Rain ſometimes
larger, ſometimes leſs, ſometimes a
dew, ſometimes a hoar froſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pouring out a greater, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a leſs plenty, that ſo it might
water the Earth according to its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
or neceſſity, thirſting for more
or leſs. Thirdly, that theſe irrigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or waterings may be not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but by turns and betwixt other
works; for the Sun doth in its courſe
ſucceed the Showers, and the Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in theirs the Sun, the day the
night, and the night the day.</p>
            <p n="140">140. The lighteſt Cold or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
Heat, doth unlooſe and make
fit to fall thoſe vapours that are
brought up into the middle Region,
and there frozen. For an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heat doth diſſipate and hinders
their condenſation, and an intenſe
heat doth ſo knit and freeze them,
that they cannot produce a humour
that may be fit to fall down.</p>
            <p n="141">141. The laſt wheel or action of
the Circulation of Nature, is Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which is nothing elſe but the
digeſtion, ripening, and converſion
into aliment of a crude humour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104552:60"/>
on the boſom of the Earth.
This ſeemeth to be the end and the
ſcope of the others, becauſe it is the
releaſe of their labour, and a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the food, attained by the
former labours. For that crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
by force of that internal heat,
is chewed, concocted, and digeſted by
it, being as it were without motion
and in a trance, ſilently and without
noiſe, moving that ſecret fire as the
proper inſtrument of Nature, that it
may turn that crude liquour temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with drineſs into a food. This is
the compleat circle of Nature, which
ſhe rowls round by various degrees of
labour and heat.</p>
            <p n="142">142 Theſe three operations of
Nature are ſo knit together, and have
ſuch a relation each to the other, that
the beginning of the one is the end
of the other, and according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
intention, they do in a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
order ſucceed one another by
turns. And the orders of theſe viciſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
are ſo interwoven and linkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as that combining to the good
of the whole, they do in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
prove ſerviceable each to other.</p>
            <p n="143">143 Yet Nature is forcedly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104552:60"/>
drawn out of her bounds and
verges, and ranges in an uncertain
path, eſpecially in the guidance of
the moiſt Element, whoſe orders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
interrupted do deceive, and they
do eaſily as well as ſuffer wrong, by
reaſon of the inconſtancy of its vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and flitting nature, as alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the various diſpoſition of the
ſuperiour bodies, which do bend
theſe things below, eſpecially Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
and draw them from their ſetled
track, according to the beck of the
Sovereign Moderatour, who doth uſe
them as Organs and Inſtruments to
the motion of the frame of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
Hence is raiſed the deceitfull
and inconſtant temperature of this
our Manſion, and the changed ſeaſons
of the year. So doth the womb of
the Earth, being diverſly affected,
bring forth either more plentifully or
more ſparingly, generous or caſtling
births. So doth the bordering Air
being either pure or impure, produce
either health or ſickneſs, the moiſt
Nature rowling and toſſing all things
amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="144">144 The Rule of our Heavens is
uncertain and deceitful to us, becauſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104552:61"/>
things below receive their orders
from things above, whoſe natures and
affections are for the moſt part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us, yet let the Philoſopher
ſet always before his eyes the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather than the action of Nature,
the order rather than the diſturbance
of the order.</p>
            <p n="145">145 We may obſerve the volubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or flittingneſs of the moiſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not onely in the general harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the World, but alſo in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of mixed Beings. For they
are generated by the revolution of
Moiſture, they are nouriſhed and
grow by drying, moiſtening, and dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting;
wherefore thoſe three opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of nature are reſembled to food,
drink, and ſleep, becauſe meat anſwers
to drineſs, drink to moiſture, and
ſleep to concoction.</p>
            <p n="146">146 Leſt man ſhould dream fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

infinite worlds of the ſame matter, yet
in form differenced. Let therefore
man ſhare humility and lowlineſs of

            <p n="147">147 The inferiour natures are lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
by the ſuperiour: But the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not enduring delay, doth haſt to
meet the operations of the Heavens,
for the Air, giving way to the vapour
that flies up to it, receives it to lodge
in the Region of the Clouds, as in a
large Hall, but ere it comes thither,
its body being in a manner ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
the moiſt Being is diveſted of
its ponderous nature, that ſo it might
by this addition of agility, the ſooner
compaſs its deſire, and enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of an ambiguous nature.</p>
            <p n="148">148 In the mean time the Sun, the
Prince of the celeſtial Quire, and the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104552:62"/>
reſt of the ſuperiour Natures, taking
care of the inferiour, do inſtil by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

the Vapours being thin, and ſo ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

a Cloud, do moſt eagerly ſuck in
in that ſpiritual <hi>Nectar,</hi> and attract it
to them by a Magnetick virtue, and
having received it, they grow big, and
being impregnated and quickened
with that ingendering ſeed, as being
delivered of their burden, do freely
fall down back into the lap of the
Earth in ſome Dew, hoar Froſt, Rain,
or ſome other nature; and this Mother
of the Elements doth receive into
her womb the returning moiſture,
and being quickened by this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeed, ſends forth in her due time
innumerable iſſues, according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

But by the nature of Water
is the fermentation of the reſt of the

            <p n="149">149 But this ferment or leaven is a

the ſeed of Life, without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p n="150">150 The three material Elements

of the univerſal NATURE.</p>
            <p n="151">151 Theſe three laſt Elements are

of the copulation of Earth and Air,
Salt produced out of the condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p n="153">153 It may be lawfull to affirm
that <hi>Democritus</hi> his opinion, That all

muſt neceſſarily be done by the

Beings: other wiſe the Elements could
not combine into a continuous &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

the artifical reſolution &amp; compoſition
of mixt Beings, which are tryed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations,
that the perfect mixtion
of two or more bodies, is not done
but in a ſubtile vapour. But Nature
doth make her mixtions far more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,

of <hi>Democritus:</hi> for the groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p n="154">154 The three-fold degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence

though they are potentially in the

by the ſubſtance of the lower

from a more noble ſpring, their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
is from Heaven, for their father

            <p n="171">171 The ſpecifical Forms of mixt
Beings have within themſelves cloſed
a dark kind of knowledge of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
and are carried up by their
own ſtrength, and by a ſecret motion,
like unto Waters, to the height of
their Fountain head. So the Soul of
man being derived from the divine
Spring of the uncreated Light, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
to the ſame by the ſharp ſight
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104552:68"/>
of his mind, and by the ſoaring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
of his ſoul, but the forms
of other living creatures being taken
out of the privy Treaſury of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Sun, do by the inſtinct
of Nature, and by a weak kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſcency,
glance back thither.
Hence we may obſerve the frequent
Prognoſticks of ſeveral creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the courſes of the Sun, and
the changes of the Heavens. But the
forms of Vegetables, being for the
moſt part airy and inſpired from the
loweſt Region of our Air, therefore
they are not able to extend or reach
forth their power, or faculties beyond
it, they do, according to their ability,
lift up their heads into the Air, as
willing to viſit their Countrey, but
they are ſtopped ſo, as that they are
not able to paſs the narrow confines
of their bodies, wanting the ſenſe and
life of a Soul, becauſe there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the Suns virtue in them, as will
not carry them above the motion of a
Vegetation. For in the order of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
the Vegetables were firſt before
the Sun, wherefore creatures are not
equally indebted to him for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
and the aged principles of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104552:68"/>
their life, but muſt acknowledge them
received from the lightſom Air, as a
nearer Agent. For the diſpoſition of
their matter was adjudged by Nature
as too weak to receive ſo ſublime a
form.</p>
            <p n="172">172 But for Stones, ſince they are
not ſo much generated out of a true
mixture of the Elements, as from a
concourſe of Earth and Water, by an
external force of Heat and Cold, they
are decocted as an earthen Work or
veſſel, therefore they are altogether
ſenſeleſs, having borrowed a feeble
form from the dark and cold nature
of the Earth and Water.</p>
            <p n="173">173 Concerning precious Stones
and Gems, we muſt conceive other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
for they derive their forms from
the Chryſtal Fouutains of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Sun, and their bodies
are the pureſt drops of a refined dew,
engendered by celeſtial influences,
and as it were the congealed tears of
of Heaven, whence they poſſeſs and
contain many ſublime virtues.</p>
            <p n="174">174 But the matter of Metals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is watry and earthy, and moſt
compacted, by reaſon of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
&amp; ſubtile commixtion of weighty
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104552:69"/>
Elements, is therefore heavy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
ponderous, and of it ſelf
capable of no motion: but becauſe it
is ſublimated and mundefied by the
wonderfull artifice of Nature, in an
earthy and ſtony Matrix, as in a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,
and its mixture is compleated
in a moſt thin vapour, by reiterated
diſtillations, that by reaſon of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſubtility and exuberancy, the
influential helps of the Sun and the
Heavens, get in and mix with it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the generation of perfect
mettals; for this cauſe, though they
fetch their bodies from Water and
Earth, yet Nature performing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of workman, doth ſo ingeniouſly
make up the bodies, eſpecially of a
perfect mettal, that it delivers them
to the heavenly Deities, as thoſe that
deſerve to be informed with the moſt
eminent form. It is a work of long
travail, but an abſolute one, &amp; height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the utmoſt of Natures actings,
in which Heaven and Earth ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to copulate, than to conſent. But
the formal ſpirits of mettals being
bound up in a hard cover, do ſtick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
till releaſed of their bands
by Philoſophical Fire, they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104552:69"/>
by their heavenly Seed in their
matter, that noble ſon of the Sun,
and at length that Quint-eſſence of
admirable Virtue, in which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
ſeem to lodge with, and come
down to us.</p>
            <p n="175">175 It was provided by the Decree
of the ſupream Creatour, that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more noble ſhould not degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into one leſs noble, or that one
more eminent, into a nature that is
more baſe, or that it ſhould, abjuring
its native priviledge of birth-right,
come under a ſervile vaſſalage. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Beings are coupled with theſe
below, and thoſe of greater power do
communicate themſelves with thoſe
of a leſs, that they may inform and
compleat them by their emiſſary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which notwithſtanding in this do
no way derogate from their ſtock or
kind. Nay, when they work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the ſeeds of things, or alſo
into mixed Beings, they ſubject not
themſelves to a bondage, but do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a new honour and priviledged
power. For every mixt Being of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
kind it is, is a kind of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
yea the whole world, who hath
a ſpiritual form of her own to rule her,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104552:70"/>
whoſe office it is to have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the organs and faculties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yea over the whole frame, ſo that
that, which being void and without
diſtinction, did drift it rowling hither
and thither in the vaſt Ocean of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is now called to an Empire.</p>
            <p n="176">176 The formal act of the firſt
matter, as alſo of the Elements, doth
inform nothing beſides the verie
principles of Nature, therefore the
ſpecifical form doth conſtitute a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
mixt Being, neither is it to be
thought to contain any more forms,
ſince the very Elements in their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have the charge of the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not of the informing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p n="177">177 It is moſt probable, that the
virtue of multiplication, which lyes in
the ſeeds of Beings, doth not flow
from the Elementary matter as its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cauſe, but from a celeſtial
form: for to multiply, is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and proper action of light, for
from one ray are almoſt an infinite
number darted forth; from whence
it proceeds, that the Sun, who is the
Fountain of immortal Light, is alſo in
nature the firſt efficient cauſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104552:70"/>
and multiplication: that
therefore every form receives a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power of multiplication from the
celeſtial light, is prov'd by this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Argument, becauſe it is lightfull
and furniſhed with its native endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Ergo</hi> multiplying; It is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
becauſe it doth enlighten with
its rays the ſenſitive and imaginative
faculties in creatures, that ſo out of
that double faculty, ſprings a double
apprehenſion &amp; knowledge of things;
an external by the ſenſes, an internal
by imagination; but all knowledge
is a light, as all ignorance is a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
but there peeps up ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening
and lightſomneſs, when
there is an apprehenſion of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of things, and when that, which
lay unknown in the dark, is now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
by a light of knowledge, for
it is onely by the good office of light,
that obſcure things receive a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
God did adde to man a third
light, <hi>to wit,</hi> his Underſtanding, by the
help of which he attains by their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
a far more perfect way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
All theſe things are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the operation of light, and of
a perſpicuity flowing out of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104552:71"/>
Soul. This laſt action of
light is onely proper to man, the two
former are ſhared with beaſts as well
as by him, for their ſouls are alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of celeſtial light. Therefore
reaſon doth convince, that the virtue
of multiplication in the individual
Beings of Animals and Vegetables,
doth proceed from the Souls multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of light, and that ſome rays
of it are included in the ſeed with the
Aetherial ſpirit, until at length they
are ſet upon the riſing of the Sun of

            <p n="178">178 Light and Darkneſs are the
principles of Life and Death, for the
rays of Light are the forms of mixt
Beings, their bodies a dark Abyſs. By
Light all things live, yea Light is life;
but thoſe that looſe their life, looſe
their light, and are hurried into their
former darkneſs, in which they lay

            <p n="179">179 The ſpecifical forms of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,

of their nature. For they have
their vital endowments, their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances,

it ſhould have from it ſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and inſeparable body, no leſs
than Earth, Water, or Air, and the
reſt of the ſenſible Natures, which do
conſiſt and are bounded within their

Fire, but ſmoke inflamed; finally,
that Robber onely feeds upon what

of it, but this not found in fire
put into wood or ſmoke, for the ſmoke

amongſt thoſe things that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpiritual. There was no light but
in God before the informing of the
firſt matter, &amp; the birth of the world.
But when Nature received her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then began there a ſpiritual light
to iſſue forth from the fiery ſpirit of
God upon the matter, and there to
ſettle as in its lamp, and this was the
creation and original of Light: that
was the firſt act of the Deity upon the
matter; the firſt copulation of the
Creatour with the creature, of a ſpirit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104552:78"/>
with a body. Therefore the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Light, was a meer Spirit,
which did kindle with its fiery virtue,
as with heat, the neareſt matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exceedingly rarefied by its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light, and ſo were the darkneſs
converted to light. The Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſtinguiſhed by the firſt light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not material and fiery,
yet is nevertheleſs inviſible, becauſe
in reſpect of the matter, it is brought
to the higheſt degree of tenuity, and
in reſpect of its form, is endowed with
ſpirituality. But the Light that was
ſcattered in the middle Heaven, being
bounded into a narrower compaſs,
was caſt into the Globe of the Sun,
which was neceſſarily to be formed
into a kind of a thick body, as it were
into a ſmoke fit to be kindled, yet not
combuſtible, that ſo it might be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
being kindled by that immortal
Light, and be in the room of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Lamp of Nature, or as a fiery
Maſs. The light of the Sun there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is nothing elſe but a lightſome
ſpirit, deriving its riſe from the Spirit
of eternal Light, gathered in, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
cleaving to the body of the

the thickneſs of the body, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
to all the natures of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
light, and a manifold virtue:
conſtituting the ſpirit of the World
by its non-intermitted influence: and
bound up in a body for the good and
welfare of the corporeal Nature.</p>
            <p n="196">196 Yet the Sun-beams that are
perceivable by our eyes, are not pure
ſpirits, for iſſuing continually from
the Sun, have their progreſs, being
clothed with the encompaſſing Air.
They are therefore nothing elſe but
a continued flowing forth of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

and to ſend forth heat and light, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104552:79"/>

is derived from the ſpiritual Fount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain,
not otherwiſe than natural forms
from their Matrix, which is the ſpirit
of the Univerſe, perpetually flowing
from the Sun, as from an eternal and

of mixt Beings in their making, do
riſe from the firſt matter, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
and do gradually at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
ſlide into the ſame again, ſo
the natural forms of individuals in

of light got looſe from their tyes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
So are all mixt Beings reſolved

imitate the divine Love: for it is not

a ſtrong multiplication of its beams,
being not ſo much born for it ſelf as
for others, being as it were the token
of Divine Love, communicating it

their powers, as the authours of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo that in the general life may

209 It is the propertie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nature to act, of the corporeal
to be paſſive, where therefore there
is a concourſe of both, as in mixed
bodies, that as the more noble doth
act and rule this as paſſive doth obey.
For the power of act is the priviledge
of ruling, but the burden of being
paſſive is the mark of being ſervile; ſo
the in-ſet fire in the ſeed, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of generation and life, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
operating ſpirit, the Archaeus of
Nature, the orderer in the preparing
and forming the matter in the mixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diſtribution of the Elements.
So doth the Form in the mixt Being
exerciſe its rule at his will, as the
fountain of all actions. So do the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the heavenly Beings diſpoſe
and ſeal all inferiour Elements and
corporeal matter.</p>
            <p n="210">210 Natural bodies which have
an active vigour, and an occult cauſe
of acting, do not, as is commonly
thought, act alone by their qualities,
but by ſecret ſpirits. For the fire
doth not heat and burn by the ſingle
qualitie of heat, but by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
flux of ſpirits and rayes. Neither
do the Earth and Water refrigerate
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104552:83"/>
or moiſten by the alone qualities of

and in-nate ſpirits ſent forth, do affect
the ſenſe from without. Neither do
poyſons onely by cold or hot quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but by malignant ſpirits bring
death or infection ſooner or later.
Concerning Plants or Herbs, we muſt
judge alike, becauſe their active vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
do not lie hid in their qualities,
but in their eſſence, which Nature
hath made abundant in ſpirits, whoſe
baſis and principle powers are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſpirituals, for the bodies are
as the ſhadows or the inveſtments of
things, under which the inviſible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is hidden, but ſince qualities are
the accidents of things, are not
therefore able to conſtitute their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
nor ſhew forth in their actings
thoſe wonderful virtues, but are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the in ſet inſtruments of actions
&amp; paſſions, which the working ſpirits,
that are the workers of all actions
make uſe of in their actings, but yet
Nature indures them not as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and efficient cauſes of actions.</p>
            <p n="211">211 The natural tinctures, odours
and taſts of things are ſpecial and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
gifts of Nature, with which it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104552:84"/>
hath ſuitably inriched her Beings,
&amp; which do not onely contribute to
their ornament, or onely are inherent
in them, as extrinſecal accidents, but
alſo have an in-ſet and radical cauſe,
and are not ſo much to be termed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
as demonſtrative tokens of
inward virtues, by which the occult
and formal ſignatures of things diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <p n="212">212 Rarefaction and condenſation
are the two inſtruments of Nature, by
which ſpirits are converted into bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and bodies into ſpirits, or alſo
by which corporeal Elements are
changed into ſpiritual Beings, and
ſpiritual into corporeal; for Elements
do ſuffer theſe changes in mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
So the Earth doth miniſter
ſpiritual food to the roots of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which being fed upon, doth go
into the ſtalk, the bark, the boughs,
the branches, the flowrs, and into the
corporeal ſubſtance. The ſame is
done by Nature in Animals. For the
meat and drink, which they diet on,
or at leaſt the better part, is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into humours, and at length into
ſpirits, which getting through the
pores, and knit to the fleſh, nerves,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104552:84"/>
bones, and the reſt of the parts of the
bodie, do nouriſh and augment them,
and do by the never-tired work of
ſupply, repair decaying nature. So
the ſpiritual and the portion of the
purer ſubſtance, is curdled to the
frothie bodie of ſeed. Art the Ape
of Nature, doth experience the like
in her reſolutions and compoſitions.</p>
            <p n="213">213 The life of individuals is in a
rational and ſtrict union of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and form: but the knot of both
natures, their tie and baſe lieth hid
in the fortified embraces of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
heat and fire, and the radical
moiſture. For that formal fire is an
heavenly ray, which is united with
the radical moiſture, which is the
pureſt and beſt digeſted portion of
the matter, and as it were an oyl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faecated,
exuberated, and turned as
it were into a ſpiritual nature, by the
organs of Nature, as by ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembicks.</p>
            <p n="214">214 There is much of the radical
moiſture in the ſeed of things, in
which, as in its food, is kept a celeſtial
Spark, which doth act all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
to generation in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
matrix. But whereſoever there is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104552:85"/>
a conſtant principle of heat, there is
conceived to be a fire, becauſe the
natural principle of heat is his in
which it is,</p>
            <p n="215">215 A man may obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
immortal in the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
which doth neither vaniſh by
death, nor conſume by the force of
the moſt violent fire, but remains
unvanquiſhed in the carkaſes and
aſhes of bodies burnt.</p>
            <p n="216">216 There is a double moiſture
lies in every mixed Being, to wit, an
Elementarie and a Radical. The
Elementarie, being partly of an aeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
parly of a watrie nature, yields
not to fire, but flies away into a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
or ſmoke, which being drawn
forth, the bodie is reſolved into aſhes;
for by it, as by a glue, the Elements
in their mixture are knit together.
But the radical moiſture ſcorns the
tyrannical aſſaults of common fire,
but it neither dies in the martyrdom,
nor flies away in the combat, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
the mixt bodie, doth ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtick to its aſhes, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of its exact puritie.</p>
            <p n="217">217 The experience of this radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
moiſture, hidden in the aſhes, did
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104552:85"/>
teach a ſecret to the glaſ-makers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of the nature of things,
for by bringing Glaſs out of Aſhes by
the ſharp point of their caſting
flames, they have made a hidden
thing evident, beyond which, neither
the ſtrength of fire or art are able to
ſtretch it. But the aſhes muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
run, that there might be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
quantitie, and a ſolid bodie
made as glaſs is, which could not be
otherwiſe, for there can be no flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing without moiſture.
Therefore that moiſture being inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from its matter, is at length
brought to terminate into that noble
and as it were aetherial tranſparent
bodie.</p>
            <p n="218">218 The extraction of Salts out
of Aſhes, in which is the chief virtue
of mixt Beings, the fertilitie of
ground increaſed by the burning of
ſtubble, and by aſhes, doth evidence,
that that moiſture preſerved free
from fire, is the radical principal of
generation, &amp; the root of nature. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this virtue lies hid, ſolitarie
and idle, till being received by the
Earth, the common matrix of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
principles, yet ſhew forth a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104552:86"/>
facultie convenient for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and multiplication, as it is alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomable
in the ſeed of things.</p>
            <p n="219">219 That Radical Balſame, is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ferment or leaven, infecting the
whole maſs of the bodie. It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible
and multiplying tincture, for
it pierceth and tingeth even the
more loathſom excrements, which is
evident by the frequent, although
imperfect generation, that is made
from out of them, as alſo by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
dunging of ground, which is
known by the moſt unſkilfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
that ſo the languiſhing
land may be ſet forward to pay its
due, and that with an advantage to
the expecting labourer.</p>
            <p n="220">220 We may gueſs, that that root
of Nature, which ſurvives the ruin of
the mixt bodie, is a foot-ſtep, and
the pureſt and immortal portion of
the firſt matter informed, and ſigned
with the divine character of Light.
For that ancient matrimonie betwixt
the firſt Matter and its Form, is not
to be untied, from which copulation
the other bodies drew their original.
Moreover, it was neceſſarie that this
incorruptible baſe of corruptible
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104552:86"/>
things, and as it were the cube-root
of them ſhould lie hid, always remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and immortal in the depth of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that it might be conſtantly and
perpetually a material Principle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a potentiality and aptitude to
life, about which, as about an immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Axle-tree, there might be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
turning of the Elements and
things. And if we may have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in dark things, to gueſs at what is
moſt likely truth, that immortal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is the foundation of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
World, and the Ferment of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
which the Eternal Meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of all things hath fore-eſtabliſhed
to ſurvive the day of the conflagration
of all things, when the Elements ſhall
be purified by that refining fire, that
ſo he might renew and repair out of
this pure and ever-remaining Matter,
his work vindicated from original ſin,
and the taint of corruption.</p>
            <p n="221">221 That this radical Baſis is not
of the kind of ſpecial forms, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
becauſe every individual hath
its individual and ſingular form, which
doth depart the body upon the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the mixt Being, yet that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
principle remaining unextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
although it abide much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104552:87"/>
and of little efficacy, by reaſon
of the abſence of the form, yet do
thoſe vital ſparkles remain apt for the
production of more debaſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
births, which production be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not ſo much to Nature, as to the
matter in its birth; this attempteth,
but is not able to generate without a
companion, by reaſon of the abſence
of the formal and ſpecifical virtue.
So the carkaſs of a man or an horſe,
by reaſon of the defect of ſeed is not
capable for the generation of a man
or an horſe, but of loathed worms
and other inſects, from whence we
may gueſs, that that feeble principle
of life proceeds from the ſcarcity of
the firſt matter, and rather to be of
the family of the lower Elements,
than of the higher and celeſtial, yet
that there is in it ſome of that tincture
of light.</p>
            <p n="222">222 For certainly that ſlight ſpark
of that former light, which did in the
beginning inform the dark matter of
the lower Abyſs, may be ſufficient for
the generation of inſects: for it doth
work the matter by a confuſed and
diſordered motion, that it might bring
forth the power into a feeble act, but
the matter warmed by this ſpark, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104552:87"/>
as it were languiſhing, being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather by the fancy than the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
of a male, doth ruſh into the
luſtfull act, and being unable to bring
forth a juſt iſſue of Nature, doth form
loathſom phantaſms, as Worms, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
Beetles, and the like, in the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
excrements. Therefore that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Moiſture is the neareſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ceaſing
ſubject of generation and
life, in which is firſt kindled the fire
of Nature, and the formal act in a well
diſpoſed and prepared matter. But
in a confuſed and ill ordered matter,
where that humour doth act the part
of the male, it begets ſpurious and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard
births of Nature, for that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which is made without ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſeed, ſeems to be made rather by
chance and default, than by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of Nature, although in it
ſeems to be a dark and confuſed kind
of copulation of actives with paſſives,
which is required alſo to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of every, though imperfect,
Being.</p>
            <p n="223">223 That radical Ferment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
abiding in the depth of mixt
Bodies, ſeem to be the Band, Seat and
Tye of that matrimony contracted
between Light and Darkneſs, between
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104552:88"/>
the firſt Matter and the univerſal
Form, finally of all the Contraries:
otherwiſe the Matter and Form, by
reaſon of their repugnant natures,
would not be knit together. But that
dark unbridledneſs of the firſt matter
and its averſeneſs from light was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and its hatred turned into love,
by the good office of that lightſom
tincture, which doth reconcile things
repugnant.</p>
            <p n="224">224 The inbred Heat and the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Moiſture are of a divers kind, for
that is wholly ſpiritual and of the Sun,
this of a middle nature, betwixt a
ſpiritual and a corporeal, both parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
of an aethereal and element<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Nature; that is of the degree of
things above, this of things below, in
which was celebrated the firſt marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of Heaven &amp; Earth, by which alſo
Heaven hath its abode in the very
Centre of the Earth. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deceived, that do confound the
inbred heat and the radical Moiſture,
for they differ no leſs than ſmoke and
flame, the light of the Sun and the
Air, Sulphur and Mercury: In mixt
Beings, the radical Moiſture is the
ſeat and food of the inbred and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Fire, its bond with the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104552:88"/>
body: but that power of Fire is
the Form and Soul of mixt Beings.
In ſeeds, that moiſture is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Keeper and Caſe of that Spirit
of Fire incloſed in the ſeed, till it be

by an adventitious heat. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that radical Subſtance is <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s

in which is kept that immortal
Fire, which is the firſt mover of all the

            <p n="225">225 That radical Moiſture is the
Catholical Balſam, the moſt precious

to every individual of her family,

more diſtant from their eternal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
There is nothing therefore
printed in this lower Margin of the
World, which was not at firſt copied
in the heavenly Being: neither is
there any particular kind of Being
of the inferiour natures, which doth
not acknowledge the dominion of
one Superiour agreeable to it, and
which it hath not the ſecret ſeal and

lower Elementary nature, is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

of the Earth is the womb, in which

For it was provided by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

            <p n="235">235 This diverſity doth eſpecially
proceed from the approch and receſs
of the Sun, appointed to this end by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104552:91"/>
the Creatour: For he hath deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sun to the Rule of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that by his various diſtance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
and reflection, they may have
a divers and various temperament,
and ſo there might be ſome help for
Nature, working divers things by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

her changes, by the various chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Times. This variety of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is worth the exacteſt thoughts of
the moſt acute Philoſophers.</p>
            <p n="236">236 The heavenly bodies, though
not ſubject to that ſtain of alteration,
do notwithſtanding introduce mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
changes in the Elementary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and do inſpire various affections
by their divers propenſion, and the

the figure of the Heavens, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

            <p n="237">237 The whole ſubſtance of the

therefore fancie the World to be the

works of Art, which is the work of
Nature, which cannot endure any
ſection into Sphears and Circles; for
they that firſt divided the aetherial
region into many orbs and circles,
did propoſe to themſelves rather the
eaſie teaching by it, than to ſhew the
truth of the thing. For the divine
nature being an unitie, is deſirous of
and endeavours unitie, and ſo avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
multiplicitie: wherefore we muſt
conceive ſhe created not many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
ſeparated by their matter and
ſuperficies, when one bodie, in reſpect
of the continuitie of the matter,
though diſtinct in the dignitie and
virtue of the parts, might ſuffice. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this taken off by the motions
of the Stars in their courſes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,
which becauſe we know not,
we therefore make a fancied Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
and do too boldly bring the
power of God under the weakneſs of
man, though the continuitie of the
Heaven hinder not the motion of the
Stars, and there might be ſome help

            <p n="238">238 That there ſhould be a firſt

whoſe hurrying motion the lower
Heavens are turned about, is not an
invention of the wiſdom of God, but
onely a fancied help for mans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
for if we aſſign the principle
of motion to that firſt mover, why do
we denie it to the globe of heaven?
why ſhould we fancie an external
cauſe of motion, which may be all

            <p n="239">239 As this loweſt province of

for its priviledges and deputie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
For the Empyrean heaven, and
the quire of the intelligible Beings,
do inſpire into the celeſtial orb thoſe
virtues, which they receive from the
Archetype, in order of ſucceſſion, and
do move thoſe natures that lie neareſt
them, not without a concent, as the
firſt organs of the material world: by
which motion the inferiour bodies,
being alſo moved, do exerciſe their
turns, as ſo many dances to a ſet pace,
and do borrow whatſoever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
from the ſuperiour bodies.</p>
            <p n="240">240 But Intelligences are illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
at hand, according to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104552:93"/>
from the mind of God, as from
the ſpring of eternal light, by which
illumination they are fed, as with an
immortal food, and in it, as in a glaſs,
do they read, receive the commands
and will of the Divine Majeſtie, and
by it are enkindled to an honourable
obedience. This is the manner and
union of the threefold nature of the
Univerſe, the knot and Herculean
bond of this union is the love of
God. So in a ternarie is compleated
the whole ſtate of the World, whoſe
Creatour is by no means part of it,
no otherwiſe than Unitie is neither
a Number, nor the part of a Number,
although it conſtitutes all number,
but is the principle and meaſure of
Number, neither is the Muſician or
Lutoniſt a part, but the authour of
the Concent.</p>
            <p n="241">241 They which believe that an
almoſt innumerable multitude of
heavenly bodies, were created for
the commoditie of the globe of the
Earth, and for her inhabitants, as to
their proper end, are deceived, for
reaſon will denie, that natures, ſo far
more noble and tranſcendent, were
enſlaved to the ſervice of more vile
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104552:93"/>
and low-born Beings. Is it not rather
more likely, that every Globe doth
rather of it ſelf make a peculiar
world, and that ſo many worlds as
feodaries to the eternal Empire of a
God, are diffuſed through the vaſt
range of the heaven, and there do
hang as bound each to the other by
that common bond of the heaven,
and that the whole large Univerſe
doth conſiſt of thoſe manifold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
Theſe, though ſo far ſevered
in nature and place, yet do joyn in a
mutual love, ſo as to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
harmonie in the Univerſe, The
heaven is the common place of all,
yet is it more pure about thoſe more
perfect Beings, therefore it is of
great tenuitie and almoſt ſpiritual,
and ſo fils up the places between,
that ſo it may the better receive the
various affections of ſo many natures,
and the ſecret virtues continually iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
from them, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, it might ſwiftly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
them to others, though far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
For the heaven is Natures
conveyance, by the mediation of
which, all the Cities of Nature do
traffique one with another, and are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104552:94"/>
made partakers of each the others
wealth and ſtore. So are they linked
together by a moſt powerfull bond
of friendſhip and nearneſs, as it were
by ſome magnetick virtue.</p>
            <p n="242">242 What hinders, but that we
may reckon the Globe of the Earth,
as well as the Moon amongſt the
Stars? For both are naturally dark
bodies, both do borrow light from
the Sun, both are ſolid bodies, and
reflect the beams of the Sun, both
ſend forth ſpirits and virtues, both
hang in their heaven or their air. But
the doubt is, whether it moves or no.
But to what end is her motion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
why may not ſhe alſo ſtand fixt
amongſt ſo many fixt bodies? And
it may be the Moon hath her inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
for it is not credible, that Orbs
of ſo immenſe and vaſt a compaſs,
ſhould be idle and uſeleſs, not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by any creatures; that their
motions, actions, and travels ſhould
onely tend to the good of this loweſt
and moſt deſpicable Globe: ſince
God himſelf, not liking Solitude, did
go out of himſelf in the Creation,
and poured out himſelf upon the
creatures, and gave them a Law for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104552:94"/>
Multiplication. Is it not more for
Gods glorie, to aſſert the intire Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of the whole Univerſe to be
like a great Empire, graced with the
various natures of many worlds, as
with ſo many Provinces or Cities?
and that the Worlds themſelves are
as ſo many habitations &amp; tenements
for innumerable Citizens of divers
kinds, and all created to ſet forth the
ſuperlative glorie of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
            <p n="243">243 And who will not admire the
Sun as an immortal Lamp, hanging up
in the middle of the hall of the Great
Lord, and enlightening all the corners
&amp; receſſes of it, or elſe as the Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Divine Majeſtie, infuſing
light, ſpirit and life into all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the World? For it was fit
that God, being altogether immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
ſhould rule and order his materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
works by an organ, which ſhould
be of a middle and moſt excellent
material Being, which alſo ought to
be full of vivifical ſpirits, and ſo to
ſet over ſenſible things, a ſenſible
Monarch.</p>
            <p n="244">244 This Doctrine of many
Worlds is not repugnant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104552:95"/>
which doth onely relate to us
the Creation of our World, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
all things concerning the others
in a myſtical, rather than an open

that ſo mens feeble ſouls, that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie

might rather ſit and admire,
than riſe and underſtand. The cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with the loſs of that true
Knowledge, which was one of all

245 The Divine nature, although
