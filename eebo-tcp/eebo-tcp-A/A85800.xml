            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moſt of the King of Spaines Cabinet Counſellors, bating his favourite <hi>Oliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> the Conſtable and Adelantado of Caſtile, who enjoy that honour by the priviledge of their offices, being Church-men, the Kings and thoſe Noblemens ghoſtly Fathers. And undoubtedly where they have ſo great a tye over mens minds, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their conſciences, they muſt needs have a ſuperintendent power over their actions, which are but the children of mens propenſions; ſo that thoſe inſolencies of <hi>Maſcarena,</hi> circumſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are derivatived from the Spaniſh Clergy, they being, if not by their conſent and directions committed, yet by their patronage and conivence. And is not this comparatively our condition, while the Clergy were <hi>revera,</hi> not <hi>nomine,</hi> onely the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Almighty, when they were <hi>boni pastores oves ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum tondentes non deglubientes,</hi> what an excellent harmony was heard through this Kingdome, joy and gladneſſe being only in dwellings? but when the Miter grew in competition with the Crowne here, when the proud and inſolently preſumptuous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates began to ranke themſelves with the chiefe Nobility, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Gentry, and tyrannize over the Communalty, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſtrange and impertinent, nay, ſuperſtitious Cannons &amp; Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of our ancient faith, backed too by authority of ſuch or the ſecular Magiſtracy, as durſt not, or at leaſt would not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their proceedings, then the wiſeſt of this Nation <hi>jam proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ardens, Vtalegon:</hi> their neighbours houſes being on fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to looke to the ſafety of their owne dwellings, endevouring to repreſſe that torrent which elſe threatned the whole Iland with a deluge. And certainly that wiſe and ſacred Senate, the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious high Court of Parliament ſeeke not to diminiſh the Kings royall Prerogative, deſcendent to him as his Crowne is from his Anceſtors, by ſeeking to regulate the power of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, by extirpation of Biſhops, though it is their conſtant tenent where the Church is reduced to an Anarchy, there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the temporall power alter'd. But I durſt not diſpute it with any of them, that not neither is Epiſcopacy ſo correlative, or conſubſiſtent with Majeſtie, that one cannot ſtand without the other, nor that the Parliament ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

To prevent a danger, certainly is the greateſt point of wiſedome, and though none will imagine, our good and gracious King ever meant to put any power againſt his people in practiſe, and in his owne Princely intention, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was an honorable and conſcionable juſtice in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being intruſted as Feoffees with the kingdomes ſafety, to ſeeke to provide for futurity, leſt ſome ſuch King there might be heereafter, that might invert the Charter of his Royalty ſeald to him by the peoples obedient ſuffrage upon the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And yet this hath ſeparated the King from his people, and given birth to theſe unhappy diſtractions: In Spaine, eſpecially in Catalonia, where the King now is, hee ſeekes to reduce them to his obedience, by affording them his preſence. All wee ſue for here, is His Majeſties royall preſence, which would ſuddenly give a ſure and happy period to theſe diſtempers. If His Highneſſe deſſerting thoſe few Incendiaries, who by their malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Councels, and affections have inſtigated and fomented theſe diſſentions would vouchſafe to comply with the univerſall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of His Kingdome, contracted in this preſent Parliament.
