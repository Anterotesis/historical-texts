            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou maiest maruaile (gentle reader)
what hath moooued mee (after so many
zealous and learned Diuines) to take in
hand this treatise against sorcery. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I haue thought it good to certifie
thee (in some measure) of my meaning
herein. It was my chance to fall into communication with
a notable supporter of those wicked vanities, which are
spoken against in this booke: who not contented to practise
the same himselfe, went about to perswade others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and to that end had framed reasons and arguments
to vphold his assertion. Which when I heard, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
considering that he was a man of place, and some
learning, and therefore might preuaile the more in this
mischieuous deuise: I determined to search out what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
had written concerning that matter. But finding
them all that I could hit vpon to be more occupied in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
inuectiues against sorcerie in generall; then in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
setting downe what it was, or wherein it consisted:
thereby leauing a dare open to these vaine and wicked
men to creepe out at: by reason the chiefe grounds were
not taken away, whereon they stand. Therefore I resolued
to make some treatise of mine own. And because I thought
I should haue thereby fit occasion, both to answer his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and also to speake of other matters very meete and
necessarie in this case: I made choice of this text in the
<pb facs="tcp:12715:3"/>
Actes of the Apostles: and so much the rather, for that it
was a place alleadged by the aforesaid partie himselfe:
that so I might (as it were,) <hi>vna fidelia duos parietes
dealbare.</hi> That is (as we say) stoppe two gappes with one
bush; both answering to the aduersaries reasons, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
opening the meaning of the said place, to all such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and true meaning Christians, as should heare or reade
the same. Howbeit at the first I had no such purpose, as to
make it common to all; but onely to such of my friends and
acquaintance, to whom I meant to commit it, and my selfe
should thinke good. Notwithstanding, afterward at my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
friends request, who did beare me in hand, that it
would be profitable to the Church of God (if it should come
abroad into the open view of the world,) at the last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as thou seest. God graunt that it may worke that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which I wish for: the which if I shall perceiue, it shall
encourage me to imploy my studies hereafter, for thy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benefit. In the meane while I commit thee to the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him, who is able to doe more then we can wish, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
And so I bid thee heartily farewell.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our Sauiour Christ Iesus
was to depart out of this world
(as pertaining to his bodily
presence) and to ascend vp into
heauen, he commaunded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
to preach the Gospel,
promising that he would ratifie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12715:4"/>
the same with signes and wonders, as appeareth cap.
16. of <hi>Marke.</hi> The fulfilling of which promise, as in
many other places, so in this chapter it is most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
set downe. For wheras before, the spirit of God
had shewed the preaching of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as also his
confutation of the aduersaries of the Gospel in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
in these words hee declareth how God
confirmed the same by miracles, especially in the
11. and 12. verses. Then followeth the peruerse emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof by the wicked coniurers, in the 13.
and 14. verses. And lastly, the effect or punishment
of this their practise in the 15. and 16. verses.</p>
            <p>For the first. The miracles which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is
here said to worke, are set downe first generally, in
the 11. verse, and afterward in the 12. verse, the same
is amplified by particulars.</p>
            <p>In the generall we must obserue two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
The chiefe efficient cause of miracles, which is God.
And the instrumentall cause, which in this place is
the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we enter into the particular discourse
of these points, we must consider the coherence of
these words, with those which went before: and that
is insinuated by this word (<hi>and</hi>) in greeke (<hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>) which
is a copulatiue coniunction, &amp; ioyneth these words
with the former: as if he should haue said, that not
only the Gospel was preached by the Apostle Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> but also the same was ratified, and confirmed
of God by miracles. And truly if we looke through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole booke of God, we shall finde the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of miracles alwaies annexed vnto the word, to
giue credit and authoritie thereunto; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the vocation of those that are setters forth of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12715:4"/>
the same. So the Lord furnished <hi>Moses</hi> with a most
excellent gift of working miracles; but hee first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him to deliuer his will vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for the
bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt. The
like may be said of <hi>Iehosuah,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and also of
all the rest of the Prophets in the olde Testament,
which for breuity sake I omit to name, leauing them
to your owne consideration, to examine the truth in
this case. As for the Apostles, and Disciples of our
Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, I thinke no man wil
denie, but that they were indued with the gift of
working miracles, to this end, that thereby their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
might the better be confirmed, and the Gospel
of Christ magnified. Neither can the contrarie bee
prooued in any of the holy men of God, which haue
wrought miracles. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the Corinthians, cap. 12. vers 7. saith, that this
gift of working miracles is giuen to profit and edifie
the Church, and not for any mans priuate vse, as it
may be necessarily gathered out of the circumstance
of that place. The which if it be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
are the dealings of those most cursed blessers,
commonly called wise &amp; cunning men, and women,
who hauing no publike calling, either ordinarie, or
extraordinarie, whereby to set forth (in any speciall
manner) the Gospel of Christ Iesus, doe take vpon
them the working of miracles: nay rather they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, and discredit his word, arrogating vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues, that which is proper vnto God, asking
oftentimes when any commeth vnto them, whether
they do beleeue, that these wizzards can do that for
them, which they come for: when as we cannot read
in the whole Scripture, of any of the Prophets, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12715:5"/>
Apostles, or any other holy men, which euer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the like at any mans hand. Indeede our Sauiour
Iesus Christ did so, but he was the eternall God, in
whome we ought to beleeue, and to put our whole
trust and confidence onely; and not in any childe of
man, whose breath is in his nosthrels, as saith the
Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> cap. 2. vers. 22. for vaine is the helpe
of man, when as he cannot thinke a good thought of
himselfe. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 3. vers. 5. much lesse performe
any good action. Wherefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in the 4.
chapter of his Epistle, inueigheth mightily against
those, which doe presume to affirme peremptorily,
that they will doe any thing, when as they know not
whether they shall liue till the morrow. Wherefore
we ought to say, if the Lord will, and if we liue, we will
doe this or that. But now (saith he) ye reioyce in
your boastings: all such reioycing is euill; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> saith, <hi>Cursed
be the man that trusteth in man,</hi> Ierem. cap. 17. vers. 5.
Then cursed are these wizzards, which would haue
others to beleeue, and trust in them: for in God we
liue, mooue, and haue our beeing, <hi>Act.</hi> cap. 17. v. 28.
and he is the onely worker of miracles, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the next words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God wrought]</hi> It is not said that <hi>(Paul wrought)</hi> but
that (<hi>God wrought.</hi>) This thing <hi>Nichodemus</hi> seemeth
very well to haue vnderstood, when he saith. <hi>Ioh.</hi> c.
3. v. 2. that hee knew that Christ Iesus was a teacher
come from God, because that no man could doe
such miracles, except God were with him; as though
no man of himselfe, or by any other meanes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the power of God alone working in him,
could effect such miraculous workes. And our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12715:5"/>
Sauiour Christ doth insinuate as much in the 10.
chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel, vers 38. saying: <hi>If ye
beleeue not me, yet beleeue the workes, that ye may knowe
and beleeue that the father is in me, and I in him.</hi> As if
he should haue said: If I doe not such workes, as are
farre aboue the reach of any mortal man to do, then
beleeue me not: but if I doe, then thinke that God,
which is the onely worker of all such miracles, is the
Author of those which ye see done by me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (after that hee with S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> had healed the creeple which was borne lame)
lest the people should attribute the said worke of
healing to their power, or godlinesse, telleth them,
that it was done onely in the name, and by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Iesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> cap. 3. So he telleth <hi>Aneas,</hi>
who had kept his bedde (by reason of a palsie) the
space of eight yeares, that Iesus Christ had made
him whole; and not he: and therefore biddeth him
to arise and make his bedde, <hi>Act.</hi> cap. 3. vers. 33, 34.
There are many other places of scripture, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the truth of this matter, but the case is so
cleare, that I will stand no longer vpon it, but will
passe ouer to that which followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No small miracles]</hi> That is great miracles: and it
is an vsuall kinde of speech in many languages. The
words in greeke doe signifie no common or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
powers, because that thereby the power of God
is shewed, after an vnwoonted sort: which power (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supernaturall) albeit it belongeth, and is proper
to God alone, yet he doth otherwhiles exercise the
same by his creatures: as it is said heare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the hands of Paul</hi>] that is by the ministery of
<hi>Paul,</hi> for so the words doe signifie in this place. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12715:6"/>
it is an vsuall phrase in the scripture, as <hi>Act.</hi> cap. 5.
vers. 12. it is said, that by the hands of the Apostles,
were many signes and wonders shewed among the
people. So <hi>Act.</hi> cap. 14. vers. 3. also. And it seemeth
to bee a metaphor borrowed from the common
course, &amp; accustomed dealings of masters with their
schollers, especially of those which beginne to learne
to write, whose hands (the master ruling) although
the scholler holdeth the penne in his hand, yet the
master maketh the letter. The like case is theirs,
which do worke miracles: for God is the onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of them, howsoever it pleaseth him to vse those
men as instruments in effecting of the same, for his
greater glorie, both in himselfe, as the chiefe efficient
cause, and also in his instruments, to the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their calling, and of the truth of his
word. And to that end, in the 4. chap. vers. 29, &amp; 30.
of the <hi>Actes,</hi> the Apostles Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
do pray vnto God, that he would stretch forth his
hand, to worke miracles by them, in these wordes:
<hi>Graunt vnto thy seruants with all boldnes, to speake thy
word, so that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing,
and signes, and wonders may be done, by the name of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne Iesus.</hi> By which prayer it appeareth, that God
doth not bestow the gift of working miracles, for
any man whatsoeuer, to vse at his owne pleasure, or
after what manner he thinketh good: but so as that
God may haue alwaies one end of the staffe (as they
say) in his own hand, to vse, or not to vse, as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
most conuenient; both for his owne glorie, and
for the good of those, for whose sake secondarily,
those miracles are wrought. For wee vse rather to
giue thankes, then to pray for that which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12715:6"/>
receiued: except it be for the continuance of
it. And that this is true, it is manifest by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
where S. <hi>Paul</hi> reciting the spirituall gifts of the H. G.
bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church at that time, for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the same: reckoning the gift of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
for one: in the end he concludeth, that al these
things worketh euen the self same spirit, distributing
to euery man seuerally, euen as he wil. If as God wil,
then not as man wil: neither in regard of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of time, &amp; place, nor yet in maner of working.
And to speake generally of the time, it is more then
probable, that miracles are now ceased: so saith S.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> about 1200 yeares since, vpon the 17.
chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> vers. 20. in these words: <hi>Cúm
hodie ista (viz. miracula) in ecclesia non fiant, an propte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
dicemus Christianos destitui fide? auertat deus, vt de
populo deitam male sentiamus. Adest fides iustificans, sed
ea quae miraculorum dicitur, iam desijt:</hi> which is thus
much in english: Because that now at this day these
things (to wit miracles) are not wrought in the
Church; shall we therefore say, that Christians are
altogether without faith? God forbid, that we should
thinke so badly of God his people. For they haue
iustifying faith, but that which they call the faith of
miracles, is alreadie ceased. For seeing that the ende
of working miracles was to confirme the word, as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 14. vers. 22. of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
gift of languages; that it was a token to them
that beleeue not, and not to them that beleeue, to
prepare and mooue their mindes to the imbracing
of the Gospel: which Gospel, beeing now a great
while since sufficiently prooued, and the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
established by miracles, what needeth the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12715:7"/>
of the said gift amongst vs? And that the gift
of working miracles, was but for a certaine time, at
the beginning onely, bestowed vpon his Church, as
diuers other spirituall gifts were, which are rehearsed
in the 12. chap. of the 1. Epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> it is very manifest:
because that all the rest of miraculous gifts there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
are ceased, &amp; out of vse at this present. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wizzards of these our daies, howsoeuer they
colour their legerdemaine in this behalfe; yet they
are farre from the true practise of working miracles,
giuen and accepted of God: by reason that the vse
thereof is ceased with the end, for which it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and ordained. Neither are we to thinke that the
hand of the Lord is shortened therby, no more then
it was, when <hi>Manna</hi> ceased among the Israelites. But
the Lord knoweth, and doth alwaies, that which is
most conuenient, and profitable, both for his owne
glorie, and for our eternall comfort. Yea, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
he so moderateth the particular actions of
all those, vpon whome hee bestoweth this grace of
working miracles; that they doe nothing in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
but onely as he doth direct, and assigne them.
So <hi>Moses</hi> did his miracles alwaies at God his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
and the disciples of our Sauiour Iesus
Christ, could not heale the lunaticke childe, in the
17. chap. of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Howbeit at other times
they did greater wonders. And the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>
in the second booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> cap. 7. because he was
not first directed by God, failed in giuing counsaile
vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> to build the temple. Neither may wee
thinke, that it hath beene otherwise in this case with
any other of the seruants of God. For albeit it bee
not expressed alwaies in the scripture; yet it is out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12715:7"/>
of doubt, that were inwardly ledde by the spirit
of God, to doe euery particular miracle, that they
wrought: euen as the disciples of our Sauiour Christ
were, what they should speake in the 10. chapter of
<hi>Matth.</hi> where our Sauiour Christ saith vnto them:
<hi>Take no thought how or what ye shall speake: for it shall
be giuen you in that houre, what ye shall say: for it is not ye
that speake, but the spirit of your father which speaketh in
you.</hi> Wherefore our Sauiour Christ in the 9. chapter
of the Gospel after Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> findeth fault with his
disciples, because they would haue had fire to come
downe from heauen vpon the Samaritans, as <hi>Elias</hi>
did procure to fall vpon the two fifties of men, and
their leaders, in the 2. booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> cap. 1. say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they knew not of what spirit they were: as
though he should haue said: If that ye did know, and
consider (as the truth is) that <hi>Elias</hi> was mooued by
the spirit of God, to execute his iudgement vpon
those men: and that ye are onely ledde by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of reuenge, ye would neuer haue motioned this
matter; for now ye aske ye wot not what. But those
that are counted cunning men amongst vs, doe
at no time looke for God his direction: but for the
opposition, and coniunction of the planets, with a
sort of other vaine and wicked obseruations, fitter
for heathen men, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for those that beare the names
of Christians: which God hath flatly forbidden in
the 18. chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> and <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> cap.
19. vers. 26. and by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> he saith, cap.
10. <hi>Learne not the way of the heathen, and bee not afraid
for the signes of heauen, though the heathen bee afraid of
such, for the customes of the people are vaine.</hi> For the
right vse of the starres, and the motions thereof, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12715:8"/>
set downe by God himselfe, in the 1. cap. of <hi>Gen.</hi> vers.
14, and 15. in these wordes. <hi>And God said, let there be
lights in the firmament of heauen, to separate the day from
the might, and let them be for signes, and for seasons, and for
daies, and yeares, and let them be for lights in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heauen, to giue light vpon the earth.</hi> The like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie
is to be found in these men; when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
and set downe vnto themselues, and their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in what place, such and such wonders are to
be wrought. As though the power of God were tied
to one place more then vnto another. Wherein
they are like the Aramites in the 20. cap. of the 1.
booke of the <hi>King.</hi> when they say, that the God of
Israel is God of the mountaines, and not of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies:
and therefore the Lord slew them with the
edge of the sword.</p>
            <p>Furthermore for euery particular miracle God
directeth (if it be done as it should be) the meanes,
and manner how it should be wrought: either out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
by his word: or inwardly by his spirit. Thus
the Lord when he did send <hi>Moses</hi> to worke miracles
before <hi>Pharaoh. Exod.</hi> the 7, 8, and 9 chapters. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth,
and telleth him, after what manner he
should doe them: So when he ledde the children of
Israel ouer Iorden, by the hand of <hi>Iehosuah:</hi> cap. 3.
he biddeth him to command the priests, that did
beare the Arke of the couenant, that when they
came to the brinke of the waters of Iorden they
should stand stil in Iorden: whereby the people went
ouer that riuer dry. In like manner in the 6. cap. of
the booke of <hi>Iehosuah</hi> the Lord declareth vnto <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah</hi>
what he will haue done, that the walles of the
citie of Iericho might fall downe before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12715:8"/>
of Israel: the which being once done, the wall
sell flat downe; so the people went vp into the citie,
euery man straight before him: And they tooke the
city. So in the 1. booke of the <hi>Kings.</hi> cap. 13. assoone
as the man of God had vttered the word of the
Lord against the altar, it claue asunder, and the ashes
fell out. But in the 2. booke of the <hi>King.</hi> cap. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that <hi>Elisha</hi> did presume of himselfe, without
the Lord his direction, to deuise a course to raise the
womans child being dead to life againe, by laying
the staffe vpon the childes face, by the hand of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi>
his seruant: therefore it tooke no effect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought we to imagine by this, that God is tyed
to these, or any other meanes of like sort. For he
doth the selfe same, sometimes by one meanes,
sometimes by another, as in the 4. cap. of <hi>Exod.</hi> vers.
9. he biddeth <hi>Moses</hi> to powre the water of the riuer
vpon the dry ground onely, and it should be turned
into blood, and in the 7. cap. of <hi>Exod.</hi> vers. 17. he
commaundeth him to stretch out his hand with the
rodde in it, ouer the waters, &amp; they should be blood,
yea God doth bring to passe contrarie things, by
one and the selfe same meanes, as in the 14. cap. of
<hi>Exod.</hi> the sea is both made dry for the Israelites to
go ouer: and the waters returne againe to couer the
Egyptians, when <hi>Moses</hi> stretcheth forth his hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the same as before. Nay seeing the Lord is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
he can doe what he will, as well without, as
with meanes: but that it pleaseth him to exercise his
children, to attend vpon his ordinances: and not to
feine vnto themselues deuises of their owne braine,
which the Lord alloweth not: as doe the cunning
men, and women in these our daies: thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12715:9"/>
to worke those wonders which they desire. The
which, although the Lord permitteth the diuell to
bring to passe for them, yet is it not therefore a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequent, that God is the author or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of this their worke; for God doth it other-whiles
to try them, as he saith in the 13. cap. of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi>
So the sorcerers of Egypt in the 7. cap. of
<hi>Exod.</hi> did bring to passe some things by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments;
as did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> by the finger of
God, whereby the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was hardened.</p>
            <p>And if it be so (will some say) how shall we discerne
the seruants of God, from the seruants of the diuell
in this behalfe?</p>
            <p>To these I answer; that albeit it be not very easie,
(especially to the children of disobedience) as the
spirit of God by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Thess. cap. 2. speaking
of Antichrist, the man of sinne saith: that his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
is by the working of Satan, with all power and signes,
and lying wonders, and in all deceiueablenesse of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
among them that perish, because they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the loue of the truth, that they might be saued. And
therefore God shall send them strong delusions, that they
should beleeue lies that all they might be damned, which
beleeued not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
And our Sauiour Christ in the 24. cap. of the
Gospell after Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith: that there shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
false Christs, and false prophets, and <hi>shall shew
great signes, and wonders, so that (if it were possible) they
should deceiue the very elect.</hi> Yet they may be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by three especial means, and notes. <hi>viz.</hi> First by
their vocation &amp; calling. Secondly by their manner
of working: And thirdly, by the end and intent of
their working. As for the first it is euident, that in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12715:9"/>
primitiue Church the gift and grace of miracles
working, was annexed vnto the Ecclesiasticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as it appeareth in the 12. cap. of the 1. epist.
<hi>Cor.</hi> vers. 28. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
in the Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets,
thirdly teachers, then doers of miracles, after that the gifts
of healing, helpers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gouernours, diuerse tongues.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Papists, least they should seeme any thing to
be inferiour vnto the primitiue Church, haue (like
apes) appointed (<hi>Exorcistae</hi>) (as they tearme them) for
one of their ecclesiasticall orders, albeit in vaine,
they hauing not their inward calling from God:
Who at the first planting of his Gospell, did bestow
this grace vpon his Church, that whereas the onely
preaching of the word tooke little or none effect, yet
by those miracles, which they see done in the
Church, they might be conuerted and acknowledge
the truth. Thus the Lord, when he sent <hi>Moses</hi> vnto
the children of Israel to tell them, that by his hand
God would deliuer them out of their bondage in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
because that <hi>Moses</hi> seemed to doubt least they
would not beleeue: Therefore the Lord appointed
him to worke miracles before them: at the sight
whereof they beleeued. <hi>Exod.</hi> cap. 4. And <hi>Sergius
Paulus</hi> in the 13. cap. of the <hi>Actes</hi> of the Apostles,
when he did see the miraculous striking of <hi>Elimas</hi>
the sorcerer blind, is said to beleeue, and to be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
at the doctrine of the Lord. So also the Iaylour
in the 16. cap. of the <hi>Actes.</hi> was conuerted to the
faith, when he saw the miracle wrought in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
where whilest <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> prayed, and sung
psalmes in the night, suddainely there was a great
earth-quake, so that the foundation of the prison
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12715:10"/>
was shaken: and by and by all the prison dores ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and euery mans bonds were loosed. And the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in the 4. cap. of the Gospell after Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> with
all his houshould beleeued in our Sauiour Iesus
Christ, when he had seene the miracle which he had
done in healing of his sonne. To these I may adde
that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 14. cap. of the 1.
epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> vers. 22. where affirming the miraculous
gift of languages to be a signe vnto those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
not, seemeth to insinuate the like end and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of other miracles. And experience doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
the same: For since the time of <hi>Constantine</hi>
the great, that the Christian religion hath bin pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
professed, and by godly Emperours maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the gift of miracles hath ceased. Many more
proofes might be alleadged to this purpose: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this matter hath beene handled before in a
fitter (as I take it) and a more conuenient place, I wil
therefore passe it ouer, and returne to the point
which I had in hand, against the which it may be
obiected, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his bookes, <hi>de Idololatria,</hi>
and <hi>de Corona militis.</hi> seemeth to affirme: that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and souldiers did miracles in his time: and
therefore this gift is not alwaies annexed to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
function. To this it may be answered:
That although their outward vocation seemed to
be meere laick (as they tearme it) yet were they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and extraordinarily called of God, to the
working of miracles: to the which no doubt was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the preachin; of the Gospell, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or els some other of the clergy. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
albeit a most excellent. Apostle, and preacher of the
Gospell in the Church of God, is said to be a Tent-maker,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12715:10"/>
and wrought of the same trade for his liuing,
as it is set downe in the 18. cap. of the <hi>Actes.</hi> vers. 3. so
that a mechanical trade, or any other honest and
lawfull profession of trafficke in marchandize, or
warrefare, doth not exclude them altogether from
being of the clergy. But as for our cunning men (as
we tearme them) what ecclesiasticall function haue
they? or how doth their profession belong thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
Seeing that for ordinarie callings, we haue none
such in our Churches: except (as I said) it be among
the Papists, wherein how ridiculous they are, who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, which is not wilfully blinded. And that they
haue no such like extraordinarie calling, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
plainely, both by reason, and experience. For
as our Sauiour Christ in the 4. chapter of S. <hi>Marke,</hi>
vers. 21. and Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the 8. cap. vers. 16. saith, that
<hi>a candle is not lighted to be put vnder a bushell, or vnder
the table: but on a candle-stick that they that enter in may
see the light:</hi> so these men, if they had an effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from God, they could not but in some measure
exercise the same, to the glory of God, and the good
of his Church. As the prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> when as he
saw little or no profit of his labours, in so much that
he was euen smitten, and cast into prison for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the word: yet he could not forbeare, but
saith, that the word of God <hi>was in his heart as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fire, shut vp in his bones: So that he was weary with
forbearing, and could not stay. Ieremy</hi> the 20. cap. vers.
the 9. But these men, of whome I speake, are much
vnlike to the prophet <hi>Ieremy.</hi> For they are either so
ignorant in the word of God, and Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they know not the truth thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how should they giue testimony vnto the same
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12715:11"/>
by the working of miracles: Or els their life is so
lewd and vaine, that their witnes would rather giue
offence, then any wise confirme the truth of the
word preached. But to leaue this, and come to the
next note or marke, whereby we may discry the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of miracles whether it be of God or not. Let vs
first consider the nature and difference of miracles.
A miracle may be defined a rare and vnwoonted
thing, or worke, which either is, or seemeth impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be wrought by any naturall force, or meanes,
and thereby mooueth admiration. Hence we may
gather two kinds of miracles: Namely, right and
true miracles: and false or feined miracles. The true
miracles are those, which cannot possibly be done
by any naturall meanes, or creature, but onely by
diuine vertue, and power, and these are of two sortes.
For some are so, of, and by themselues: as was the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the children of Israel with Manna in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
in the 16. cap. of <hi>Exod,</hi> vers. 36. The staying
of the sunne in the time of <hi>Iehosuah,</hi> cap. 10. vers. 12.
The raising of the dead: Yea and the healing of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
that by no natural meanes of any creature can
be cured, and a great many more, such like set down
in the scripture: the which cannot be wrought but
onely by the finger of God: and therefore not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diuilish meanes or sorcery: Albeit the diuell may
sometimes counterfeit the same. Yet his legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
is heere sooner espied, then in any other kind
of miracles, by reason that he wanteth the ground of
naturall causes to support it. The second sort of
right and true miracles, are those which are so onely
in regard of their manner of working, being not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by, nor proceeding from any naturall cause,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12715:11"/>
but from the power of God. As the curing of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
with the onely shadow of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> cap. 5. (if
the said diseases were otherwise curable) although
hardly by naturall meanes. And in this chap. ver.
12. with the napkins and partletes of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> As
also the raine and cloudes of <hi>Elias</hi> in the first booke
of the <hi>King.</hi> cap. 18. And the thunder of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> cap. 12. In this sort of miracles the diuell doth
often intermeddle; his ministers the sorcerers vsing
otherwhiles the same outward meanes, which the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God haue vsed in such like cases: and the
diuel vnder this veile worketh the effect intended, by
naturall meanes: as many sorcerers in these our daies
doe send cloathes vnto their patients, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, the diuell doth secretly infuse some natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
remedy, whereby the malady, wherewith they
are greieued, is cured. And when things are thus
wrought, they are not true, but false miracles, for
right and true miracles (as I said before) are those
which are effected by the diuine power of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
of which sort were all those which were done by
the Prophets, Apostles, and our Sauiour Christ
himselfe, and his disciples. For the grace of working
miracles is a spirituall gift and not a naturall, as it is
set downe in the 12. cap. of the 1. epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> And
therefore the meanes of the said working, must
needs be supernaturall, being wrought by the same
spirit who is the author, and distributer of the said
gift. For euen as the Lord God hath created heauen
and earth, so hath he giuen to euery thing therein, in
the creation a seuerall nature, vertue, and property,
to be wrought, or to worke this or that effect (if it be
rightly vsed and applyed) the which it is not possible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12715:12"/>
for any creature in the world to alter, or change, but
onely for the creator, who made al things of nought
at the first, as the Psalmist saith. <hi>He set the earth vpon
hir foundations, that it neuer should mooue. Psal.</hi> 104.
Wherefore neither man, angell, nor diuell can doe
any thing, but onely by naturall meanes; for they
cannot create any thing of nothing, for that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God alone: and therefore they of themselues
can doe no true and right miracles; but as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by his diuine power, doth supernaturally worke
the said miracles by them. But they may worke false
and counterfeit miracles. Which are those, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are not the thing that they seeme to be; or els if
they be so, yet are they wrought by naturall meanes,
albeit to vs vnknowne. For the diuell doth often
times deceiue and delude the senses, so that things
do shew to be other, and otherwise, then they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede;
as it commeth to passe in night spells (as they
tearme them) when as it seemeth that a wal, or some
great water, is obiected and set against the party that
is within the circle of the said spell, that he cannot
passe forth. Which is nothing els but a meere delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Satan: For let them goe backward and they
may passe the circle without any such let: with
many other such like. Howbeit sometimes he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth
the thing it selfe, which in shew appeareth,
as was the fire which consumed <hi>Iobs</hi> sheepe, and his
seruantes, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. cap. And this he doth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
and sundry waies, and meanes: but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by three. The first is by applying the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
or working cause vnto the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they know any thing (which they intend) may
be effected. And so it is thought, that <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:12715:12"/>
sorcerers made the frogges before him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. The
like wherof we may see by daily experience amongst
vs: when as by the blowing of flyes vpon flesh,
there arise wormes, or maggotes. And by this means
partly they both bring diseases vpon men, and
likewise sometimes cure them by applying, or infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
secretly, either inwardly or outwardly to the
bodie, things that may hurt or heale the same.
Secondly, by the stirring and moouing of things: as
in the aire, when he raiseth windes and lightnings:
as <hi>Iob.</hi> cap. 1. vers. 19. and when he maketh any to be
carried aloft in the same. In the waters when he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
inundations. In the body of man, or beast, when
he mooueth the spirits or humours, whereby diuers
and sundrie diseases are ingendred, the which it were
long here to recite. Thirdly, whereas the diuell of
himselfe is an inuisible spirit, he taketh often vpon
him the shape of other creatures: whereby &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he appeareth vnto men after diuers sorts: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in insensible things: as he gaue his oracles in
olde times, otherwhiles out of images set in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the heathen gods: as also it is reported, that
hee did out of an oake in a wood neere to the citie
Dodona. Sometimes in sensible creatures, as he did
deceiue our Grandmother <hi>Eue</hi> by, &amp; in the serpent.
Sometime in reasonable creatures, as in man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there are many examples in the new testament, of
those whose bodies he had possessed: and in our time
also the like hath beene seene and obserued: as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
in the 16. chapter of his second booke <hi>de abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
rerum causis,</hi> recordeth a historie, wherof himselfe
was (as it seemeth) an eye-witnes: Of one which
was possessed with a diuell, who beeing a young man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12715:13"/>
of good place and calling, and being grieuously pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(as it is there set downe) did send for diuers Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
who hauing vsed their best skill to cure the
said malady, did notwithstanding all their labour,
and cunning, nothing preuaile. In the end (about
some three moneths after) it was found out, that hee
was possessed with a spirit; as well by other things, as
also, and that especially by speaking of greeke and
latine: whereas the party diseased was vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the greeke tongue; wherefore after that the
fitte was somewhat slaked, he confessed that hee had
vttered those speeches against his will: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
after these waies, and meanes, and such like;
the diuell doth worke counterfeit miracles (as I
haue said,) to the which he is apt and able rather
then man, both in regard of his nature in his first
creation: and also in regard of his long experience
since. For beeing a spirit, he easily doth pierce into
that which a solide substance cannot: and also bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
void of that burthen of the flesh, wherewith man
is clogged, and pressed downe, hee is able to mooue
himselfe as well vpward, as downeward, or sidewaies;
and that with such speede as it passeth mans capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to conceiue of it. Thus he sometimes stirreth vp
windes, and lightnings in the aire, as <hi>Iob.</hi> cap. 1. from
whence also he espyeth what is done, or to bee done
vpon the earth beneath: sometimes raising earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
and fire, and vapours out of the earth: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
passing from place to place, as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
to marke, to see, or to doe, that which is most
fitting for his owne turne, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
saith, 1. Epist. cap. 5. vers. 8 <hi>that he goeth about like a
roaring lyon, seeking whome he may deuoure.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12715:13"/>
at the first beeing made an angell of God, euen
by nature he surpasseth man farre, as well in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and knowledge, as also in power and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
to put their knowledge in practise. All which
are much confirmed and augmented by his daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
the which hee hath had from the creation
of the world, the which is graunted to no mortall
man; and therefore he is rightly called the olde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in the <hi>Apocal.</hi> cap. 12. vers. 9. And albeit he bee
fallen from his former integritie, by reason of his
transgression, yet his naturall powers and faculties
are not vtterly taken away, but onely corrupted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now prone to all kinde of mischiefe, and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.
For whereas God almightie at the first, framed
him a most excellent creature, furnished with most
admirable gifts as the other angels, to the obedience
of his will: now hee is become an enemy both to
God, and man: turning his wit and knowledge, into
cunning, and deceit: and his strength and such like
qualities, to the working of sinne and iniquity: euen
to the ouerthrow of all vertue and goodnes: but that
the Lord hath put a bridle in his mouth: so that he
can go no further then God will permit him, no not
in naturall causes, as it is manifest in the booke of
<hi>Iob,</hi> c. 1. &amp; 2. where it is set downe, that he could not
touch <hi>Iobs</hi> goods without especial licence: and when
he had done that, he could proceed no further with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a new commission to touch his bodie: yet hee
opposeth himselfe (as much as in him lyeth) against
God, erecting to himselfe by tyranny a kingdome
of his own, withdrawing by all meanes possible, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
from the obedience of the almightie, to serue
him. And to bring this matter the easier to passe (as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12715:14"/>
neere as he can) he wil notwithstanding imitate God
in these actions, thereby to set a better glosse vpon
his bad dealings. In so much that as the Lord hath
giuen a law vnto his subiects, namely his word, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is set downe, both how himselfe will bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and also they should deale amongst themselues.
Euen so the diuell giueth rules of instruction to his
liege people, which haue giuen as it were their names
vnto him to serue him; I meane the magitians, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
sorcerers, inchanters, and such like; how they
should vse themselues towards him, both in regard
of his owne person, and also how they should do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
and worke counterfeit miracles, and vaine
trickes of legerdemaine amongst themselues, and
other men. Howbeit nothing is brought to passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
by these meanes: but the diuell himselfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour therof, to wit of certaine sette formes
of words, or characters, of what forme or fashion so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they be, whether circular, angular, crossewise, or
in the figure of man, beast, or any other thing which
is vsed in magicke. The diuell (I say) vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of these, and such like, doth worke those effects,
which by his ministers are intended. For what can
words of themselues doe, but onely signifie: neither
can characters doe or effect any thing, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present.
For if they doe any thing, it must bee either
of their owne nature; or else by God his institution
aboue, and beyond nature. But not of their owne
nature, seeing that the meanes and matter onely of
words at the beginning were made, when as God
created al things, and gaue vnto them their naturall
properties: and words were deuised by man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for otherwise they would be the selfe same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12715:14"/>
all nations; which we see is false: and this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
true, and approued by the second chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> the 19. and 20. verses, where it is said, that the
Lord God formed of the <hi>earth, euery beast of the field,
and euery foule of the heauen: and brought them vnto the
man, to see how hee world call them: for howsoeuer the
man named the liuing creature, so was the name thereof:
the man therefore gaue names, vnto all cattell, and to the
foule of heauen, and to euery beast of the field.</hi> And as
for characters, they (as euery man may see) are not
things naturall, but artificially made, and formed (as
we say) according as it pleaseth the painter. And as
for this prerogatiue of words by God his instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
besides that there can no warrant out of the
scripture be brought to approoue it: so it seemeth
confutable by the 13. v. of this present chap. where
the Exorcists are said to vse the same words in effect,
which the Apostles had vsed in the like cases, and
brought nothing to passe; which could not haue bin,
if the Lord had appointed and giuen such vertue to
the words alone, to worke such supernaturall effects.
But to leaue this, and to returne to our former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
In the 18. cap. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> vers. 20. it is thus
set downe: <hi>The Prophet that shall presume to speake a
word in my name, which I haue not commaunded him to
speake; or that speaketh in the name of other Gods, euen the
same Prophet shall die.</hi> The which place, although it
may seeme by the words, to bee vnderstood of the
Prophets, or preachers of the word onely; yet it may
also bee vnderstood of workers of miracles: in as
much as they (for the most part) were the workers
of miracles: and therefore in the 13. cap. vers. 1. &amp; 2.
of this booke, they are mentioned togither, in these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12715:15"/>
words: <hi>If there arise among you a Prophet, or a dreamer
of dreams, &amp; giue thee asigne, or a wonder, &amp;c.</hi> Yea euen
prophesying it selfe is a supernaturall worke, and a
miracle: and further, the circumstance of this 18.
chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> from the 9. verse, doth insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
the same sense. For after that the Lord by the
hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> had giuen the Israelites in charge,
that when they came into the promised land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
they should not seeke to sorcerers, witches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,
necromancers, and such like; hee telleth
them that he would raise them vp Prophets, which
should supply all those wants, whereof they sought
to bee releeued by the aforesaid diuelish practisers
(so farrre forth as God should see it needefull) and
therfore there should be no reason, why they should
vse to goe vnto such: but rather to vse God his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
meanes, which he hath allowed in his word,
and sanctified. And lest any of the aforesaid magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or any other beeing not lawfully called, should
intrude himselfe into this function, therefore hee
threatneth them, that they should be slaine, whether
they pretended the name of the true God for this
their practise, or vsed the name of any other false
god, to bring their purposes about. In which place
we may note two especiall meanes in generall to bee
set downe, whereby the Prophets did prophesie, and
worke wonders among the people. The one is in the
name of (<hi>other</hi>) that is (straunge) or (false) gods:
which is, when they do it in the name, and as it were,
by the meanes of any thing, or creature, but onely of
God almightie. For seeing there is but one God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which is the true God, and creator of al things,
and from whome euery good gift proceedeth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12715:15"/>
euery miracle is wrought (as I haue prooued before)
it followeth of necessitie, that whosoeuer worketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wonder in the name, or by the meanes of any
thing in the world, but onely of him, and by the
meanes that himselfe hath appointed, and allowed,
maketh thereof a god, and in the roome of the true
<hi>Iehouah,</hi> placeth the creature. And of this sort are all
they which worke by the name of any, either angell,
diuell, saints, or men deceased, or any other creature,
or by any other words deuised by man, or Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in regard of the words the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues alone, or
in regard of the maner: as whether they be pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or written, or how often this is to be done: or in
respect of the order, or any other circumstance of
time, or place, or such like. The which also may bee
said of figures, or characters, of what forme, or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
soeuer they be. All these meanes are simply euill,
and against the first commaundement (<hi>Thou shalt
haue no other gods but me</hi>) and therefore abominable,
and by no meanes to be vsed. The other meanes of
working miracles, is in the name of the onely true
God. That is, when they vse any, or all the names of
the holy Trinity: or the meanes set downe in the
word, and exercised by the Prophets and Apostles:
as is praier, and fasting and such like. They which
doe vse the name of God, as it consisteth of letters
and syllables in these cases, whether pronounced
with the mouth, or written, doe exceedingly abuse,
and blaspheme the name of God against the third
commaundement. <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vaine,</hi> vsing it vnto another end, then
he hath ordeined it. For God hath not appointed his
name for men to worke wonders by it, but that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12715:16"/>
he might be knowne, and glorified. For whereas
God in himselfe is incomprehensible by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of man, it hath pleased him to manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by certaine names, which doe in some measure
expresse his nature vnto vs, so far forth as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of our capacity can beare: and as God thinketh
it to be most meete, &amp; conuenient both for his owne
glory, &amp; the good of his people, as he saith vnto the
Israelites in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 2. that the <hi>appeared vnto Abraham,
Isaack</hi> and <hi>Iacob, by the name of God almighty: but</hi> (saith
he) <hi>by my name Iehouah, was I not knowne vnto them.</hi>
As for those which doe vse certaine set formes of
prayers, and other meanes vsed by the holy men of
God in working miracles: albeit at the first it may
seeme to be very lawfull, and good, yet if they haue
not an especiall gift, and calling from God to worke
the same, their practise is to be suspected. Nay it is
most vnlawfull and wicked, and a sinne against the
third commaundement. In that the meanes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
are vainely vsed, when as God hath giuen no
such vertue vnto those words alone: neither haue
they any commission from him, to worke miracles
by his authority or power: for although our Sauiour
Christ in the 17. cap. of <hi>Matth.</hi> vers. 21. and <hi>Mark.</hi>
cap. 9 vers. 29. seemeth to insinuate, that some mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are not wrought without prayer and fasting;
(speaking of the casting out of diuels) yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, that God hath graunted such force and
vertue vnto the words in prayer, or to the action of
fasting, of themselues to worke miracles, howsoeuer
they be vsed; for our Sauiour Christ doth there
speake vnto his disciples, vpon whome he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
the grace of working miracles before: and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12715:16"/>
yet neuertheles, he will haue them to vse harty prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in this busines, that thereby they may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God almighty, to be as well the continuer, as
the first author and giuer of all such graces: and that
they might altogether depend vpon him, for his
continuall assistance with the same. Wherfore heere
we must haue regard vnto the first note of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betweene the seruants of God, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of Satan before set downe: namely, their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>But because that wolues doe often times enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sheepefold in sheepes cloathing, neither hath
euery one of the Church of God the gift of working
miracles (albeit an Ecclesiasticall person) as it is
plaine by the 12. cap. of the 1. epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> vers. 29. and
30. therefore we must marke and consider the third
note of difference. VVhich is to what end and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
they doe worke miracles. And this note or
marke may be gathered out of the 13. cap. of <hi>Deut.</hi>
where the Lord saith thus; <hi>if there arise vp among you
a prophet, or a dreamer of dreames, and giue thee a signe, or
a wonder, and that signe, or wonder which he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
come to passe, saying, let vs goe after other gods, which
thou hast not knowne, and worshippe them hearken not thou
to the words of that prophet, or dreamer of dreames: for
the Lord your God, trieth you, to know whether you loue the
Lord your God with all your heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with all your soule,
follow the Lord your God, and feare him, and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
and giue eare vnto his voice, and worshippe
him, and cleaue vnto him.</hi> By which words it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that whosoeuer he be, that worketh miracles,
and doth not thereby seeke the glory of the onely
true God, but rather his owne gaine, praise, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12715:17"/>
Or doth it for any other sinister respect:
we are not to goe, nor to hearken vnto him: for he
doth not the Lords message, but his owne: Neither
is he sent of God, but vsurpeth the authority of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or is Satans minister herein. The which the
Lord sometime doth suffer to be done, to try what
is in the heart of his people: whether in loue they wil
cleaue vnto him, and keepe his commaundements
which he hath set downe in his word, for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof he hath wrought so many, and so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
miracles. And indeed the gift of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as also other such like graces, wherewith
the Lord doth indue, and adorne his Church, and
the ministers of the same: is in a manner bestowed
vpon it to this end, that his elect children being in
minde, and conscience assured, setled, and grounded
in the truth of Gods word; may grow, and encrease
together, more and more, in the faithfull and zelous
practise thereof, in all godly and honest conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to the glory of God and their owne saluation.
This is prooued to be true by the 12. cap. 1. epist.
<hi>Cor.</hi> where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> recounting the spirituall gifts
of God bestowed vpon his Church in these words
saying, that <hi>to one is giuen by the spirit the vtterance of
wisedome, to another is giuen, the vtterance of knowledge
by the same spirit: to another faith by the same spirit: to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
the gift of healing by the same spirit: to another pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do miracles: to another prophesying: to another iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to discerne spirits: to another diuerse tongues: to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the interpretation of tongues:</hi> saying in the seauenth
verse going before in the same chapter, that all and
euery one of these gifts is giuen <hi>to profit withall.</hi> But
whome, not him selfe alone, to whome any of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12715:17"/>
spirituall graces is giuen: but the Church of
God: and therefore the Apostle making a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
afterward in this same chapter betwixt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
body of man, and the Church, which is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
body of Christ, seemeth thus to reason <hi>viz.</hi>
Euen as there are many members in mans body, yet
none of them is for himselfe alone, but each of them
is carefull to procure the health, and welfare of the
whole body: so in the Church of God, euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof, ought to vse those gifts, and graces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
and such like; not to their owne gaine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
or glory: but to the good of their fellow-members,
and of the whole Church. And that in
spirituall matters, pertaining to the true knowledge,
and seruice of God, and eternall saluation in Christ
Iesus: and not in temporall and wordly things; but
so farre forth, and to that end, that thereby they
may the better be inabled to goe forward in their
spirituall course vntill they come to the end thereof,
which is the saluation of their soules. For as the gift
of working miracles, and the other gifts aforesaid
are spirituall: so the obiect, and end of the same is
spirituall: namely, the edification, and building vp
of the Church, as it is the mysticall body of Christ
Iesus, whereof himselfe is the head; as it is plaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by
the 4. cap. of the epist. of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
where the Apostle speaking of the aforesaid spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
gifts (although he rehearseth not all) saith that
they were giuen, <hi>for the gathering togither of the Saints,
for the worke of the ministery, and for the edification of the
body of Christ (vntill we all meete togither in the vnity of
faith and knowledge of the some of God) vnto a perfect
man, vnto the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12715:18"/>
that we henceforth be no more children, wauering and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
about with euery winde of doctrine, by the deceit of
men and with craftinesse, whereby they lay in waite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
but let us follow the truth in loue, and in all things
grow vp into him, which is our head, euen Christ.</hi> And
therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> continuing his speech concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the spiritual gifts begun, &amp; set downe 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
hath these words vnto them in the 14. c. of the same
Epistle. <hi>Seeing that ye couet spirituall gifts, seeke that ye
may excell to the edifying of the Church.</hi> As if he should
haue said. If so be that ye be so desirous to excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in the extraordinary gifts of the spirit: see that
ye may goe beyond others in the right vse of the
same, which is the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they which make not this vse of the aforesaid
spirituall gifts, and namely of working of miracles
(which is the chiefe thing which we stand vpon at
this time) doe most mightily abuse the same: Nay
rather (which is more probable) they haue not this
gift giuen and inspired into them by the spirit of
God, but they are the diuels seruants, and ministers
herein: by whose meanes and aide, they may be
thought to effect those wonders. For euen <hi>Iudas</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariot,
albeit otherwise a most wicked person, and
one that afterward betraied his master: Yet when he
had receiued of our Sauiour Christ the gift of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
miracles, he preached the Gospell of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as did the other Apostles. For whomsoeuer
the Lord doth furnish with such extraordinary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
gifts, he will haue them (will they nill they) to
vse them to that end which he hath appointed. And
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 1. epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 9. vers. 16.
and 17. <hi>If I preach the Gospell, I haue not wherin to boast,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12715:18"/>
for necessity is laid vpon me. Woe be to me therefore, if I
preach not the Gospell: for if I doe it willingly, I haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but if I doe it against my wil, the dispensation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto me.</hi> So when the Lord had made <hi>Ionas</hi> his
prophet to goe vnto Niniue, to tell them what he
had determined concerning their destruction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Ionas</hi> was very vnwilling to doe it, in so much
that he fled another way, onely that he might eschew
the performance of that message: Yet God drew him
backe againe, as it were through the midst of the sea,
and constrained him to fulfill his commaundement
herein. And <hi>Balaam</hi> howsoeuer before, and at other
times he may seeme to haue beene a sorcerer, and to
worke by inchantment, for his owne estimation and
profit: Neuertheles when it pleased God to make
him his minister, and had inspired him with the gift
of prophecy, to pronounce his blessing concerning
the children of Israell, albeit he laboured by all
meanes possible to the contrary, being thereunto
mooued with the desire of wealth, and preferment
promised to him by king <hi>Balack,</hi> as it is in the 22.
cap. and 23. cap. of the booke of <hi>Numbers.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
at the last he was forced to yield to gods
determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in blessing the Israelites, whom before
he endeauoured to curse. <hi>Numbers,</hi> cap. 24. Now
they which are only Satans instruments in working
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, haue no purpose at al, to glorifie god in obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his precepts, and in preaching of his word to
the edifying of his Church. For as Satan the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
both to God, and man, is the author of these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
so will he haue his ministers, to direct their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
accordingly. Neither doth the Lord inforce
them, to make that vse of their faculty of working
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12715:19"/>
miracles, which he appointeth to all those that are
wrought by his spirit: because they haue neither
receiued the gift from him, nor yet any comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
to doe any such thing. But they are led of
themselues, and of their master whome they serue,
to aime in all their practises at other ends, and work
for other worldly, and deuilish respects. As the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
of Egypt wrought miracles, onely that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might disgrace <hi>Moses</hi> the seruant of God,
and discredit his office, and authority. So <hi>Bariesu</hi> the
sorcerer in the 13. cap. of the <hi>Act.</hi> of the Apostles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured
what he could to turne away <hi>Sergius Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
from the faith of Christ which <hi>Paul</hi> preached.
And what was the end of <hi>Simons</hi> practises, which in
the 8. cap. <hi>Act.</hi> is said to haue vsed witchcraft? but
onely his owne gaine, and worldly honour, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as it appeareth by the circumstances of that
place. And although the magitians, sorcerers, &amp; such
like people, sometime do vse good and godly words,
in outward appearance, and that (as it may seeme)
to a good end: yet at other times, and that for the
most part, you shall find them to haue other badde,
worldly, and wicked intents: and to doe this but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in hypocrisie, to couer and colour their owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
dealings, and that they may worke the greater
mischiefe afterward: as it may be gathered out of the
sixteenth chapter of the <hi>Actes</hi> of the Apostles, by
the history of the damsell, which being possessed
with a spirit of diuination (which seemeth to be such
an one as they vse amongst vs to goe vnto, to know
of them their fortunes, or what is become of things
lost, stolne, or such like) whereby shee inriched her
maister with whome shee dwelt, shee (I say) this
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12715:19"/>
damsel seeing <hi>Paul,</hi> with the rest of his company pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by, cryed out saying. These men are the seruants
<hi>of the most high God, which preach vnto vs the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
But to what end (thinke ye) did shee this? to
confirme the Gospel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached? No: for
that is farre from Satan, and all his ministers. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because that shee, or Satan by her, and in her,
thought it the best course to bring to passe their
purpose: that whereas they neither could, nor durst
openly, and manifestly contrary the preaching of
the Gospel: yet by this means they might thinke se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
by crafty pollicy to weaken, and diminish the
authority of the same, by bearing men in hand (as it
were) that they were indued, &amp; led by one &amp; the selfe
same spirit, that the Apostles were, &amp; that there was
no difference in their doctrine. So that hereby the
doctrine of the gospel might be brought into suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The which when <hi>Paul</hi> perceiued, &amp; fore-seeing
the inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that might arise therby, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
al occasion of misdeeming, he commanded the
spirit to depart out of the said Damsel; making ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
(as it were) an open profession of the enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Satan &amp; him, and so of the contrariety of both
their doctrines, and of the endes of the same. So in
like manner our Sauiour Christ commaunded the
foule spirit to hold his peace, when hee said hee was
<hi>the holy one of God,</hi> Mark. 1. cap. and <hi>Luk.</hi> cap. 4. Now
to conclude: If these three notes before set downe,
be duely weighed, and considered, with a single eye,
and an vpright heart, they will not a little helpe to
discerne the true seruants of God, from the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the diuell in the working of miracles. But
alas; now a daies people are more prone and readie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12715:20"/>
to lay a stumbling blocke before their owne steppes,
and to hang a veile before their owne eyes, that they
may not see the truth in this behalfe: feigning and
framing vnto themselues reasons and arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the same, to vpholde and maintaine magicke
and sorcery in deede, and in truth (albeit they like
not altogither of these names.) To the which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I meane (God willing) to answer when I come
to the handling of the 13. verse of this chapter. In
the meane time I will proceede vnto the next, which
is the 12. verse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that]</hi> In the which (as I tolde you before) the
particular amplification of the miracles, which God
wrought by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is set downe: where wee are
to obserue two things. <hi>viz.</hi> The matter of these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
or the miracles themselues; and the meanes
by which they were wrought. But for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
thereof (although it be placed last in the
text) yet wee will speake first of the miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
whereof two especiall and principall are here
rehearsed, (to wit) the healing of the diseases of the
body; and the dispossessing of Satan the enemy of
the soule, in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the diseases departed from them, and the euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
went out of them</hi>] These two sorts of miracles our
Sauiour Christ in the 10. chap. of the Gospel after
Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> cap. 6. and <hi>Luke</hi> cap. 9.
when he sent them forth to preach the Gospel, gaue
power and authoritie vnto his twelue Apostles to
worke. And so likewise hauing made, and appointed
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 9. chapter of the <hi>Actes</hi> to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
to preach his Gospel vnto the Gentiles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
him with gifts of the holy Ghost, and as we see
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12715:20"/>
heere, adorned him with the same grace of working
miracles, which he had bestowed vpon the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
aforesaid; thereby ratifying &amp; confirming his
functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ministery, as he did of the rest. Where we
may also note, that these miracles were no vaine, and
iugling trickes, to mooue laughter amongst pleasant
heads: nor yet framed, or deuised for those of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wittes to wonder at: but they were wrought for
the profit, and commodity of mankind in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
life; albeit that be not the chiefe end, wherefore
God gaue them this power to worke the same. But
his owne glorie (as I said) and the edification of his
Church: and therefore when the Apostles at any
time sawe, that the aforesaid kinde of miracles serued
not so fitly for that purpose: they tooke a contrarie
course, as appeareth in the <hi>Actes</hi> 5. chapter, where it
is said, that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, fell downe
dead at the speech of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he tolde them
of their wicked dissimulation, and hypocrisie before
God, in selling of a certaine possession, and bringing
part of the price vnto the Apostles, to the vse of the
Church; pretending that they had brought the
whole. By which example the people were mooued
to glorifie God for his iust iudgement vpon these
hypocrites; and also were put in feare lest at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time the like offence should lay hold vpon them.
Whereas if he had not done thus, it might haue bin
a meanes to make them goe on still in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to haue encouraged others to haue done
the like. In like manner, in the <hi>Actes,</hi> 13. chapt. when
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> caused <hi>Bariesu</hi> to be stricken blinde, for
resisting the preaching of the Gospel by Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>
wee see what effect it wrought in the conuersion of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12715:21"/>
               <hi>Sergius Paulus.</hi> For truely all the spirituall giftes of
God, giuen and graunted vnto his Apostles, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
in regard of their said calling and function, is
for the edification of the Church, and not for the
destruction thereof, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.
<hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 10. vers. 8. in these words: <hi>If I should
boast of my selfe somewhat more of our authoritie or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which the Lord hath giuen vs to edifie, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
it should not be to my shame.</hi> Howsoeuer somtimes
they seeme to doe otherwise, yet it is but as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
or Chirurgion, who doe not alwaies applie
milde &amp; mollifying medicines, but somtimes biting
corrosiues, according to the nature and condition
of the disease: yea somtimes they cut off a member,
for feare of infecting the rest: as the Poet singeth.
<q>
                  <l>Omnia tentanda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sed immedicabile vulnus</l>
                  <l>Enserescindendum est, ne pars sincera trahatur.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> in the 3. chap. of the 1. Epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> verse 5.
deliuered the man that had committed incest, vnto
Satan (as he saith) <hi>to the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit might be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> But of
this I haue spoken somewhat afore: wherefore I will
go forward to the particular discussing of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
two sorts of miracles. And first of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
gift of healing, because that is first placed in
the text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the diseases departed from them]</hi> It is not heere
particularly set downe, what kinde of diseases were
healed by the Apostle: but it is certaine by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of the place, that hee cured all whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
for curing whereof he sent napkins and partlets:
and it agreeth very well to the commission which
our Sauiour Christ gaue to his Apostles in the 10.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12715:21"/>
chapter of the Gospel after Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> verse 1.
where it is said, that he <hi>gaue power vnto his disciples to
heale euery disease, and euery infirmity,</hi> that is, all maner
of diseases, which the spirit of God did mooue them
to take in hand: and this is confirmed by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
practise throughout the whole new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein we cannot finde (especially after the
ascension of our Sauiour Christ) that they euer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in healing any disease whatsoeuer, which they
tooke vpon them to cure. For this extraordinarie
power of healing, is not a naturall facultie, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
gift of God, supernaturally inspired by his holy
spirit: to whome nothing is impossible, and all, and
euery thing is of like easines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea that which to vs
seemeth, nay and is indeede most hard, and difficult,
is soonest brought to passe, when as God will haue
his glorie shewed (in a speciall manner) thereby, as
in this kinde of healing. Wherefore they which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this miraculous gift of healing, and cannot, or
doe not cure all, but some certaine of those diseases,
which they take in hand, are greatly to be suspected:
of which sort are those, which amongst vs are called
wise, and cunning folkes; whereof some can cure
but some one, or a fewe particular diseases: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
they which haue a charme for the toothach:
a prayer or a blessing for a Fistula, and such like. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe professe the curing of all diseases; and yet
neither of them both doth alwaies, and at all times
performe that which they pretend in this behalfe:
no not in those diseases, in curing wherof they would
seeme to be most expert. The reason is this: when
diseases cannot be cured by naturall meanes, then
are they past the diuells reach to heale: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12715:22"/>
his instruments must needes faile therein. To
make this more plaine, wee must note, that amongst
all the diseases set downe by the Physitions in their
treatises, some are curable, and some are vncurable,
I call those curable, which nature either of her selfe
alone, or by the helpe of medicines is able to worke
out, and expell. Of this sort we see many examples
by daily experience, which nature cureth, if shee bee
strong, and the cause of the disease light; or if shee be
weake, or the cause of the disease stubborne, by the
meanes of physicke. Now these kindes of griefes the
forcerers can, and do heale: and for as much as some
diseases are more difficult then other: yea some are
so hardly cured, as that fewe, euen of the best sort of
Physitions (except God his especiall assistance) can
heale them, whose cure notwithstanding is wrought
by these forcerers. Here therefore Satan in these his
ministers is greatly honoured, who in regard of the
subtilty of his nature, and his long experience (as I
haue said before) doth more readily finde out the
disease, with all the circumstances thereunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
as also a fit remedie therof, then most men can
doe: and yet for all that the disease by man (if hee
could hitte vpon the right methode) and that by
naturall meanes, not vncurable: for that disease is
vncurable from which the partie grieued by no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
meanes, or medicines, can be recouered: of
which kinde the Physitions doe account all deepe
wounds in the braine, heart, or liuer: also the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the sinewes asunder, which are deriued from
the braine or spirituall marrow to any limme, or
member of the body, to giue sense, and moouing
thereunto, (whether it bee by a wound, rupture, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12715:22"/>
any such like) causeth a palsie, which is vncurable.
So is deafenes, if it haue continued from the birth: as
also blindnes, according to that which the blinde
man saith to the Pharisies in the Gospel after Saint
<hi>Iohn,</hi> cap. 9. vers. 32. <hi>Since the world beganne was it not
heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne
blinde.</hi> The like may bee said of them that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
smell. An vlcer or sore that is deepe in the liuer,
is counted vncurable: and so is an absolute, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
hardnes without sense or feeling in the same:
as also in the mylt. An vlcer in the bladder likewise
is thought vncurable, especially if it be deepe. In like
manner no member which is altogither mortified,
can be recouered. Now these aforesaid and such like
diseases, are iudged simply vncurable; by reason that
at no time, nor in any person, they are seene to bee
healed. But there are diuers and sundrie other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
which are not simply, and altogither so, but
onely in regard of some circumstances: as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
feuer, which is called <hi>febris hectica,</hi> at the first
is easily cured; but after that it is confirmed, it is past
remedie: as also that kinde of leprosie, called <hi>Elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiasis.</hi>
The gout likewise, when as it hath continued
so long, that hard knobs or knots are of grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
ingendred in the ioynts, is esteemed vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
according to the saying of the Poet.
<q>Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So there are many diseases, which in young folks
are healed; but in olde persons they are vncurable:
and diuers kindes of feuers are cured in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but in some they admit no remedy, as we see by
daily experience: and it is manifest by the 20. chap.
of the second booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> that <hi>Ezechias</hi> was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12715:23"/>
irrecouerably sicke, and that (as it is thought) of a
<hi>pestilent feuer,</hi> from which oftentimes other are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
by the helpe of medicines. And albeit hee
was restored to health againe, and a medicine apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto his disease; yet was his sicknes deadly, as it
is in the first verse of the said chapter. Neither was
it cured by any naturall meanes, but supernaturally:
as appeareth in the 5. verse, where God saith, that
himselfe had healed him, before that any naturall
remedie at all was applyed vnto his sore. There are
many other vncurable diseases of both sorts, the
which it were too long and tedious here to recite:
none of all which (beeing past remedy by naturall
meanes) can be healed by any charmer, or sorcerer,
nor by the help of Satan, or any other creature what
soeuer, but onely by the supernaturall power &amp; fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God: by the which all the holy Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and Saints of God from time to time, haue
wrought all their miracles: and therefore the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of healing. As for the outward meanes &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which they haue vsed (which is the second thing
which I obserued in these miracles:) it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to the curing of any disease: but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the eyes of our vnderstanding are so obscured &amp;
blinded, that they cannot see into the inward power,
and working of the spirit of God, which is the onely
author of this gift and grace of healing: it pleaseth
God otherwhiles to put into the mindes of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
in these cases, to vse some outward sensible
meanes, by the view whereof, as by certaine signes &amp;
tokens, men might bee admonished, and further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a deeper consideration of Gods hidden
working herein. Not that any thing is effected by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12715:23"/>
these meanes, for then would the holy men of God
haue vsed alwaies one, and the selfe same outward
meanes in producing of the same effects: Or els
all the same meanes are effectuall alwaies, and in
all persons: But the first is false, for our Sauiour
Christ cured by his word onely, and <hi>Peter</hi> in the 5.
cap. <hi>Act.</hi> vers. 15. is said to heale diseases, euen with
his shadow.</p>
            <p>And heere Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is reported to haue cured
them with napkins and partletes. And as for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
we see it cannot be true by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
for who cureth now by his shadow onely as
<hi>Peter</hi> did. Indeede many of our sorcerers will seeme
like apes, to imitate Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, sending
napkins or cloathes vnto those that are sicke: but
their working is (as I haue said before) by naturall
meanes. For it seemeth very certaine in all reason:
That by the same meanes generally, that the diuell
inflicteth diseases vpon man, or beast, he doth expell
and driue away the same. Now it is euident by many
examples, that he inflicteth diseases by naturall
meanes: for <hi>Iohannes Langius</hi> in his 38. medicinall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
reciteth an history of one <hi>Vlricke Neucesser,</hi>
who being extreamely pained in one of his sides, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a time laid hold of a naile, that lay vnder the
skin there: which naile when the chirurgion had cut
out, and the paine nothing allaied, the man despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of any recouery cut his owne throat, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being opened before his buriall, (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of many) by two chirurgions, whom he there
nameth: there were found in his belly a long round
piece of wood, foure kniues of steele, partly sharpe,
and partly nickt like a saw, and two sharpe instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12715:24"/>
of iron, that were more then a spanne long,
and haire rowled together in forme like a ball. So
<hi>Anthonius Beneuenius, de admirandis morborum causis:</hi>
telleth of a certaine woman of Florence, who being
pained with an exceeding great torment in her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
sodainely cast vp by vomit crooked nayles,
needles of brasse, with waxe and lumpes of haire; and
lastly a piece of flesh so bigge, that it was thought
impossible to be auoided. In like manner <hi>Benedictus
Veronensis</hi> in his 7 booke, and 25. chapter saith, that
he saw two women dwelling in the same towne, and
very familiar friends: which being both extreamely
vexed, and tormented with vomiting: one of them
(with much adoe) cast vp a great needle, or pinne
wherewith women vse to trimme their haire, being
crooked after the manner of a hooke, and wrapped
together with the haire of a womans head, wherein
were infolded the pairings of nayles: the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she notwithstanding lay as it were strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and so dyed the next night. The other cast vp
the haire of a womans head, with pieces of glasse,
and three peices of a doggs taile dried with the haire
vpon it, which if they had beene set togither againe,
would haue made the length or quantitie of the
whole taile. There are many other such like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of diseases laid vpon mortall men, which might
be brought to this purpose: None of all which could
possibly be done, but by inchantment: and yet we see
that they were done or inflicted, but onely by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
meanes. Neither can any man prooue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
(as I thinke) in any other. The which if it be so,
then may we conclude that all these, and such like,
which are done by inchantment, are done by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12715:24"/>
meanes. But some man may obiect and say:
That as one swallow maketh not summer, so a few
particular examples cannot inferre a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
To this I answer: That many particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
recited, with the rest all are in generall impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that there can no instance be brought to the
contrary is a sufficient argument. Besides this the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name giuen by men of former age in latine, to
magitians, charmers, sorcerers, inchanters, necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers,
and such like: calling them <hi>venehicos,</hi> doth
decipher the manner of their working: as though
they made and infused such matter, or medicines, as
altereth the nature and temper of those things into
which they are infused, and wherewith they are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and the greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, betokeneth the
same thing. Neither do I see wherefore Satan should
vse naturall meanes, in the parties before specified,
and such like: rather then supernaturall, if it had not
past his reach: seeing that he doth for the most part
endeauour to couer his dealing (as much as he can)
that it may not be espied. As he did when he laid his
hand vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> as it apeareth in the first chapter of
his booke. And therefore it is to be thought, that he
made vse (in the aforesaid persons) of those naturall
meanes which came first into his minde, and were
nearest at hand for that present time. And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the second kind of miracle, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> is
heere said to worke by napkins, and partlets sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the parties grieued: To wit the casting out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
the same is to be iudged and said, which hath
beene spoken of the miracle of healing: both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the outward, and also of the inward meanes
of the same. For as for the inward, which is the onely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12715:25"/>
meanes: It is the power and spirit of God alone: and
as for the outward manner, it maketh (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
nothing to the working of the miracle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are all in a mighty errour, which thinke
that Satan can be cast out, by certaine set and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
words, or characters, as they vse in magicke:
For we must not thinke that the diuell is either so
simple, or so weake (if God permit him to vse his
strength) as to be (as it were) blowne out with the
winde, or sound of words: or so timorous, that he
may be fraied away with the sight of figures, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
when as he durst tempt our first parents in
their state of innocency. <hi>Gen.</hi> cap. 3. Nay he was not
afraide to set vpon our Sauiour Christ, as it is in the
4. cap. of Saint <hi>Luk.</hi> although he was God, albeit in
the forme of man, <hi>Phil.</hi> cap. 2. vers. 6. And S. <hi>Peter</hi>
likeneth him to a roaring lyon in his first epist. and
cap. 5. And our Sauiour Christ in the 12. cap. of S.
<hi>Mathewes</hi> Gospell, seemeth to compare him to a
strong man, which will not yield, till a stronger then
he compelleth him. Indeede sometime he will faine
as though he were forcibly dispossessed by the vaine
trickes of magitians, and coniurers: but it is onely to
this end, that he may thereby the more strengthen
and enlarge his owne kingdome, by bringing into, &amp;
detaining men in this wicked errour, to thinke that
such things are brought to passe by magicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits:
when as the diuell goeth out of himselfe: euen
as when we see two men pulling at a thing, one of
them contrary to the other: and the stronger will
seeme to be forced to yield, and so letteth goe his
hold, but it is when he seeth his most aduantage to
giue his aduersary the greater fall. Euen so Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12715:25"/>
he may sometime seeme to be forced, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and in truth it is but policy, thereby to worke
the more harme. For he is not constrained to go out
by any such vaine follies, or by any other howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vsed, but onely by the meere power and finger of
God, as it will appeare by that which followeth in
the text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then certaine of the vagabond Iewes [exorcistae.]</hi>
Heere in this verse we see the effect of those mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which <hi>Paul</hi> is said to worke in this place in the
wicked sorcerers: who (when the Apostle had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Gospell of our Sauiour Christ: and by his
power, and in his name had done these said mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
for the confirmation of the same) went about
most wickedly to abuse his sacred name, to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of their magicke, and sorcery. For although
the name which they are called by, may seeme to
haue no badde, but an indifferent signification, being
vsed in the primitiue Church for those, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
receiued the gift of working miracles from
God, did vse his name in casting out of diuels, and
the very etymologie of the word in the originall
tongue doth shew the same: Yet it is most euident by
the circumstance of this place, that these men were
nothing but meere wicked magitians, and namely, of
that sort which we cal coniurers: who although there
be no difference in respect of the substance of their
wicked seruing of Satan in this behalfe: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the fashion, and manner of their seruice,
seemeth somewhat to differ. For those which we call
witches, or sorcerers, seeme to be in a more vile, and
slauish condition, being alwaies at the diuels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement:
but these which we terme coniurers,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12715:26"/>
will make as though they commaunded the diuell,
howbeit they profit nothing thereby, sauing that
they serue his turne herein, and sometime their own:
so farre forth as their practise may stand with the
furtherance of Satans purpose in the same, which is
the enlargement of his owne kingdome. Otherwise
they may commaund (as they say) and goe without:
he will doe what himselfe listeth, and not what they
would haue him to doe. The which peraduenture,
when these Exorcistes saw, hauing eftsoones vsed
their accustomed manner, and ceremonies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration,
and neuertheles many times missing of
their purposes: And likewise seeing, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> how he neuer fayled in
the working of his miracles by the name of the
Lord Iesus: They thought that they would make
triall, what they could bring to passe thereby: and so
as they traueliled about the country, as fortune-rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
charmers, inchanters, and such like do with vs,
they tooke in hand to cast out diuels, out of those
which were possessed with the same, by naming ouer
them which had the said euill spirits the name of the
<hi>[Lord Iesus]</hi> Marke I pray you the incredible bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of these wicked coniurers: who not considering,
neither the occasion, end, nor authority whereby S.
<hi>Paul</hi> did worke: Nor their owne daunger, which
might ensue vnto them thereby: rashly take vpon
them to doe such miracles by the name of our Lord
Iesus, without any further direction. But such is all
kinde of magicke and sorcery being founded nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon reason, nor yet vpon common sense: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they will seeme to make an art of it. For whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shal examine the truth of the grounds, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12715:26"/>
thereof in their bookes, shall finde no pith, nor
any sound matter worth the noting: but onely foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and vaine trickes, as are circles, characters, and
such like: or words notvnderstood: or vainely, or
wickedly applied: as in abusing the name of God, or
his word, and such like: when they vse them not to
that end, for the which they were appointed: as doe
heere the aforesaid forcerers, the exorcists: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the most part they are frustrate of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
except it be sometime (by God his permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that the diuell of his owne minde (for causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed) doth worke the effect for them. The
which when the Emperour, <hi>Nero</hi> saw (as it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the thirtieth booke, and first chapter of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
naturall history) who was one that fauoured this
wicked craft, no man more, hauing sufficient store of
wealth and power: and magitians sent for from all
parts of the world to conferre with: and yet for all
that, in the end, left it as vaine and friuolous. And
common experience doth teach vs euen the very
same. For whosoeuer shall looke into the dealings of
those persons, which are accounted the onely cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
men in the world amongst vs, he shall see that
they vse no other outward meanes, but a sort of
charmes: the most of them so ridiculous and foolish,
that a wise man must needes laugh at them, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that hath but a sparke of religion, to loath &amp;
detest them: Which are either newly deuised by the
diuell and his ministers: or els receiued afore by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from one to another. And if so be they vse
good words and sensible, which is very seldome in al
points: yet are they vttered with an euill intent, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by them alone to worke such wonders: as the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12715:27"/>
exorcists doe heere. Seeing that the words of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
can doe nothing, how glorious soeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
without further authority and power from
God. And yet we see that this vaine &amp; wicked craft,
and the practises of the same, haue many fauourers
in the world, especially of those that are profane,
and want knowledge in religion. The which also
haue deuised many reasons to vphold the said craft:
whereof some of the chiefest I will heere recite.</p>
            <p>And first they say, that these cunning men doe
vse no euill meanes, and especially the diuell is not
the author of this their working. For (fay they.) The
diuell neither can, nor will doe any good: but these
cunning folkes doe good, and therefore they doe it
not by the diuell, or by any euill meanes. To answer
vnto this argument, we must more deepely weigh
and consider of the matter, then it seemeth, that
those which framed this argument did. For I thinke
they vnderstood not what they meant themselues
by this word <hi>(good.)</hi> If they vnderstand thereby that
which is absolutely, altogether, alwaies, and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<hi>(good)</hi> then we deny their assumption: for in
this manner there is none good but God alone: as
our Sauiour Christ saith in the 19. cap. of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
after Saint <hi>Matth.</hi> vers. 17. As for all other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures
they are good, so farre forth as it pleaseth
God the chiefest goodnesse to esteeme, and accept
of them. For whereas it is said in the first chapter of
<hi>Gen.</hi> vers. 31. <hi>And God saw all that he had made, and loe
it was very good.</hi> We must vnderstand by <hi>(goodnesse)</hi>
the perfit estate of all things both generally, and
particularly, whereby they were conformable to the
will and minde of God the creator, who approoued
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12715:27"/>
them when they were made. For no creature is
good of it selfe first, and for that cause approoued:
but because God approoueth it, therefore it is good.
Now the Lord seemeth to haue approoued these
his creatures, in three especiall respects. First in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the beautie, comelines, and glorie of all,
and euery creature in their kinde. Secondly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the excellent vertue which God gaue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing. For as hee hath made nothing in
vaine, but euery thing to some especiall ende: so
hath hee furnished the same with sufficient power
and vertue, for the accomplishment of the same end.
Thirdly, in respect of the exceeding benefit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
which came by them vnto man. As for the two
first, no man will say that in those respects these cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
folke can, or doe any good by reason that they
concerne the creatures themselues alone, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reference vnto man: and we know that no man
can make, no not one haire of his head white, or
blacke, as it is in the 5 chapter of Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi>
Gospel vers. 36. Therefore it must needes be in the
third respect, which is in regard of the profitte
that redoundeth thereby vnto men: so that their
meaning is, that whatsoeuer doth exhibite, doe, or
procure any benefit, or profit vnto any man, is by
their reason said to doe him good. But let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this: that albeit at the first the Lord created
euery thing very good, yet since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>
this goodnes of the creature is partly corrupted, and
partly diminished: not only in the two first respects,
but also, &amp; that especially in the last. For wheras the
creatures were in some measure made for mans vse,
so when man had transgressed the commandement
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12715:28"/>
of God, both man himselfe fell from that integrity
of nature, wherein he was first created; beeing now
corrupted and depraued, as well in all the powers &amp;
faculties of the body, as of the minde: as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the punishment laid vpon the man, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
vpon the woman in the 3. chapter of <hi>Genesis:</hi> in
so much as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 7. chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi>
vers. 18. in the name or person of al men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that in him, that is, in his flesh (whereby is
meant the whole man, as he is now by nature, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
both of body and soule) is no good. Yea that
we cannot thinke a good thought of our selues, as it
is in the 2. Epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 3. vers. 5. and also the Lord
cursed the earth for mans sake: as it is in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
3. chapter of <hi>Genesis.</hi> The whole creature beeing
now subiect vnto vanity, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh to
the <hi>Romanes</hi> cap. 8. So that the creatures are not now
so profitable vnto him, as hee is a naturall man, as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 1. chapter to <hi>Titus,</hi> vers. 15.
That <hi>to those that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing, nothing
is pure; but their mindes and consciences are defiled.</hi>
Whereby it appeareth, that before God hath puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the heart by saith, nothing can doe him good,
nothing is pure vnto him. But euen as an impure
vessell defileth whatsoeuer is put into it: so whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
happeneth vnto the wicked, it is for ther fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
damnation: and what doth it profit a man if he
gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule, as our
Sauiour Christ saith in the 16. chapter of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi>
Gospel. And for as much as no man is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regenerate in this life, but hath alwaies the flesh
striuing and lusting against the spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> c. 5. v. 17.
therefore it pleased God (to the end that they might
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12715:28"/>
see the haynousnes of sinne, and the grieuousnes of
the fall of our first parents) to suffer those thinges
which were in their first creation ordained for their
good, to be euen vnto his deere children, an occasion
of their fall, albeit not eternally. So <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing
a man after God his owne heart, abused that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
strong, and healthfull state and temper of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is set downe in the 16. chapter of the first
booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to the horrible committing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie
with the wife of <hi>Vrias:</hi> as it is the 11. cap.
of the second booke of <hi>Samuel:</hi> the which no doubt
he would neuer haue done, if he had beene a weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and crased with sickenes. The which thing was
very well vnderstood by <hi>Alurede</hi> king of the most
part of this Realme of England, who beeing a faire,
comely, and a goodly personage, was therewithall
giuen to the vice of the flesh: wherefore hee desired
God to chastise him with some continuall sickenes,
whereby he might serue God the better, and yet not
be made vnapt to worldly busines: wherefore by the
ordinance of God he was taken with the disease cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Ficus,</hi> and was thereof sicke a long time. And the
good king <hi>Ezechias,</hi> so long as the Lord exercised
him vnder the crosse of troubles and sicknes, walked
before him in all dutifull humilitie: but after that he
was deliuered from them, and restored to health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he beganne (as it were) to be lifted vp in the
pride of heart, &amp; in the vanitie of his minde, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Embassadours of the king of Babylon all his
treasure, and prouision: as it is in the second booke
of the <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 20. and the 32. chap. of the second
booke of the <hi>Chronicles.</hi> And what was it that made
<hi>Dauid</hi> so grieuously to offend God, in numbering of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12715:29"/>
the children of Israell? as it is in the second booke of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> cap 24. but onely prosperity, health, &amp; ease.
The which when he had more deepely considered;
and had seene that the Lord had alwaies called him
home againe into the right way by aduersity and
troubles: he saith in the 119. psalme, vers. 71. that
<hi>It was good for him that he was in trouble.</hi> And againe,
in the 67. verse of the same psalme he saith, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was troubled, he went wrong, but then did he keepe
Gods words, or commaundements.</hi> So that oftentimes,
nay for the most part affliction, whether it be in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or minde, or goods, is more expedient and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the children of God, then worldly pleasure,
health, or prosperity. For God is said to chasten his
deerest children, in the 12. chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
vers. 6, 7, &amp; 8. in these words: <hi>Whome the Lord loueth,
he chasteneth, and he scourgeth euery sonne that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
If ye endure chastening, God offereth himselfe vnto
you, as vnto sonnes: for what sonne is it that the father cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth
not? If therefore ye be without correction, whereof
all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and no sonnes.</hi> And
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 9. chapter of the 1. Epist. <hi>Cor.</hi>
vers. 27. that <hi>he beate downe his body, and brought it into
subiection: lest by any meanes, after he had preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other, himselfe should be reprooued.</hi> The which if it
be so, then no maruaile though the ministers of the
diuell, the sorcerers, are willing to procure somtimes
temporall benefits of health, and riches vnto men,
seeing (as I haue said before) that oftentimes they
are more hurtfull, then profitable vnto them. And
it is the soule altogither that Satan hunteth for: the
which that he may obtaine, he careth not so much if
they enioy wordly prosperity, &amp; felicity for a time.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12715:29"/>
For as for worldly, and temporal commodities, they
are as well common to the wicked, as to the godly:
nay the vngodly doe most flourish in this life, as wee
see it daily by experience before our eyes. And it is
plainely prooued by diuers places of the scripture:
as in the 73. psalme, their prosperity is described,
whereat the Psalmist fretted himselfe, as hee saith,
when hee did see the prosperity of the wicked: for
<hi>there are no bandes in their death, but they are lustie and
strong, they are not in trouble like other men:</hi> And againe,
<hi>their eyes stand out with fatnes, they haue more then heart
can wish.</hi> Here we see that they haue not riches alone,
but also they are lusty and strong without diseases of
the body: neither are they grieued in minde, as other
men; but all things whatsoeuer, yea more then
heart can wish, they haue and enioy, as well for their
pleasure, as for their profit: as <hi>Iob</hi> saith in the 21. cap.
<hi>Wherefore doe the wicked liue and waxe olde, and growe
in wealth? their seede is established in their sight with
them, and their generation before their eyes. Their houses
are peaceable without feare, and the rodde of God is not
vpon them. Their bullocke gendreth and faileth not, their
cowe calueth, and casteth not her calfe. They send forth
their children like sheepe, and their sonnes daunce. They
take the tabret and harpe, and reioyce in the sound of the
organes. They spend their daies in wealth, and sodainely
they goe downe to the graue.</hi> As it were without any
long, or languishing sicknes. And this happeneth not
onely to themselues, but euen vnto their children,
to whome they leaue plenty also of goods: as it is in
the 17. psalme, where the Prophet saith, that God
<hi>filled their bellies with his hidde treasure, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
had enough, and left the rest of their substance for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12715:30"/>
their children.</hi> The which prosperity of the wicked,
when he had set downe, hee concludeth the said 17.
psalme with these words saying: <hi>But I will beholde thy
face in righteousnes; and when I awake, I shall be satisfied
with thine image.</hi> As though he should haue said: Let
the wicked triumph as much as they will, for they
haue their portion in this life: but as for me, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
I be troubled and afflicted, I will (as neere as I
can with Gods assistance) so liue in godlines, and
holines of life, now in this world, as I may attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
eternall ioy and felicity in the world to come. For
truly all earthly things are but meere vanities, as the
spirit of God saith by <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the booke of the
preacher: but <hi>godlines is profitable to all things, as that
which hath the promise of this life, and of the life to come,</hi>
1. Tim. cap. 4. vers. 8. Wherefore we neede not to
doubt, but that this will be good and profitable vnto
all them which haue it rightly, and soundly wrought
in their heart by the spirit of God, whereby they are
renewed and regenerated vnto newnes of life, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the olde man with the deedes thereof, and
putting on the new man, which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
after the image of him that made him. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
beeing an aduersarie both to God, and to all the
children of men, hath neuer any intent, or meaning,
(except it be in hypocrisie) that either himselfe, or
any of his instruments, the sorcerers should mooue,
perswade, or minister any occasion vnto godlines
of life, whereby the soules of men might be saued in
the day of the Lord: but only that they should feede
&amp; ford them on with temporary benefits, the which
by God his permission both the diuell, and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
the sorcerers by his helpe, both can, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12715:30"/>
will doe. As the Damsell in the 16. chap. <hi>Act.</hi>
vers. 16. is said to bring her master great gaines by
meanes of the diuellish spirit of diuination, wherwith
shee was possessed. And <hi>Simon</hi> the sorcerer, in the 8.
cap. <hi>Act.</hi> is reported to haue purchased such honour
by his witcherwft, and magicke, that the people of
Samaria extolled him aboue the common conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men calling him, and saying, that hee was the
great power of God. But it will be obiected and said:
that riches and honours, and such like, are thinges
without a man, and therefore may the rather bee
procured by Satan. But health is not so easily to bee
wrought; by reason it is within, euen in the bodie of
man. Besides that, it is so neere, and deere vnto man,
that the diuell will not doe it for him, if he could. So
that he neither can, nor will procure health vnto
mankind by this reason, howsoeuer he dealeth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temporall benefits with him. To answer to this
obiection, we must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that (albeit he may seeme
to enuie euen worldly commodities, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon men) yet Satans chiefest drift &amp; maine
point that he aimeth at, is the inlargement of his
owne kingdome, by the eternall destruction of man
in the life to come. The which that he may bring to
passe, he leaueth (as they say) no stone vnturned: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as the greate politicians of the world, who to win
a horse, will lose the saddle. So the diuell is content
to bestow sometimes temporary benefits vpon men
in this world, that their soules may bee damned in
the world to come: yea and such is his crafty polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that he feedeth them with those commodities,
wherein they take most delight, and whereof they
are most desirous; that so hee may the easier drawe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12715:31"/>
them vnto his lure, whether it be riches, honours
pleasure, health, or whatsoeuer else. But for as much
as this will not serue his purpose in some men, as it
appeareth by <hi>Iob:</hi> therefore he vseth (if he may) in
them a contrary meanes, namely, vexations and
troubles, as he did in <hi>Iob:</hi> seeking thereby to make
them desperate. For riches, and honours, procuring
vnto them pouerty: and for health, extremity of
paine, both in bodie, and minde. Neither can I see
any reason (if he be willing) wherefore Satan should
not be able, as well to cure diseases in man, as he is to
inflict them vpon man; seeing that the one requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
as inward a working in the body, as the other:
&amp; it is manifest by diuers places of the scripture, that
hee doth insinuate himselfe into the very thoughts
of men, and namely, in the 18 chapter of the second
booke of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> vers. 22. where it is said, that
he will <hi>be a lying spirit in the mouth of all Achabs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi>
and therefore much more into their bodies;
the which also otherwhiles he doth possesse; as it is
plaine by sundry places of the new testament. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
seeing that God doth bestow all kinde of
temporarie, and worldly blessings, whether they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the bodie, or to the minde: as are all artes,
sciences, and worldly wisedome and learning, as well
vpon the wicked, as vpon the godly; as we see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
and it is said by our Sauiour Christ Iesus,
in the 5. chapter of the Gospel after Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi>
vers. 45. that <hi>God maketh his sonne to shine, as well vpon
the badde, as vpon the good: and his raine to fall as well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wicked, as vpon the godly.</hi> By these two blessings
(to wit) the <hi>sunne</hi> &amp; <hi>raine</hi> meaning al other earthly
benefits whatsoeuer, by the figure <hi>synechdoche.</hi> And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12715:31"/>
if he deale thus bountifully with wicked men, whose
end is destruction with the diuel and his angels: why
may he not bestow such like giftes euen vpon the
diuell? albeit he abuse the same. We know, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our Sauiour Christ calleth (as it were) <hi>Iudas</hi>
Iscariote for his wickednes, and trechery a diuell, in
the 6. chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel, vers. 70. yet in
the 10. chapter after Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> hee had giuen
him the grace of healing diseases, as well as the other
Apostles. But to come more neerely to the point
which wee haue in handling, wee must remember,
that the scripture in diuers and sundry places, as in
<hi>Leuit.</hi> 177. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 17. &amp; <hi>Ps.</hi> 106. 37. &amp; 1. <hi>Cor. 10.
20.</hi> saith, that they which doi worship, and dosacrifice
vnto Idols, doe it vnto duels. The which although
it be expounded to be spoken, in regard that therein
they serued the diuell, and not God: yet it is certaine
by diuers auncient histories, that the diuell himselfe
did worke by, and in some of those Idols: as <hi>Apollo
Dodonaeus</hi>
did speake out of an oake: and <hi>Hermes
Trismegistus,</hi> as he is alleadged by <hi>Apuleius</hi> &amp; others,
hath these words: <hi>Homo statuas ad similitudinem suam
facit: in quas arte magica spiritus inuitat, aut ipsi ad eas
vltro accedunt: &amp; hi humano generi futura praedicunt,</hi>
which may be thus englished: Man maketh Idols or
Images like vnto himself: into the which he inuiteth
or procureth spirits, or else they come into them of
themselues: and these do foretel vnto men things to
come. And a little after he saith, <hi>AEsculapius Asclepii
avus, et Mercurius avus meus, qui apud Hermopolen AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypti
adorabantur, homines erant, quorum corpora seu ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davera
sepulta sunt, illius quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Libya, at huius in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipto,
in vrbe quae inde Hermopolis vocatur: sed sub his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12715:32"/>
coluntur daemones, quos ego in eorum statuas pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexi.</hi>
That is <hi>Aesculapius</hi> grandfather to <hi>Asclepius,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Mercurius</hi> my grandfather, which were worshipped
as gods at <hi>Hermopolis</hi> a city in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were men,
whose bodies or dead corpes are buried, the one of
them in <hi>Libya</hi> and the other in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the city
which thereof is called <hi>Hermopolis,</hi> but vnder these
or their names, spirits or diuels are worshipped, the
which I haue prouoked or brought into their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And truely if the diuell did not worke in, and by
them, they could say or doe no more then a stocke
or a stone, as the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal,</hi> 115. that
they haue mouths &amp; speake not, eies &amp; see not, eares
and heare not, noses, and smell not, hands and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not, feete and walke not. The which being so, it
followeth of necessity, that whosoeuer is cured of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disease by any Idol, or Image, is cured by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
Now it is more then probable, that some haue
beene cured by Idoles. For we read in the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the second booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> that <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
king of Israel being sicke, sent vnto <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> which
was an Idol (which they of Ekron worshipped for
God) concerning the recouery of his health. And
albeit it is there set downe, onely that he sent to
know whether he should recouer of his health or
not: Yet it is very likely, that wicked men vsed to go
to those Idols, as wel to be cured of their diseases, as
to know whether they were curable or not. For as in
all other things (as neare as he can) the diuell as an
ape will imitate God, to set thereby a better colour
vpon his wicked dealings: Euen so in this matter of
healing, it is most certaine, that Satan by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
&amp; ministers, did the same which God did by his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12715:32"/>
prophets: But it is manifest, that the prophets of
God did as well cure diseases, as foretell the euent
thereof: For the damsell which waited vpon the
wife of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> told her mistris, that if
her master <hi>Naaman</hi> were with the prophet <hi>Elisha</hi>
in Samaria, he would soone deliuer him of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie:
The which no doubt shee would neuer haue
done, if she had not knowne, or heard that he had
done the like before. Nay if it had not been well
knowne, that they which went to the Idol <hi>Baalze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi>
had sometimes obtained their purpose in those
cases, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> being a man of that power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
would not haue sent vnto him.</p>
            <p>But to leaue this, &amp; come to their next argument,
which is. That oftentimes they vse good and godly
words and characters: and therefore their doings are
not euill, nor wrought by Satan. But herein they doe
mightily bewray their ignorance in the crafty poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the diuell: who euer (as neare as it is possible
for him) will couer his wicked entents and dealings
with the cloake of holinesse and honesty, turning
himselfe, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
cap. 11. vers. 14. <hi>into an angell of light.</hi> For euen as
the holy angels in heauen doe indeede performe all
duties, and vse al good and godly meanes according
to God his commandements, to the honour of God,
and the good of his elect: euen so Satan and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
the sorcerers, will seeme to doe the same: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they haue alwaies another, yea a contrary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and meaning. So the diuell in the beginning
would not seeme to doe it himselfe, but when there
was no humane creature vpon the earth to suborne
in that behalfe, he entred into the serpent, vsing him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12715:33"/>
to perswade the woman to disobey the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God, in eating of the forbidden fruit: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the wiliest beast of all that God had
made: and therfore <hi>Eue</hi> might the rather be drawne
thereby, to follow his counsell: which he would
seeme to giue vnto her for her good, as one that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
her well, and sought her commodity: when as
he went about her eternall destruction, and of all her
posterity. And in the 22. cap. of the first booke of
the <hi>King.</hi> he did not take a direct course, to shew
himselfe according vnto his intention in that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but he vsed the tongue of the prophets to tell
lies: that thereby <hi>Achab</hi> might be perswaded to goe
and fall in battell. And albeit they were all of them
false prophets, yet they were not so reputed or estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the king, who asked counsell at their hands.
And it is manifest in that place, that they pretended
the authority and commaundement of God by the
suggestion of the diuell, as it is in the aforesaid chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
v. 11. where it is said that <hi>Zidkiiah</hi> made hornes
of iron saying, thus saith the Lord <hi>with these shalt
thou push the Aramites, vntill thou haue consumed them.</hi>
We see also in the 4. cap. of Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Gospel
and likewise in Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> That Satan himselfe in
his owne person vsed the words of the scripture to
couer his mischieuous intent, when he tempted our
Sauiour Christ. The which if it be so, then why may
not his seruants and instruments the sorcerers vse
the like meanes to colour their wicked practises?
Nay whosoeuer shall looke into their bookes and
writings (albeit for the most part they be badly, and
without any sense or reason applied) yet he shall find
often times very good words and sentences, partly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12715:33"/>
out of the scripture, and partly of their owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing)
the which a man would not thinke to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found fault withal, if their intent were good,
and their authority from God lawfull and allowed.
As it is manifest by histories. That the Aegyptian
sorcerers vsed in their sorceries these words. To wit:
<hi>The god of Israell: The god of the Hebrewes: The god
which drowned the Aegyptians, and their king in the red
sea.</hi> And is it not most manifest by the plaine words
of this text, which I haue in hand, that the <hi>Exorcistes</hi>
vsed the same words in effect which Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the other holy Apostles of our Sauiour Christ did?
making (as it were) a charme of the scripture of
God? For what is a <hi>Charme</hi> els? but a certaine, or set
forme of words, either by themselues alone, or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with characters, without any commission, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
authority from God, vsed to the intent,
that by them some extraordinary worke, or wonder
might be wrought: So that how glorious soeuer, or
how goldy soeuer the words may seeme to be in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew, yet if they be vsed without gods especiall
direction, or commaundement to the aforesaid end,
they are but meere charmes. Albeit my selfe haue
heard some being patrones of these kinds of wicked
practises, who haue said: That then it is a charme
onely, when as such words are vsed, which are not
vnderstood of him which vseth them. The which is
confuted in the 58. <hi>Psal.</hi> in these words: <hi>They are as
venemous as the poyson of a serpent: euen like the deafe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that stoppeth hir eares: which refuseth to heare the
voice of the charmer, charme he neuer sowisely.</hi> In which
words, the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> describeth the obstinate
wickednesse of his aduersaries, in the court of king
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12715:34"/>
               <hi>Saul,</hi> who hauing beene often reprooued, and told
their duty out of the word of truth; did notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
wilfully persist in their sinnes: giuing no eare to
that wholesome counsell, whereby they might be
bettered: much like vnto the adder which will not
heare when she should with inchantment be bound,
and restrained from hurting with her poison: but
stoppeth her eares, least shee should hear the voice
of the charmer charming. Now if a charme cannot
be vnderstood, what it signifieth, what needeth the
adder to stoppe her eares at it? or what wisedome or
cunning can be discerned therein? if so be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereof is not to be knowne what is said or
sung? or finally how serueth this comparison to the
purpose of the Psalmist, if no difference may be
perceiued betwixt one charme, and another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is the better, or morewise or cunning.
Nay the very etymologie of the word doth insinuate
vnto vs, that it may be vnderstood. For it is certaine,
that the word <hi>(charme)</hi> is deriued of the Latine word
<hi>(carmen)</hi> the letter <hi>(h)</hi> being put in, as we see in the
word <hi>(Inchantment)</hi> when as in the Latine word <hi>(in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantamentum)</hi>
whereof it is deriued, the said letter is
not found: but in the french tongue it is put in.
Wherefore both these words. <hi>viz. (charme)</hi> and <hi>(in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment)</hi>
seeme to come from the Latines vnto
the French men first, and from them to vs by the
comming in of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by auncient recordes that <hi>(charmes)</hi> and <hi>inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)</hi>
in old time were called <hi>(Spells,)</hi> which seemeth
to haue the same signification that <hi>(carmen)</hi> hath in
Latine, as it may be gathered out of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> where
he saith. <hi>Listen to my spell,</hi> which is as much to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12715:34"/>
say, as Listen to my words, or worke in vers. For a
<hi>(spell)</hi> as also <hi>(carmen)</hi> among the Latines, is when a
set forme, order or number of words in matters are
(as it were) so religiously to be kept, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to alter, or chaunge the same. Now because that
in poeticall workes in verse, this is chiefly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
therefore they are most commonly called
by the aforesaid names. Howbeit, all charmes and
inchantments, by reason that they are also tyed to a
certaine forme, order or number of words, are also
termed <hi>(Spelles)</hi> as <hi>(night-spells)</hi> and <hi>(wood-spells)</hi> and
such like. As also in Latine <hi>(Carmina)</hi> as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by diuerse Latine authours: and namely, in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
in his eight eglogue by these words. <hi>Ducite ab vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
domum mea carmina ducite Daphnim,</hi> &amp;c. And for
as much as the same were sometimes pronounced
in a singing manner, therefore they were also called
otherwhiles <hi>(Incantamenta)</hi> that is (as we translate it)
Inchantments of the Latine word <hi>(canto)</hi> which doth
betoken (to sing) and also (to charme or inchaunt)
as it is in the aforesaid eglogue: where it is said <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidus
in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis.</hi> So that heere
we see, that one &amp; the selfe same thing in effect is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by diuerse words, although in diuerse respects.
Yea and the originall word in the aforesaid 58. <hi>Psal.</hi>
which is there translated a charmer, and in some
translations an inchaunter, doth naturally betoken
one that whispereth, muttereth, or mumbleth, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
softly as it were betwixt the teeth. And because
the charmers, and inchaunters do so, as it is manifest
by experience, and likewise by the 8. cap. of <hi>Esa.</hi> vers.
19. in these words. <hi>And when they shall say vnto you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at them that haue a spirit of diuination, and at the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12715:35"/>
south-sayers which whisper and murmur, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Esa.</hi>
the 29. cap. vers. 4. <hi>Thy voice shall be also out of the
ground, like him that hath a spirit of diuination,
and thy talking shall whisper out of the dust.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that we may not striue or contend about words
alone, let vs returne to the very point, and pith of
the matter, which we haue in handling: which is,
what is lawful in this case, and what is vnlawfull. The
which may easily and briefly bee determined, if wee
call to mind, what I haue said before, concerning the
difference betwixt the seruants of God, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of the diuell in this behalfe. For seeing that
there be three especiall things required in him that
is a lawfull worker of miracles. First that he haue an
especiall calling from God: secondly, that the means
and manner which he vseth be lawfull, good, &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and thirdly, that he doth it to the glory of God,
and the edification of his Church: whosoeuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
any one of these three things in his working,
what words or characters, or what meanes soeuer he
vseth, hee is but a charmer, or inchanter: and the
meanes, or manner which hee vseth, are but meere
charmes, and inchantments; and therefore vtterly
vnlawfull, and abominable before God. Albeit some
doe holde that the signe of the crosse is very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in these cases, as it is much vsed in charmes, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments.
And to approoue their assertion, they
alleadge the figure which appeared vnto <hi>Constantine</hi>
the great, wherein it was said, that hee should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
as it is in Latine: <hi>in hoc signo vinces.</hi> But this may
be easily answered: That it was not the signe of the
crosse, but of Christs name: for the said figure was
made of two greeke letters conioyned togither.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12715:35"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as it is manifest in <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine.</hi>
l. 1. cap. 22. 25. So that it is not <hi>signum crucis,</hi>
that did this, but <hi>fides crucifixi,</hi> or rather Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And although it pleased God at that time to
shew this signe of the crosse to that Emperour to
confirme his faith: yet it followeth not, that that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
was to be vsed afterward to worke wonders by:
or that there was any such vertue therein. Nay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles
it commeth to passe, that the same which
God hath commaunded to be vsed for a time, vpon
especiall occasion knowne to himselfe alone; and
hath giuen vertue and power to it, to worke some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
good vnto his children: doth after lose the
same vertue, &amp; is an occasion of falling to them that
vse it: as the brasen serpent, which the Lord appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be set vp vpon a pole, and whosoeuer then
beeing bitten of the fiery serpents, which are there
spoken of, did looke vpon it, recouered health, as it
is in the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the 21. chapter, vers. 8.
besides that it was a type of our Sauiour Christs pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
as it is in the 3. chapter of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel,
vers. 14. Yet we cannot reade, that euer afterward it
wrought the like effect. Yea <hi>Hezekiah</hi> seemeth to be
commended in the second booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> cap.
18. ver. 4. for breaking the same in pieces. But let this
suffice concerning their second reason.</p>
            <p>The third argument which they vse to defend
these sorcerers, which they call cunning folkes, is:
That they worke these things by the saith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
and therefore by no euill, or diuellish meanes.
To this I answer: That if their <hi>antecedent</hi> were true, I
could easily graunt their <hi>consequent.</hi> But that by no
possible meanes can be prooued by them. For albeit
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12715:36"/>
our Sauiour Christ in the 17. chapter of the Gospel
after S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> vers. 20. saith vnto his disciples.
<hi>Verily I say vnto you, if ye had faith, as much as is a graine
of mustard-seede, ye shall say to this mountaine, remooue
thy selfe hence to yonder place: and it shall remooue, and
nothing shall be vnpossible vnto you.</hi> Yet it followeth not,
that these cunning folke (as they are termed) doe
worke by the said kinde of faith. For our Sauiour
Christ speaketh in that place vnto his disciples, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whome he had bestowed the gift of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
before as it is in the 10 chapter of the Gospel
by Saint <hi>Mathew:</hi> and yet notwithstanding their
faith wauered, so that they could not cast out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
out of that childe, as it is in the said 17. chapter
of the Gospel after Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> Euen as we see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in <hi>Peter:</hi> who although our Sauiour Christ in the
14. chapter of the said Gospel, did bidde him come
vnto him walking vpon the sea: yet through infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
he had beene drowned, if Christ had not taken
him by the hand, and (as it were) againe renewing
his former faith, and strengthening it. For it is most
certaine, that no man liuing hath the faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
except the Lord hath first giuen him the grace
and gift of working miracles. For seeing that faith
is a beliefe: and how can a man beleeue that which
he knoweth not? and how can he know without some
especiall promise. For to build his faith of miracles
simply vpon the word of God alone, as it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set downe in the scripture, is not sufficient, vnlesse
he haue further an especiall promise, or reuelation
from God. For otherwise euery one that beleeueth,
might bee a worker of miracles by the same faith,
which is false. For <hi>Simon</hi> the sorcerer in the 8. chap.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12715:36"/>
of the <hi>Actes of the Apostles</hi> is said to beleeue, and yet
had not the gift of working miracles; but would
haue bought it for money afterward of <hi>Peter.</hi> Nay it
is manifest by the 12. chap. of the 1. Epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> that
euen the elect children of God, and those that are
workemen, and builders in his Church, beeing of the
clergy, haue not all this gift. But will some say: This
maketh nor so much to the purpose: for why may
not our cunning men and women be of the number
of those, vpon whome God hath bestowed that gift?
To this I answer: That besides that I haue shewed
before: that the said grace of working miracles is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ceased: it is requisite, that they shew some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
promise, or reuelation from God, by the
which they doe work. Or else they do but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
thereof, taking the authority vnto themselues
before the same be giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which is most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sacriledge. Euen as the Exorcistes doe in this
place. For it is not enough to prooue, that they are
indued with the grace of working miracles from
God: And that they doe that which they doe in this
behalfe, by the faith of miracles, because that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
they bring to passe such vnwoonted, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
things as they take in hand. For so it
may as well follow: That the sorcerers of Egypt spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the 7. and 8. chapters of <hi>Exod.</hi> did worke by
the aforesaid meanes. Which cannot possibly be.
For they themselues doe in a manner confesse the
contrary: when as in the 19. vers. of the said. 8. cap. of
<hi>Exod.</hi> they are said to affirme, that the <hi>finger of God
was there.</hi> That is the lies spoken of in the vers. going
before were made, and brought forth onely by the
almighty power of God. As if they should haue said.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12715:37"/>
Heretofore whatsoeuer we haue done in turning
our roddes into serpents: the water into blood: or
procuring of frogs: It was by naturall meanes: and
such as was ministred vnto vs by Satan our master:
But now this causing of lice after such a manner doth
passe our cunning, or any meanes that can be vsed
by man: but onely by the diuine, and supernaturall
power of God, and authority from him. The which
we want: and therefore we cannot effect this thing.
But as for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they haue their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from the almighty: and therefore whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they haue done in this action of causing these
lice, it is by no other meanes saue onely by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and mighty power of God, working by them,
and in them: Wherefore it is no maruaile, though
they goe beyond vs herein. And it is most apparant
by the circumstance of the 8. cap. of the <hi>Act.</hi> That
<hi>Simon</hi> the sorcerer did many wonderfull things in
the eyes of the people, and yet it is as cleare as the
sunne, that he did them not by any godly and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes, but onely by magicke: and therefore
not by any authority or gift from God, or by the
faith of miracles. And truely if so be extraordinary,
and wonderfull things were not sometimes wrought
by euill meanes, God would neuer haue inueighed
so much against the same in the holy scriptures,
as it appeareth that he doth in diuerse places
thereof. But to goe further with them in this case. If
so be that the gift of healing, and other miracles
working, be the meere grace and gift of God, being
giuen onely to some especiall body, vpon special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
(as the truth is) why can these cunning folkes
doe nothing without their ordinary set forme of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12715:37"/>
prayers, or characters, and such like? or so many
times repeated? When as our Sauiour Christ fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
fault with such things in the 6. cap. of S. <hi>Math.</hi>
Gospell, where he saith to his disciples these words.
<hi>viz. When ye pray,</hi> make no <hi>vaine repetitions as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
doe: which thinke to be heard for their much babling,
be ye not therefore like vnto them.</hi> And why doth one of
these sorcerers giue vnto another certain set formes
of prayers, or blessings (as they call them) to cure
such or such a disease? or to worke these or those
wonders, if God alone be the onley author of their
working? what (I pray you, is this els? but to tie the
power and will of God in this behalfe vnto words,
and characters, that is, vnto his creatures, then which
there can be no greater Idolatry or sacriledge.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last reason which they bring; is
not so much to confirme the lawfulnesse of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of going to these wizzards, as to induce or insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
a tolerablenesse in regard of the necessity (as it
should seeme) thereof. For say they, there are diuerse
and sundry kinds of Maladies, which though a man
do goe to all the physitions that can be heard of, yet
he shall find no remedy: whereas sometimes they are
cured by those which are called cunning folkes: and
therefore in all likelihood (admit it be not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so allowable by the word as the common
and ordinary manner of curing by medicines) yet
because that there seemeth to be no other meanes
left (as it were) to cure the said diseases, we hold it to
be tollerable, and in such cases to be vsed without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great offence vnto God: vnlesse we should neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and make no account of our health: nay not of
life it selfe, which is a most especiall benefit, and gift
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12715:38"/>
of the almighty. To this I answer: That indeede o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles
the sorcerers by the meanes of Satan doe
heale-diseases, which many physitions cannot. The
which he is more apt and able naturally to bring to
passe then man is, both (as I haue said before) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his nature in his creation: and also his long
experience, especially if the diseases be inflicted by
him selfe, as many times they be. Yea after such a
sort, and by such meanes, that no mortall man can
find out the causes or reason of the same as you may
perceiue before <hi>fol. 41, 42, &amp;</hi> 43. And in these cases
as our common prouerbe hath, he that hideth can
best find, and he that made the wound, and he that
wrought the griefe best knoweth the cause thereof?
and therefore can best cure it, being (as he is) so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in such matters. And as the diuell doth at the
first cause certaine diseases, so it is very likely that he
continueth, and vpholdeth the same so that by no
ordinary meanes they can be cured, and that to this
end, that men may seeke to him, or to his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for helpe, contrary to the word and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God. The which ought not to be done.
For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 3. cap. of the epist. <hi>Rom.</hi> vers. 8.
sheweth, that we ought not to doe euill that good
may come thereof. And he insinuateth as much in
the 6. cap. of the same <hi>epist.</hi> vers. 1, and 2. Besides this:
What good is it (I pray you) that they looke for at
these wizzards hands? but onely health, and riches,
and such like temporall benefits, which soone passe
away; and oftentimes (as I haue prooued before) are
cause of the vtter ruine of him that hath them.
What madnes is it then for vs, in regard of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany
and transitory things, in going to such
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12715:38"/>
kind of men to procure gods iust iudgement to fall
vpon owne heads, vnto our eternall destruction.
Yea and sometimes euen in this life, God layeth his
punishment vpon such offenders (as I haue said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
and as it is manifest by the first chapter of the
second booke of the <hi>King.</hi> where the Lord affirmeth
by the mouth of <hi>Elias:</hi> that because that <hi>Abaziah</hi>
had sent vnto <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of Ekron concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the recouery of his health: Therefore he should
not come off from his bedde where he did lie, but
should most certainely die. And we haue a most
fearefull example of king <hi>Saul,</hi> of the iudgement of
God against this sinne. The which if it be duly
weighed and considered according to all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
thereof, it will be sufficient to ouerthrow
all excuses of going vnto sorcerers: as it will appeare
by the history therof set downe in the scripture. For
whereas in the 28. cap. of the first booke of <hi>Samuel</hi>
vers. 3. It is said that <hi>Saul,</hi> had put away the sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and the south-sayers out of the land: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the next two vers. That the Philistims assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themselues <hi>and came and pitched in Shunem. And
Saul assembled all Israel, and they pitched in Giboa. And
when Saul saw the host of the Philistims he was afraid, &amp;
his heart was sore astonied.</hi> Now <hi>Saul</hi> being in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
extremity, at the first vsed gods ordinary
meanes: and as it is in the 6. vers. <hi>he asked counsell of the
Lord.</hi> And because the Lord did not answer him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>dreames:</hi> nor by <hi>Vrim:</hi> nor yet by <hi>prophets.</hi> The
which were meanes whereby often times it pleased
God to reueale his will vnto men in those daies.
Therefore <hi>Saul</hi> being thus beset with his enemies,
and seeing that God did not vouchsafe, albeit he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12715:39"/>
had sought vnto him in some measure (as he thought)
to instruct him any waies, what he was to doe in this
case: whether to yield, or to ioyne battell with the
Philistims: neither what successe he should haue in
this busines. Therfore (I say) as one that would not,
or peraduenture (as he thought) that could not stay
the Lords leisure, he resolued to leaue off seeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more vnto him, but to the diuell: &amp; therupon he
went to <hi>Endor</hi> to aske counsell of asorceresse which
dwelt there, as it followeth in the same chapter. But
what was the end of this act of his? Truly a most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
destruction both of himselfe, as also of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Israelites, his subiects, as appeareth most
notably, both in the 31. chapter of this booke, and
likewise in the 10. chapter of the first booke of the
<hi>Chronicles,</hi> where it is said, that the Philistims com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the Israelites to flie, slue his three sonnes, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,
Abinadab,</hi> and <hi>Melchisna:</hi> and draue <hi>Saul</hi>
into such a streight, that he killed himselfe for feare,
with his owne sword: and the Philistims finding his
body dead amongst the rest of the slaine, hung it vp
reprochfully vpon the wall of their city <hi>Bethsan.</hi>
And least any should thinke, that this punishment
did not happen for seeking vnto such wicked, and
abominable sorcerers, it is said in the 13. and 14.
verses of the aforesaid 10. chapt. of the first booke
of the <hi>Chroni.</hi> that <hi>Saul dyed for his transgression, that
he committed against the Lord, euen against the word of
the Lord, which he kept not: And in that he sought and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Counsell of a familiar spirit, and asked not of the
Lord: therefore the Lord slewe him, and turned the
kingdome vnto Dauid the sonne of Ishay.</hi> Heere in
this historie we may plainely perceiue, that no cause,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12715:39"/>
or occasion can free from punishment, or make
the going vnto sorcerers tollerable. For then
might <hi>Saul</hi> haue had some excuse: who sought
not for helpe of them, vntill he was in such distresse
and daunger, both of his owne life, and of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that hee sawe (as it seemed to him) no other
way or meanes of escape: neither did hee goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, vntill hee had first asked counsaile of
the Lord: and that hee had (as it were) refused to
heare or answer him in this his extremity, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes allowable, as it is heere said. <hi>Neither
by dreames, nor by Vrim, nor by Prophets.</hi> And yet
notwithstanding it is saide in this 10. chapter of the
first booke of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that <hi>because he sought, and
asked counsaile of a familiar spirit, and asked not of the
Lord: therefore the Lord slue him, &amp;c.</hi> Where we see
that verified, which is spoken in the 18. cap. of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi>
vers. 24. <hi>viz. If the righteous turne away from his
righteousnes, and commit iniquitie, and doe according to all
the abominations, that the wicked man doth, shall he liue?
all the righteousnes that he hath done, shall not be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but in his transgression that he hath committed, and
in the sinnes that he hath sinned, in them shall hee die.</hi> For
albeit <hi>Saul</hi> is said in the 28. chap. of the first booke
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> vers. 6. That <hi>Saul</hi> asked <hi>counsell of the
Lord: and the Lord answered him not.</hi> Yet because
hee left off that good course which hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne,
and afterward went vnto a sorcerer; it was
all one, as if he had not asked counsaile of the Lord
at all. He ought rather to haue repented him of his
sinnes, and to haue turned vnto the Lord by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and heartie prayer, and amendment of
life: and then no doubt the Lord would haue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12715:40"/>
hearkened vnto him, and haue graunted his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so soone, and so farre forth, as he had thought it
meetest, and best for him at least wise in the world
to come. This knew king <hi>Dauid</hi> very well, and that
was the cause that mooued him in the 2. booke of
<hi>Sam.</hi> cap. 15. (when as <hi>Absolon</hi> his sonne pursued him
with an host of men, and brought him vnto such a
distresse, that he was compelled to flie for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his life) to yield himselfe in all humanity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the meere mercy, and goodnesse of God: and to
waite the Lords leisure, as it appeareth in the 25. and
26. vers. of the same chapter, by the words which he
spake vnto <hi>Zadok</hi> the high priest: who had brought
the Arke of God out of the city in that flight, saying
vnto him the said <hi>Zadok, Carry the Arke of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into the citie: If I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the
Lord, he will bring me againe, and shew me both it, and the
tabernacle thereof. But if he thus say: I haue no delight in
thee, behold heere I am, let him doe to me as seemeth good
in his eies.</hi> So that this was his resolution: to depend
vpon the mercifull prouidence of God, whatsoeuer
it should please God to doe with him. He did not as
king <hi>Saul</hi> had done before him: who sought for
helpe and comfort of sorcerers: but as the holy man
<hi>Iob</hi> saith, in the 17. cap. and 15. vers. That <hi>albeit the
Lord did slay him, yet he would put his trust in him:</hi> And
this hath beene the course that the Saints of God
haue taken from time to time. And this ought to be
our course, if we will arriue at the happy hauen of
saluation in the world to come. For it is not a thing
indifferent, but a matter of exceeding great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In so much that whosoeuer doth not obserue
the same, he shall not (without repentance) enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12715:40"/>
the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>These foure are the chiefe of their reasons which
I haue heard. The rest are either of small weight or
moment, or els they may be referred to the foure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid:
wherefore I will hast to the next words,
which the exorcists are heere said to vse in their
coniuration: which are these following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We adiure you by Iesus, whome Paul preacheth.</hi> This
speech seemeth to be borrowed of the common
course of iudges in their sessions, and such like: who
when they would haue anything done exactly and
diligently, doe vse to sweare them vnto it. Euen so in
this place, the Exorcists are said to vse the greeke
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is deriued of the
noune <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifieth an oath: and so doth
the Latine word <hi>adiuro</hi> come of <hi>iusiurandum</hi> which
betokeneth the same thing. As for English terme we
haue none (that I know) that can in all points ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the greeke, or latine word, wherefore we are
constrained to make an English word of the Latine,
saying <hi>(we adiure)</hi> for the common vsuall word of
coniuring in our language, cannot well stand with
the sense of this place: Neither doe I know how it
hath crept into our tongue in these matters, seeing
that it signifieth rather <hi>(conspiring)</hi> when diuerse haue
conspired, and as it were sworne together to doe any
act. How heit according as they are vsed now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, there us little, or no difference in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and may be vsed (for the most part) the one
word for the other. But notwithstanding in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest
translations they vse this word <hi>(charge)</hi>
which because it carieth not that <hi>(emphasis)</hi> with it,
which the greeke and latine words doe, therefore it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12715:41"/>
in altered heere, and <hi>(adiure)</hi> put in for it. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it be, it is most certaine, that these exorcists did
mightily offend the maiesty of God in so profaning
of the most holy name of Christ Iesus, by making
thereof a charme or inchantment: and abusing it to
their owne priuate fame, and commodity, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such commission, or authority from God. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as all authority and power is appointed by him,
in ciuill causes and matters of the common wealth,
as it is in the 13. cap. <hi>Rom.</hi> vers. 1. <hi>All power is of God, &amp;
the powers that be, are ordeined of God.</hi> So it is in <hi>gods</hi>
Church wherin euery man hath his place, <hi>euery</hi> man
hath his especiall gift, according as it pleaseth God
to appoint, and giue him, as it is manifest by the 12.
cap. of the 1. epist. <hi>Cor.</hi> And whosoeuer is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that measure which God by his spirit hath
bestowed vpon him, but presumeth of greater gifts
in this behalfe then he hath, is a vsurper, of which
sort were <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> in the 16. cap.
of the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> with their adherents,
whose most fearefull punishment is set downe in
that place. Nay euen <hi>Vzza</hi> in the second booke of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> cap. 6. was stricken with present death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he touched the Arke of God to stay it, least it
should haue fallen, or haue beene hurt: which he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to doe of a good intent. The which if it be so,
then no doubt the sinne of these exorcists cannot be
but most horrible, in abusing thus the name of
Christ Iesus: for God will not hold him guiltles that
taketh his name in vaine: as it is in the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
And truely it is very much to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
at, that men of such place, and knowledge, as it
may seeme that these were: should fall into such
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12715:41"/>
grosse errours and impietie.</p>
            <p>For they were the sonnes of <hi>Scena a chiefe priest of
the Iewes which did this.]</hi> Now wee know that the
<hi>priestes lippes should preserue knowledge, and the law
should be required at his mouth, for he is the messenger of
the Lord of hostes, Malachy.</hi> cap. 2. ver. 7. Wherefore
if it were the duty of all the Israelites, to teach their
children the preceptes, and commandementes of
the Lord, as it is in the 6. cap. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> ver.
7. &amp;. 8. and cap. 11. ver. 19. then much more were
the priestes bound to doe it, vnto whom all the rest
were to resort to light their candle of knowledge.
But that seemeth to bee most truly verified of the
people in that age, which the prophet Esay in the
first chapter verse 5. &amp;. 6. saieth, viz. <hi>The whole head
is sick of one and the same disease: the whole heart is heauy:
euen from the soale of the foote, vnto the crowne of the head
there is no whole part, but woundes, and swellinges, and
filthy sores.</hi> For Iosephus a Iew, one of their owne
countrie men, liuing not long after this time, a most
excellent historiographer in his booke, <hi>De antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Iudaeorum</hi> cap. 6. and in other places, doth say
that this most wicked art of magick was neuer more
vsed, then it was in his time. In so much that some
doe report in their writings, and those of their owne
nation and countrie: that their 70. Senators, and
as they terme them in their language the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi>
which were the cheife counsailours of state amongst
them: and were wont to sit with the king for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of that common wealth were infected with
the poison of this art, and had great skill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the same. Wherefore the afore-said Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
in the place before alledged hath these words.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12715:42"/>
               <hi>Erat tunc temporis Iudaea latronum, praestigiatorum, &amp;
planorum, asylum &amp; spelunca: &amp; certè quia deus extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Iudaeorum impietate offendebatur: vrbem<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ideò, &amp;
templum abominabatur, Romanorum exercitum induxit,
vt tanquam per ignem expurgaret. Quin (ait) si Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
vel tantillum eius excidium distulissent, proculdubio
aut terrae hiatu absorpti, aut nouo diluvio mersi, aut incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio
consumpti fuissent. Haec enim generatio Sodomiticâ ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
longè sceleratior &amp; flagitiosior erat.</hi> Which may bee
englished thus: At that time was <hi>Iudea</hi> a receptacle
and denne of theeues, iuglers, and notable deceiuers.
And truly because God was offended with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great impiety: therefore hee detested also
the cittie and the temple, he brought in the army of
the Romanes, that thereby he might purge them as
it were by fire. Yea (and that more is) if the Romanes
had deferred the destruction thereof neuer so little
a while, without doubt either the earth had swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them vp, or they had beene drowned with some
straunge and vnwoonted deluge, or ouerflowing of
waters, or else the fire had consumed them. For this
generation was farre more sinneful, and wicked then
those that dwelt in Sodome. Here wee see, that this
<hi>Iosephus</hi> (who was an eye-witnes and partaker of that
misery and calamity, which he wrote of) doth reckon
magicke and iugling, or charming, for one of the
chiefe capitall sinnes, for the which the cittie of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
was destroyed. And doubtlesse, when men are
come to this passe, that they maintaine, and practise
magicke, and sorcery, it is a signe that they are come
(in a manner) vnto the highest degree of wickednes.
For here they seeme to make (as it were) a publike
profession of the religion, and seruice of the diuell:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12715:42"/>
whereas they doe not so altogether in other sinnes,
except it bee in open blasphemy: wherefore when
this is generally practised without controlement in
any cittie, or countrey: it cannot possibly bee, but
that the Lord must needes bring a vniuersall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
vpon the same. The which I beseech God
to keepe farre from vs: for I am perswaded, that this
kinde of wickednes (albeit the good and wholesome
lawes which are made against it) was neuer more
practised amongst vs, especially for the recouery of
health. For many, I might say, most men now a daies
(if God doe not restore them to health, when, &amp; how
they thinke good, they will leaue Gods ordinarie
meanes by physicke, and will goe to sorcerers: that
is, to the ministers of Satan, which is all one, as to go
to Satan himselfe. And although it may be, that they
will answer me, and say: that they whome they goe
vnto for remedy, doe vse good meanes, and godly
words in these cases. Yet it followeth not (as I haue
said before) that they are therefore no sorcerers. For
no doubt, those which <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaketh of, vsed as
good meanes in outward appearance: and so do the
sonnes of <hi>Sceua</hi> in this place. But because this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
not so directly to the verse, which I haue in
handling, I will passe to the next words, where I shall
haue fitter occasion to speake of this matter, when I
come to the 15. and 16. verses. In the which (as I
haue said before) is set downe the issue, or euent of
the practise of these lewd sorcerers, and that in two
respects. First, in regard of that which was said vnto
them in the 15. verse. And secondly, what was done
vnto them in the 16. verse.</p>
            <p>The wordes which were spoken vnto them are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12715:43"/>
these, <hi>Iesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?]</hi> The
which is an answer of the foule spirit vnto the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
sorcerers: being as much in effect, as if hee
should haue said in this manner. Whereas you
sorcerers the sonnes of Sceua, doe charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
me so straightly by the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> to goe
out of this man: I see no reason why ye should doe
so. Indeed I know Iesus to be the sonne of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
God: yea God himselfe, equall to the Father as
touching his godhead: and therefore of sufficient
might &amp; power, euen of himselfe to driue me out of
possession where I am. And likewise I knowe <hi>Paul</hi> to
be sent, and to haue lawfull power &amp; authority from
him, to cast me out: But as for you, and such as you
are: I acknowledge you for none such, neither by
your selues, nor by any commission from God, to
commaund me to goe out: but ye are onely vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and presume to doe that which ye are not able
to performe. For although God doth bestow this
grace of casting such as I am out of those men, whom
we haue possessed, vpon some men whome it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him, vpon speciall occasion; yet ye are none of
the number of them to whome he hath granted this
gift. Therefore in vaine doe ye take in hand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse
me, with your goodly and glorious wordes:
for it is not the words which is able to worke such
wonders, but it is onely the working power of God,
which bringeth such mighty things to passe, as ye
shall well see: and so hee caused the man which hee
had possessed, to run vpon the said sorcerers, and all
to beat them, and wounded them, as it followeth in
the next verse. Thus wee may perceiue that God
doth not tye his power of working miracles vnto
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12715:43"/>
words, or characters whatsoeuer, or howsoeuer vsed:
for then might euery one be a worker of miracles,
which could vse those meanes: But God bestoweth
that grace vpon the person: and that not vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, nor vpon the most part: but only vpon some
particular, and that vpon especiall occasion (as I
haue said before) and this place doth most euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prooue: especially in the next vers. where it is said.
<hi>The man in whome the euill spirit was, &amp;c.]</hi> We must
not thinke that it was this man alone heere spoken
of, which dealt thus with these sorcerers. For could
one poore silly man be able to ouercome so many,
being young, (no doubt) and lusty men? who (as it
appeareth plainely by the words of the text) did not
stand still, and suffer themselues to be thus shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
intreated and handled, but resisted what they
could. For it is heere said, that he ouercame them (as
it were) in the combat: and so preuailing against
them did driue them out of the house, both naked
and wounded: wherefore it was the diuell which was
the chiefe actor in this fray: and vsed the man pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
as an instrument, to bring this matter to passe.
Where we see that the Lord doth oftentimes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
punish that sinne, wherein men doe take most
delight, and thinke that it should be most for their
honour, commoditie or pleasure: euen that doth
God turne to their greatest shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
and to his greater glory. So our first parents
when they had thought to haue gained pleasure,
profit, and wisedome by eating of the forbidden
fruit, they lost themselues and their posterity, with
all good things els: had not the Lord to the great
glory of his mercy saued some of them by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12715:44"/>
seed of the woman. And those men in the old
world <hi>Genesis.</hi> cap. 11. which imagined to keepe
themselues from being dispersed by building of that
huge tower, and citie of Babylon: were by the same
occasion scattered into all partes of the world. So
the faction of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> dreamed
of honour, and preferment, by resisting of <hi>Moses:</hi>
in the 16. cap. of the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> but it was
the cause of their euerlasting shame, and ouerthrow,
as it is there set downe. There are infinit examples in
the scriptures, which doe inferre the truth of this
point: but I will let them passe, and come to the text
it selfe, where we may behold these sorcerers most
extreamely and shamefully beaten of him, euen of
the diuell: by whose seruice in this action they had
thought to haue obtained greatest credit. Neither
are we hereby to gather that Satan was grieued with
this profaning of the name of Christ Iesus, or with
this sorcery of theirs. But because God bringeth (as
it were) light out of darknesse, and therefore foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that God would turne this their wicked act into
his owne glory, and the furtherance of the Gospell:
therefore Satan being as it were in a rage for this
their vnseasonable vsing of the name of the Lord
Iesus in their charmes: at such a time, and in such a
place as they did deale thus with them: Whereas at
other times, when it might haue serued his owne
turne better, no doubt he would haue beene so farre
from hurting them for such an act, that he would
haue seemed to yield vnto them therein: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might the better haue confirmed his wicked
craft of magicke and sorcery. Nay it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that euen at this time, he would haue giuen place,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12715:44"/>
at the aforesaid words vttered by the sorcerers, if
the wonderfull prouidence of God had not ouer-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him: who by this act had determined to glorifie
the Gospel of his sonne Christ Iesus: as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the 17, 18, and 19 verses following: where
it is set downe. That after this was knowne, both
Iewes and Gentiles, which dwelt at Ephesus, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the name of the Lord Iesus, confessing their
sinnes. And among the rest, those that had vsed
vaine and curious artes; that is, <hi>charmes, inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
coniuring,</hi> and other magicall deuises, came
moreouer, and brought their vaine books, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them in the sight of the people. The worth of
them being counted, came (at the least rate) to about
eight hundred pounds. For hereby they were driuen
to consider more deepely of the infinit power of the
Godhead of Christ Iesus, to tame the vnbridled
rage, and malice of Satan: and also the wicked vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of magicall conceits, whereby these sorcerers
could bring nothing to passe: and finally the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the same which albeit it may seeme not to
be so great to be beaten and wounded: yet whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall weigh the circumstances of the text, shall
finde that it was no ordinarie kinde of combate, that
did driue the beholders into such a maze. But it was
such an one (no doubt) as the like had not bin seene
in their time. And it is very likely, that they did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceiue by this example, of the iust iudgment
of God threatned against such in the scriptures:
wherein the spirit of God doth mightily inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this kinde of wickednes: as in the 10. chapter
of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> vers. 27. he commaundeth, that they
should be put to death in these words. <hi>If a man or a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12715:45"/>
woman, haue a spirit of diuination, or sooth-saying in them,
they shall die the death, their blood shall be vpon them.</hi>
And likewise in the 22 cap. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> vers. 18. he
saith: <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to liue.</hi> And the Lord
himselfe saith in the 3. cap. of the prophet <hi>Malachy.</hi>
vers. 5. that he will <hi>come in iudgement, and that he will
be a swift witnesse against the south-sayers.</hi> Wherefore
the good king <hi>Iosiah</hi> in the feare of the Lord, tooke
away all that had familiar spirits: and the <hi>sooth-sayers,</hi>
as it is in the second booke of the <hi>King.</hi> cap. 23. vers.
24. But it may be, that some men will obiect and
say, that these places seeme to be vnderstood of
those onely which haue made (as it were) a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
or haue priuate conference with the diuell, the
which is a thing that themselues will confesse to be
abominable: But as for all those which vse any other
kind of conceit or deuise: whether by word, chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
or otherwise, so it be not manifestly wicked and
blasphemous: they will defend their doings therein
to be good, or at least wise not hurtfull. To these I
answer, that let them looke into the booke of God,
and they shall finde the one, as well as the other to
be condemned: as namely in the 18. cap. of <hi>Deut.</hi> the
spirit of God hath these words. <hi>viz. Let none be found
among you that maketh his sonne or his daughter to goe
through the fire, or that vseth witchcraft, or a regarder of
times, or a marker of the flying of foules, or a sorcerer, or a
charmer, or that counselleth with spirits, or a sooth-sayer,
or that asketh counsell of the dead. For all that doe such
things are abomination vnto the Lord: and because of those
abominations, the Lord thy God doth cast them out before
thee, &amp;c.</hi> VVhere we may euidently see, and perceiue
a difference to be made betweene the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12715:45"/>
and that not onely contracts, counselling, and
conference with spirits is forbidden: but also all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds of vaine, friuolous and superstitious artes
are counted abominable vnto the Lord: as namely,
<hi>witchcraft.]</hi> the original words do signifie him which
vseth diuining, of which sort are those which will tell
of things lost, stolne, or conueied away, and other
such like hidden and secret things. Secondly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of times, as they are which will haue one time
more lucky then another: To be borne at one how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
more vnfortunate then at another. To take a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or any other enterprise in hand, to be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
or prosperous at one time, then at another.
As likewise if such a festiuall day fall vpon such a
day of the weeke, or such like, we shall haue such a
yeare following: and many other such like vaine
speculations, set downe by our astrologians, hauing
neither footing in gods word: nor yet natural reason
to support them: But being grounded onely vpon
the superstitious imagination of mans braine:
Wherefore this kinde is much spoken against, in the
booke of God, as I haue somewhat touched before.
The next are the markers of the flying, or noise of
foules: as they which prognosticate death by the
croaking of rauens: or the hideous crying of owles
in the night Or some misfortune, if a hare do crosse
a man: with many other such like vaine and wicked
toyes. By <hi>(sorcerers)</hi> in this place seemeth to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
those wicked persons, which take in hand
to hurt any man, in his body, or goods: wherefore
the old translation termeth them <hi>maleficos,</hi> as it
were harme-doers, or workers of mischiefe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these kind of people doe oftentimes vse crafty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12715:46"/>
and cunning sleights to bring their matters to passe,
therfore they are by <hi>Tremellius</hi> called <hi>Praestigiatores,</hi>
of their iugling trickes of leger demaine, whereby
the senses of men being deluded they would seeme
to doe one thing, when as they doe another, and that
by another meanes then in shew they pretend. And
of this sort seeme our witches to be among vs, whose
doings in this behalfe it would belong, and needles
to recount: seeing that they be so well knowne by
common speach, and experience. As for <hi>Inchanters</hi>
and <hi>Charmers,</hi> for they are both one, I haue spoken
somewhat before, although not all that might be
said to that purpose. These are they, which by vsing
of certaine conceited words, characters, circles, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and such like vaine and wicked trumpery (by
gods permission) doe worke great maruailes: as
namely in causing of sicknesse, as also in curing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
in mens bodies. And likewise binding some,
that they cannot vse their naturall powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
as we see in <hi>night-spels.</hi> In so much as some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doe take in hand to bind the diuell himselfe by their
Inchantments. Wherfore those, which we terme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers,
are not vnfitly to be referred to this kind: and
by the same reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Exorcists spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in this text.
And to speak generally, whosoeuer worketh any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
wonder, by any of the last aforesaid
means of words, characters, amulets, &amp; the like: doth
worke by charming, and inchantment: albeit he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no contract, nor hath any conference with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
as they haue which are spoken of in the next
place, which take counsel of spirits in those matters
wherin they would haue them to serue their turne, as
the damsell in the <hi>Acts,</hi> 16, 16. which had a spirit of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12715:46"/>
diuinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby she procured much profit vnto her
master. And the woman in the first booke of <hi>Sam.</hi>
28. 7. to whome king <hi>Saul</hi> went for counsell, when
the Philistims came against him. And of these sorts
are all those which haue a familiar spirit, or by any
meanes doe vse conference with Satan, vpon any
occasion, or in any matter wherein they would vse
him. These that are heere called <hi>(sooth-sayers)</hi> seeme
to be those which doe foretell, and prognosticate
things to come: as are alterations of kingdomes, and
common wealths, dearth, or plenty of victuall, and
such like: as the prophets of God were wont to doe
by the speciall motion of Gods spirit so these would
seeme to imitate them in this behalfe, hauing no
warrant for the same out of the word, nor any priuate
reuelation from God: but are ledde thereunto by
some imaginary conceit, or superstition, or els by the
instinct of Satan: as were the false prophets in the
booke of God: who seeme then especially to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by that name, when as they falsely vsed the name
of God to confirme their predictions. The next and
last kind of magicke set downe in this place is of
those which aske counsell of the dead, not that the
dead doe or can resolue them in any such doubtfull
case, or that they are able by these or any other
meanes, to raise them vp againe, being once depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
as it may be prooued both by reason, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
places of the scripture. But because it was so
thought and beleeued of the people, both in regard
that oftentimes it was vsed about the tombs of men
deceased: and also by reason that the diuell did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
vnto them in the forme of those which were
dead when they gaue answer to those things which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12715:47"/>
they were demaunded, as it is plaine by the 28. chap.
of the first booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where the holy seruant
of God <hi>Samuel</hi> is said to bee raised vp by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to certifie king <hi>Saul,</hi> what successe hee should
haue in the battaile against the Philistimes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought any man to maruaile at this: That I
haue cited this last example before, when I spake of
those which aske <hi>counsaile of spirits.</hi> For we must not
thinke that all the afore-said kindes of magicke, are
so strictly to be distinguished, but that they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
otherwhiles in some points, one with the
other: yet so, as then they are rather to be tearmed
compound, then simple; and may in diuerse respects
be referred to diuers kinds of magicke; as in the last
alleadged example. In regard that the woman did
counsaile with a spirit, shee may bee referred to the
number of that kinde of magitians. But because he
appeared vnto her in the likenes of a dead man, shee
may bee called a necromancer, that is, one that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
counsaile of the dead. And if she vsed any sette
forme of words, or characters in this action; then
might shee haue beene called a charmer, or inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Finally, if she had done it to haue hurted, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
any body, we might haue placed hir among the
sorcerers before spoken of. And so in like manner
may wee iudge of all the rest, according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
to be obserued in each kinde of magick.
Howbeit it is manifest by the afore-said 18. chapter
of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> whereas the counsellours with spirits
are reckoned for an especiall and seuerall kinde of
magitians, that the same doth differ from the other
kindes, or at least wise from some of them, euen in
this behalfe. So that in all of them, there is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12715:47"/>
a contract, or personal conference with Satan,
as it appeareth by this present text: where it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that these Exorcists had not the personal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the diuell, at least wise in this action: but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vaine and irreligious persons, and hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to surpasse other men, tooke vpon them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
magicke; and because they did see Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
and the other Apostles to bring to passe such great
miracles, by the name of Iesus: therfore they of their
owne head, tooke vpon them to doe the like: and to
draw the same into their magicall artes (had not the
Lord confounded them in their said enterprise) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto the common custome of many men
in these our daies, who to winne themselues a name
in the world, will by all meanes possible procure
what magicall bookes they can heare of: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if they know any man to vse any manner, or
forme of words, or characters in curing of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
or working of any other wonder; they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
(after they haue obtained the knowledge
thereof) put the same in practise also, especially if it
carrie any colour, or shew of holines in it; as that of
the Exorcists did, thinking it no sinne so to doe. Nay
and because they see not an expresse couenant made
with Satan herein; therefore they will defend them
to bee good: whereas the spirit of God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
this kinde of magicke (for it is no better then
magicke) as wel as al the rest. The which the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in this 19. chapter of the <hi>Actes,</hi> did very well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
wherefore vpon the view and sight of the
iudgement of God vpon the Exorcists, they are said
to burne their bookes of curious artes: whereby is
meant, not only the grossest kind of magicke, wherin
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12715:48"/>
is a manifest compact, or conference with the diuell;
but also al vaine, &amp; superstitious deuices of diuining,
soothsaying, charming, and such like, which haue no
warrant out of the word of God, nor any reason out
of the whole course of nature to confirme them: such
as they vsed, which in the afore said 18. chapter of
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> are said to be <hi>regarders of times, markers
of the flying of foules, soothsayers, and charmers:</hi> as also
they which diuined by looking into beasts intralls,
as many did among the heathen, as it may be partly
gathered out of the 21. cap. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> v. 26. And it
is manifest by histories, that the Ephesians were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to such like superstition; for it is recorded in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
authors: That in the Image <hi>Diana,</hi> which was
worshipped at Ephesus, there were certaine obscure
words, or sentences not agreeing together, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
one vpon another; much like vnto riddles
written vpon the feete, girdle, and crowne of the said
<hi>Diana:</hi> the which if a man did vse, hauing written
them out, and carrying them about him, hee should
haue good lucke in all his businesses: and hereof
sprung the prouerbe, <hi>Ephesiae literae:</hi> where one vseth
any thing which bringeth good successe. And it is
very likely, that a great part of those bookes, which
are said to be burned in this 19, chapter of the <hi>Actes,</hi>
were filled with such like vaine and friuolous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Of which sort we haue an infinite number also
vsed amongst vs, as namely in Palmestry, where
mens fortunes are tolde by looking on the palmes
of the hands: and also by foredeeming of euill lucke,
by pulling on the shooe awry, or by the falling of
salt toward one: and likewise of good lucke, if drinke
be spilled vpon a man: or if he finde olde iron. And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12715:48"/>
furthermore, by erecting of a figure, to tell of stolne
goods. By the turning of a sieue, to shew who hath
bewitched one. By curing diseases with certaine
words or characters, or such like: with many more
foolish and superstitious vanities, needles heere to
recite, seeing that by these fewe we may easily iudge
of the rest. All which are an abomination vnto
the Lord, in so much as hee ouerthroweth, and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out whole countries because of the same, as hee
did the Chananites before the children of Israel,
according as it is set downe in the afore-said 18. cap.
of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> vers. 13. &amp; 14. And afterward, when
the Israelites had committed the like offence, the
Lord laid the like punishment vpon them: as it is
manifest in the second booke of the <hi>Kings,</hi> cap. 17,
vers. 17. where it is said, that <hi>they made their sonnes and
their daughters to passe through the fire, and vsed witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
and inchauntment: yea solde themselues to doe euill
in the sight of the Lord, to anger him: wherefore the Lord
was exceeding wroth with Israel, and put them out of his
sight.</hi> And if he deale so with whole nations, yea with
his owne peculiar people; among whom (no doubt)
some were godly and religious, and abhorred the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
sinnes: what shall those particular men
look for, which do practise the same? and take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
therein? truely nothing else, but the heauie and
iust iudgement and vengeance of God, to be laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them for this their wickednes: yea sometimes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in this world, either vpon themselues, or vpon
their posterity: but especially eternall damnation
in the world to come, with the diuell whome they
serue; as it appeareth in the 21. chapter of the <hi>Apoc.</hi>
vers. 8. where it is said, that <hi>the fearefull, and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12715:49"/>
and the abominable, and murtherers, and whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyers: shall haue
their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
which is the second death.</hi> Neither let those which
goe, and seeke to such vaine wizzards, and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sorcerers for counsaile &amp; helpe, thinke to escape
the like punishment. For the Lord in the 19. chapter
of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> vers. 31. forbiddeth the going vnto such
in these words: <hi>You shall not regard them that worke
with spirits, neither soothsayers: ye shall not seeke to them
to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.</hi> As if hee
should haue said, see that ye make no account of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians,
inchaunters, soothsayers, or any such like
vaine persons: and much lesse goe and seeke vnto
them for helpe, or counsaile, lest ye be defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
for it is no better then spirituall fornication:
for I am the Lord your God, which doe abhorre all
such vncleanenes: who also am able, and will surely
punish the same. And therefore hee saith in the 20.
chapter of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>If any turne after such as
worke with spirits, and after soothsayers, to goe a whoring
after them: then will I set my face against that person, &amp;
will cut him off from among his people.</hi> The which place
albeit it seemeth to be meant of earthly punishment
only, when as God doth root them so out, that there
remaineth no memoriall of them (as it were) in this
world, that may sound to the good &amp; credit of them
or theirs. Yet it may be vnderstood also of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
destruction. For euen as <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob</hi> are said, <hi>Genesis,</hi> cap. 25. vers. 8. &amp; cap. 35. vers.
29. &amp; cap. 49. vers. 33. to be gathered vnto their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they departed this life: that is, to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into the fellowship of the Saints of God, which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12715:49"/>
were gone before them into heauen. So those which
seeke vnto sorcerers, inchanters, and such like: when
they are said to be cut off from among their people,
may thereby be vnderstood to be for euer separated
from the company of the faithfull, and to be cast out
into hell, with the diuel &amp; his angels. And no maruel
though this heauie iudgement bee laid vpon them:
for there seemeth to be no more difference in effect
betwixt them that seeke to the afore-said sorcerers,
and other such like superstitious practisers, then is
betwixt a thiefe, and him that is accessarie vnto his
felony: or a traytour, and him that consenteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
For although they bee not chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
actours in this wicked busines; yet by seeking
vnto such persons, they shew their loue, and liking
of those means which the afore-said persons dovse,
and that they doe giue their consent thereunto, and
doe allowe of the same. But what of that will some
say? Indeede if so be that we knew those whome wee
seeke vnto, to be such as you would beare vs in hand
they were, then your comparison might well holde.
But seeing that we are ignorant thereof: nay we doe
rather take them to be contrarie, and their meanes,
which they vse to be good and lawfull: and therfore
we are of this opinion, that wee may goe vnto them
without offence to God: albeit vnto others, which
are not so perswaded of them, wee thinke that they
doe amisse, if they goe vnto such: for whatsoeuer is
not of faith, is sinne. To these I answer. That herein
their knowledge and iudgement is very shallow: for
the principle and ground which they would seeme
to stand vpon in this point, is taken out of the 14.
chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and is to bee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12715:50"/>
vnderstood of things indifferent onely: as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of that whole chapter doth set downe
vnto vs: of which sort are meates and drinkes, and
the obseruation of festiuall daies. The which things,
albeit of themselues they be neither good nor bad;
yet in regard of the person, and the minde, or intent
of him that vseth them, they may sometimes bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
For he that in vsing them, is not fully set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in conscience, but is in doubt whether the vse
thereof be lawfull or not, doth greatly offend: and
the reason is alleadged in the 23. verse of the same
chapter, where it is said: that <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith,
is sinne.</hi> Now it is certaine by the 10. chapter of this
Epistle, that true faith is grounded vpon the word
of God. Wherefore whatsoeuer action it bee (let
men pretend what they will) if it haue no warrant
out of the scripture, it is but a meere imagination of
their owne braine, springing either of their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature, or else of the suggestion of the diuell:
and therefore is wicked and sinnefull. The which
thing, if it be so, it followeth of necessity, that the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto sorcerers, charmers, inchaunters, and all
such like wizzards, albeit men beleeue neuer so
much, that they may lawfully do so; yet because that
it is not onely not allowed, but also condemned in
the word of God: therefore this their beliefe is no
true faith, but a vaine &amp; diuellish presumption, and
most abominable in the sight of God. Neither will
ignorance which they pretend serue their turne, to
couer their offence herein; albeit it may sometimes
extenuate and lessen the fault: as our Sauiour Christ
saith in the 12. chapter of the Gospel after S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
vers. 47. &amp; 48. <hi>That seruant which knew his masters will,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12715:50"/>
and prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his wil,
shall be beaten with many stripes. And he that knew not
his masters will, and committed things worthy of stripes,
shall be beaten with fewe stripes.</hi> So that here wee see,
that there is no defence for ignorance: but whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he be that sinneth, whether it be of ignorance, or
of knowledge, must needes bee punished for it. For,
<hi>Cursed are all they, which doe not continue in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, as it is in Deuteronomy,</hi> cap. 27. vers.
26. And the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, in the 2. chap.
to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> vers. 12. that <hi>as many as haue sinned
without law, shall be punished without law: and as many as
haue sinned in the law, shall be iudged by the law.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as dutifull seruants, in those things which wee
know, wee ought to bee diligent to put the same in
practise; and if we be ignorant of any thing, we ought
to seeke and inquire what the will of God is out of
his word, and not to rush forth into those actions,
which we know not whether the Lord doth allow or
not. But if we seeke for knowledge in those matters,
no doubt, but God wil instruct vs therein by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit, &amp; by his word, as our Sauiour Christ saith,
<hi>Matthew,</hi> cap. 7. vers. 7. <hi>Aske, and it shall be giuen you:
seeke, and ye shall finde: knocke, and it shall be opened vnto
you.</hi> And truely if we would vse zealous prayer, and
godly meditation comming vnto them with faith,
and humility, and such like, wee shall finde the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not to be so hard and obscure, to be knowne &amp;
vnderstood, as we take them to be; but most plaine
&amp; euident, for our comfort and instruction, both in
this point concerning those vaine, &amp; friuolous arts,
whereof I haue so much spoken: and also in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters of faith, &amp; good workes, what we should
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12715:51"/>
follow, and what we should eschew: as God in the 30.
chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> verses 11, 12, and 14. saith,
<hi>This commaundement which I commaund this day, is not
hidde from thee, neither is it farre off: it is not in heauen,
that thou shouldest say, who shall goe vp for vs to heauen,
and bring vs, and cause vs to heare it, that we may doe it!
but the word is very neere vnto to thee, euen in thy mouth, and
in thy heart, for to do it.</hi> So that it is our own pride, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
contempt, or such like sinister affections,
which is cause of this our ignorance; and that in
some more, and in some lesse, according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes of knowledge, and as they are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mooued in this behalfe. In so much that we may
hereof gather two kindes of ignorance to be in men.
One is, that which although it be not without the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said euill affections: yet they doe little appeare
in their actions, (no not to the parties offending
themselues, and much lesse vnto others) thinking
that to be good, which is euill; and that to bee euill,
which is good. And such was the ignorance of Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> before he was illuminated by the spirit of god,
as he saith in the first Epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> cap. 1. v. 13.
that he was before-time a blasphemer, <hi>a persecutor,
and an oppressour: but hee was receiued to mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee did it ignorantly through vnbeliefe.</hi> And
yet notwithstanding for all this, hee accounteth
himselfe the chiefe of all sinners for the same: and
most worthily doth attribute his conuersion to the
wonderfull and exceeding great mercy of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
who had not onely forgiuen him this his sinne,
but also had made him a fit vessell, to cary his name
abroad, and to preach the Gospel among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
whereas he had reiected other of his countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12715:51"/>
which offended of ignorance as well as he: as it
is in the 10. cap. of the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> vers. 2.
where speaking of the Iewes, or Israelites, he hath
these words. <hi>I beare them witnes, that they haue a zeale
but not according to knowledge.</hi> The other kind of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is that, wherein malice, and hatred doth
preuaile, as it did in the chiefe of the Iewes, which
crucified our Sauiour Christ, as it is in the 15. cap. of
<hi>Ioh.</hi> ver. 22. in these words. <hi>If I had not done those things
among them, which no other man did, they should haue had
no sin, but now haue they seene, and hated both me and my
father.</hi> And to say the truth, not onely this latter
kind, but also all of vs, before we are regenerate, are
by nature so corrupt, that we cannot but bring forth
most vile fruites of wickednesse: and therefore we
doe couet naturally rather to be ignorant of gods
lawes, and commaundements: thereby thinking to
couer the hainousnesse of our sinnes: wherefore our
Sauiour Christ in the Gospell after Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> cap.
3. vers. 19. <hi>saith, this is the condemnation, that light is
come into the world: and men loued darknes more then
light, because their deedes were euill.</hi> Whereupon the
Lord in his iust iudgement in times past, seeing they
regarded not to <hi>know him: euen so he deliuered them vp
into a reprobate minde, to doe those things which are not
conuenient: being full of all vnrighteousnesse:</hi> and so forth,
as it is in the 10. cap. of the Epistle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> vers.
28, 29, and 30. Euen as he saith also of the Scribes,
and Pharises, <hi>Math.</hi> cap. 15. vers. 14. and in them to
all other such like: in these words. <hi>Let them alone, they
are blind leaders of the blind: and if the blind lead the
blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</hi> As if he should haue
said: These men are void of the right knowledge of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12715:52"/>
religion, and true seruice of God: and yet they wil be
instructers of others: so that by this meanes they are
not onely wilfully ignorant themselues, but ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to bring those that will follow their doctrine
into the same condition. Wherefore let them alone,
let them goe on still therein: and in the end you shall
see: nay, it is most certaine (if they be not renewed by
faith and repentance) they shall fall both the sorts
of them, into the pit of euerlasting destruction. By
all this it is plaine, that if we transgresse the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
of God, in committing of any sinne,
it is not ignorance that shall excuse. For then would
not the Lord haue commanded sacrifice to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the same, as he doth in the 4. cap. of <hi>Leuit.</hi> ver.
2, and 3. in these words: <hi>Speake vnto the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
saying if any shall sinne through ignorance, in any of
the commandements of the Lord, (which ought not to be
done) but shall doe contrary to any of them. If the priest
that is annointed doe sinne (according to the sinne of the
people) then shall he offer, for his sinne which he hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
a young bullocke without blemish vnto the Lord for a
sinne offering.</hi> The which law is repeated also in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the <hi>Heb.</hi> cap. 9. vers. 7. And the prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuck,</hi>
maketh a solemne prayer for ignorances in
the 3. cap. of his prophesie. Furthermore the same is
manifest in the whole course of the scriptures, by
the punishment that hath beene laid vpon such like
offenders: as we may perceiue by the 17. cap. of the
second booke of the <hi>King.</hi> where when the Lord had
cast out the ten tribes of Israell with their king, out
of their owne country, for their wicked abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; that <hi>Shalmaneser</hi> had caried them away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
with him: he sent other of his own natiue people
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12715:52"/>
to supply their roome in <hi>ludea:</hi> who because they
were Gentiles, and had not beene brought vp in true
religion, therefore it is said in the 25, and 26. verses
of the same chapter: That at <hi>the beginning of their
dwelling there, they feared not the Lord: therefore the
Lord sent lyons among them, which slew them, wherefore
they came to the king of Ashur saying, the nations which
thou hast remooued, and placed in the cities of Samaria,
know not the manner of the God of the land: whereupon the
king commaunded, to send vnto them a priest of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to instruct them:</hi> as it followeth in the next vers. of
the same chapter. And in the prophet <hi>Esa.</hi> cap. 5.
vers. 13. the Lord hath these words. <hi>Therefore my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
goeth into captiuity, because they haue no knowledge.</hi>
Out of which two places we may note, that the Lord
doth not onely, not hold guiltles those offendours,
which haue the greatest meanes of knowledge in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as were the Israelites in times past: as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the 13. cap. of the Epistle to the <hi>Rom.</hi>
where it is said by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that to <hi>them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the oracles of God,</hi> euen as the Gospel of Christ
Iesus is now vnto vs Gentiles: but also doth punish
those, to whome it is not graunted to haue such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to learne. And truely no maruaile. For if
we account it lawfull for an earthly prince, to punish
those whosoeuer, which doe dwell within his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if they offend against his lawes being once set
forth, though they doe it of ignorance, why should
not the king of kings, and Lord of Lords, exact the
like obedience vnto his lawes set downe in his holy
word, of all those whome it pleaseth him to place in
his visible church and kingdome heere vpon earth.
For the Lord hath giuen vs his word as a law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12715:53"/>
he hath set down whatsoeuer he would haue done
learned, or beleeued: and likewise what he would
haue vs to eschew: as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth
say in the 1. epistle to <hi>Tim.</hi> cap. 3. vers. 16. &amp; 17. that
<hi>the whole scripture is giuen by inspiration of God: and is
profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct, and to instruct in
righteousnesse: that the man of God may be perfect, and
prepared vnto all good workes.</hi> So that whatsoeuer God
would haue vs to know, or doe, it is contained in the
same. Howbeit we must, as our Sauiour Christ saith,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 5. cap. v. 39. <hi>search the scriptures.</hi> It is not enough
for vs negligently, and carelesly, and (as it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,
to read them: but we must with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
reuerence, &amp; humility, study them: and as the
prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> did: <hi>meditating therein day and night:</hi>
conferring of one place with another: and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the drift of the holy Ghost in euery of them:
and aboue all things vsing humble and hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vnto God, that he would graunt vs his holy spirit,
which may so enlighten vs, that we may see those
wonderfull things which are contained in his lawes:
that we may conceiue aright of the truth in his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
word. For as Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. epist. cap. 1. vers. 20.
saith: <hi>no prophesie in the scripture is of any priuate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:</hi>
that a man may expound it according to
his owne mind and imagination, <hi>but holy men of God
did speake as they were directed, and ledde by the holy
Ghost,</hi> as it followeth there in the next vers. who as
he is the onely author, and inditer of the Scripture,
so he is the onely interpreter of the same, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
priuie to his owne meaning. And therefore the
Euangelist Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his first epistle cap. 4. vers. 1.
doth bidde vs not to beleeue <hi>euery spirit, but to try the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12715:53"/>
spirits whether they be of God or</hi> not as if he should haue
said. There are many which will make a great shew
of religion, and godlinesse, and will seeme as though
they had warrant from God for all their dealings,
when as it is nothing so. Wherefore beleeue note
uery one vntill you haue first madetriall, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
their actions, by the touch-stone of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whether God be the author of them or not.
The which precept if the prophet spoken of in the
13. cap. of the first booke of the <hi>King.</hi> had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
he had done well, but because he did not so, but
beleeued the false tale of the old Prophet, and came
backe again contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God:
and did eate and drinke in <hi>Bethel</hi> by his procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
when as the Lord had said vnto him, that he
should neither eate bread nor drinke water there.
Therefore the Lord said, that his body should not
come into the sepulchre of his fathers: which came
to passe presently: for he was slaine of a lyon in the
way as he returned home, and so was brought againe
to Bethel, and there buried. Whereas if hee had first
examined the truth of the olde Prophets speech, he
had no doubt neuer fallen into that daunger. For he
had a sufficient warrant from God afore, for that
which he did: vpon the which he might safely haue
relyed, if hee would haue gone forward according
vnto the same, and not haue hearkened to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
words of the said olde Prophet: vnlesse the
Lord himself had giuen him another contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
as otherwhiles he doth in particular
cases: as it may appeare by <hi>Genesis,</hi> chap. 22. where
after that God had giuen <hi>Abraham</hi> in charge, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12715:54"/>
his sonne <hi>Isaacke</hi> in the 2. verse of the same
chapter: afterward it is said, that the angel of the
Lord did bidde him not to doe it, when he had proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his faith, and obedience therein: till which time,
he could by no meanes be drawne from executing
the former commaundement of God. Euen so wee,
seeing that we are forbidden by the word of God to
goe, or seeke vnto any witches, inchaunters, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
or any such like vaine, and superstitious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisers:
and seeing that ignorance will not excuse vs,
as hath beene before declared: it behooueth vs to
trie, and examine the dealings of euery one in this
case, whether they be of God or not, by their calling
in this behalfe, by their meanes they vse, and by the
ende whereat they aime, and by all other waies and
meanes, which it shall please God to minister by his
holy spirit, out of his word; before wee giue credite
vnto them, whatsoeuer shew they make of religion,
and godlines in this point: lest the Lord in his wrath
lay vpon vs, all those plagues &amp; punishments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his word (as hath beene said before) against
such persons. There are many other things, which
might be fitly, and profitably gathered &amp; noted out
of this text, which I haue willingly omitted, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they haue beene sufficiently handled at large
by other men; and also because it was my only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
at the beginning to vtter that, which I thought
meetest concerning sorcery, and such other like wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
vaine, and diuellish abominations before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. It remaineth therefore now, to exhort eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good Christian to consider diligently, &amp; to make
vse of it: and to desire almighty God, that he would
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12715:54"/>
make it profitable, which hath beene said, both to
his owne glorie, and to our eternall comfort in
Christ Iesus: to whom with the Father and
the Holy Ghost, bee all honour, praise,
and thanksgiuing, now and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
