            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the Printed Catalogue of Books, 1674. I met with <hi>One,</hi> wearing the glorious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription of <hi>A Discourse concerning the Knowledge of Iesus Christ, and our Union and Communion with him:</hi> By <hi>W. S.</hi> And I did
<pb facs="tcp:105027:4"/>
seriously rejoyce, to see those who are Adorned with the Honourable Name of <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> so profitably employ those Hours which they borrow from Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, as to travel in so <hi>necessary</hi> a Subject. Now as this was <hi>the onely Reason</hi> of my first Ambition to be found amongst his Readers; so perhaps I am not the first that has been <hi>decoyed</hi> by <hi>a specious glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Title,</hi> to place out precious Time upon Disappointments; for I must freely confess, how ashamed I was of my ill-spent pains, when I found <hi>pro Thesauro, Carbones;</hi> not <hi>many</hi> Barley-Corns, but <hi>not one Iewel</hi> in all that Dunghill.</p>
            <p>I was willing at first to suspect, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily through some Oversight, either in <hi>the Collator,</hi> or <hi>Binder,</hi> a <hi>wrong Title-page</hi> had been praefixt to <hi>the Book;</hi> so irreconcileable did the Enmity seem between them; but second thoughts informed me, that <hi>the Title</hi> did not oblige <hi>the Book</hi> to Treat of <hi>the True Knowledge of Christ,</hi> nor to acquaint us wherein <hi>our Union to, and Communion with him,</hi> did <hi>really</hi> consist; for, provided, <hi>The Discourse</hi> was managed <hi>concerning</hi> these things, though <hi>in Reproach</hi> of them, or <hi>in Opposition</hi> to them, yet it was enough <hi>to justifie</hi> its Harmony with, and <hi>make good</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105027:4"/>
whatever was explicitly promised in <hi>The Bill of Fare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever my Apprehensions were <hi>about that,</hi> I found <hi>many difficulties</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and <hi>great discouragements</hi> to get over, before I could perswade my self, to give the Author <hi>the Contentment,</hi> or the World <hi>the Trouble,</hi> of this Answer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first and greatest</hi> that presented it self, was, from <hi>my own Inexperience</hi> and <hi>want of skill,</hi> dexterously to handle <hi>the Polemical Saw:</hi> But yet I was help'd over that Block by <hi>a temptation,</hi> that softly whisper'd, I must never hope for <hi>a more encouraging Piece</hi> to enter <hi>a Novice,</hi> or flesh <hi>a junior Disputant.</hi> For though it be not the Priviledge of every one, with the great <hi>Hercules, to strangle Serpents in his Cradle,</hi> yet a Child may serve <hi>to kill Flies,</hi> as well as <hi>the Mighty Domitian.</hi> But I was more daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that <hi>Huffing Confidence,</hi> wherewith he <hi>Hectors</hi> his low-spirited Readers into Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiousness, challenging the whole World, at all Weapons, from the <hi>Spanish Needle</hi> to the <hi>long Pike and upwards;</hi> and yet amongst them all, I felt not the weight of <hi>Goliah's Weavers Beam.</hi> His discourse indeed proceeds <hi>in Cavalcade,</hi> like the Ceremonious Train of <hi>Bernice,</hi>

Pomp and Gallantry, but when I had ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed up so much Courage, as might make me once dare to look his Arguments in the Face, truly I found nothing but <hi>a Gyants skin stuft with straw,</hi> or the Guts of an old Warr-Saddle; such as might well <hi>affright any,</hi> but would <hi>kill no living thing:</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I saw how the <hi>poor terrified Frogs</hi> trembled at the first Appearance of <hi>Iupiters Viceroy Log,</hi> but when they had <hi>retrieved their scattered spirits,</hi> and came to examine <hi>the Reasons of their Consternation,</hi> they soon made <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Object of their Scorn,</hi> which had been so lately the <hi>Cause of their Terrour.</hi> It minded me too of that <hi>little</hi> Policy of the <hi>great Alexander,</hi> who, to impress the Dread of his Name and Arms upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> formed such <hi>a Camp,</hi> that none but the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stradling <hi>Rhodian Colossus</hi> could look over the <hi>Breast-works;</hi> and left such <hi>exalted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> behind him, as would have sterved his own <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> such as must presume <hi>every Horse</hi> in the Army to have been <hi>a Pegasus.</hi> But yet my poor Labours might well plead <hi>a Writ of Ease,</hi> from the <hi>weakness of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,</hi> which would hardly <hi>proselyte any,</hi> but those who were <hi>half-curdled;</hi> nor infect any with that <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb facs="tcp:105027:5"/>
But I consider'd withall, that <hi>weak persons</hi> are mortally <hi>strong</hi> when they encounter <hi>weaker constitutions,</hi> and there are not many who (with <hi>Mithridates</hi>) carry <hi>Antidotes in their Complexion.</hi> This last Age has given us plain demonstration, that <hi>Noyse, Clamour and Confidence,</hi> with <hi>a small sprinckling of Rhetorick,</hi> are Charms able to over-sett <hi>ductile and sequacious Natures;</hi> and the <hi>Eagles complaint</hi> has taught us, that <hi>the Beetles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> ought not to be despised. But I was superseded a while <hi>by a more weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;</hi> That they who <hi>superintend Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Affairs,</hi> would doubtless inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and bestow a deserved Trimming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Book, and make it doe <hi>Penance in its own sheets,</hi> which had so <hi>openly defiled its own Mother,</hi> exposed <hi>her avowed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> but withall it was my Duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that <hi>Non vacat exiguis rebus adesse—Greatness and Smallness,</hi> are <hi>two Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Beings,</hi> which render them <hi>less Visible:</hi> Thus we cannot take a view of <hi>the World,</hi> because it's <hi>too Bulky;</hi> nor of <hi>an Atome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it's <hi>too Minute an Object</hi> for the sight: And possibly from <hi>one of these Accidents</hi> it was, that his Book <hi>walks invisible,</hi> and (as under the Protection of <hi>Gyges his Ring</hi>) has hitherto escaped <hi>the Cognizance of Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105027:6"/>Such were my <hi>Remora's;</hi> but now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those <hi>Inducements</hi> which lay before me, might out-weigh <hi>these Discouragements,</hi> and be sufficient to turn the scale of an <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiz'd Iudgement;</hi> I must leave to the <hi>better judgement</hi> of the impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>And, (1) The <hi>Comprehensiveness</hi> of many of his Errours, called aloud for Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: I saw <hi>the Offices</hi> of Christ, so confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ravelled, and mangled, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to discern <hi>the Acts</hi> of the <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> from those of the <hi>Regal;</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Employment of <hi>either of them,</hi> from that of the <hi>Sacerdotal;</hi> I saw the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Ends of the Death</hi> of Christ, <hi>vacated</hi> and <hi>cashiered;</hi> I saw the <hi>Work of the Holy Spirit</hi> in Regeneration <hi>scorned</hi> and <hi>denyed:</hi> Now the Historian tells us, There were <hi>in uno Caesare decem Marii;</hi> the Ambition of <hi>ten</hi> such as <hi>Marius</hi> in <hi>One Caesar:</hi> And others tell us, that <hi>Serpens cùm Serpentem devorat, sit Draco;</hi> when <hi>a Serpent swallows a Serpent, he becomes a Dragon:</hi> What then could we expect less than <hi>Legion</hi> from the Teeming Womb of such <hi>Big-bellied Monsters?</hi> For though in point <hi>of Argument,</hi> his <hi>Mountain</hi> is often delivered of <hi>a Mouse;</hi> yet in point <hi>of Errour,</hi> his <hi>Mouse</hi> alwayes brings forth <hi>a Mountain.</hi>

after a sort in the other: And our Authors Notion is the very <hi>Pallas</hi> hammer'd out of <hi>their Brains;</hi> the Falshood whereof we shall endeavour to lay open in a few words.

They were Properly distinct Persons who Typified our Lord Jesus Christ in his Offices: <hi>Aaron</hi> was onely a Priest, had a <hi>Priesthood</hi> in him distinct from the <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Prophetical Office;</hi> and it were really an astonishing thing, that <hi>Aaron</hi> should be a real proper High-priest, and bear that Office <hi>distinct</hi> from <hi>all others,</hi> to typifie him, who had the Office but in an <hi>improper,</hi> and that a <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manner in himself;</hi> Nay those Persons in whom <hi>two of these Offices</hi> did meet, yet kept the <hi>Offices in them</hi> distinct; <hi>Melchizedek</hi> acted otherwise when he <hi>enacted Laws</hi> at <hi>Salem,</hi> than he did when he stood <hi>besides the Altar;</hi> though both those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>center'd</hi> in his Person, yet they remained <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> distinct; 3. <hi>The special Acts</hi> of all these Offices are properly distinct in Christ.

The <hi>Objects</hi> of these Offices are distinct: For as the Kingly and Prophetical, have <hi>Men</hi> for their <hi>Objects; Men</hi> are to be <hi>governed</hi> and <hi>instructed;</hi> so the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> hath <hi>God</hi> for its <hi>Object.</hi> Sacrifices are <hi>for</hi> Men, but <hi>unto</hi> God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>For every High-Priest taken from amongst men, is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for sins.</hi> And we may <hi>admire the wisdom</hi> of God in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering matters with <hi>such exactness,</hi> in every <hi>puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> that our Lord Jesus should so <hi>exactly</hi> and <hi>closely answer</hi> this <hi>description,</hi> that <hi>no room</hi> for <hi>cavil</hi> might be left, nor any <hi>creep-hole</hi> for a <hi>witty evasion:</hi> He was <hi>taken from amongst men, ordained for men,</hi> in <hi>things</hi> pertaining <hi>to God,</hi> he <hi>offered Gifts</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> and <hi>for sins</hi> too: And yet in all this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but that the <hi>offices</hi> of Christ however <hi>really</hi> distinct, yet do all <hi>meet</hi> together in <hi>one Person; Moses</hi> his Prophetical Office was <hi>really distinct</hi> from his <hi>Regal Power,</hi> and yet <hi>both met</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Person;</hi> and secondly we own, that all these did meet in their <hi>general</hi> and <hi>common end,</hi> the salvation of all Believers, yet there are <hi>next</hi> and <hi>special ends</hi> very distinct; <hi>enlightning the mind, subduing the will,</hi> and <hi>reconciling us to God,</hi> do really <hi>differ</hi> in

themselves; and thirdly, we grant that it was the same God, who by one and the same Call invested our Lord Jesus Christ in all his Offices, and as there was no moment wherein he was <hi>Iesus,</hi> and not the <hi>Christ,</hi> A <hi>Saviour,</hi> and yet <hi>not authorized</hi> to be so; so we conceive, that there was no moment in which he was a <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>two thirds</hi> of a Christ, and not a <hi>whole Christ;</hi> his Offices being conferred upon him at the same time. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>No man taketh this Honour to himself but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi>

               <q>His preaching the Gospel, (which we commonly call his Prophetical Office) was the Exercise of his Regal Power, in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Laws.</q>

the <hi>Prophetical Office.</hi> They do indeed call it the <hi>Exercise</hi> of that Office, or an <hi>Act</hi> of that Office, but should they <hi>call</hi> it an <hi>Office,</hi> they would <hi>miscall</hi> it miserably; but if <hi>Preaching the Gospel,</hi> be onely <hi>commonly</hi> and not <hi>truely</hi> called (<hi>an Act of</hi>) his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office;</hi> what may we then call it <hi>safely</hi> for the future,. and <hi>escape a chiding?</hi> Why you may <hi>securely venture</hi> to call it the <hi>Exercise of his Regal Power.</hi> In good Time! but how long shall this Protection be in force? Just till you come to <hi>pag.</hi> 18. For there Preaching the Gospel is grown to be an Employment belonging to the Prophetical Office again; <hi>he came to be our Prophet and our Guide, to teach us by his Precepts and his Life.</hi> But his proof is most admirable: 1. Because, <hi>the Gospel is called the Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> Nay, it's <hi>often</hi> called the Kingdom of Heaven, which our Author thinks hugely considerable; but if it were call'd so but <hi>once,</hi> it's enough to command our Faith to what it asserts; but the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>consequence</hi> is that I most am at a loss for. <hi>The Gospel is called the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Preaching the Gospel belongs to Christs Kingly Office.</hi> That <hi>the state of the Gospel,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> or a <hi>Heavenly kingdome,</hi> is out of Question; That Christ is the <hi>Sovereign Lord and Ruler there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> that his <hi>Precepts</hi> are the <hi>Laws</hi> whereby he <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> it, is as little questioned; but that there is no <hi>proper distinct Employment</hi> for a Prophet in this <hi>state or Kingdome,</hi> is flatly denyed. Christ was not onely a <hi>King</hi> to <hi>make</hi> Laws, but a <hi>Prophet</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, promulgate,</hi> and <hi>reveal</hi> those <hi>Laws.</hi> Nay, there is other work for Christ to doe besides <hi>making</hi> of Laws or <hi>promulgating</hi> of them; there are many

As a <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>discovery;</hi> and this is the work of Christ as a <hi>Teacher</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> the <hi>great Praeco,</hi> or <hi>publick Officer</hi> of Heaven, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in the Bosome of the Father from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, came from thence to reveal Gods Will to us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. 2. It may be considered as <hi>powerfully</hi> yet <hi>sweetly prevailing over,</hi> and <hi>subduing</hi> of our <hi>Hearts</hi> to that <hi>revealed Truth,</hi> and this indeed is the work of <hi>Christ as a King;</hi> but this is a Notion for which our Author will give me little thanks; for not being willing to allow any more <hi>power</hi> to Christ, than that of the <hi>Evidence of Truth;</hi> and yet seeing a Necessity to assign <hi>some Employment</hi> or other to Christ <hi>as a King,</hi> he thought it the <hi>safest</hi> course, to Allott it <hi>this Task</hi> rather than none at all, and to make the <hi>Regal</hi> go <hi>shares</hi> with the <hi>Prophetical</hi> office, rather than be quite <hi>cashiered,</hi> and <hi>shut out of Dores.</hi> His next Proof is from <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 37. where (as our Author tells us) Christ tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>he was born to be a King, and the principal Exercise of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power in this World, consists in bearing witness to the Truth.</hi> But they must have <hi>other Bibles</hi> than we have, or however be well skill'd in the <hi>New Device</hi> of <hi>variae Lectiones,</hi> that can see <hi>any such</hi> matter there: Christ asserts himseif to be a King, he <hi>was so,</hi> he <hi>was born so,</hi> but that he was born to be a King, he tells not <hi>Pilate;</hi> all the <hi>strength</hi> of his Argument lyes in a little obvious <hi>piece of Knavery,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, He comes to Attacque the <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> of Christ. <hi>He was</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Kingly Priest.</hi> Well! so he was, and so he might be, and yet though <hi>both the Offices</hi> center'd in his <hi>Person,</hi> they might be <hi>formally distinct</hi> in their <hi>Acts, special Ends,</hi> and <hi>proper Objects;</hi> Nay, we will allow, that All his Offices conspiring in the same <hi>general Ends,</hi> their <hi>Acts</hi> might have <hi>mutual respect,</hi> and give <hi>reciprocal assistance</hi> each to other. And he could not have chosen a fitter Instance than that of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> who being <hi>King of Salem,</hi> and <hi>Priest of the most high God, Heb.</hi> 7. yet would it savour of too gross Absurdity to say, that when he <hi>offered sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>blessed Abraham,</hi> he appeared in the <hi>Quality</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> or when he <hi>enacted Civil Laws,</hi> he bore the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Priest;</hi> but our Authors Proofs are as Pertinent as his Doctrine True: His Doctrine is, <hi>When he offered himself a Sacrifice for sin, he acted like a King,</hi> p. 6. Really one would think he acted as <hi>like a Priest</hi> as we could reasonably desire. For, 1. Here is a <hi>Sacerdotal Act: he offer'd.</hi> 2. A <hi>Sacrifice: Himself.</hi> And, 3. This was <hi>for sin.</hi> And what of <hi>a King</hi> do we spell out of all this? The truth is, there's nothing in all this, but a pitifull <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Iuggle,</hi> who having resolved not to own Christ as a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Priest</hi> at all, and yet not daring to deny <hi>express phrases of Scripture,</hi> found out this Expedient, to own the thing in words, and then to shuffle it off with a Metaphor.

why he should make the <hi>Regal Office</hi> of Christ so <hi>over-top</hi> all the rest; but I soon satisfied my self from <hi>Volkelius,</hi> lib. 3. <hi>de verâ Relig.</hi> p. 41. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè Regibus id habebatur honoris, ut Christi, sive uncti appellarentur, ita ut cum Christum dici audis, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem imprimis dici intelligas.</hi> Kings had chiefly that Honour, that they should be called <hi>Christs,</hi> or <hi>Anoynted ones,</hi> so that when you hear the <hi>Name Christ</hi> mention'd, you must understand, that <hi>a King</hi> is <hi>especially intended.</hi> This I confess quieted me; but why our Author should be <hi>so zealous,</hi> to set up a King of his own making, and then all o'th' sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to pluck him down again, to <hi>enthrone</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne</hi> at pleasure, is at present to me <hi>unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> for I observe, he has removed these great Things from his Kingly Office, and placed them upon another Foundation, <hi>viz. the reward of his death and sufferings.</hi> Now take away <hi>Preaching the Gospel,</hi> from his <hi>Prophetical Office;</hi> subtract <hi>offering himself a Sacrifice,</hi> from his <hi>Sacerdotal Office;</hi> and then <hi>Governing the Church, raising the Dead,</hi> and <hi>judging the World,</hi> &amp;c. from his <hi>Regal Office;</hi> and when you have done, <hi>compute the clear Remainder,</hi> and I suppose at the <hi>foot of the Account,</hi> you will have <hi>three great Cyphers,</hi> without one <hi>poor figure</hi> to give them the least <hi>significancy</hi> or <hi>value.</hi> I know he will say; He does but onely <hi>place</hi> them upon <hi>other Bottomes,</hi> and so long as we find them, what's matter where they <hi>are found.</hi> But then (say I) they will have but a <hi>praecarious station</hi> in any <hi>other</hi> place, and he that removes them from their <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>true grounds,</hi> can with a <hi>wet finger</hi> jostle them from that <hi>false</hi> Basis whereon, out of <hi>meer good Nature,</hi> he had <hi>for a season</hi> set them.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105027:20"/>
But to come closer home to our Author: There are two small faults I charge this Discourse with; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi> and <hi>Falshood:</hi> First, Here's a great deal of <hi>Confusion;</hi> As your old dull Philosophers use to tell us, that Cold did <hi>congregare Heterogenea, Unite things that were of differing Names and Natures;</hi> so has our Author <hi>glazed</hi> over his discourse with Ice, which has <hi>so united things</hi> of <hi>various Natures,</hi> that its hard to find <hi>sure footing</hi> in his <hi>Expressions:</hi> Christ <hi>pardons sin</hi> upon <hi>one Account, governs his Church,</hi> and <hi>raises the Dead</hi> upon <hi>another:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> he does by his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> the other by his <hi>almighty power.</hi> And yet some of these things, in <hi>one respect,</hi> belong to <hi>one</hi> Office of Christ, and some of them to <hi>another:</hi> he <hi>purchases</hi> Grace <hi>as a Priest,</hi> he <hi>dispenses</hi> and <hi>gives forth</hi> that Grace <hi>as a King;</hi> he <hi>offers Sacrifice</hi> for sin as our <hi>High-priest;</hi> yet he <hi>applyes the pardon of sin</hi> to us, <hi>as a King:</hi> But, Secondly, I find as much <hi>Falshood</hi> as Confusion in these Expressions; and that, 1. In denying that these are truely appropriated to Christs <hi>kingly</hi> Office. For if <hi>Governing the Church, raising the Dead, Iudging the World,</hi> do not <hi>speak a king,</hi> never talk more of a Kingly Office in Christ, but make that <hi>Metaphorical too,</hi> as you make the rest, and so the Tree is cut up by the roots. 2. In that these are assigned only as <hi>the Reward of his Death and Suf ferings.</hi> For we find Christ invested with an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>execute,</hi> and <hi>actually executing</hi> these Powers <hi>before his Death,</hi> saving in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two particulars,</hi> where the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> did <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>compleat exercise</hi> of them <hi>at that time.</hi> It may be worth the while to run over the particulars. (1) <hi>For governing the Church;</hi> he gave <hi>Laws</hi> to it,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105027:20"/>
set up <hi>new Institutions of Worship</hi> for it; <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to continue <hi>to the end of the World; sent out his Apostles</hi> to preach the Gospel, and we have good and sufficient warrant for it, under our Authors own hand, just on the other side of the Leaf, <hi>That his preaching the Gospel, was the exercise of his Regal Power and Authority in publishing his Laws.</hi> (2) <hi>For sending his Spirit,</hi> that is, in an <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way</hi> pouring out the gifts of Miracles; 'tis true, the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>abundant effusion</hi> of these Gifts was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> for the <hi>day,</hi> when the <hi>Son of Man should be glorified:</hi> Yet it is clear beyond Contradiction, that Christ had the Power, and delegated the Power too before his death; The Gift of speaking with Tongues there was no need of, and Christ never used to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> without <hi>an extraordinary</hi> and pressing <hi>Reason;</hi> The Apostles were sent to their <hi>own</hi> Countrey-men, and could dispatch their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> and <hi>deliver their Message</hi> in their Vernacular and <hi>Mother-tongue, Math.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Goe ye not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any of the Cities of the Samaritans enter ye not; but goe rather to the lost Sheep of the house of Israel:</hi> But as to <hi>other</hi> miraculous Operations of the Holy Spirit, he had Authority to make it over to others, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Heal the sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the Dead, cast out Devils;</hi> Nay the Seventy Disciples had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power in their Commission, as it appears, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 17. <hi>And the Seventy returned again with joy, saying, Even the Devils are subject to us through thy Name.</hi> That is, We produced thy warrant and authority, and the very Devils could not resist it. (3) <hi>As to forgiveness of sins,</hi> there needs no other proof that Christ <hi>had the power,</hi> than that he <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105027:21"/>
it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee.</hi> I know there are some who will allow Christ a Power to forgive sins, even <hi>here on Earth;</hi> but then it's such an odde kind of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as never was heard of; <hi>Volkel.</hi> lib. 3. <hi>de verâ Relig.</hi> cap. 21. <hi>Non diffitemur quidem eum (viz.</hi> Christum) <hi>cùm in terris degerit, divinissimâ potentiâ praeditum fuisse, quam ipse peccatorum in terrâ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donandorum, id est, terrena ab hominibus supplicia, propulsandi potestatem appellat.</hi> We deny not that Christ even when he was upon Earth, had a most divine power, which he calls a Power to forgive sins, that is, to drive away from men temporal and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily punishments. A very liberal concession truly; <hi>to cure a Fever or an Ague,</hi> must be <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> when these mens Necessities require it should be so. (4) That Christ did <hi>dispense Grace</hi> and <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral assistances,</hi> at <hi>any</hi> time, we are glad to hear owned, and as sorry that they vanish again into smoke, and nothing, when our Author is out of the good Mood; but let them signifie what he will, for once, he dispensed them before his death, <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Errour and Ignorance, destroy'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkness by the brightness of his Appearing, erected a Throne in the Hearts and Consciences of men, by the power and evidence of Truth.</hi> And I suppose he will allow Christ to do no more now he is risen from the dead. (5) That Christ <hi>raised the Dead,</hi> needs no other Confirmation, than to call over the <hi>Instances</hi> of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the <hi>Widows Son of Naim,</hi> the <hi>daughter of Iairus;</hi> but whether he did it with, or without Authority, I list not to dispute till I hear the Gentleman endeavour to disprove it. (6) That he <hi>answer'd Prayers</hi> will need no proof;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105027:21"/>
I think it would puzzle the most froward Caviller to instance in <hi>one Case,</hi> where-ever he denyed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to any, that with Faith or Importunity craved it for themselves or others: (7) That the power to <hi>judge the World,</hi> was committed to him, we have his own words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>The Father hath given him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of Man.</hi> And the ground of this Power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with him, is not assigned because he had <hi>merited it by his death and sufferings,</hi> but because he was the <hi>Son of Man.</hi> And though it be true, that the General Judgement be yet <hi>to come,</hi> yet Christ was furnisht with ample Power to execute it, whenever it <hi>should come.</hi> Say the same of his <hi>bestowing immortal Life on all his Disciples:</hi> Now concerning all these, it is acknowledged once for all, that though he had the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Radical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the <hi>plenary Commission</hi> to <hi>put in Execution</hi> all these matters, during the state of his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and in some <hi>pregnant particulars</hi> did accordingly <hi>exert</hi> and <hi>put</hi> forth that Authority, yet the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> the <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> of his Acting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, was in much <hi>wisdom suited</hi> to that <hi>dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> wherein he was to appear in the <hi>form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> The more <hi>illustrious, august,</hi> and <hi>solemn exercising</hi> thereof being reserved for the <hi>State of Exaltation,</hi> when he should <hi>Appear</hi> like <hi>himself,</hi> cast off the Cloud which had <hi>eclipsed</hi> the <hi>rayes</hi> of his <hi>Deity,</hi> and sit down <hi>on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3ly, I must repeat my charge of <hi>Falshood</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Doctrine, in that he sayes, <hi>All this is called his Intercession,</hi> p. 6. That <hi>Government of the Church, Raising the Dead, Judging the world,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105027:22"/>
should be called Christs <hi>Intercession,</hi> looks as like Non-sence, as ever I saw any thing in my life. For Intercession has God for its Object; as Intercessor he deals with his Father, though on the behalf of Men, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, and he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> I should wonder to hear, that an Advocates Office should be to plead with <hi>his Clyent,</hi> and not <hi>with</hi> and <hi>before the Iudge,</hi> on the <hi>behalf of his Clyent:</hi> but because Intercession is the <hi>other</hi> great <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Sacerdotal Office,</hi> and some are deeply concerned, that he should not offer up a <hi>Proper sacrifice</hi> to God, they judge it Reason, that one part of the same Office should not fare better than the other: The High-Priest under the Law, when he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Sacrifice upon the Altar, upon the Feast of Expiation, he goes into the Holy place, with the blood, carrying on his Breast and on his shoulders the Names of the twelve Tribes, to signifie that he went in to intercede with God for the whole Church; what He did <hi>typically,</hi> Christ has done <hi>really, Hebr.</hi> 9. 12. for when he had <hi>obtained eternal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us</hi> by his blood, he goes <hi>to Heaven,</hi> there <hi>to Appear</hi> before <hi>his Father</hi> and <hi>our Father, his God,</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> on our behalf, and this is <hi>indeed</hi> called <hi>his Intercession;</hi> the benefits we have thereby, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>some</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of <hi>those</hi> things <hi>before</hi> mention'd; but I think it's reasonable to distinguish between <hi>a thing</hi> and its <hi>proper effects</hi> and <hi>fruits:</hi> but these are nothing but the <hi>Socinian Coleworts,</hi> twenty times <hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105027:23"/>
till we see <hi>stronger Engines</hi> to unfix the Notion of it. Hitherto of the Nature of Christs Offices, which he sayes is a <hi>true Account of his Mediatory king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> but, I say, it's the most <hi>false, absurd,</hi> and <hi>Idle account</hi> that ever was given by any but our Author and <hi>his partizans</hi> of the <hi>Socinian misbelief,</hi> and is neither reconcileable <hi>with the Truth,</hi> nor with it self, one instance whereof we have in this last Paragraph. <hi>That</hi> (sayes he) <hi>to which we commonly appropriate the Name of Regal power,</hi> is <hi>his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: Commonly</hi> indeed, but not <hi>truely</hi> so called; and yet in the close, he tells you, <hi>that Intercession signifies the Administration of a Kingdom,</hi> which how it should <hi>doe,</hi> and not pertain to his <hi>kingly Office,</hi> I cannot make out.</p>
            <p>And now from the <hi>Nature</hi> of Christs Kingdome, he proceeds to the <hi>method</hi> of erecting it. 1. <hi>He conquers the minds of men by the power of his Word and Spirit, and reduces them to subjection to God.</hi> 2. Then <hi>he pardons their sin:</hi> 3. <hi>He raiseth them to Immortal Life:</hi> 4. <hi>This is done by the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sacrifice, and that Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is founded on it.</hi> Of which supposed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of Christs procedure, because abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant occasion will be offered for its Consideration in the ensuing Discourse, I shall <hi>supersede</hi> any <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Disquisition at present.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader does not forget whereabouts he is, and what our Authors operofe Endeavours have design'd; it is to prove, That <hi>Christ is Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Name of an Office,</hi> and fearing that none would bestow the pains to <hi>confute him,</hi> he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to save the world that Labour, and <hi>confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And this is the Interpretation of the Name</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105027:24"/>
               <hi>Christ, which signifies a mediatory King, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed by God to that Office,</hi> p. 7. Be it therefore Reported to the Judgements of all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, Whether <hi>a Mediatory King,</hi> be a <hi>Person</hi> or a <hi>Thing:</hi> an <hi>Office,</hi> or an <hi>Officer?</hi> So large a <hi>Dose of Milk</hi> had he given us, and now has kickt it all fairly down again with his foot: Indeed we had complained before that he favour'd us not with one Text of Scripture to establish his Notion; But 'twas not out of <hi>Penury,</hi> but <hi>Plenty,</hi> and that it seems made him <hi>Poor,</hi> For <hi>thus</hi> (sayes he) <hi>the Name Christ signifies in those places of Scripture where Iesus is said to be the Christ,</hi> i. e. <hi>that Messias whom God promis'd to send.</hi> So that all the further trouble the Reader is like to have from me in this matter, is to advise with himself, Whether, <hi>He, the Messias whom</hi> God promised to send, be the one or the other; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether God promised an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> which like the Popish <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> should <hi>hang in the Aire</hi> without their <hi>proper Subjects,</hi> or <hi>Mahomets Tombe;</hi> or else a <hi>real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son even Iesus the Mediator between God and Man,</hi> furnished with those Offices of <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> to save us in <hi>turning away every one of us from our Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Though Christ is Originally the Name of an Office, yet it is used in Scripture to signifie the Person who is invested with this Office.</hi> It would tempt a man to enquire, what that <hi>original use</hi> of the word is, which is opposed to the <hi>Scripture use.</hi> In some <hi>Original</hi> or <hi>other</hi> it's the <hi>Name of an Office;</hi> and that can be no other but the <hi>Originals</hi> of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Volkelius, Crellius,</hi> and other of the <hi>same bran;</hi> however we are infinitely his Debtors for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,

               </gap>t now, <hi>The places were so many and so obvious that he needed not name them,</hi> for the other use of the word. But I see it's not wisdom to be too hasty to own a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before we be sure on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t, for no man more <hi>reall</hi> when he <hi>offers an Injury,</hi> nor more <hi>complemental</hi> in his <hi>Courtesies;</hi> for he's just now standing upon a Tack. <hi>Before his Designation to this Office was publickly owned, he was onely called Iesus, the Name given him by the Angel, before he was born, yet when by his Resurrection from the Dead he was declared with power to be the Son, and the Christ of God, Christ became his Proper Name, as Iesus was before.</hi> It may create a suspicion in some jealous heads, that our Author does insinuate Jesus to <hi>become the Son of God,</hi> as he became the <hi>Christ of God;</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bears date in our <hi>Authors Chronology, from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Resurrection,</hi> but Suspicions ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice no man. To his confident Assertion, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this <hi>blessed Person</hi> of whom we speak, was called <hi>Christ,</hi> without any reference to <hi>mens owning</hi> or <hi>not owning</hi> of him; nor could he <hi>claim</hi> to be <hi>owned</hi> by men as the <hi>Christ of God,</hi> unless he had <hi>been so,</hi> even the Christ, before such <hi>claim;</hi> he was therefore <hi>owned,</hi> because he was <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> so, and not <hi>subsequently called Christ</hi> because Men had <hi>owned him:</hi> It were strange indeed that he should hold his Name upon so ticklish a Tenure as that, <hi>Advoluntatem Populi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he was owned to be the Christ of God <hi>before</hi> his <hi>Rsurrection from the dead,</hi> not so <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>universally,</hi> but yet as <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly;</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:105027:25"/>
Nay, all that owned him to be <hi>Iesus, a Saviour</hi> from sin, owned him be to <hi>the Christ Anointed</hi> of God, that he <hi>might be a Saviour:</hi> They that deny'd him to be <hi>the Christ,</hi> deny'd him to be <hi>a Iesus;</hi> for what firm Footing could Faith have to believe him to be <hi>a Saviour,</hi> had he not brought his <hi>Credentials</hi> along with him, that he was <hi>sent of God,</hi> for that End, a Terme of the same <hi>Import</hi> with that of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Christ of God</hi> was as truly his <hi>Proper Name,</hi> as <hi>Iesus:</hi> These with many others, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting still the <hi>same Person,</hi> though under <hi>divers Considerations:</hi> Jesus was his Name, expressing the <hi>General end</hi> for which he came into the World: <hi>Immanuel</hi> was his Name, denoting the <hi>Union of God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same Person: Mediator</hi> was his Name, as signifying the two Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom he was to stand, and whom he was to Reconcile; and <hi>Christ</hi> was his Name too, as Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the Authority he had from his Father, to Accomplish the Work of Saving, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Angels foretelling his Name to be Jesus, makes not that to have the Advantage of the other Appellations of Christ: Seeing he was made <hi>The Christ,</hi> by the <hi>Father Himself,</hi> and yet we have the Suffrage of an Angel too, that he was <hi>Born</hi> the Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Unto you is Born this day a Saviour, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>which is Christ the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. As sadly out is our Author to say, that <hi>in the Gospels he is alwayes called Iesus:</hi> Which, whether you take it <hi>Exclusively,</hi> as shutting out the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Inclusively,</hi> taking in the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:105027:25"/>
is apparently False, and needs nothing but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pair of Spectacles for its Confutation: But the stress of all this Pother lying here, that he was not called Christ as by his Proper Name, till after the Resurrection, we shall call over a few of many places in the New Testament to Evince the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 25. The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Common Fame,</hi> and a generally <hi>received Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> that he that should acquaiut them with the Will of God, was <hi>to be called Christ. I know that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah cometh, which is called Christ, and when he is come, he will tell us all things.</hi> And our Saviour would not suffer her to hang in Suspense about the Person, who was so well Satisfied about his Name, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, but presently Answers, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>I that speak to thee, am He:</hi> The poor Woman glad at the News, and loth to Rejoyce alone, Proclaims it in the Streets, and speaking in their own <hi>known Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect,</hi> says she: <hi>Is not this the Christ?</hi> ver. 29.

greater Heresies on Earth, than in Hell: Nor shall I insist upon that of <hi>the Souldiers,</hi> who took it for granted that he was commonly Distinguisht by the <hi>Name Christ, Mat.</hi> 16. 68. <hi>Prophesie unto us, thou Christ, who it is that smote thee.</hi> But Christs own Testimony must pass, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. 10. <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your Master even Christ, and all ye are Brethren; neither be ye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Master, for one is your Master, even Christ.</hi> A huge Bussle there has been about this place, and our Authors Evidence had it been Subpoened in, would have struck the Business dead, <hi>One is your Master, even an Office:</hi> And now will you hear a Facetious and Merry Reason, why <hi>He is alwayes called Iesus in the Gospels, which contain the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of his Life and Death,</hi> p. 8. <hi>Because</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) <hi>all this time it was Disputed, whether He were the Christ or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Disputes indeed the Devil has raised about the Lord Jesus, some will dare to Dispute it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He be <hi>very God or not,</hi> others whether He be the <hi>Christ of God or not?</hi> And not a few, whether he offered himself a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> upon the Cross, to <hi>an offended God</hi> for sin; so that if Christ must never be owned till <hi>all Disputes</hi> be ended, we must <hi>Prorogue his Naming,</hi> till the <hi>coming of Elias:</hi> The World was then as 'tis now; which would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be Disputing things in themselves Indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Disputed</hi> then his Name was <hi>before his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> and so has been ever since, by <hi>Infidels;</hi> and <hi>by those who Believed,</hi> neither <hi>Disputed before nor after.</hi> I have heard of a great Dispute of late amongst Persons of great Learning, about the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of an <hi>Appearance in Philosophy,</hi> when one of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105027:26"/>
the Company, wiser it seems than his Neighbours, gravely Counselled them, to Examine more Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, whether indeed the Thing were so <hi>in Fact or no;</hi> before they did beat their Brains about giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reason why it should be so: His Advice was hearkned to, and upon severe Scrutiny, they had been Arguing about a <hi>Non-entity.</hi> Thus it had become our Authors <hi>Excellencie</hi> to have shewn <hi>that it is,</hi> before he came to flie so high, at the <hi>Why it is?</hi> But it seems the Matter was not weighty, whether he were <hi>the Christ</hi> or not; it being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by our <hi>Authors</hi> own <hi>Licenser,</hi> that <hi>whatever is Disputable is inconsiderable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Christ signifies the Gospel and Religion of Christ: As Moses signifies the Writings, and Law of Moses, and the Prophets the Writings of the Prophets.</hi> Hold, good Sir, Create your self no further Trouble, we will grant you <hi>more</hi> than you <hi>con Prove,</hi> even <hi>as much</hi> as you <hi>Demand,</hi> that we may purchase our Peace. And that, <hi>in Common Speech, Christ</hi> may signifie <hi>his Laws</hi> by much strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Reasons, than <hi>Moses</hi> can signifie his <hi>Laws:</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> was but a <hi>Servant</hi> in His <hi>Masters House,</hi> but Christ a <hi>Son</hi> in and over his <hi>own House;</hi> Christ was the <hi>Law Maker, Moses</hi> only an <hi>Instrument</hi> for their <hi>Promulgation,</hi> and <hi>Execution.</hi> But then it must be Remembred withal, 1. That the Name <hi>Moses</hi> signifies <hi>Originally, Properly,</hi> and <hi>Primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the <hi>Person of Moses,</hi> the <hi>very Man Moses,</hi> and only <hi>Obliquely, Secondarily, Figuratively,</hi> or (as your great Friend <hi>Vol.</hi> has it) <hi>Analogico, Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toque dicendi genere; the Doctrine, Writings, Laws of Moses.</hi> 2. That when we meet with a word that has a <hi>Proper,</hi> and an <hi>Improper;</hi> a <hi>First</hi> and a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105027:27"/>
               <hi>Second;</hi> a <hi>Plain</hi> and a <hi>Tropical</hi> signification, we always let that <hi>Proper, Plain,</hi> and <hi>Primary signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> take the <hi>Wall,</hi> and have the <hi>Upper hand</hi> of the <hi>Improper, Tropical,</hi> and <hi>Second-hand</hi> sence; all ways provided, that no <hi>Cogent Inexorable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> taken from the Circumstances of the Place, do Oblige to the Contrary. 3. We must well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what our Author Claims, and what we Grant: That <hi>it's usual, nothing more usual, in Common Speech, than to call any Laws or Religion, by the Name of the first Authors:</hi> In <hi>Common Speech</hi> then this <hi>holds;</hi> for if he will lay the Weight or Stress of any <hi>Disputable Point</hi> upon it, that the word is so used <hi>in Scripture,</hi> we must beg his Pardon, and desire him to hold us Excused, unless he can Prove it by Convincing Arguments; and we lay down this Protestation before-hand, that we shall not take <hi>High mounted Confidence,</hi> nor <hi>Imperious Dictates,</hi> nor <hi>Hungry jejune Glosses</hi> for <hi>Apodictick</hi> in the Case: The rather, because we are ascertained that the Name Christ does <hi>Properly, Primarily, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> nay, <hi>Generally</hi> express a <hi>Person in Office;</hi> and if our Author will needs have it signifie, or <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Gospel,</hi> or any <hi>Living thing else in all the World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But we attend his Evidence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>In Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision, but a new Creature. That is, in the Gospel, and Religion of Christ, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is of any Value to Recommend as to the favour</hi>

               <hi>of God, but a new Nature, a Holy, and vertuous Life,</hi> p. 9.</p>
            <p>To which Gloss, I oppose two small Incoveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies: First, The <hi>Uncertainty.</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Apparent falshood</hi> of it. First, If there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to Disparage it, its <hi>Uncertainty</hi> is enough; for its merely <hi>Precarious,</hi> that Christ must signifie so here: If any has the Confidence to deny it, though never so <hi>faintly,</hi> the Cause is <hi>utterly blown up;</hi> our <hi>Negative</hi> upon him, puts him to <hi>Eternal si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> When our Author is hard beset at any time, he has one Answer ready <hi>Cut and Dried,</hi> which serves for every Text in the Scripture: as <hi>pag.</hi> 261. <hi>It is a sufficient Answer to this, to say, they need not signifie so.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> will <hi>suffice him,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must be glad to be <hi>sufficed with,</hi> he's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd: But why not the Common Gloss? <hi>In the Account of Jesus Christ,</hi> Circumcision, nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision avail nothing, but, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Probabilities lie on this side: First, The <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words,</hi> whereof this Verse is rendred as a <hi>Reason,</hi> do unquestionably speak of a <hi>Person, ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And now comes in this Verse as a Reason or Proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>For in Christ Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. Did the Apostles Premises speak of one thing, and his Conclusion of another? 2. Here's this lies in the way, that <hi>no Cogent Reason</hi> can be assigned why we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the <hi>Plain, Ordinary, Primary accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Word Christ, for a <hi>Figurative, Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>Secondary acceptation,</hi> but only to humour our Author; for which at present I am not in the Mood. 3. He is miserably short in <hi>his Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for after all his pains to prove that Christ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105027:28"/>
               <hi>an Office,</hi> a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> a <hi>Church;</hi> he must go over with all this again, and prove that <hi>Jesus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and Jesus a <hi>Church,</hi> or else he's just in <hi>Statu quo.</hi> For he had told us before, that (though Christ was an <hi>Homonymous word,</hi> a Name, of <hi>Desuetory, Lubricous,</hi> and <hi>Versatile sound</hi>) Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was his <hi>Proper Name, given him by the Angel before he was Born;</hi> and therefore surely that has not been <hi>Warped,</hi> and <hi>Twisted,</hi> and <hi>Scrued,</hi> at that Rate that this <hi>other poor Name</hi> has been; for as it falls out unhappily. Here's <hi>Jesus</hi> joyned with <hi>Christ,</hi> and that perswades us almost, that a <hi>very Person</hi> is intended.</p>
            <p>But yet secondly, The apparent Falshood of it sticks more with me than all this, I could easily down with a few Absurdities: For I think, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve according to the Scripture, That there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing besides a <hi>Vertuous Life</hi> of value to <hi>Recommend us</hi> to the <hi>Favour of God;</hi> nay, something <hi>more of Value</hi> (and <hi>I</hi> shall not be Hector'd out of it by Blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering words:) 'Tis the Righteousness of Jesus which <hi>I</hi> mean, and we have the Apostles Warrant for it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the Beloved. If</hi> God should enter into Judgment with us according to the Exactest of our Obedience, perhaps we should be willing to accept of <hi>Christ's Recommendation to the favour of God,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our most <hi>vertuous Lives,</hi> but secondly, I indite it of Falshood, that he makes a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>a vertuous Life,</hi> equivalent Expressions: For I had thought that a <hi>vertuous Life</hi> is but the <hi>Fruit</hi> that <hi>Grows</hi> on the <hi>Tree,</hi> but the <hi>Tree</hi> must be <hi>made good,</hi> e're the <hi>Fruit</hi> can be <hi>so; A vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life</hi> the <hi>Streams,</hi> that <hi>flow</hi> from the <hi>Spring</hi> of

the <hi>new Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> must be <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> e're the <hi>Streams</hi> will <hi>be so:</hi> In plain Terms, the vertuous Life is but the <hi>Result</hi> of a <hi>new Heart,</hi> the product of a <hi>Renewed Nature;</hi> without which Principle of a vertuous Life, and without Christ to Recommend both to God, there is no hope to find <hi>favour</hi> in <hi>his sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His second place is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Traditions of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Christ.

            <p>The Reader has seen by this time, that his <hi>first Notion</hi> of Christ is <hi>false,</hi> his <hi>second</hi> onely <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily True,</hi> his <hi>third</hi> very <hi>questionable,</hi> and the <hi>fourth unproved,</hi> and if it <hi>had been proved</hi> would not have done his work; and now it's high time to draw with him towards a Conclusion.

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of what use the Consideration of Christs Person is, in the Christian Religion.</head>
            <p>IN the <hi>Entrance</hi> of this Chapter, I observe our Author is <hi>feelingly concern'd</hi> to <hi>amove</hi> from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the <hi>sinister suspition</hi> of a <hi>Design to render Christ useless.</hi> And he makes a <hi>solemn Protestation,</hi> not onely of <hi>his own</hi> Innocency, but is ready to <hi>become Surety</hi> and <hi>Compurgator</hi> for <hi>all his Accomplices. A design</hi> (sayes he) <hi>which I confess I am wholly a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to, as I believe all those are, who are so much charged with it.</hi> When we hear a man <hi>zealously purging</hi> himself of some <hi>Notorious Crime,</hi> noysed abroad onely <hi>in the general,</hi> without <hi>praevious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation;</hi> it's apt to <hi>fly-blow</hi> our Heads with <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi> he may be <hi>Tardy;</hi> an <hi>over-forward Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> being reputed more than half an <hi>Accusation.</hi> But I dare be one of his <hi>Twelve-Godfathers</hi> in this matter, that he does not <hi>make Christ useless;</hi> but will allow him to be of <hi>some use,</hi> that is to say, that Christ is good for <hi>something,</hi> and in effect, a little <hi>Better than,</hi> though <hi>next to</hi> Nothing; and I can with more security become <hi>Bound</hi> for Him, because he has given me good <hi>Counter-security,</hi> that I shall not <hi>forfeit</hi> my <hi>Recognizance. P. 330. I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perswade my self</hi> (no not for your heart, though you had attempted it) <hi>that the perfect Obèdience</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:105027:36"/>
               <hi>and Righteousness of His Life was wholly excluded. So that whatever rendred Christ beloved of God, contributed</hi> something <hi>to our Acceptation.</hi> P. 331. <hi>We ought not to think that we receive</hi> No Benefit <hi>by the Righteousness of Christ.</hi> And I hope <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> is better than <hi>Nothing.</hi> Nay, (such is his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) he can be content to Allow, that God was somewhat <hi>more pleased with the Obedience of Christ, than the Faith of Abraham.</hi> ibid. And that <hi>his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was of greater value, than the Blood of Bulls and Goats,</hi> p. 19. Naughty men are they then, that wrong <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> so, as to insinuate that they design'd to make <hi>Christ useless,</hi> the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they proceed upon so bad a Ground. <hi>We are charg'd with making Christ useless, onely because we dare not make his Laws so;</hi> And thus it seems they have <hi>unhandsomely</hi> payd him in his <hi>own Coyn,</hi> who charges them with making <hi>his Laws</hi> Useless, <hi>onely</hi> because they dare not make his <hi>Person</hi> so. And yet to deal plainly with Him, for all this, I find a <hi>Double charge upon the File</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>(1) That though he has not made <hi>Christ</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Useless,</hi> yet he has made him <hi>Needless.</hi> Though he can <hi>use Him,</hi> yet he could have <hi>spared him;</hi> though he can make a <hi>shift with him,</hi> he could have made a <hi>Rubbing shift without</hi> Him. <hi>Ut tecum possum vivere, sic sine te.</hi> So <hi>p. 46. I should rather have thought that Gods requiring such a sacrifice as the Death of Christ, was not because he could not do otherwise.</hi> And if <hi>Gods Iustice</hi> could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented without that <hi>sacrifice,</hi> I may presume it shall not <hi>stick</hi> at our Authors <hi>good Nature,</hi> p. 43. <hi>Had Christ never appeared in the World, yet we had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that God is thus Wise and Good,</hi> viz. <hi>to</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105027:37"/>
               <hi>Pardon sinners.</hi> And (as he labours to Prove) <hi>Enoch, Noah, Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who knew <hi>nothing at all of Christ,</hi> p. 44. yet understood <hi>God to be a God pardoning iniquity</hi> without him: And surely if the <hi>World jogg'd on</hi> for <hi>four thousand</hi> years <hi>without Christ,</hi> it might have <hi>worn out</hi> the <hi>Remainder with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him</hi> too.</p>
            <p>(2) I find a <hi>second Charge</hi> against him: That though he make not <hi>Christ useless,</hi> as to some <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ordinary</hi> and <hi>general Ends,</hi> which might have been <hi>attain'd,</hi> and <hi>reach'd without him;</hi> yet he renders him <hi>wholly Useless</hi> as to those <hi>special,</hi> those <hi>main</hi> and <hi>glorious purposes</hi> for which <hi>he came into the World:</hi> The <hi>making satisfaction</hi> to <hi>Divine Iustice,</hi> the <hi>Imputation of his Righteousness to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> his <hi>powerfull and effectual sanctifying</hi> them by <hi>his Spirit</hi> for <hi>whom</hi> he <hi>undertook.</hi> Whereof we shall meet with <hi>abundant Evidence</hi> in the <hi>progress</hi> of his <hi>Discourse.</hi> So that a <hi>Declaration</hi> contrary to the <hi>Fact,</hi> is of <hi>small weight</hi> with <hi>considering Readers,</hi> and <hi>sinks</hi> it self below all <hi>consideration.</hi> But to return: <hi>Two things</hi> fill up <hi>this Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, That the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> is of <hi>some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;</hi> and Secondly, That the <hi>consideration of his Person</hi> is of <hi>some use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> onely the difficulty to be assoyled by His Abilities, is, Of <hi>what use, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his Person should be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[1.] Then, the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> is of <hi>some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;</hi> but e're he ventures upon that <hi>Province,</hi> he bethought Himself it would be <hi>a Task</hi> worthy his <hi>great Parts,</hi> to <hi>indoctrinate</hi> our <hi>Plumbeous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebrosities</hi> in the <hi>Nice Point, What the Person of Christ is?</hi> P. 15. <hi>By the Person of Christ I mean, what all men ought to mean,</hi> (nay there's no doubt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105027:37"/>
of that; All men at their <hi>utmost Peril</hi> ought to mean, to <hi>a hairs breadth,</hi> just as our Author means) <hi>Christ Himself.</hi> Had it not been <hi>a Prodigy</hi> as great as ever was in the World, if by <hi>Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had been meant <hi>any body else?</hi> Such then is Christ's Person. The Consideration thereof follows: <hi>And</hi> (as he assures us) <hi>the onely proper considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here is the Greatness of his Person;</hi> This is the <hi>onely,</hi> or however, <hi>The onely Proper,</hi> or at least the <hi>onely Proper consideration here;</hi> whatever <hi>other improper considerations</hi> of it there may be <hi>in other places,</hi> or <hi>cases,</hi> upon <hi>other accounts,</hi> or <hi>occasions,</hi> at <hi>other times,</hi> it skills not; for <hi>Here,</hi> at <hi>this Time,</hi> and in <hi>this place,</hi> the <hi>onely Proper</hi> Consideration is the <hi>Greatness of his Person.</hi> And yet methinks, the <hi>exceeding loveliness</hi> of his Person, standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>lost Sinners;</hi> his <hi>laying down his Life as a Ransome payd to God,</hi> his standing as <hi>a Surety</hi> in <hi>our stead,</hi> his <hi>bearing our sins in his Body on the Cross,</hi> might have <hi>claimed</hi> a Place, and <hi>come in for a share in our consideration</hi> of his Person. But thus much for that.</p>
            <p>[2] The <hi>Use of this consideration</hi> follows. And some good Use he has assign'd it.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>And first, it's a plain demonstration of Gods love to Mankind, that he sent so dear, and so great a Person into the World, as his onely begotten Son, to save Sinners.</hi> It is so indeed, but a very <hi>weak demonstration of Gods Love</hi> to <hi>his own Son,</hi> to send him into the World, to grapple with all those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series he met withall in <hi>his Soul,</hi> in <hi>his Body,</hi> from <hi>Enemies,</hi> from <hi>Friends,</hi> from <hi>Men,</hi> from <hi>Devils;</hi> nay, from <hi>himself,</hi> whom <hi>it pleased to bruise him, and lay upon him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> to <hi>make</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:105027:38"/>
               <hi>his soul an Offering for sin,</hi> nay, to be <hi>made sin</hi> for them, <hi>who</hi> himself <hi>knew none,</hi> to Die <hi>a cursed Death,</hi> and all this without <hi>any Absolute,</hi> or <hi>Indispensible necessity: Contrary</hi> to all the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Decorum; Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice Nodus incide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And it would be <hi>of use</hi> to consider also the <hi>Love of Christ,</hi> his Willingness to <hi>Accept the Terms</hi> of being a Redeemer, though He knew well they were <hi>severe,</hi> and would cost him <hi>Sweat,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and yet He cheerfully <hi>Undertook, Underwent,</hi> and <hi>went through</hi> with them. He voluntarily <hi>assumed a Body,</hi> that He might become a <hi>Sacrifice, Heb.</hi> 10. He was willingly for a <hi>little while, made lower than the Angels</hi> by Dispensation, who was above them by Nature, <hi>for the suffering of Death,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. He understood well the <hi>Debtor</hi> was <hi>Insolvent,</hi> and yet he became <hi>Surety;</hi> He knew well the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God,</hi> and yet He was ready to put in <hi>sufficient Caution,</hi> to <hi>Declare his Righteousness,</hi> to <hi>Clear,</hi> and <hi>Vindicate</hi> it, <hi>that God might be Iust, and the Iustifier of them that should believe in Him,</hi> Rom. 3. 25, 26. These things would have had their Use; but alas, <hi>this Head</hi> was brought in <hi>by the Shoulders,</hi> only to make way for more of our Authors <hi>excellent Theology. Religion</hi> is the <hi>Theam</hi> he has <hi>singled out</hi> to practise upon; and he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it first <hi>in General,</hi> and then in its <hi>particular Species.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) For <hi>Religion in General. 'Tis founded</hi> (says he) <hi>on a belief that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. That this is <hi>a Postulatum,</hi> somewhat to be <hi>presupposed</hi> in <hi>all Religion,</hi> is easily <hi>granted;</hi> and and no more can be <hi>necessarily inferred</hi> from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105027:38"/>
Place. All Religion does suppose the <hi>Existence of God,</hi> and that it is not in vain to seek Him: But if hence our Author would conclude, that <hi>nothing more</hi> is required as a Foundation for <hi>Sinners</hi> to Build their hopes of <hi>Acceptation with God,</hi> in their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> to him, and <hi>Service</hi> of him; he <hi>gathers</hi> what the Apostle <hi>strewed not,</hi> and <hi>Reaps what,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>where he Sowed not.</hi> There are no <hi>Infidels</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> the <hi>Devils believe God to Be,</hi> and <hi>Tremble</hi> at their <hi>own Belief,</hi> wishing they could <hi>perswade themselves,</hi> what they have <hi>perswaded others,</hi> that there is no God: They know too that God is a <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> and yet they have <hi>no Foundation</hi> to come to God. A <hi>despairing Cain,</hi> a <hi>self-condemned Iudas</hi> may know this to be <hi>a Truth,</hi> and yet not seeing a <hi>Mediator,</hi> through whom they may <hi>securely come,</hi> and <hi>find Acceptation</hi> in their <hi>seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Him, they <hi>dare not,</hi> they <hi>have no ground</hi> to come; but if this be in very Deed the Foundation of all Religion, why durst not our Author <hi>Trust</hi> to it, but flie (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to his <hi>Tutissimum est</hi>) to the Lord Jesus Christ: For, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. He freely tells us, <hi>That the Foundation of his Hope, is that which is the Foundation of the Christian Religion, the Sacrifice and Intercession, of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) For the Sorts, and particular Kinds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he is pleas'd to Instance only in <hi>three,</hi> but he might as well, would he have Created himself the trouble, have named <hi>Threescore.</hi> A <hi>various Mode,</hi> or <hi>Circumstance,</hi> does not Constitute a <hi>new Religion:</hi> It may appear in <hi>various Garbs</hi> and <hi>Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> be represented under <hi>other Oeconomies,</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> and yet continue the same for <hi>Substance.</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105027:39"/>
The Ocean as it salutes <hi>differing Shoars,</hi> falls under <hi>divers Denominations,</hi> yet is but the same vast Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sea: There may be many <hi>false Religions</hi> (<hi>Errour</hi> is <hi>Multiform, Truth</hi> is <hi>Uniform</hi>) but as to any that can plead for <hi>acceptance with God,</hi> there never were but Two: That of <hi>Integrous and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Innocent Persons</hi> in Paradice; and that other of <hi>Sinners retrieved</hi> and <hi>brought back</hi> to God by <hi>a Mediatour.</hi> But I attend his Motions.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Natural Religion</hi> (as he says) <hi>is founded on the natural Evidences of the Divine Bounty and goodness, in making, and Governing the World.</hi> I now see my Errour, and it's well it is not too late. He had told us, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>That Religion in its first Natural Estate, knew no Priest nor Sacrifice nor Mediatour.</hi> Whence I innocently concluded, that he spoke of a State of <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>uncorrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which indeed knew <hi>none of these;</hi> but I see I was but Choust; for here we have <hi>a Natural state of Religion,</hi> on this side the <hi>general Revolt</hi> from God, below the <hi>common Apostacy</hi> of Mankind, a <hi>Sublapsarian Posture</hi> of Affairs, which yet is a meer stranger to <hi>Priest, Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Mediatour,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Natural Evidences of Divine Bounty and Goodness. To which I humbly offer: That these <hi>Natural Evidences</hi> were not, could not be a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation firm enough to bear the weight of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of sinners in their Return to God, so as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them secure of Acceptation with him. For, 1.

               <hi>plainly</hi> in <hi>Adam;</hi> Who when he had <hi>sinned,</hi> and Guilt <hi>Recoyled</hi> upon his <hi>Conscience,</hi> in stead of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> to God, he became <hi>Vain in his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> thinking to flie from him that is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> or to <hi>Abscond</hi> from him that is <hi>Omniscient,</hi> he <hi>takes Covert</hi> in the <hi>Trees of the Garden;</hi> and he gives this Reason, <hi>He heard the Voice of God, and was afraid:</hi> And yet I see not but 'twas as <hi>Rational a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> as to think of <hi>Returning to God,</hi> when in that <hi>Covenant</hi> wherein he <hi>had stood,</hi> and now <hi>had broken,</hi> there was <hi>no provision</hi> for an <hi>After-game,</hi> or <hi>salving Matters</hi> by <hi>Repentance:</hi> The Law he had <hi>Violated</hi> in the <hi>Sanction thereof,</hi> tells him he <hi>must Die.

Nor could the <hi>Evidences</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:105027:40"/>
of Gods <hi>making the World,</hi> give any Glimps of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that first or last he would not <hi>destroy it</hi> (though at present he <hi>suspended</hi> the Execution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Secret Design of Grace lodged in his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som) unless a <hi>Mediatour</hi> had <hi>Interpos'd,</hi> and that Interposition <hi>Accepted,</hi> and <hi>both Revealed</hi> to those Consciences which were fill'd with hideous Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions about the Holiness of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Mosaick Religion</hi> was founded <hi>on those Miraculous deliverances which God wrought for</hi> Israel, <hi>and that particular Providence which watched over them.</hi> To which I return: 1. The <hi>Mosaick</hi> and the <hi>Christian,</hi> are not <hi>different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the same</hi> for <hi>Substance, differing</hi> in <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Circumstance.</hi> What they <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,</hi> that we <hi>enjoy:</hi> They <hi>had Christ</hi> in <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and we have <hi>all their Sacrifices</hi> in <hi>Christ:</hi> What they had at <hi>sundry times,</hi> and in <hi>divers manners,</hi> that have we <hi>in one Uniform</hi> way by <hi>Christ:</hi> They had <hi>scattered Particulars,</hi> we have them all <hi>summ'd</hi> up <hi>in one,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday, to day, and the same for ever.</hi> 2. The <hi>Miraculous deliverances</hi> which God wrought for <hi>Israel,</hi> were indeed <hi>Cogent Motives,</hi> super-added to those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others vouchsafed them, but not the <hi>Foundation</hi> of their Religion under any Notion: When God gave the Law upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> He <hi>Prefaces</hi> it with this <hi>strong Inducement; I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>out of the House of Bondage.—Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> May we now upon our Authors Warrant, say, That Gods <hi>delivering them out of Egypt,</hi> was the Foundation of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Worshipping</hi> the <hi>true God, and none besides</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:105027:40"/>
               <hi>Him;</hi> or rather that it was an <hi>Additional Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to command Obedience to that Law, which yet <hi>Antecedent</hi> to such <hi>particular Obligation,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved its <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>their Consciences?</hi> But that these <hi>Deliverances</hi> and <hi>Providences,</hi> were no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Religion, I shall endeavour to prove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that God himself declares, that he had laid another Foundation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion a sure Foundation:</hi> And this is not <hi>constitutive</hi> of what was <hi>New,</hi> but <hi>declarative</hi> of what was <hi>Old;</hi> not only a <hi>Prophesie</hi> of what he <hi>would</hi> do, but a <hi>clearer Discovery</hi> of what he <hi>had done;</hi> that he might lead them into <hi>stronger Expectations</hi> of that <hi>Messiah,</hi> which <hi>from time</hi> to <hi>time</hi> was <hi>promised would</hi> come, and in <hi>fulness of Time should</hi> come; and this Foundation God laid in <hi>Zion:</hi> Which though it may <hi>express</hi> the <hi>Gospel-Church,</hi> yet sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must not <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>Iewish,</hi> to which the Name Primarily appertains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that God had actually laid another Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, from the Foundation of the World, for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Build their Hopes upon in their addresses to God.

That the Sins here mention'd, were not <hi>ceremonial Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, legal Defilements,</hi> but such <hi>Wickednesses</hi> as were <hi>discoverable</hi> by the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>Law of Nature: Lying, Cozening, False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing, Unfaithfulness in Trust,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105027:41"/>
these sins did bring a <hi>proper Guilt</hi> upon the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as being <hi>committed against the Lord;</hi> and therefore the Sinner was <hi>guilty before God,</hi> that is, <hi>Obnoxious and liable to his Displeasure,</hi> and <hi>bound over in conscience</hi> to answer it at <hi>Gods Tribunal;</hi> ver. 1. <hi>If a Soul sin, and commit a Trespass against the Lord,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Then it shall be because he hath sinned and is guilty.</hi> 3. That for that <hi>part</hi> of his Fact which was <hi>Injurious</hi> to <hi>his Neighbour, that which he violently took away,</hi> or the <hi>thing he hath deceitfully gotten,</hi> or <hi>that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found;</hi> he was to restore the <hi>principal</hi> in Specie, and to add a <hi>fifth part more,</hi> because of the <hi>Damnum emergens.</hi> 4. That notwithstanding he had thus <hi>compounded</hi> with man, he must bring his <hi>Trespass-offering to the Lord, a Ram without blemish,</hi> ver. 6. 5. The <hi>Priest was to receive the Trespass-offering at his hand,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up to the Lord. 6. The design of this Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was <hi>Attonement,</hi> procuring Favour from God. 7. Here's a Promise of the full Pardon of sin, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto this Sacrifice, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>It shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, for any thing of all that he hath done in Trespassing therein:</hi> Now upon the whole Matter, we observe here was Pardon of sin <hi>annext to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> and yet <hi>their Reasons</hi> could tell <hi>them,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> has <hi>told us,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. <hi>It's not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats, should take away sin:</hi> And I think we may venture to say the same of the <hi>blood of Rams</hi> too. How shall these then be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled? I know no other way, but by owning the <hi>Respect</hi> which they bore to the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> who was from the <hi>Foundation</hi> of, and <hi>all along</hi> the World the <hi>only Lamb slain,</hi> of value <hi>for these ends,</hi> in Gods Account.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:105027:42"/>Thirdly, <hi>The Christian Religion</hi> [is founded] <hi>on the Incarnation, Death and Resurrection, of the Son of God.</hi> Our Author had founded his <hi>own,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> on the <hi>Sacrifice, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ,</hi> p. 15. But perhaps, <hi>fearing</hi> or <hi>finding</hi> the <hi>Foundation too narrow,</hi> has here <hi>widened</hi> it at the <hi>bottome,</hi> and taken in the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Jesus Christ. But I hope now the <hi>Storm</hi> will <hi>blow over,</hi> and the <hi>Indignation</hi> conceived against those Persons who <hi>Love, Honour,</hi> and <hi>admire Christs Person, a little Slake;</hi> for if their Religion, the Acceptation of their <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> be built upon Him, as <hi>Sacrificed for them on the Cross,</hi> and <hi>Interceding for them on the Throne,</hi> they do judge it their duty to love him against the World. Nay, what will you say if our Author himself should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Convert;</hi> his <hi>own Hope,</hi> and that's his All (he says) is Built on the <hi>Sacrifice, and Intercession of Christ:</hi> And can you imagine but he should <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and Adore his Person?</hi> And then may there not arise a danger that he should <hi>set up a Religion of Christs Person?</hi> However that goes, This I know, it was Christs blessed Person, that endured the <hi>Shock,</hi> and <hi>abode the Storm</hi> of that Displeasure which was <hi>due to our sin;</hi> and no Reason can <hi>be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,</hi> why a Person should endure <hi>all the Sorrow,</hi> and not have also the <hi>Love, Honour, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them</hi> for whom he endured it: And if <hi>some few Holy men</hi> be a little <hi>Transported</hi> with the Love of Christ, methinks it's easily <hi>pardonable; very few</hi> die of <hi>that Disease;</hi> no danger <hi>this Age</hi> should be Hot in the <hi>fourth Degree</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to a Redeemer, that our Author should be necessitated to Write a Book for fear it should Poyson us: For my part I

meet with no such <hi>Paroxisms</hi> of Divine Love, that his <hi>Iulip</hi> should be so much cry'd up; but I would fain please my self with this, that whilst he seems <hi>Frigidam suffundere,</hi> his Real Design is to make us all <hi>more in Love with Christ</hi> by a Spiritual <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>This gives great Reverence and Authority to his Gospel, that it was Preacht by so Great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as the Son of God.</hi> And therefore whilst he is in the good Humour, let him Retract those Severe and Toothed <hi>Satyrs,</hi> wherewith he has <hi>Torn</hi> and <hi>Lasht</hi> those poor Honest Men for loving <hi>his Person,</hi> but <hi>Neglecting his Laws;</hi> when he tells us here, <hi>The greater Reverence we have for his Person, the more sacred Regard we have for his Laws.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he was then under an <hi>Accession</hi> of <hi>Gout, Stone,</hi> or <hi>Cholick,</hi> or some of the <hi>peevish Distempers,</hi> which made him so <hi>Testy,</hi> and <hi>Teachy,</hi> with his best Friends; but now he's a little come home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he's in as <hi>Sweet, Treatable,</hi> and <hi>Debonaire</hi> a Humour as one could wish, if it would but last. I confess, some may think that <hi>All this</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Complement</hi> which he passes upon Christ's Person, or a little <hi>Holy-water he sprinkles in his Face;</hi> and that there Lurks a <hi>Snake</hi> under these <hi>fair Flowers.</hi>—For he plainly makes <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Edaequate, and Commensurate Terms. This gives Reverence to the Gospel,</hi> [for] <hi>Laws always partake of the Fate, and condition of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> The Gospel as <hi>Contradistinguisht</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works,</hi> denotes the <hi>glad Tidings of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by a Mediatour,</hi> or the <hi>joyful News</hi> that there was <hi>Forgiveness with God, that He might be feared.</hi> As <hi>contradistinguisht</hi> to the <hi>Old Testament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:105027:43"/>
it is the <hi>glad Tidings of the Son of God sent into the World, that taking upon him our Nature, he might therein become a Curse for us, and by his perfect Obedience to the Law, might Purchase and Procure Eternal Life:</hi> And are Christs <hi>Laws</hi> and His <hi>Gospel</hi> become <hi>Convertible?</hi> Is there <hi>no Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?

The Laws of Christ then are <hi>Holy, and Just, and Good;</hi> that the <hi>Greatness of his Person Consiliates Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and due Regard to them</hi> we acknowledge; that <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> are <hi>words of equal Extent,</hi> we deny, and do think our Author will be harder put to it to prove <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>signifie Law,</hi> than to <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gospel:</hi> Much less are we satisfied in <hi>his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</hi> Numa <hi>pretended he received his Laws from the Goddess</hi> Aegeria, <hi>to procure a greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to them.</hi> Thus God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Say you so?

            </p>
            <p>(3.) The <hi>Greatness of his Person gives great Authority to his Example, for he came to be our Prophet, and our Guide, to Teach us by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and his Life.</hi> Believe it, this is something like?

            <p>That which follows is Truely excellent. <hi>God cannot but be pleas'd, when his own Son undertakes to be a Ransome, and to make an Attonement for sinners, which is so great a Vindication of Gods Dominion and Sovereignty, of the Authority of his Laws, the Wisdom and Iustice of his Providence, that he may securely pardon humble and penitent sinners, without reproaching any of his Attributes.</hi> What pity 'tis a single word should here be lost.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God will not, indeed cannot, pardon any sin to the reproach of his Attributes.

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:105027:46"/>
a way must be contrived that he may <hi>securely pardon;</hi> and when 'tis said [he cannot] 'tis <hi>no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> of His <hi>Omnipotency;</hi> He is <hi>therefore Omnipotent</hi> because he <hi>cannot Doe some things,</hi> the <hi>Doing</hi> whereof would imply <hi>want of Power.</hi> He <hi>cannot Dye,</hi> and is <hi>therefore</hi> the rather <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> because <hi>he cannot:</hi> He <hi>cannot Deny himself,</hi> and therefore he <hi>can doe</hi> all things, because he <hi>cannot</hi> doe <hi>that;</hi> for he that can <hi>Deny Himself,</hi> his <hi>Word, Promise,</hi> or <hi>Threatning,</hi> may be presumed <hi>Able to doe very little:</hi> Thus therefore God cannot pardon sin, without security that his <hi>Attributes be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,</hi> for so to doe, would argue a <hi>Remisseness,</hi> and <hi>languid easiness</hi> in a <hi>Governour</hi> which is <hi>a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>no perfection.</hi>

Now concerning this, you must understand; <hi>That God who is never wanting to his own Glory, and the Happiness of his Creatures, hath taken care in all Ages, by one Means or other to make known himself, and his Will to the World.</hi> Our Author <hi>presumes</hi> he has <hi>penn'd this Discourse</hi> with <hi>much Artifice,</hi> and laid a <hi>train</hi> of <hi>fallacies</hi> for us, which if not <hi>timely discovered,</hi> and <hi>prevented,</hi> will irrecoverably <hi>blow us</hi> and <hi>our Cause</hi> up into the Aire, in the next Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But indeed the <hi>best part</hi> of his Policy is the <hi>confounding</hi> of things, and <hi>involving</hi> them in such <hi>Intricacies</hi> and <hi>Perplexities,</hi> that it's <hi>much harder</hi> to <hi>discover</hi> his Errors, than to <hi>confute</hi> them being once discovered; like what Physicians tell us of the <hi>Hectick Fever,</hi> that in its <hi>first Rise</hi> it's <hi>hardly</hi> discerned, but otherwise <hi>easily</hi> cured; and at length <hi>easily</hi> discovered, but then <hi>impossible</hi> to be removed; according to the <hi>French</hi> Proverb, <hi>Toutes les ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, termines en Ique, font aux Medecins la Nique.</hi> And therefore, e re things are gone too far, and we be given over by <hi>Aesculapius</hi> himself, as those whom <hi>safety it self</hi> cannot <hi>save,</hi> let us try if we may prevent a growing evil.</p>
               <p>And (1) it stumbles some I perceive, that he layes the <hi>Happiness</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> in the <hi>Knowledge and Love</hi> of God, and then the <hi>Means</hi> to that End in <hi>making known himself, and his will;</hi> which looks as if the <hi>Means</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> were <hi>coincident,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> were the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>know God.</hi>

               <p>(3) We are more dissatisfied about this one point, that he makes the <hi>Revelation of Gods Will</hi> a sufficient Means for Happiness, to all Ages: for though it were granted to have been so, in the state of primitive Integrity; yet it's <hi>not so</hi> in those Ages when the <hi>whole world lay in wickedness.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God describes the <hi>state of Sin,</hi> to be a <hi>state of Impotency.</hi> Rom. 5. 6. <hi>When ye were yet without strength, in due time Christ dyed for the ungodly:</hi> There must goe <hi>something more</hi> (then) to make the <hi>Means</hi> sufficient to <hi>attain that End,</hi> than a <hi>Naked</hi> discovery of <hi>what</hi> God would have Sinners <hi>doe,</hi> even <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>doe it;</hi> for the Will of God was, and is the same; <hi>Doe this and live;</hi> and if strength be not afforded to fulfill <hi>this Law</hi> exactly (which <hi>none</hi> could ever <hi>yet find</hi>) nor a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute allowed, (which <hi>some</hi> will <hi>not accept,</hi>) Man <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> perish as well <hi>with,</hi> as <hi>without</hi> the discovery of Gods Will; with this onely difference, that he sees now <hi>his sin going before him unto Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4) It's very vain to talk of Mans <hi>tampering</hi> about <hi>doeing</hi> the Will of God, in Order to Eternal Life, till <hi>some means</hi> be found out to <hi>take up</hi> the <hi>old Controversie;</hi> and <hi>make a peace</hi> betwixt God, and his Creature, that they may treat upon other Terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are sure <hi>Adam</hi> thought it so; And <hi>the first in its kind</hi> may well be allow'd the <hi>just measure</hi> of all <hi>after Attempts;</hi> who when he had sinn'd, went

and hid himself; at once discovering both his <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional fear,</hi> which was to <hi>stand before God;</hi> and his <hi>foolish contrivance,</hi> which was, to <hi>hide himself from God</hi> in the Covert of the Trees, under which (nay under Rocks and Mountains) it had been <hi>more</hi> comfortable for him ever to have <hi>shrowded</hi> his <hi>guilty Face,</hi> had not God revealed the <hi>postliminary means</hi> of conversing with him.</p>
               <p>(5) We think our Authors <hi>Reason</hi> is as <hi>lame,</hi> as his <hi>Assertion, viz.</hi> Because <hi>God is never wanting to his Creatures happiness:</hi> To which I return,</p>

               <p>(1) For the state of <hi>Integrity;</hi> How God was <hi>not wanting</hi> to his <hi>Creatures Happiness</hi> therein, he informs you at large. <q>He left such visible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses of his own Wisdom and Power on the works of Nature, and planted in the Mind of Man such a Natural Knowledge of himself, that it was as easie to discover the first Author of all things, as it's now for a well disposed Eye to see the Sun when it shines, and while Man preserved his Innocency, God Himself did not disdeign to converse with him.</q> And so I hope <hi>Adam</hi> is well provided for: <hi>Some</hi> may think, that we are here <hi>less agreed,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> that we are <hi>more of a Mind</hi> than indeed <hi>we really are.</hi> I shall not take notice of that Phrase of <hi>conversing with God,</hi> it looks as if it were <hi>neer a kin to,</hi> and <hi>well nigh</hi> as bad, as that of <hi>holding Communion with God,</hi> which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>throwes up his Nose</hi> so scornfully at: <hi>Some other</hi> matters may have a Room in our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: As,</p>
               <p>[1] That this <hi>Knowledge of God was Natural,</hi> had need be a little better <hi>trimmed</hi> than ordinary: <hi>Natural,</hi> either imports what is <hi>constitutive</hi> of our <hi>Beings,</hi> or flows <hi>immediately</hi> from the <hi>Principles of Nature;</hi> or else what is <hi>congruous,</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to our Natures, as designed for <hi>such an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as is <hi>proper</hi> to them: If he take <hi>Natural</hi> in the first sence, I softly deny that, <hi>The Knowledge of God which made or would have made Adam</hi>

                  <hi>happy, was Natural to him:</hi> And my Reason is, that what does so <hi>constitute</hi> Nature, or <hi>flow imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> from the Principles thereof, cannot <hi>possibly</hi> be <hi>separated</hi> from that Being, but withall, the <hi>very</hi> Being is <hi>destroy'd;</hi> but we see <hi>damned Souls</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> retain <hi>all that knowledge of God,</hi> which did <hi>constitute</hi> their <hi>Essences,</hi> and yet have lost <hi>all that knowledge of God,</hi> which is or may be a <hi>Means to their happiness;</hi> they <hi>retain</hi> their <hi>Beings,</hi> are not <hi>physically stript</hi> of them, though they are <hi>Morally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested</hi> of all the <hi>Comfort</hi> of their <hi>Beings:</hi> but then if by <hi>Natural Knowledge,</hi> no more be intended, but that <hi>upon supposition,</hi> God would create man to <hi>serve, love,</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> him, it was <hi>due</hi> to a Being <hi>so posited,</hi> to be <hi>so qualified:</hi> If man must <hi>serve</hi> his Maker, and in that <hi>service enjoy</hi> him, and in that <hi>enjoyment</hi> be <hi>Happy</hi> in him, then indeed is it <hi>natural, such a Knowledge, such a Will, such a Heart,</hi> should be bestow'd upon him; but I would have this Bush <hi>soundly beaten</hi> by a <hi>better</hi> Huntsman than my self, and ten to one, he may from under it <hi>start</hi> a <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[2] It would be enquired, whether this <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Knowledge</hi> was a <hi>sufficient means</hi> for <hi>Adams</hi> Happiness? Our Author seems clearly to assert it, but I confess I cannot joyn with him, as believing that <hi>much more</hi> was <hi>required of,</hi> and indeed <hi>bestow'd</hi> upon him than a <hi>Natural Knowledge</hi> of God. He was made in the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>likeness of God,</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 27. <hi>A main part</hi> of <hi>that Image</hi> lay <hi>in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> Eccles. 7. 29. <hi>God made man upright,</hi>

And this appears, In that <hi>the Image of God restored</hi> by Grace, assures us <hi>what</hi> that <hi>Image was</hi> which he once had, but since has lost, <hi>Eph. 4. 24.

               <p>[3] I question much that Expression of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> as not very <hi>Innocent;</hi> it has been taken upon suspicion many a time, and sometime could not give a good Account of it self. <hi>Casta quidem sed non credita:</hi> And it has been the more narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, since <hi>a Generation of Men</hi> arose in the world who would perswade us, That <hi>the Perfection of Man in his first Creation, lay not in any positive Qualities of Holiness, Righteousness, and Truth, but in a bare Freedom from sin;</hi> That is, they would fancy Man to have been created as <hi>pure white</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> as a <hi>sucking Lamb;</hi> but not so much as the <hi>first preparative blue</hi> towards the <hi>tincture</hi> of any <hi>Vertues;</hi> but whether this <hi>one word</hi> in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, may be iuterpreted <hi>so high,</hi> time must disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

               <p n="1">1.

And as I remember amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, they insist upon <hi>Hosea</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5. <hi>He took his Brother by the heel, and by his strength he had power with God, he had power over the Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prevailed, he wept and made supplication to him, The Lord God of Hosts, the Lord is his Memorial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105027:58"/>
that Created Angels did (as sometimes they did,) appear to <hi>good Men,</hi> and that their Message was the <hi>Mind of God concerning their Happiness, and Blessedness in the Enjoyment of God;</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they preach'd any other Gospel than they preach'd <hi>to the Shepherds at Bethlehem:</hi> because it would seem, that these inferiour Angels could not employ their Tongues upon <hi>a more welcome</hi> Theme, than <hi>Him,</hi> who was <hi>their Head,</hi> and under <hi>whose Obedience</hi> they were <hi>Ranged</hi> by <hi>Creation,</hi> and to whom he was also a <hi>Mediator of Confirmation.</hi>

that he sent none but <hi>Righteous Men</hi> to preach <hi>Righteousness,</hi> to an <hi>unrighteous generation.</hi> To <hi>vapour against sin,</hi> and then to <hi>wallow</hi> in it; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <hi>our Patients</hi> that <hi>Food</hi> which is often found upon our <hi>own Trenchers,</hi> will not gain much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to <hi>our Doctrine,</hi> and therefore Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 1. is said <hi>first to Doe,</hi> and then <hi>to Teach:</hi> Otherwise Ministers words are look'd on as <hi>things of Course,</hi> to while out <hi>one Glass,</hi> that they may be readier for <hi>another:</hi> Such Preachers being like him in the Comoedian, <hi>Qui alterâ manu fert lapidem, panem ostentat alterâ,</hi> that is, he <hi>feeds</hi> his <hi>Auditors</hi> like <hi>Apes,</hi> with <hi>a Bitt and a Knock:</hi> but here are a few things upon this head, that we cannot pass by, for our Author is as full of Excellencies as an Egge is full of Meat.</p>
               <p>(1) Here has been <hi>good Provision</hi> made for <hi>Good men,</hi> and <hi>pretty good too</hi> for the <hi>more degenerate part of Mankind;</hi> but there's a <hi>midling size</hi> of Men, all this while, that have <hi>no care</hi> taken of them, <hi>sink</hi> or <hi>swim:</hi> Men, that your Papists will tell you, are <hi>too good</hi> for <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>too bad</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> but of a <hi>just Gage</hi> for <hi>Purgatory:</hi> Now these men did not need such <hi>extraordinary Helps</hi> as <hi>Noahs,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Sermons;</hi> nor could deserve the <hi>apparitions of Angels,</hi> and therefore they must be content to <hi>drudge</hi> through the work in their <hi>own strength,</hi> whereof having <hi>a sufficiency, enough</hi> is <hi>as good</hi> as a <hi>feast, &amp; Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2) <hi>What Righteousness</hi> was it that these Men preach'd? Surely it would have been a hard Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have preached to them Their own; for if Mans Nature be <hi>Corrupted,</hi> and he lyable to <hi>Gods</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:105027:59"/>
                  <hi>Wrath, and Damnation,</hi> as <hi>the Church of England</hi> determines; it will be very difficult at least, to bring <hi>such a Righteousness</hi> to God out of so <hi>vitiated a Nature</hi> by its <hi>own mere strength,</hi> as may <hi>plead</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him: That Righteousness which is the <hi>Result</hi> of our <hi>utmost</hi> Obedience, has some flaws in it, that make it very <hi>improbable</hi> to justifie any person in the world under <hi>our Circumstances,</hi> that is, Sinners. 1. <hi>That Obedience</hi> which we may <hi>plead</hi> and <hi>abide by</hi> before God, for Justification and Eternal Life, must be entirely <hi>our own;</hi> performed <hi>in our own</hi> strength: it were <hi>idle presumption</hi> to come to God, for <hi>Acceptation</hi> and a <hi>Reward</hi> for that which we are beholden to his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> to help us to perform. 2. That which is not <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect</hi> cannot justifie in the face of a <hi>perfectly holy Law,</hi> and an <hi>infinitely perfect holy God.</hi> For if <hi>any thing short</hi> of Gods demands, would serve to justifie a Sinner, what should hinder but that, seeing God is <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>absolute in Mercy,</hi> he might abate the whole? Nay indeed, if God can <hi>abate,</hi> and <hi>come down</hi> from his <hi>first Terms,</hi> who shall <hi>set the Dice</hi> upon <hi>his Grace</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> and say, <hi>Thus far shall Mercy goe in Abating, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> And in a <hi>little while,</hi> no doubt, this Doctrine will be <hi>so well</hi> improved, that we shall have it made as plain to us, How God may justifie all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches</hi> of the World, as a Repenting Sinner; if <hi>no respect</hi> be had to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of Another. But of these things <hi>abundant</hi> occasion will be administred for Debate in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers.</p>
               <p>But then Secondly, there's another <hi>Expedient,</hi> which God used to reclaim the more Degenerate
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105027:60"/>
part of Mankind, and that he tells us was <hi>the good Examples of good men;</hi> how they lived, and how well they sped by Holy Living, and how they were rewarded, and how happily they dyed, and how much God delighted in them: All this is True in it self, <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Translation, <hi>Noah</hi>'s Preservation, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Exaltation, and <hi>Lott</hi>'s Ereption, were <hi>convincing</hi> Arguments <hi>how dear these good Men were to God:</hi> But first I would say, it was a more Convincing Argument to me, that God was Good to them, who made them so, who call'd <hi>Abraham</hi> from <hi>Ur of the Chaldees,</hi> from the Idols which <hi>his Family</hi> had worshipt <hi>on the other side the Flood:</hi> It was Gods Grace that <hi>raised up the Righteous Man from the East, and call'd him to his foot,</hi> Isa. 41. 2. And then secondly, I would say too, that there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed something more than outward Examples to make that Age happy, even an <hi>inward Operation</hi> of Gods Grace; for the Church of <hi>England</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently resolved, <hi>Art. 10. The Condition of Man is such after the Fall of Adam, that he cannot turn—without the Grace of God preventing him, that he may have a Good Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) We are now arrived at a third Division of Time, stretching it self from <hi>Abraham</hi> untill <hi>Christ</hi> came in the Flesh. <hi>For when the World would not be reformed by single Examples,</hi> (as ye know one Swallow will not make a Summer,) what did God doe then? why <hi>he chose the Posterity of Abraham to be a publick and constant demonstration of his Power, and Providence, and Care of Good Men.</hi> Our Author fancies that God had been <hi>trying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi> and <hi>casting matters</hi> in <hi>his thoughts,</hi> how he might <hi>reform the rugged World;</hi> and that he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105027:60"/>

I have heard of one that would needs trye how to make <hi>a dead body</hi> stand <hi>upright,</hi> he <hi>set him</hi> upon <hi>his feet,</hi> and placed him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Just <hi>such a process</hi> does our Author <hi>modestly</hi> ascribe to the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> God. He supposes God <hi>was not wanting to his Creatures Happiness;</hi> and I may suppose God knew well, <hi>what would serve</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his <hi>Creatures Happiness,</hi> in the <hi>present posture</hi> he was in; and yet all came to little or nothing, surely there's <hi>something</hi> wanting <hi>somewhere</hi> or other.

               <p n="1">1. God was <hi>never disappointed</hi> in the <hi>Counsels</hi> and <hi>purposes</hi> of his heart; whatever he undertakes according to the <hi>good pleasure of his will,</hi> he goes through with it; If <hi>he will work, none shall let;</hi> If <hi>he sayes</hi> it, <hi>he will doe it,</hi> and <hi>his word shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him in vain,</hi> but <hi>accomplish the thing for which he sent it:</hi> Thus <hi>Enoch</hi>'s, <hi>Noah</hi>'s, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Ministry</hi> atchieved <hi>whatever his hand and Counsel fore-ordained by them should be done:</hi> And if any be <hi>angry</hi> hereat <hi>without a Cause,</hi> they must be <hi>pleas'd</hi> again <hi>without amends.</hi>

is to be the <hi>Measure</hi> of his Assertion, let us attend to it with diligence; <hi>This Respect is founded on that Natural Relation God owns to Mankind:</hi> To which I answer, Whatever respect God had to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> so as to afford them at any time the <hi>Means of Salvation,</hi> it was not founded on <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> as their <hi>Creator;</hi> but on a Relation <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> and of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mere Grace;</hi> and we will <hi>joyn issue</hi> with him <hi>upon this point</hi> when <hi>he pleases.</hi> But I shall endeavour to set the Apostles Argument upon its own Legs: What he drove at, he shews you, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>That a Man is justifi'd by Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the Law:</hi> he had proved this in the <hi>foregoing Verse,</hi> thus: <hi>The way</hi> that <hi>God takes</hi> in the <hi>Iustifying of a Person,</hi> is <hi>such a one</hi> as <hi>shuts out of dores Boasting;</hi> But Justification <hi>by Faith,</hi> onely <hi>excludes Boasting,</hi> and <hi>the way</hi> of Justifying <hi>by works</hi> would <hi>not exclude</hi> it, and therefore God takes <hi>that way</hi> to justifie the Sons of Men: In this 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse, he proceeds to another Argument to evince the same Thing. If Justification <hi>come by the works of the Law,</hi> then never <hi>any Gentile</hi> could be justifi'd, but <hi>some Gentiles</hi> have been justifi'd, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Justification comes not by <hi>the works of the Law.</hi> That <hi>some Gentiles</hi> had been justified, he proves in the Instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was justifi'd, not <hi>in Circumcision,</hi> but in <hi>Uncircumcision,</hi> as he sayes, <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Now it's evident, that <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> are <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>equal wideness</hi> with <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile:</hi> For that which he calls <hi>v.</hi> 29. of the third Chapter, <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> Verse the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses by <hi>Circumcision and Uncircumcision: It is one God that shall justifie the Circumcision</hi> (the Jews)

               <p>And [1] It may seem that the Son of God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>exchanged</hi> the <hi>Throne,</hi> for the <hi>Footstool;</hi> nor the <hi>King of Glory,</hi> taken on Him the <hi>form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> nor He that was <hi>Rich to a Miracle,</hi> have become <hi>Poor to a Proverb,</hi> without some <hi>Cogent Reason,</hi> and <hi>pressing Necessity;</hi> which our Author will just now favour us withal: And here I sorely suspected it would go very hard with him: For

whereas at other times, no necessity of Christ at all could be found; for both <hi>Iews and Gentiles who knew nothing at all of what Christ was to do in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Recovery, did believe God to be Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Merciful to sinners,</hi> pag. 44. And what could they desire more? Yet now when it will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serve the Turn, and subserve the present Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that Christ may be brought into the World with some Pomp and State, there must be an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensible necessity of his coming,</hi> for all <hi>other means</hi> that had been <hi>tried, proved ineffectual.</hi> What our Author supposes, may I hope without offence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a modest Examination. Two things are here by our Author supposed: (1) That the means which God had formerly used, <hi>proved Ineffectual to Reform the World.</hi> To which I shall Calmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, 1. That he had done much better to have proved that they were <hi>Designed by God to reform the World,</hi> before he asserted that they were <hi>Ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for that end;</hi> For it seems strange that God <hi>so Wise to know what Means would reach the end,</hi> and to <hi>Choose</hi> such as would do it, should pitch upon <hi>Means</hi> that he knew would never <hi>reach</hi> their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed ends. 2. If the end of Christs coming into the World was to <hi>reform it,</hi> upon an <hi>Experiment</hi> that all other Means proved <hi>Ineffectual:</hi> Must not God be forced to Try <hi>another Conclusion</hi> at least, and once more to <hi>Venture</hi> upon other means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>even now</hi> the World is unreformed? 3. The Means that God <hi>then used,</hi> (he will confess) were <hi>sufficient</hi> for that end, Or else how were they <hi>Means?</hi> And the <hi>Means</hi> which God <hi>now uses</hi> proves not <hi>Effectual</hi> to Reform the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what have we got by the Bargain? 4. I hope our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105027:68"/>
Author will be better advised than to talk of <hi>Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Means</hi> of Grace, which shall <hi>Infallibly</hi> reach their ends, for that would bear the Face of <hi>Irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Grace.</hi> 5. The ways and means which God <hi>now</hi> uses to reform the World, are Effectual to reform as far as He in his wise Counsels did Bless them, and so were they <hi>then:</hi> And the ways and means He formerly used for the reforming the World, reacht not every Individual person <hi>then;</hi> nor have they any higher effect <hi>now.</hi> The <hi>Purpose</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> of God then are the <hi>true Measure</hi> of the <hi>Success and Efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Means of Grace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and since the coming of Jesus Christ.

A supposition <hi>extremely Scandalous</hi> to those appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions which both <hi>Natural Light</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> teach us to entertain of the Blessed and Glorious Majesty.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105027:69"/>
prostituted to blind Experiment) but God (who in our Authors Divinity had been practising upon the World for Four thousand years, before he saw his mistake) bought his skill with the Blood of many millions of Souls, who perished under his hands by ineffectual Remedies; and now he must be forced either to study, and find out some more effectual Means, or else give up the World as desperate and irrecoverable: And now, whether his Expressions do not more than squint that way, let the impartial Reader determine.</p>

               <p>[2] For the <hi>Employment</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> which our Author is pleased to assign unto Christ upon his Coming into the World, he tells us, that was, <hi>To make a full and perfect Declaration of Gods will; to give us the best Rules of Life, and to encourage our Obedience with the most express Promises of a blessed Immortality.</hi> And if this be <hi>all</hi> the Business our Author has shaped out for him, I shall the less wonder, that he can see no Necessity of Christs Coming into the World; and as little, that others
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105027:69"/>
can see no Necessity that he should be the Eternal Son of God: But whatever the Matter is, in these and the following lines, I observe our Author falls short of his wonted Accuracy and Confidence: He hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and staggers, and goes backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and strangely bewilders himself in Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. he tells us, <hi>The secret Purposes of Gods Counsels were conceal'd from Ages;</hi> and yet before he takes off his Pen, he tells us, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did not</hi> so fully <hi>understand them: Understand them</hi> then it seems <hi>they did;</hi> and <hi>fully understand</hi> them too, but not <hi>so fully</hi> understand them. It would tempt one to turn Questionist, and humbly ask; If they were <hi>conceal'd before,</hi> how were they <hi>understood?</hi> And if the Prophets did <hi>understand</hi> them, how were they <hi>conceal'd?</hi> Again, <hi>p.</hi> 29. he had let us know, that <hi>the Israelites had the best Rules of Life;</hi> and yet p. 30. <hi>That God sent his Son into the World to give us the best Rules of Life.</hi> Whence we see how easily our Author could have saved him that perilous Journey into this mischiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous World. Again p. 30. he supposes, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ's coming, the World had <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>express Promises</hi> too, <hi>of a blessed Immortality,</hi> though indeed not <hi>so express:</hi> And yet for all that, p. 34. That Christ <hi>onely</hi> brought to light <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;</hi> which has a greater Truth in't than perhaps our Author is aware of: Again p. 33. he acquaints us, That <hi>God was</hi> formerly <hi>known by the Light of Nature, the Works of Creation and Providence, and occasional Revelations;</hi> and p. 44. That <hi>those Natural Notions the Heathens had of God, and the discoveries God made of himself in the works of</hi>

                  <hi>Creation and Providence, did assure them that God is very good, and that it is impossible to understand what Goodness is, without pardoning Grace;</hi> and yet p. 33. he would fain perswade us, That <hi>NOW,</hi> (since Christs coming) <hi>The onely true Medium of knowing God, is the Knowledge of Christ, who came to declare God to us.</hi> A discovery indeed very sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing: For if <hi>Natural Light,</hi> without Christ, could reveal it <hi>then,</hi> why can it not doe it still? how comes it to pass that Creation and Providence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>perform the same Office now?</hi> If Christ be the <hi>onely true</hi> Medium <hi>now,</hi> it would make one suspect he was so <hi>then.</hi> The <hi>Light of Christ</hi> has not <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> but <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi> it; he came not to be <hi>an Extinguisher</hi> to the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> but a <hi>Candlestick;</hi> not to put out the <hi>Eye of Reason,</hi> but to provide an <hi>Eye-salve</hi> for it. Did <hi>Creation and Providence, preach</hi> God to be a <hi>sin-pardoning God then,</hi> and are they <hi>suspended ab officio, &amp; beneficio,</hi> in the <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Christian,</hi> and become <hi>silenc'd Ministers?</hi> And yet he seems to Retract this, <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>Nor have we any other certain way of knowing this</hi> [the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Purposes of Gods Counsel concerning the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind] <hi>but by the Revelation Christ hath made to us.</hi> Other wayes there may be still, if any will <hi>run the Risque,</hi> and venture upon them, but none <hi>so certain</hi> as this. And here comes in the fine Expedient for the Salvation of the <hi>Terra in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,</hi> without the Revelation of Christ. And yet once again, <hi>p.</hi> 30. he assigns the work of Christ, coming in the flesh, to be, <hi>To make a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Declaration of Gods Will,</hi> and yet by and by, as if he had forgot, or over shot himself, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105027:70"/>
it was but <hi>One main end of Christs appearing in the World, to reveal God to us:</hi> And so there may yet be some little room left for his Priestly Office, his Sacrifice and Interposition with God, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Sinners. And lastly, as I remember, <hi>p.</hi> 5. he tells us, that <hi>Christs Preaching the Gospel was the Exercise of his Regal Power,</hi> and indeed all along through that Chapter, the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> carried it hard-born from the rest, and ran them sheer out of distance, and yet the wind is vered about, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>When we speak of the knowledge of Christ, we must consider him as our Prophet.</hi> But really if this be all the work Christ had to doe in the world, Two third parts of Christs Mediatory Employment are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered, and the other lyes at mercy, whenever he shall please to revive the Commission of <hi>Natural Light,</hi> to reveal <hi>God's sin-pardoning Mercy,</hi> and <hi>the best Rules of Life</hi> unto the World.</p>
               <p>Now that he may give the better countenance to his Sentiments herein, he thought it meet to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon some Texts of Scripture, which else would have frowardly and perversly hung back from abetting his Fancies, and so might have spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Game. A taste of his Excellencies, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading or forceing Scripture to warrant his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will give us in his Learned Gloss upon <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> But never was Comment so pestered, so thwack'd with a Lirry of <hi>id est's,</hi> one clambring on the back of another, a third mounted o'th top of that, a fourth bestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, a fifth in the neck of that, and so on: <hi>I am the Way,</hi> id est, <hi>I declare the way. No man comes to the Father but by me;</hi> id est, <hi>None can</hi>

Caetera desiderantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the very truth is, all this is nothing but a trifling Imitation of his old Friend <hi>Volkelius,</hi> de verâ Relig. lib. 4. c. 2. p. 173. <hi>Et hoc quidem illud est, quod ipse Christus ait,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. <hi>Neminem nisi per ipsum ad patrem pervenire,</hi> id est, <hi>Neminem Dei Patris Cognitionem assequi nisi per Christum posse;</hi> Which shall never be spoyled by my bungling Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, our Author having saved me the labour, and so clearly translated it to my hands. But is it so indeed? Does <hi>Coming to God</hi> imply and import no more than the bare <hi>knowing of God?</hi> Surely there's some other, some more excellent Act of the Soul denoted by it: God may be known by, and yet the Soul never come to God: The Devils know him, and yet fly away from him: It supposes indeed the <hi>knowledge of God;</hi> none can come to an unknown God; but yet it further denotes the Souls address to God in Faith and Love by Jesus Christ; for though it were revealed, that God is a sin-pardoning God in himself, yet still the Sinner has need of <hi>an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> with him, <hi>even Jesus Christ the Righteous, who is a Propitiation for its sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. In whose Name, and through the Power of whose prevailing Blood, the guilty Creature may come and treat with God about his Pardon and Acceptation. In the next Section we shall find our Author as <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>plain-hearted</hi> as one could almost wish, he opens a <hi>Casement</hi> in his <hi>Breast,</hi> and lets us see how the <hi>pulse of his Soul beats,</hi> freely owns where he <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed</hi>

Lib. 3. de verâ Relig. p. 173. <hi>Deus non nisi per Christum cognosci potest, ut qui Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conspicui Imago est,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>eúmque id est ejus voluntatem nobis enarravit:</hi> Now will you have our Authors Translation in Masquerade; <hi>Christ hath made a True representation of the Divine Nature, and Will, and it's plain, that in this Sence Christ is called the Image of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4: <hi>It's Plain!</hi> yes, wondrous plain, that <hi>Volkelius</hi> is of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and for any other plainness we are to seek.

I know it's an easie thing with our Author to Name Christ a hundred times, and yet to speak as very little of Gospel, as he has done. But one thing I must, and desire the Reader, that he will not fail to take special Notice of: I find our Author over the shooes in Love, and most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately doting upon his own Critical Learning; for having observed to us, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. that <gap reason="foreign">

The Types and Shadowes which from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning represented him to the Faith of Believers, had all their Strength, Vertue, and Efficacy from Him; and that also made it Necessary, that Christ the Substance should come to answer them: for what could the blood of Bulls and Goats signifie to the appeasing of Gods Anger, the removing of Guilt, and the making peace betwixt God and Man, which the Scripture frequently assures us they did doe, and yet the same Scripture as clearly assures us in their own Nature they could not doe, otherwise than with respect to that Sacrifice once for all to be offer'd up to God for that end? 6. And it was Necessary, that the gracious God who had trusted the World so long with Pardon, Peace, and Life, should at last be satisfied, and not alwayes be put off without due Compensation to his Justice and Truth. 7.

there was a <hi>small inconvenience</hi> which attended the Design, and may possibly (if not timously prevented) spoyl its Expectations: For when every <hi>Pedling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit</hi> would be <hi>pecking</hi> at the <hi>Trade,</hi> the Commodity <hi>stuck</hi> most miserably upon their <hi>hands,</hi> became a <hi>very Drug;</hi> and even <hi>scoffing at Religion</hi> turn'd to as little Account, as the more common and trite way of Whipping and Spurring for the first Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy of a Presentation.

               <p>Some I perceive who are less knowing in this Mystery, have given themselves causeless trouble to enquire, Why our Author should single out <hi>these Persons</hi> and <hi>their Writings</hi> for his Enemies, when he might with the same Ease and Modesty have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the <hi>first Reformers of our Church,</hi> reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Reverend Bishops,</hi> and most <hi>eminent Divines;</hi> and above all, duelled the <hi>Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of Eugland;</hi> and either with <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus à S.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105027:77"/>
yet take so little notice of those who are <hi>digging up</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Building.</hi> But hence we may learn, That <hi>some may with more safety steal a Horse, than others look over the Hedge;</hi> so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does the <hi>same thing</hi> vary from <hi>its self,</hi> when done by <hi>differing hands,</hi> that as one informs us, from <hi>Livy, Papyrius slighted the Pullarii handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was well rewarded; when Appius Pulcher for doing the same thing slovenly and rudely, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it's high time to consider our Author. There are <hi>Two Praeliminaries</hi> which usher in the <hi>Body</hi> of his <hi>Discourse</hi> in this <hi>Section.</hi> First, an Account what notable Feats he has done in the former; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a modest account of his own Ingenuity in this Section: What he has atchieved in the former, he summes up in few words. <hi>After this plain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, wherein the Knowledge of Christ consists, the summe of which is this, that to understand Christ, is to understand his Gospel; which contains all those Revelations he made of Gods Will.</hi> I must needs say, I could have been content he had called it a <hi>learned</hi> Account, an <hi>unparallel'd</hi> Account, a <hi>witty, gentile,</hi> or indeed almost <hi>any other Account</hi> in the world besides a <hi>Plain one;</hi> for though there be but <hi>little of Truth,</hi> yet there's <hi>nothing at all</hi> of <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in it: I had alwayes thought, (and Thoughts are as free for me as another) that the <hi>Formale</hi> of <hi>the Knowledge of Christ</hi> lay in knowing <hi>his Person, that he is God and Man, two Natures united in one Person; his Offices, that he is our Prophet, our King, our High-Priest;</hi> and that the understanding of the Gospel, is the <hi>onely proper Means</hi> to come to the understanding and knowledge of Christ, <hi>Who he is,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105027:77"/>
                  <hi>What he is,</hi> in Himself, and to us; But that <hi>the knowledge of Christ should consist in understanding the Gospel,</hi> is an uncouth way of Praedication where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am not yet acquainted. Jesus Christ is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>in and by</hi> the Gospel: True; he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the Gospel, must needs understand Jesus Christ: Very good; but still as <hi>a Means</hi> leading to <hi>that End,</hi> and not <hi>the very thing</hi> it self: Much less is it true, That <hi>the Knowledge of Christ consists in understanding the Gospel, as it contains all the Revelations of Gods will.</hi> For this was but <hi>a part,</hi> and the <hi>least part</hi> too of Christs Employment and Undertaking; Christ had <hi>something more</hi> to doe than <hi>revealing to us Gods Will: Suffering the Displeasure,</hi> was a harder task than <hi>Revealing the Will of God;</hi> It was one thing to <hi>Preach a Sermon,</hi> and another to <hi>sweat drops of Blood;</hi> to have <hi>his Soul made an Offering for sin;</hi> to have <hi>the Iniquities of us all to meet upon him:</hi> Christ had many things to <hi>doe,</hi> and <hi>command</hi> as our Lord and Governour; many things to <hi>suffer</hi> as our Sacrifice, many to <hi>offer</hi> as our Priest; and what he had <hi>thus done,</hi> and <hi>suffer'd,</hi> to <hi>Reveal</hi> to us as our <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Teacher.</hi> But supposing all this to be true, That <hi>the knowledge of Christ consists in the knowledge of the Gospel;</hi> and suppose also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>the Gospel contains no more than a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods Will, concerning us and our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> what use can he make of it? Why hence he will take <hi>a happy occasion</hi> to reproach some body or other, who have formed <hi>Another Notion of the Knowledge of Christ, very distinct from this, which contains a greater secret than one would at first imagine, and that is, an Acquaintance with Christs Person, which, if we will believe some men, is the</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105027:78"/>
                  <hi>onely Fountain of saving Knowledge:</hi> And is it grown such an unpardonable Crime in <hi>England</hi> to be <hi>acquainted</hi> with, or to have any <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Christs Person</hi> by his Gospel? Are these things grown so inconsistent all oth' sudden? It's not so very long since, that our Author could allow, that <hi>the Greatness of his Person as</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God-man,</hi> was of <hi>some Consideration,</hi> and that Consideration of <hi>some good use</hi> too; we were told <hi>what Credit his Person gave to his Laws,</hi> what <hi>repute it brought to his Doctrine,</hi> what <hi>value it procured to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and what <hi>Influence it had upon the great Ends of Religion;</hi> and are his Person and Gospel so fallen out of late, that there's no hopes of an Accommodation? What our Author may doe, I know not; but other men I am sure, have learn'd to distinguish betwixt <hi>a King</hi> and <hi>his Laws,</hi> though they <hi>do not oppose</hi> them; and to put a difference between <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and his <hi>Revelations,</hi> without creating differences between them; they can look upon <hi>a Priest</hi> and his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as <hi>two</hi> things, and yet not as <hi>contrary</hi> things; to consider Christ and his Gospel under distinct, and yet not under incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Notions. Oh! but the Quarrel lyes a great deal deeper; That they make the Person of Christ <hi>the onely Fountain of saving Knowledge:</hi> I confess, I could not expect that they should scape without a Chiding, who say, <hi>Christ's Person is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of saving Knowledge,</hi> when the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self could not escape a Nip for calling him <hi>the onely Foundation,</hi> p. 105. And yet as it has been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed discretion <hi>not to throw away our foul Water till we have got fair;</hi> so some I perceive are resolved not to leave their <hi>Confidence in Christ</hi> till our Author
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105027:78"/>
can show them a <hi>stronger bottom for Faith,</hi> nor to <hi>despise</hi> Christ as <hi>the Fountain of Knowledge,</hi> till he has discovered them one <hi>both fuller and freer</hi> of that which concerns their Salvation: They will own the Gospel to be <hi>the Conduit</hi> which <hi>Conveighs</hi> to us <hi>the Knowledge</hi> of God, but they are somewhat bold to assert Christ to be <hi>the Fountain</hi> that fills it: They own the Gospel to be the <hi>next immediate Cause</hi> which Derives saving Knowledge to us, but yet Christ is the <hi>Original Spring</hi> whence all true saving Knowledge of God is Derived; and they are the more confirmed in it, because Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self spoke a word, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. <hi>That no man had seen God at any time, the only Begotten Son who was in the Bosome of the Father, He hath revealed Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet say what you will or can, <hi>There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion of the Knowledge of Christ very distinct</hi> from our Authors: The true meaning whereof is no more than this; That it's better <hi>so Excellent a Book</hi> had been Written upon <hi>a false</hi> Ground, than <hi>none at all,</hi> and that it's more desireable to run upon <hi>a sleeveless</hi> Errand than to <hi>sit still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is enough to stay any mans Stomach by way of <hi>Repetition,</hi> what gallant Feats our Author has done in the former Section: A Taste of his Modesty, and Ingenuity follows: For, he <hi>will not envy the Author the glory of the Discovery, and will therefore honestly confess where he had it:</hi> For he who would be loath that any should Rob him of the glory of his rare Discoveries upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20. is as unwilling to be accounted <hi>a pilfering Plagiary,</hi> one that <hi>Filches</hi> his Notions from others, and will not own his <hi>Benefactors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:105027:79"/>Now the great Grievance lies against a Book, <hi>Intitled, Communion with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost distinctly, Written by</hi> John Owen, D.

And here I must <hi>openly</hi> profess, that I have no Commission either from <hi>this Gentleman,</hi> or those others Concern'd in the Reproaches of our Author, to Vindicate their Names, or Interpose in their Concerns, they need not my Defence and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; they are of Age to answer for themselves: and would certainly do it, but that they are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by an Old French Diverb: <hi>Le jeune vault pas La chandelle.

               <p>Our Author begins with Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and from amongst all the Books that he has Publisht, he has singled out that <hi>Practical piece of Communion with God:</hi> This some think was most <hi>absurdy,</hi> and

                  </hi> Any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving might have said, but this Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and a very few more, and have thought no great Harm neither; What ails then our Author thus dismally to <hi>Paratragediate?</hi> whence comes all this Clutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Din? Had <hi>Medaea</hi> Torn her Children piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, and scattered their reeking Entrails, and bleeding Limbs about the fields? Or had our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor been Invited to <hi>Thyestes</hi> his Banquet, at the Honour whereof the amazed Sun muffled his face in Clouds? Or had he perhaps (at least in a Play,) seen <hi>Hippolytus</hi> drawn in Pieces with his own Coach-Horses? Or <hi>Hercules</hi> stark Raging Mad, with the <hi>Centaures</hi> poysoned Jerkin? No, not a Syllable of all this: But one Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly Quoted, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In Him are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom, and Knowledge,</hi> to prove that <hi>Christ is our Wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. All this while the Honest Reader stands wondering what should be the Cause of this high Ferment, and where the <hi>Lye</hi> should be, that deserves <hi>this Stab.</hi> But I shall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him: The Doctor thinks these words are true <hi>of the Person of Christ;</hi> and our Author will needs have them applied <hi>to the Doctrine of Christ: The Text</hi> (says he) <hi>speaks of the Doctrines, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Christ.</hi> Shall it then be Compounded by indifferent Arbitrators? If our Author will <hi>not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Christs Person,</hi> I dare undertake the Doctor shall not <hi>exclude his Revelations:</hi> and so the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie shall be all Husht, and Quiet. Two things I shall modestly offer to the Reader. (1.) That in this Text, <hi>the Person of Christ must necessarily be Included.</hi> And I shall assign these two Reasons.</p>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. It's dangerous to Interpret Scripture at that Rate, as may destroy the Design of it: and if this Course be taken, I know nothing but that the Person of Christ may be Distinguisht, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted out of the whole Bible: If it stand not here <hi>necessarily,</hi> it stands in all other places but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariously;</hi> and when he sees good, can show us a way how <hi>a Doctrine</hi> or <hi>a Revelation,</hi> may be <hi>Born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> and <hi>suffer also under Pontius Pilate.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. The second Verse leads us plainly to a Person; <hi>The Mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.</hi> Hence I am apt to believe, That since <hi>the Father,</hi> and <hi>the Son,</hi> are equally <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reason,</hi> 3. How harsh would it sound in our Ears, to say that <hi>God is the Father of a Doctrine,</hi> an <hi>Office,</hi> and whatever else our Author pleases, and yet it's plain, that of <hi>that Son</hi> to whom God is <hi>a Father,</hi> the Apostle affirms; <hi>In Him are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge.</hi>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Because our Author sometimes, when his Ingenuity works, can be content to divide the Matter. Thus, pag. 32. <hi>Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. <hi>the Brightness of his Fathers Glory, and express Image of his Person; as the Will of God was fully declared to the World by Him, as well as with respect to his Divine Nature.</hi> And pray why may we not be allowed the same Liberty here to say: <hi>All the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge are hid in Christ, as well with respect to his Person</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105027:81"/>
                  <hi>as to his Doctrine.</hi> (2) If this will not do, I have one thing more to acquaint him with: Let him leave that <hi>Imperious way of perpetual Dictatorship,</hi> and fall to Proving, and Arguing, as hard as he can, for it's past that time of day with the World that has its Eyes open, to receive <hi>Confident assertions,</hi> for <hi>Demonstrations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I dismiss this Period, I must a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examine our Authors <hi>Connexions,</hi> and <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi> of things, and the rather because they seem to hang together with no better Friendship, than so <hi>many Pebbles in a Halter,</hi> nor to maintain a strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Correspondency each with other, than <hi>the parts of a Thumb-rope made of Sand.</hi>

               <p>And, 1. He tells us, <hi>That he may not do the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor wrong, he must tell us what he means by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christs Person:</hi> And then Quotes the words which we have just now discharged from our Consideration: But say I, this could not be, that he might <hi>not wrong him,</hi> but the contrary, that <hi>he might be sure not to do him right.</hi> For (not to Insist upon so small a Matter, that he Mutilates and Mangles the Doctors words) it's very plain that the Doctor does not there <hi>describe our Acquaintance with Christs Person,</hi> but the Effect of it: <hi>That in a Crucified Christ, we behold the Glory of God,</hi> pag. 78.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I cannot but observe, what a Mad and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Inference, he draws from the Doctors words: <hi>So that our acquaintance with Christs Person, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in this man's Divinity: such a Knowledge of what Christ is, hath Done and Suffered for us, from whence we may learn those Greater, Deeper, and more saving Mysteries of the Gospel, which Christ</hi>

                  <hi>hath not expresly revealed to us.</hi> Now this is sure an <hi>excellent Invention,</hi> and whereof our Author deserves <hi>the Patent,</hi> to Slander, Revile, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate a Person, that he may <hi>not do him wrong;</hi> to <hi>Cut a mans Throat,</hi> for fear you should <hi>hurt him;</hi> to <hi>Pick his Pocket</hi> out of <hi>mere tenderness of Conscience,</hi> lest you should do him an <hi>Injury.</hi> Our <hi>acquaintance with Christs Person,</hi> teaches us no <hi>new Doctrine,</hi> but only acquaints us with <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Old ones:</hi> We learn <hi>from the Gospel</hi> that God <hi>pardons Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin,</hi> and from the same Gospel we understand <hi>what Influence the Personal Sufferings of Christ have upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness with God.</hi> We learn <hi>from the Scriptures,</hi> That God <hi>heareth the Prayers of his People</hi> offer'd in the Name of Christ: And <hi>from the same Gospel</hi> we learn what the <hi>Intercession of Christ at the right Hand of the Father, does contribute to the answer of our prayers.</hi> The <hi>Person of Christ</hi> reveals <hi>no other,</hi> much less <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>deeper Mysteries</hi> than are revealed in the Gospel; only that upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Christs Person, his Offices, his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, we have <hi>a satisfactory account,</hi> how those things which the Gospel reveals, <hi>should be Possible and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. we find that <hi>God is the Iustifier of him that believes:</hi> And Faith that Resolves all its acts into the <hi>Veracity and Authority of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer,</hi> is ready to assent to, and acquiesce in that Revelation: But suppose God will gratifie the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitiveness of our Spirits, and clear up Matters to the satisfaction of our Trembling, because guilty Souls; the Gospel reveals all this to be in Christ: He is <hi>set for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There is one thing which I shall touch upon by the way: That for any Doctrine, or Proposition which his Adversaries do Abett, he exacts Rigorously, and they are bound to produce <hi>express Revelations,</hi> Scripture to a Letter, a Tittle; but <hi>for any of his own phancies, A feeble Conjecture,</hi> some <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht Consequence</hi> shall serve the turn well enough: Such Laws did his Master <hi>Volkelius, Lib. 3. de ver â Relig.

               <p>But, 3. As I am dissatisfied with our Authors <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> from the Doctors words, so I am much more with the <hi>Reason</hi> that he assigns to make good <hi>his Inference:</hi> His Inference is, <hi>That the Doctor, from Christs Person, learns greater, deeper Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, than Christ hath Revealed in his Gospel.</hi> The Proof is this: <hi>For so he adds soon after, That these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of God</hi> (his pardoning Mercy) <hi>Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Doctrin, in that revelation he hath made of God and his Will.</hi> The Sinews and Nerves of which Argument, lie visible. The Doctor asserts, <hi>That these properties of God are revealed in the Gospel:</hi> Ergo, It's plain, that <hi>He asserts they are not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Gospel:</hi> That is, in broad English, he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> because he <hi>affirms:</hi> Or he says the <hi>Snow is Black,</hi> because he <hi>proves,</hi> as well as he can, that <hi>it's White.</hi> Let none ever hereafter despair of the greatest Impossibilities; this is one of the most hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Essays towards the <hi>Squaring of the Circle,</hi> the <hi>Doubling of the Cube,</hi> and setting on Foot a <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motion:</hi> And what cannot that Wit be able to do, that can prove the Doctor affirms <hi>these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:105027:83"/>
                  <hi>are not,</hi> because he says <hi>they are in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> I confess when first I read this Passage in our Author, I examin'd the Doctors words with all possible care; nay, I wrested them almost in pieces, and wrackt them most cruelly, to try if with my weak strength I could extort any such conclusion from them, and when I had tired my self, was forced to sit down by this Determination, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Author, or all his Readers, are certainly Frighted out of their Wits: But yet there's, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing follows in the Doctors, that will yield matter of Cavil: <hi>But the Life of this Knowledge lies in an acquaintance with Ghrists Person, wherein the express Image and Beams of this Glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth shine forth:</hi> That is (as our Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Gloss it from the Doctor) <hi>These things are clearly, eminently and savingly, only to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Jesus Christ.</hi> I was apt to think at first sight, that he might have some dreadful Pick at those words: <hi>In his Person the express Image and Beams of this Glory of his Father, shine forth.</hi> But I soon Cured my self of that Suspition, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that <hi>pag.</hi> 32. Our Author himself was pretty well contented, <hi>Christ should be so called, upon the account of his Divine Nature, although to please all Parties, he had found out a Temper, that he should be so called in respect of his Doctrines and Revelations:</hi> And therefore without more ado, I was satisfied that the Grudge lay against those other words; <hi>The Life of this Knowledge lies in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christs Person.</hi> Now if I might presume so far upon <hi>my Acquaintance</hi> with the Doctors meaning, as I think any one may, it's no more but this: That whereas the Scripture every
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105027:84"/>
where reveals to us, that <hi>God is a God pardoning Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. Yet the Matter is Clog'd with <hi>considerable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> and attended with <hi>great Objections;</hi> for the same Text assures us, that <hi>He will by no means clear the Guilty:</hi> Both the parts of this Scripture are <hi>equally revealed,</hi> both <hi>equally claim</hi> a share in Gods <hi>Veracity,</hi> and till we can be resolved to Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, how God may be <hi>such a one</hi> as <hi>pardons Iniquity,</hi> and yet will <hi>by no means clear the Guilty,</hi> till we can see how this seeming Contradiction may be Reconciled, we shall either have <hi>none,</hi> or but a <hi>faint,</hi> and <hi>Dying knowledge</hi> of it. But now Christ he is <hi>the very Life</hi> of this Knowledge, for in his Death and Sufferings we see, and know clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Gods Justice is satisfied</hi> upon Christ, and <hi>his pardoning Mercy</hi> Magnified upon the <hi>Repenting and Believing sinner;</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> to know God to be <hi>a Sin-pardoning God,</hi> has indeed <hi>Life in't.</hi> For thus, to use the words of the Learned Bishop <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> upon Psal. 110. <hi>A Way is found out that things may be all one in respect of Man, as if the Law had been utterly Abrogated; and that they may be all one in respect of God, as if the Creature had been utterly Condemned,</hi> pag. 500. This is all the Doctor here intends, wherein though he should be mistaken, yet has he not discovered <hi>a Fellonious Intention,</hi> and so I hope it will not prove <hi>a Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matter.</hi> But yet our Author with his prying Eyes, can see further into a <hi>Milstone,</hi> than he that <hi>Pecks</hi> it: And as our <hi>Critical Scholiasts</hi> upon the Poets, discover <hi>Elegancies, Figures,</hi> and great <hi>Rarities</hi> which the poor man never Dreamt of; so can our Author discover <hi>Errors,</hi> multitudes of <hi>hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>

                  <hi>Errors</hi> in the Doctor, which he neither Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor Waking was ever aware of. For, says he, <hi>He explains himself thus: These things are Clearly, Eminently, and Savingly, only to be discovered in Iesus Christ.</hi> Whether the Doctor say any such thing or no, we shall take the Boldness to Catechise our Author by and by; and make him produce his Chapter, Paragraph, and Page, e're we have done, or abide by the shame that is due to a Malicious Slanderer. At present I only ask which of these Terms it is that he will Duel, or will he throw down the Gantlet to them all, that we may have <hi>Battle Royal?</hi>

               <p n="1">(1) <hi>These things are only</hi> clearly <hi>to be discovered in Iesus Christ:</hi> I see the most Innocent things may give Offence, But who would have suspected that in this place? For suppose that <hi>Sun, Moon, and Stars, Gods general Goodness</hi> to, his <hi>Patience</hi> with, and <hi>Forbearance</hi> of Sinners, might Intimate some <hi>such thing,</hi> that there was <hi>Forgiveness with God;</hi> yet surely there's <hi>a more clear</hi> account given of it in Christs Person, who was <hi>made sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Chap. 53. v. 10. calls <hi>making his Soul an Offering for sin:</hi> And that, methinks, clears it up a little more, than if we had been put to <hi>spell out the meaning</hi> of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Forbearance,</hi> with the <hi>Fescue</hi> of our <hi>own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> And though the Scripture abundantly reveals Pardon of Sin, yet the <hi>Manner how,</hi> the <hi>Reason why,</hi> which are the <hi>very Life and Soul of all Knowledge,</hi> is revealed to be from <hi>the Mercy of God,</hi> through <hi>the Blood of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveness of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi> And the rather may we be bold to say,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105027:85"/>
that the <hi>pardon of Sin is cleared up in the Person of Christ;</hi> because so <hi>Authentick,</hi> so <hi>Infallible</hi> an Author as ours is, has given us leave to believe, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. that <hi>the Gospel-Covenant is sealed with the Blood of Christ, and therefore we can desire no greater Security.</hi> And this I am sure of, from <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. that the Summe and Substance of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my People;</hi> and a main Branch of that Covenant, <hi>I will be Merciful to their Iniquities, and Remember their Sins no more.</hi> If then we could but clear this one Poynt, that <hi>the Bliod which Sealed this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> was not <hi>the Blood of a Doctrine,</hi> nor <hi>of an Office,</hi> nor <hi>of the Church,</hi> but <hi>the precious Blood of Iesus Christ, the Son of God,</hi> even the <hi>Blood of a Person;</hi> it would then be <hi>clear</hi> also, that <hi>God's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy is only clearly</hi> (or so clearly however) <hi>to be discovered in Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) For the Term [Eminently] if the Bluster be against that, I shall not much trouble my self, I am no great Friend to, because poorly skilled in <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical</hi> Notions; but as it stands here <hi>in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> with other <hi>honest words,</hi> I see no harm in't. To me it denotes no more, but that <hi>the Pardon of sin,</hi> is Notably, Chiefly, Gloriously, and <hi>in a most Special and Excellent manner,</hi> discovered in the Personal Sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ: But if our Author after all this be not satisfied, but finds himself Aggrieved, the Law is open, I plead no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, let him take his Course, and the Remedy the Law has given him.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Therefore it must needs be that last word <hi>Savingly,</hi> that is guilty of all, and therefore must bear the Charge brought in against the whole Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105027:85"/>
That <hi>pardon of sin is only savingly discovered in Iesus Christ.</hi> I cannot tell, but I do shrewdly conjecture that our Author has spoken <hi>as dangerous a thing</hi> as this comes to, and has given us sufficient warrant to distinguish between <hi>a vain, empty, Insignificant Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>an Useful, Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and <hi>Saving Knowledge,</hi> pag. 36. <hi>There is</hi> (says he) <hi>a larger Notion of the Knowledge of Christ, which includes the Vertue and Efficacy of this Knowledge.—For how true soever our Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be, the Scripture brands all those as Ignorant of God, who do not love, Reverence and Obey Him.</hi> Now if the Doctors Book had had but the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to have seen the World after our Authors, he might have Explained himself so as to come off with a dry Head: <hi>Notwithstanding what I have said of Gods Sin-pardoning mercy, and the Knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as in Him;</hi> yet there is <hi>another Knowledge thereof, which Includes and takes in the knowledge of this God to be our God, and pardoning our sins, which God is, only in and through the Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> and therefore <hi>the Scripture brands all those as Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of God, and his pardoning Mercy, who know him not as their God, in a Covenant of Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ is the Mediator, and therefore without Him we can have no Saving-knowledge of, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God, or his Sin-pardoning Goodness, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Speculations may be of Mercy and Grace, and Pardon to be in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all this Trouble our Author has put me to, and just as much that I have put the Reader to; the Mischief on't all is this: The Doctor says not one Word, Syllable, Letter, Jot, or Tittle of all this, but the contrary. I am sure the Reader
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105027:86"/>
is startled, and his Hair begins to stand an end: What, no Truth on Earth? Is <hi>Astraea</hi> more than in a Fable gone to Heaven? Well Reader, when thou art come to thy self, and art a little more Cool and Composed, Consult the Doctors Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 90. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>There are some of the most eminent Properties of God, that there is not the least Glimps to be attained of out of the Lord Jesus Christ, but only by and in Him; and some that comparatively we have no Light of but in Him, and of all the rest no true Light but by Him.</hi> In which words, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor evidently sorts all Gods Properties under three Heads. 1. Such whereof there is <hi>not the least glimps to be attained</hi> out of Christ, and under this Head he reckons <hi>Gods Love, his pardoning Mercy or Grace to sinners.</hi> 2. Such whereof we have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively no Light</hi> but in Christ; and to this Head he refers, Gods Vindictive Justice in punishing Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>Of all the rest</hi> he affirms we have <hi>no true Light</hi> but <hi>by Him:</hi> Now concerning the second sort, he says, <hi>pag.</hi> 92. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>Secondly, There are other Properties of God, which though also other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways discovered, yet are so clearly, eminently, and savingly, only in Iesus Christ.</hi> Now Reader, for a tolerable pair of Eyes: Our Author would make the Doctor say, that <hi>Gods pardoning Mercy is clearly, eminently, and savingly, only discovered in Christ:</hi> But the Doctor himself says, <hi>Sin-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning-mercy is not at all known, there's not the least glimps of it but in Christ.</hi> So pag. 91. <hi>Out of Christ there's not the least Conjecture of it, not the least Morsel to be tasted of it out of Christ:</hi> That is, God has not any way, any where, at any time, discovered that he will pardon a Sinner but upon
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105027:86"/>
the Account of his Son. And now Reader, I hope I may fairly protest against our Authors Bills for the future, or however carry a very suspicious Eye over him, as being in his Quotations either sick of <hi>sapine Negligence, thick Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>transparent Malice;</hi> and let all men know by these presents, that henceforwards I shall not take his Word for a single Farthing.</p>
               <p>But how false or impertinent soever this be, I knew he did not raise all this dust, and make such a heavy adoe for Nothing; whatever the Doctors Principles and Assertions were, he was resolved to pay him home, and load him soundly with ill-favour'd Inferences, and mishapen Conclusions, and in that one Knack lies our Authors Master-piece. <hi>So that</hi> (sayes he) <hi>it seems the Gospel of Christ makes a very imperfect and obscure Discovery, of the Nature, Attributes and Will of God, and the Methods of our Recovery; we may throughly understand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is revealed in the Gospel, and yet not have a clear, and saving knowledge of these things, untill we get a more intimate Acquaintance with Christs Person.</hi> There was never any Man that made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use of <hi>id est</hi>'s, and <hi>so that</hi>'s, than our Authour. So that! The Doctor had said, That <hi>Christ hath revealed the Properties of God in his Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. and what would you now think follows from hence? Why surely, one would think; That therefore <hi>the Gospel of Christ makes a perfect and clear discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Nature, Attributes, and Will of God:</hi> Nay, there you are out (sayes our Author) for hence it followes, that <hi>the Gospel makes a very imperfect and obscure discovery of them:</hi> But what Necessity may there be to draw such a Conclusion from such
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105027:87"/>
a Doctrine? I will tell thee Reader in thy Ear, <hi>Sub Sigillo Concessionis,</hi> as a great Secret; Otherwise as excellent a piece as ever blessed the World with New Divinity, had got <hi>a knock in its Cradle,</hi> and would have retain'd <hi>a soft place in its head</hi> all the dayes of its life: Now that which he would fain fasten upon the Doctor, is a piece of the greatest Foolery Imaginable: As if he made <hi>the Person of Christ, no part of Gospel-Revelation;</hi> whereas 'tis indeed <hi>his great Principle,</hi> that Christ is <hi>the summe and substance of it:</hi> He could never once fancy it possible to have <hi>a through understanding of the Gospel,</hi> but we must <hi>ipso facto</hi> have also <hi>a through understanding of Christs Person;</hi> nor to have <hi>a through understanding of the Gospel,</hi> and Christ the Subject of it, but we must have also <hi>a through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Gods Nature, Attributes and Will, and of the Methods of our Recovery by Iesus Christ:</hi> But this is the Product of our Authors <hi>So that;</hi> which alwayes agrees with his Premises just like Brains and Stairs, Harp and Harrow.</p>
               <p>If therefore any one will do the Doctor Justice, he must read our Authors words backwards, with a pair of Hebrew Spectacles, and that will give him a truer Account of the Doctors Sentiments. <hi>The Gospel of Christ makes a very perfect, and clear discovery of the Nature, Attributes, and Will of God, and of the Methods of our Recovery, but we can never throughly understand what is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, unless we understand the Person of Christ, who is so considerable a part, and indeed the whole of Gospel Revelation. And by such a knowledge of Christ revealed in the Gospel, will the Person of Christ be justly advanced, and the Gospel which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:105027:87"/>
                  <hi>him greatly recommended:</hi> Shall we then smile at, or lament our Authors simple Conclusion? <hi>This sets up a New Rule of Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>Acquaintance with Christs Person, in whom dwells all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdom and knowledge.</hi> And here a vein of his old thredbare Fallacy discovers it self, which I now perceive (like the poysonous string in the Lamprey,) he resolves shall run through his whole Discourse; <hi>Dividing those things which God has joyned,</hi> and supposing those things <hi>inconsistent,</hi> which are indeed <hi>subservient one to the other. Christs Person</hi> is Revealed <hi>by the Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel, and <hi>not opposed</hi> to it; Christ <hi>as a Prophet</hi> reveals himself to our Faith as <hi>God-man,</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and as vested <hi>with all those</hi> Offices for the discharge of his whole Mediatory Employment. To advance his <hi>Person</hi> is <hi>not to degrade</hi> his Gospel; the Magnifying of <hi>a Prophet</hi> is <hi>no disparagement</hi> to his Prophesie: The Honouring of <hi>a King</hi> is <hi>no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to his Law: The Gospel is <hi>therefore</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, because it reveals to us <hi>so Excellent a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> as the <hi>Word made flesh,</hi> the Person of Redeemer: <hi>New Rule of Faith</hi> therefore we own <hi>none,</hi> and wish heartily that they who <hi>condemn us,</hi> whilest they pretend to <hi>abhorre Idols,</hi> did not <hi>commit</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> that they set not up <hi>New Rules of Faith,</hi> upon a pretence that <hi>the Scripture is not sufficient</hi> to direct <hi>our Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> in <hi>things pertaining to God;</hi> but it's Common for some to <hi>exclaim</hi> against feeding on the <hi>Devils flesh,</hi> who yet will sup soundly of <hi>the Broth that he is boyl'd in:</hi> But these things our Author has been told so often of, that I see it to no purpose to <hi>tell him a story,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I could <hi>find him Ears.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:105027:88"/>But these are but <hi>Velitations</hi> and <hi>light Skirmishes,</hi> our Author is preparing for a most <hi>terrible Charge</hi> upon the Doctor: These <hi>whiffling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Slanders</hi> do but make way <hi>for the Show,</hi> like the <hi>Turkish Spabi,</hi> good for nothing but to fill up <hi>the Trenches,</hi> or blunt the <hi>edge</hi> of his Enemies <hi>Weapons,</hi> we are now wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive the <hi>formidable Impression</hi> of his <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things he will Confound us all with; First, by shewing <hi>what Additions, This Dr.</hi> O. <hi>and some others make to the Gospel:</hi> And then Secondly, <hi>what an unsafe way of Arguing they use:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, [1] He will shew us, <hi>What Additions these men make to the Gospel, from an Acquaintance with Christs Person.</hi> I must needs say, I was extremely startled to hear <hi>a Charge of Additions to the Gospel</hi> brought in against any Man; I presently expected either <hi>unwritten Traditions,</hi> or <hi>immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or I know not what <hi>African Monster</hi> should stare me in the face: And I know nothing at which my Nature more recoyls, nothing more abhorring to my Temper, than <hi>such sawcy Additions;</hi> and the rather, because I presently remembred that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Curse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>If any one shall adde unto these things, God shall adde to him all the Plagues that are written in this Book:</hi> If Men will be <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> God will be <hi>Adding;</hi> if Men will <hi>adde</hi> their <hi>whimsical Inventions,</hi> God will adde his <hi>Righteous Iudgements;</hi> And for that Reason I never liked, either the <hi>Addition of Officers</hi> to those Christ has commanded to <hi>govern</hi> his Church, nor <hi>the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Canons</hi> to those by which he has appointed his Church to be <hi>governed;</hi> I alwayes thought it safest, to leave the <hi>Doctrine, Worship, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                  <hi>of Christ</hi> as we found them; we may be chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for <hi>adding,</hi> or <hi>substracting,</hi> but never for being <hi>no wiser</hi> than the Gospel; and when we have done our Best, and <hi>chopt</hi> and <hi>changed,</hi> we shall hardly ever <hi>make better</hi> than those Christ <hi>made</hi> for us: If therefore our Author can but prove <hi>his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as he has <hi>layd it,</hi> I am his <hi>absolute Creature,</hi> his <hi>prepared Man,</hi> and shall be sure <hi>to find for him</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Doctor, and a thousand more <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:</hi> But at last I perceive, all this is but the <hi>old stratagem</hi> of his Neighbours of <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> where the <hi>crafty Slut</hi> calls her Opponent <hi>Whore first,</hi> lest she should be prevented with as <hi>bad language,</hi> and <hi>better Proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are no less than <hi>Three Additions</hi> that this one single Doctor has <hi>made to the Gospel. In which</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>is summ'd up all true Wisdom and Knowledge, and not any one of them to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be obtained, or is manifested, but only in, and by the Lord Christ;</hi> Now though our Author had <hi>almost pored his eyes out with seeking for these things in the Gospel</hi> to no purpose, yet still he was so <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicacious</hi> as to espy one sorry, single, little word [<hi>by</hi>] which the Doctor had <hi>fallaciously added, to include the Revelations made by the Gospel.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that little word was added <hi>fallaciously</hi> or no, I shall not at present determine; but this I will say, that it was as <hi>mischievously</hi> and <hi>enviously</hi> added, as ever any word of that Bigness was added in the world; of <hi>set purpose</hi> no doubt, and <hi>propense Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> to spight our Authors design, and most <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely</hi> and <hi>barbarously,</hi> to cross all his Projects: For it's plain, that the Particle [<hi>in</hi>] referres to [<hi>obtaining,</hi>] and this other Particle [<hi>by</hi>] to [<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting,</hi>]
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105027:89"/>
which by resolving the Doctors words into <hi>their distinct Propositions,</hi> is more than evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <list>

               <p>[Obtained in him,] that is, <hi>Through his Merit, Mediation, Intercession or Procurement:</hi> And, [Manifested by him,] that is, <hi>By his Preaching, and the Preachings and Writings of his Evangelists and Apostles.</hi> Now had but the Doctor left out that one word [<hi>by</hi>] as a good Natur'd man would have done, our Author would have had a fair Ear of advantage to lay hold on, for reviling him, as <hi>excluding the Revelations of the Gospel;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must say it again, it was not <hi>so Civilly</hi> done of the Doctor, nor so <hi>like a Gentleman,</hi> as might have been expected <hi>from him,</hi> to insert that one word, to the apparent prejudice, hazard, if not utter <hi>disherison</hi> of our Author, his Cause, Learning, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick and Reputation: But yet he thinks it was <hi>fallaciously Added,</hi> because <hi>his first undertaking was, to shew how impossible it is to understand these things savingly and clearly, notwithstanding all those Revelations God hath made of himself, and his Will, by Moses and the Prophets, and by Christ himself, without an Acquaintance with Christs Person:</hi> He that cheats me <hi>once</hi> proves himself <hi>a Knave,</hi> but if he over-reaches me <hi>a second time,</hi> he proves me <hi>a Fool;</hi> Remembring therefore how Matters stood between <hi>our Author</hi> and <hi>my self,</hi> and that I was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bond</hi> never to trust him more, I took down the Doctors Book, and with the best Eyes and Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

Well, (sayes our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) let that pass; Oh the Charity of the Man, that will not ruine his Enemy all at once! and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it's not <hi>good Husbandry</hi> to eat up a Man at one Meal: <hi>Polyphemus</hi> himself would reserve <hi>Ulysses</hi> for a <hi>Breakfast,</hi> when he supped so liberally over night with picking the Bones of <hi>his Mates;</hi> and yet there was as much <hi>Discretion</hi> in the Case, as <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,</hi> not to shew <hi>his Teeth</hi> when he could <hi>not Bite,</hi>

or however not to <hi>fasten</hi> them where it might break <hi>his Fangs.</hi> But it will be seasonable to examine the particular Additions.</p>
               <p>(1) The first is, <hi>concerning the knowledge of God, his Nature, and Properties.</hi> And here the Doctor has made <hi>a great Addition,</hi> viz. that <hi>The Love of God to sinners, could never have entred into the heart of Man but by Christ,</hi> p. 90. Now our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor promises us, that <hi>he will not examine particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly every thing the Doctor sayes:</hi> Of which we have had good proof all along; for 'tis not his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to trouble himself with any more than what may conveniently serve his purpose, but without considering either Antecedents or Consequents, to Nibble at some Expression, that seems most lyable to Exception; but herein we begge not his <hi>favour,</hi> onely demand <hi>Iustice;</hi> That he may not Usurp a Liberty to suppose, that the Doctor asserts <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be wholly silent in this Matter.</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion silent! Alas, it rings loud with the continual sound of Gods <hi>pardoning Mercy</hi> to Sinners, onely the Doctor judges, that <hi>Revelation directs us to this Mercy of God through a Mediator, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it:</hi> When therefore our Author asks fo pert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the Doctor be not <hi>a confident Man to lay down such a Position:</hi> I onely teturn, that I have known our Author far <hi>more confident</hi> upon <hi>far less Grounds;</hi> when the Doctor has a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Confidence, let him be so and spare not: A great deal <hi>less Confidence</hi> may be <hi>sinfull</hi> when it wants a <hi>Basis</hi> proportionable to beare its weight; and <hi>a great deal more</hi> Justifiable, when it's born up with sufficient Warrant: Tell not me of the Doctors Confidence, but examine his Reasons for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105027:90"/>
it, and let us see what our Author can do to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount it. Truely he offers us but <hi>one thing,</hi> but I assure you, it's <hi>a knocker: The Experence</hi> (says he) <hi>of the whole World confutes him:</hi> Never was Man so confuted and confounded as he that stems the Experience of the whole World; for though I ever look'd upon Experience as a very ticklish way of Confutation; and the best way of employing them is to Experience in our own Souls the Virtue and Efficacy of certainly revealed Truths, and not to make them the Umpires of questionable Doctrines, yet I should be loth to run counter to the universal Sentiments of Mankind, and the Experience of the whole World shall carry a mighty stroke in my Judgement; but has our Author taken their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences by the Pole? and do they one and all give in their Suffrages against the Doctor? Yes, <hi>Both Iews and Gentiles, who knew nothing of what Christ was to doe in order to our Recovery, did believe God to be gracious and mercifull to sinners.</hi> I must own it, That Jews and Gentiles are a <hi>sufficient enumeration</hi> of particulars; they did once <hi>divide</hi> the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and if they both agree in their <hi>Verdict</hi> against the Doctor, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> he is gone for ever, being over-born with <hi>Epidemical</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

The <hi>Iews,</hi> they understood the Doctrine of <hi>the Pardon of sin to be in God,</hi> but then they understood by Promises, Prophecies, Types, Sacrifices, and the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, that <hi>God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Redeemer;</hi> the Gentiles, they <hi>knew Nothing of a Redeemer,</hi> but then they knew as little of <hi>the Pardon of Sin:</hi> But here our Author will knock the Matter Dead by an Argument. <hi>Those Natural Notions the Heathens had of God, and all those discoveries God made of himself in the works of Creation and Providence, did assure them that God is very good, and it's not possible to understand what Goodness is, without pardoning Grace.</hi> Not possible? that's a thousand pities! I have sometimes sat ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring our Authors singular Happiness, in defining <hi>to an inch</hi> so precisely, <hi>Necessaries</hi> and <hi>Impossibles,</hi> which are the two <hi>extremes of the Modes of Being:</hi> And yet our Author can at one stride or jump, pass from Necessity to utter Impossibility: Some did but venture to say, that <hi>God could not pardon sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some intervening security to his Iustice:</hi> And there grew such a Hubbub, and Out-cry upon't, as if the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> had over-run all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> and yet our Author, who can climb up all the stairs, from <hi>easie</hi> to <hi>difficult,</hi> from <hi>difficult</hi> to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,</hi> has resolved upon the Question, that from henceforth all shall adjudge it <hi>impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what Goodness is, without pardoning Grace.</hi> But is there indeed such a <hi>close Connexion,</hi> so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable a glewing</hi> together of these two, that we

The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 14. 16, 17. assures us, <hi>That God left not himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a witness, in that he did good, and gave them rain from Heaven, and fruitfull Seasons.</hi> It was more than he owed to Condemned Sinners, to afford them <hi>any kind of Goodness;</hi> he might have rained <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>showres of Brimstone</hi> upon their heads, and it was <hi>goodness</hi> that he did it not; in stead of those <hi>fruitfull seasons,</hi> he might have sent <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Cleanness of Teeth,</hi> and there was <hi>much Goodness</hi> in that; yet whether they could from hence bless themselves with <hi>a well-grounded</hi> Hope that he would <hi>pardon their Iniquities,</hi> I much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.

will of a Deity; I presently conclude, they had no settled fixed Apprehension of any such thing in God. For though they might hear a rumour, that there were a people in the World, towards whom God shew'd himself propitious and favourable, and that the way of the peoples part to reconcile this God to them, was by killing of Beasts, and offering up them to him in Sacrifice, and might therefore hence fall upon this practice of Sacrifices, yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>true use</hi> of them, what reference they had to a promised Mediator, they must needs fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and toss up and down in uncertainties about so weighty a Concern. Hence was it, that least they should not hit upon the True God, in that Crowd and Throng of Deities wherewith they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stockt the Commons, they set up an Altar <hi>To the unknown God;</hi> and least they should miss the right Sacrifice, and most acceptable Offering, sometimes they Sacrificed the <hi>worst,</hi> sometimes the <hi>best</hi> of Men; and sometimes to please their God the better, they would let him choose by Lot which he would have: They tryed Conclusions with almost all sorts of Creatures, and all to answer the demands of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Conscience, which as Gods Officer was alwayes haling and dragging them before the Barr of Gods Justice, to answer for their Delinquencies: Either then they had no Notices of Sin-pardoning Mercy, or what they had came not in from <hi>the Works of Creation and Providence,</hi> but were some scattered Beams, and broken Splinters of Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Knowledge, derived Originally to them from the People of God, who themselves had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by pure Revelation, in and through a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>

                  </hi> But, 3.

That these Properties of God <hi>are plainly revealed in the Scripture,</hi> is very true, but then the plainness of their Revelation lyes in this, that <hi>God will pardon Sinners upon the Account of a Mediator;</hi> Perhaps he would put a trick upon us by that word [<hi>Further</hi>] and therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, let him understand, that we own <hi>all these Properties of God to be plainly revealed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any further Acquaintance with Christs Person than what is therein Revealed.</hi> But our Author joggs on still. <hi>Had Christ never appeared in the World, yet we had Reason to believe, that God is thus wise and good,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> to pardon Sinners,] <hi>and holy and mercifull, not onely because the Works of Nature and Providence, but the Word of God</hi>

Jesus Christ was once to appear in the World, to reconcile God and Man; and as <hi>without Revelation</hi> we had <hi>never known,</hi> so <hi>without his Interposition</hi> we had <hi>never enjoy'd</hi> the Pardon of Sin. The truth is, Christ was a Teacher and a Prophet, to reveal the Nature and Will of God, <hi>before his Appearance in the flesh; The Spirit of Christ signified before-hand the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11. and those Sufferings had <hi>a Virtue and Efficacy</hi> to procure the Pardon of Sin long before they were actually undergone; for in Gods Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he was <hi>a Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World;</hi> yet still our Authors Larum is not run down: <hi>The appearance of Christ did not first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nature of God to us:</hi> No sure; God had revealed himself to be such a God long before, yet still <hi>upon the Account of that Propitiation and Atonement</hi> which in infinite Wisdom and Grace he had provided. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43 <hi>To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his Name, whosoever believeth on him, shall receive Remission of sins:</hi> It's much to a little, that our Author will flam off all this with a fine Tale of a Tub, that it's not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, but <hi>a Doctrine, a Gospel, a Church, an Office,</hi> or something, or nothing, provided it be not Christ himself, that is here intended; but the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105027:97"/>
Apostle has hedged out that Evasion, <hi>v.</hi> 39. It's he that <hi>was slain,</hi> and <hi>hang'd on a Tree,</hi> he that was <hi>raised again the third day,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 42. he that is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to judge the quick and the dead:</hi> And yet perhaps our Author with one Cast of his Office, can make it out how <hi>a Doctrine, a Church may be stain,</hi> and <hi>hanged on a Tree too;</hi> and if they be no better than some that have troubled the world, as no great matter if they were; however I shall not concern my self in its Confutation. For ought then that I can see, the Doctor may keep his Principles to himself, and his Confidence too, that <hi>Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace could never have enter'd into the heart of man, but by Christ;</hi> that is, that none could have had any security (whatever God is in his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that ever God would or could have pardoned Sinners without some Provision made for the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Honour of his Justice, as Ruler of the World, by a Mediator; which onely could be the Lord Jesus Christ. And to shut up this matter, we will stand to the Determination of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Art. 7. <hi>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New, for both in the Old and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, everlasting Life is offer'd to Mankind by Christ, who is the onely Mediator between God and Man; wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign, that the Old Fathers did look onely for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory Promises.</hi> Again, Art. 18. <hi>They are also to be held Accursed that presume to say, that every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, provided he be diligent to frame his Life according to the Light and Law of Nature; for, Holy Scripture doth set out unto us onely the Name of Jesus, whereby men must be saved:</hi> But this <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:105027:98"/>
is become to our young Fry, <hi>Brutum Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after all this Lirry of our Authors, he finds it seems, that he and his Antagonists, have not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed <hi>ad idem:</hi> The Question has been about <hi>the Sun in the Firmament,</hi> and the Answer was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Staffe that stood in the Chimney-corner; For</hi> (says he) <hi>considering what these men make of Gods Love, pardoning Mercy, Iustice, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>these Properties could never have been discover'd but by a too familiar Acquaintance with Christ's Person, for Nature and Revelation say Nothing of them.</hi> But why then did he not fix the true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these things in the first place, and never tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Reader with a <hi>wild, rambling, impertinent Story,</hi> which he now confesses was not one word to the purpose? For <hi>that which they call pardoning Mercy</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is not to be seen in Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and perhaps <hi>that which he calls so,</hi> may be seen <hi>in the Discoveries of Nature,</hi> and found growing upon every Hedge: We shall go near to entertain more Charitable thoughts of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the old Systematical Divines hereafter; for they would have set the <hi>Terms of a Question</hi> to rights, and <hi>stated</hi> the due bounds of the Meaning of words, before they had made a noyse and blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about the Confutation of their Adversaries: what our Author means by these things, we must leave in the Clouds as we found it, what others mean we are pretty well secured: But we are not so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of our Authors Honesty in this matter, who jumbles together those things which the Doctor had separated, and puts them all (Pell Mell) into the common Box, as if he had asserted, That <hi>the Love</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:105027:98"/>
                  <hi>of God to Sinners, his Justice against Sinners, his Patience with, and Long-suffering of Sinners, were none of them discoverable but by Christ;</hi> whereas the Doctor plainly and in terms asserts that <hi>Gods Iustice, Patience, Long-sufferance,</hi> may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise known, as we have heard before, and shall see again by and by: The Rise of our Authors Fury and Indignation against the Doctor, is from these words, <hi>p.</hi> 93. Com. <hi>God hath manifested the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalness of his Righteousness unto him, in that it was impossible that it should be diverted from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, without the interposing of a Propitiation. Now</hi> (says he) <hi>this is such a Notion of Iustice as is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly New, which neither Scripture nor Nature acquaint us with:</hi> And if it be so, I could heartily wish it underwent the <hi>Deleatur</hi> of an <hi>Expurgatory Index:</hi> but how strangely is our Author wheel'd about! it was but <hi>p.</hi> 42. that he deliver'd it with as much Confidence as most men are guilty of, That <hi>the Light of Nature, the Works of Creation and Providence, besides Revelation, doe assure us that God hath a Natural Love for all good men, but that he hates sin, and will certainly punish incorrigible sinners;</hi> from whence we might have been prone enough to have dropt into such an Error, that if <hi>Hatred of Sin,</hi> be as <hi>Natural to God,</hi> as his <hi>Love to good Men,</hi> he cannot but <hi>hate the one,</hi> and <hi>love the other:</hi> for God <hi>cannot act against</hi> his Nature, and <hi>must act</hi> according to his Nature. Nay, we should have concluded, that it holds <hi>more strongly a great deal,</hi> for his <hi>hatred of the one,</hi> than <hi>for his love of the other;</hi> seeing there's <hi>something of sin</hi> in <hi>good</hi> men, in the <hi>best</hi> of Men, which may <hi>allay</hi> his Love towards <hi>them,</hi> consider'd in their single and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105027:99"/>
Personal Capacities, but there's <hi>nothing at all</hi> in sin, not <hi>the least</hi> that may <hi>qualifie</hi> his Indignation against sin: And had we not been snib'd, we should have ventur'd further to say, that as God has <hi>a Natural Love to good Men,</hi> and will <hi>not fail</hi> to reward them; so he has <hi>a Natural displicency</hi> against sin, and therefore will <hi>not fail</hi> to reward it according to its demerits: And then because we are assured from a surer hand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. That <hi>the wages of sin is death;</hi> which <hi>by the opposition,</hi> clearly intends <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death;</hi> we could not much doubt, that a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy God will give to every one their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without the interposition of that Propitiation, whereof our Author makes so light: Thus I say we had concluded, but that our Author limits the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of punishment <hi>to incorrigible,</hi> and <hi>obstinate Sinners:</hi> but this is but a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and will not much mend the matter; both because those <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible ones</hi> are not so wholly corrected, but that still some remaining sins lodge in them, which are the Object of Divine abhorrency, and also because those Corrigible ones are onely pardoned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to Grace through the Interest which they have in the Sufferings of Christ; hence 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we confess our sins, he is faithfull and just to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our sins:</hi> which Faithfulness of God, has the Foundation of its Exercise in the satisfaction of his <hi>Vindictive Iustice,</hi> which being once answer'd, God <hi>that cannot lye,</hi> promises the pardon of Sin through Christ, which because he is faithfull and just, he will make it good to the truely penitent Sinner: But what Reason will our Author favour us with of his Blunt Negative? Why, <hi>All Mankind have accounted it an act of Goodness (without the least suspicion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:105027:99"/>
                  <hi>in it) to remit Injuries and Offences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exacting any punishment.</hi> I much doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Author was ever Principal Secretary of State to all Mankind, that he should be so privy to their Sentiments; his own daring Fancies, and crude Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are no just Standard of their Apprehensions; and I am well assured that some of Mankind, and such whose Learning and Judgement may vye with his, and may be supposed to know Mankind as well as himself, yet think not with him in this business; but I shall lay a few things in his way, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them.</p>
               <p>(1.) The Strength of his Argument lyes in <hi>a most gross and palpable Absurdity:</hi> viz. <hi>That there is the same Reason for Gods pardoning sin against his most holy Law, that there is for a private Persons charitable remitting a trespass against himself.</hi> That God <hi>as he is the Governour of the World,</hi> may wave the Execution of the Sentence threatned against, and due to the violation of his Rules of Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>a private Person</hi> may depart <hi>from his Right</hi> in <hi>a Six-penny</hi> matter; but these things are wonderfully mistaken: For, 1. Our Author confesses, that <hi>God will certainly punish all obstinate and incorrigible Offenders:</hi> but if <hi>sin be consider'd onely as an injury against a private Person,</hi> God may pardon <hi>even Impenitency and Incorrigibility</hi> it self: And if it be an act of Goodness to remitt <hi>such an Injury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least suspition of Injustice;</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> the Offence is, <hi>the greater will that Goodness triumph</hi> in remitting the <hi>greater Injury. The degree</hi> of sin <hi>alters not</hi> the Case: He that can pardon <hi>a Penny justly,</hi> may also <hi>a pound,</hi> who shall <hi>set limits</hi> to him how far he shall <hi>depart from his Right?</hi> 2. That
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105027:100"/>
the Case is not the same between God and Man, is evident from hence. Man <hi>may depart from his Right</hi> to his Servant, may Manumitt him, and release him from <hi>all dependance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> on him, from performance of <hi>all duty</hi> to him, as his Master; but it's impossible to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>suppose that God should discharge and acquitt a Creature from its dependance on, and its subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himself. 3. God is to be considered, not only as <hi>our Proprietor and Owner,</hi> but <hi>as our Governour and Ruler:</hi> Now the <hi>end of Government</hi> being <hi>the good and welfare</hi> of the Community, every viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law claims, either that Judgement and Execution pass upon the Offender, according to it; or if not, that good Security be put in, that neither the Honour of the Legislator suffer, Offenders be encouraged, nor the Common good damnified, which was certainly done by Jesus Christ: And God himself has declared how odious such an Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of spirit is in a Magistrate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>They who justifie the wicked, and condemn the Righteous, are both an abomination to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) There's a great suspition, nay clear evidence of injustice in <hi>a private Persons departing from his right</hi> in some Cases; we will suppose a summe of Money, which is all the Livelyhood of a Personand his Numerous Family; shall he not grievously sin, who shall <hi>depart from his Right,</hi> so far as to forgive this Debt. and turn all his Family a grazing upon the bare Common of Charity, which might have been plentifully provided for in a way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Justice? But still he prosecutes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison: <hi>He is so far from being Iust, that he is Cruel and Savage, who will remit no offence, till he hath satisfied his Revenge:</hi> Which were true, 1. If
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105027:100"/>
spoken of a <hi>private Person; Vengeance</hi> belongs not <hi>to any in that state,</hi> it's a flowre of the Crown; we are not to avenge our selves, we may prosecute our own Right lawfully, and yet even <hi>that</hi> managed <hi>with a revengefull</hi> Spirit, is sinfull. 2. A publick Person in <hi>punishing according to Law,</hi> ought not to be called <hi>cruel and savage,</hi> but <hi>just and righteous;</hi> when the holy God executes the Penalty of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law, he does <hi>not satisfie his Revenge,</hi> but <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his righteous Laws</hi> from Contempt; he will not have them trodden under foot, to please every sawcy and malapert Caviller, that shall tax him with <hi>savage Cruelty:</hi> And surely, there are Terms more becoming <hi>the Majesty of a holy God,</hi> which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might have bestow'd upon <hi>the righteous Iudge of all the Earth,</hi> in his Process against Sinners. That <hi>he is holy in all his wayes, righteous in all his works;</hi> that the <hi>same Law,</hi> which is <hi>the Rule of Duty</hi> and Obedience, is also <hi>the Rule of Punishing</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. But still he will be importunate: <hi>That part of Iustice which consists in punishing Offenders, was alwayes look'd upon as an Instrument of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore the exacting or remitting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was referred to the Wisdom of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> &amp;c. What he means by <hi>an Instrument of Government,</hi> I cannot well tell; but this I know, that Atheism will have God too to be <hi>an Instrument of Government,</hi> a <hi>politick Engine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to bridle the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-headed Multitude, and keep the Herd of the Vulgar in some awe: And I have learnt it from our Authors <hi>great Friend</hi> also, that <hi>the Articles</hi> of the Church are <hi>an Instrument of Peace,</hi> and no matter whether they be <hi>an Instrument of Truth;</hi> but I would gladly be satisfied in a few things 1. Who
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105027:101"/>
they are that call Gods <hi>punitive Iustice</hi> an Instrument of Government, and what warrant they have so to call it? I have read indeed that <hi>the Law is an Instrument of Government,</hi> but that the Righteousness and Justice of the Law-giver, in <hi>giving to every one his due,</hi> should be <hi>an Instrument of Government,</hi> seems to me an Arbitrary Term, onely invented that men might seem to say <hi>something,</hi> when indeed they say <hi>just nothing.</hi> 2. I would have a satisfactory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why <hi>That part of Iustice which consists in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Offenders, should be an Instrument of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and yet <hi>the other part</hi> which consists in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the Complyant and Tractable,</hi> should not be such; and why God may not as well choose whether he will <hi>reward the Righteous,</hi> as whether he will <hi>punish the Wicked.</hi> And then, 3. Whether this will be <hi>an Instrument of Goverment,</hi> or of <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Confusion;</hi> for if after all Obedience, and Disobedience, the Law be not <hi>the Rule</hi> of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Rewards and Punishments,</hi> Good night to both; If Laws be not executed, both they and the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver will be despised; and this great <hi>Instrument of Government</hi> will be like <hi>Iupiters Log,</hi> which made <hi>a noyse</hi> without <hi>execution;</hi> and the wicked will be tempted to doe evil, the Righteous discouraged in their Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let his <hi>Antecedent</hi> sink or swim, I am as little satisfied with his <hi>Consequent;</hi> That therefore <hi>the exacting or remitting of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was referred to the Wisdom of Governours, who might spare or punish as they saw Reason, without being unjust in either:</hi> For, 1. God has not left it to the <hi>Wisdom of Governours,</hi> whether they shall secure <hi>the Ends of Government</hi> or no; Nay, we are assured that the <hi>Iews</hi> under their <hi>Theocracy,</hi> were
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105027:101"/>
tyed up (in many Cases especially) and not left to their <hi>discretion,</hi> Numb. 35. 33. <hi>Thou shalt take no satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer, he shall surely be put to death.</hi> 2. What if God has <hi>obliged himself to the contrary,</hi> that he will <hi>not remitt</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but has made his holy Law <hi>the Rule</hi> of his dealing <hi>with us,</hi> as well as of <hi>our walking with him?</hi> Numb. 14. 6. 18. <hi>The Lord is long-suffering, and of great Mercy; and by no means clearing the guilty.</hi> Nay, what if this be the immediate <hi>result of Gods Nature,</hi> supposing an Offender? the Text makes this as <hi>essential</hi> to God as any of his other Attributes, and if our Author can exclude <hi>one,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it shall serve the Scene, will exclude <hi>all the rest,</hi> and then we shall have a God to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors hearts desire.</p>
               <p>In the Conclusion of this Point, our Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosoms himself to us, and ingenuously discovers the bottom of his heart; namely, that the Reason why he is so zealously engaged against <hi>the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative Iustice of God,</hi> is because he was well aware, that it would put in strongly for the Necessity of Christs Death: And he understood his Interest well enough; for <hi>the Iustice of God</hi> once admitted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces <hi>the Necessity</hi> of Christs Death, if it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that God will declare himself <hi>just in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of a Sinner;</hi> and <hi>the Death of Christ</hi> also reciprocally will prove the <hi>holy peremptoriness of Gods Iustice</hi> against Transgressors: For, what else could call for the Death of the Lord Jesus Christ? The Lord Jesus Christ was the onely begotten, and dearly beloved of the Father; free from Sin, <hi>in whom no guile was found,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 22. and not onely <hi>voyd of Sin,</hi> but <hi>full of Grace, exact in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>

Matth. 3. 16. <hi>he fulfill'd all Righteousness,</hi> and he durst avow it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 29. <hi>That he alwayes did those things that pleased his Father;</hi> so that his Eternal Father, in the view and Prospect of these things, declares that he was <hi>well-pleased with him, Math.</hi> 17. 5. Now let us consider, how the Father dealt with <hi>this Dear, this Holy, this onely Son,</hi> Isa. 53. 10. <hi>It pleased the Father to bruise him, he hath put him to grief, he laid upon him the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us all;</hi> what shall we say to these things? the Father was <hi>well-pleased with his Person,</hi> with <hi>his Obedience,</hi> and yet <hi>well-pleased with his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> also; he was <hi>made a Curse,</hi> who was <hi>blessed for ever,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. he dyed <hi>a poenal Death,</hi> who had no Guilt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>God spared not his own Son;</hi>

                  </gap> he spared him not in exacting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; <hi>Death came into the World by sin, and yet Christ dyed, who never sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. The Law <hi>in its Penalty</hi> had nothing to do with him, who had <hi>not offended</hi> the Law <hi>in its Rule:</hi> So that I profess, I know no greater wonder in the world, than that the Father would have him <hi>suffer,</hi> and that he should be <hi>Capable of Sufferings;</hi> till the wonder be removed by viewing Christ <hi>in the stead</hi> of others; and thus the Scripture assoyls the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>His Soul was made an Offering for sin;</hi> Nay, <hi>he was made sin for us, though he knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. He <hi>so loved the Church, that he gave himself for it:</hi> And appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Quality; Death, the Officer of Gods vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Law might <hi>justly</hi> arrest him, and the Father be <hi>pleased to bruise him,</hi> delighted in his Sufferings <hi>upon one account,</hi> who was so <hi>infinitely satisfied in</hi>

                  <hi>his Person</hi> upon <hi>another:</hi> And yet all this while our Author can see <hi>no necessity of Christs Death. I should rather have thought</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that Gods requiring such a Sacrifice as the Death of Christ, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not do otherwise, but because his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom judged it the most effectual way of dispensing his Grace.</hi> Then, 1. It seems though Gods <hi>infinite Wisdom</hi> saw this <hi>the best way,</hi> yet it might have consisted <hi>with his Wisdom</hi> to have pitch'd upon <hi>a worse;</hi> and then it will be a Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that had been Wisdom or no: For we are told, <hi>p.</hi> 48. <hi>That Wisdom consists in the choyce of the fittest and best Means to attain an End, when there are more wayes than one of doing it:</hi> If then <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom consist</hi> in choosing <hi>the fittest and best Means,</hi> and the Death of Christ was <hi>the best Means</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing of Gods Grace, either it was <hi>impossible</hi> for God to choose <hi>any other way</hi> than this, or it is <hi>possible</hi> for God to act in a way <hi>not consisting with Wisdom.</hi> But, 2. Our Author had highly obliged the World, had he discovered how sin might <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> have been expiated than by the Sacrifice of Christs Death. The <hi>Iews</hi> have pitch'd upon <hi>a Cock,</hi> and at last upon <hi>their own Death:</hi> But it's twenty to one, when our Author shall <hi>substitute</hi> any in the <hi>room of the perfect Sacrifice of Christ,</hi> we shall find as many <hi>real Inconveniences</hi> in it, as he has found <hi>imaginary absurdities</hi> in the Necessity of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring satisfaction to his Justice, and Christs Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it upon the Cross. But, 3. Who ever assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>simply</hi> that God could doe <hi>no otherwise</hi> than to require the Sacrifice of Christs Death? Alas, our Author is wide the whole Heavens in this Matter; It must first be supposed, that <hi>God will treat with</hi>

                  <hi>the sinner,</hi> and that Christ <hi>will accept the Terms of being a Mediator between God and Man;</hi> The Necessity proceeds upon <hi>a presupposed Voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> both in the Father and in the Son; and when you have supposed them, there are who will dispute it with our Author when he pleases, that <hi>upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position God will accept and justifie a sinner, a just Compensation must be made to wronged Iustice.</hi>

It sheweth how his Iustice is founded in his Holiness, and his Governing Relation; It justifieth it by opening the Purity of his Nature, the Evil of Sin, and the use of Punishment to the right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; and it magnifieth it, by opening the Dreadfulness, and Certainty of his Penalties, and the Sufferings of our Redeemer, when he made himself a Sacrifice for our Sins.</hi>

               <p>But the storm is not yet over, nor our Authors Fury quite spent. Dr. <hi>O.</hi> had said, <hi>Com.</hi> pag. 94, 95. <hi>That there are many Glympses of the Patience of God towards Sinners, shining out in the Works of his Providence; but all exceedingly beneath that discovery which we have of it in Christ; for in him the very Nature of God is discovered to be Love and Kindness; whatever discoveries were made of</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:105027:103"/>
                  <hi>the Patience and Lenity of God to us, yet if it were not withall revealed, that his other Attributes, his Iustice and Revenge for Sin, had their actings assigned them to the full, there could be little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation gather'd from his Patience and Lenity:</hi> It were very hard if a Spider could suck <hi>no poyson</hi> out of these words, and I should conclude she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>her Nature;</hi> but what was there in all this that could exasperate a sweet natur'd Gentleman? Whilest a sinner hangs by the <hi>meer forbearance</hi> of God, he hangs but over Hell-fire by <hi>a single Thread,</hi> and if that breaks, he falls irrecoverably into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Burnings; and it can be <hi>little Consolation</hi> (the Doctor was gentle, he might have used a harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er word, and said <hi>just none at all,</hi>) to an awakened Conscience, to have a place <hi>in Gods forbearance,</hi> when he has none <hi>in his Forgiveness,</hi> or to depend upon <hi>mere patience,</hi> without an interest in Gods <hi>pardoning Mercy:</hi> God may have <hi>patience with,</hi> when he has <hi>no pardon for</hi> a sinner; he had so for the Old World, for <hi>Sodom,</hi> for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which yet perisht under his just displeasure: A sensible Soul will be apt to argue thus, I am <hi>reprieved,</hi> but is my <hi>Pardon sealed?</hi> God visits not my Iniquities upon me, but will he <hi>remember them no more?</hi> Those that are <hi>the familiar Acquaintances of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and of <hi>the Cabal</hi> to Common Reason, have told me, that <hi>Forbearance is no Acquittance;</hi> that <hi>Patience abused, turns into Fury;</hi> Nay perhaps it may be in Judgement that a Sinner is forborn; for God hath sometimes <hi>suffered the Nations to walk in their own wayes,</hi> Acts 14. 16. <hi>And endured with much long-sufferance the Vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction:</hi> But <hi>now through Christ the Nature of</hi>

                  <hi>God is discover'd to be Love and Kindness; for seeing Provision is made for, and regard had of all his other Attributes and Essential Perfections, God can secure to himself the Glory of them all, and yet the Sinner escape wrath to come:</hi> And indeed it's altogether <hi>as unaccountable</hi> why God should be <hi>mercifull</hi> to the reproach of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> as why he should be <hi>severe</hi> to the disparagement of his <hi>Mercy;</hi> As the Goodness of God naturally disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it self in doing good, (where all due requisites are found) so does Justice as readily exert it self upon the Sinner, where a Propitiation doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose; And if Conscience were rightly instructed in its Office from the Word, it would mind the Sinner, that God can be <hi>just in destroying,</hi> without the least Impeachment of <hi>his Mercy and Goodness;</hi> since <hi>Mercy it self</hi> is not obliged to plead for the Sinner, without respect had to the other Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that God who is Essentially what he is: But has our Author never a Stone to throw at the head of this Truth? Two things he offers, most lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and horrid <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) Here's most wretched <hi>Ignorance. A happy Change</hi> (sayes he) <hi>this, from all Iustice, to all Love.</hi> No Sir, don't trouble your self, here's <hi>no Change at all,</hi> happy or unhappy: God is the same holy, just, righteous, gracious and loving God that ever he was, <hi>onely,</hi> (sayes the Doctor) <hi>he's otherwise disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi> Justice and Mercy are <hi>not contrary things</hi> in God; he can be <hi>all Love and Mercy,</hi> and yet <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Sinner</hi> that cannot plead the Death of Christ for his Discharge; and he can be <hi>all Iustice</hi> too, and yet <hi>pardon the believing, repenting Sinner</hi> through Jesus Christ: The Change is <hi>not made in</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:105027:104"/>
                  <hi>God,</hi> with whom is <hi>no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> variableness nor shadow of turning,</hi> but the Change is made <hi>in the State and Condition</hi> of the Creature, who once standing upon his <hi>own bottom,</hi> and so considered by a holy and righteous God, was the Object of just displeasure, but now being <hi>found in Christ,</hi> and so eyed by God, is in another Capacity, and meet to enjoy the benefit of that Grace and Love, to which before such Qualification he had no right, and whereof he was utterly incapable.</p>
               <p>(2) I wish <hi>Ignorance</hi> had been the worst that might be charg'd upon his Discourse; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here's a vein of the most unparallel'd <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Drollery,</hi> that ever faced the World with <hi>an Imprimatur;</hi> except <hi>Friendly Debates, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Policies,</hi> and some few others of <hi>the same Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> And first he will represent the Holy God in his taking Vengeance, or requiring Satisfaction, like <hi>an angry passionate Man;</hi> and the Grace of God upon the Account of Christ's Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to the Kindness of <hi>a revengefull Man when he has glutted himself with Revenge, and his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is over.</hi> I think it might become our Author, or the proudest Worm on Earth, to have spoken more reverently of the way of Gods dealing with repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners through our Lord Jesus Christ: That discomposure and perturbation of Mind to which frail man is obnoxious, falls not upon the great God; he can <hi>turn the wicked into Hell, and all those that forget God,</hi> without Passion; <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> saith God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 4. An earthly Judge in <hi>his private Capacity,</hi> may weep when he pronounces Sentence of Death against a Malefactor, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is <hi>a Iudge;</hi> and <hi>cut off from the</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:105027:105"/>
                  <hi>City of God the wicked of the Land: Nihil minùs quam irasci punientem decet: Nothing is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely in him that punisheth than Passion:</hi> And though we read of Gods <hi>Anger, Wrath, and Fury;</hi> yet it becomes us to conceive of God <hi>according to his Dignity,</hi> even when he represents himself <hi>to our Capacity;</hi> Though God <hi>humble himself,</hi> we have no warrant <hi>to abase him;</hi> whatever things are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God which are common to Men, it's our Duty to <hi>garble out</hi> all the Imperfections and Frailties that those Qualities are mixed and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>in Men,</hi> before we ascribe them to God.</p>
               <p>But this is not the worst, he will strain his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Drollery a few Notes higher: <hi>The summe of which is, that God is all Love and Patience when he has taken his fill of Revenge, as others use to say, the Devil is good when he is pleased.</hi> This is indeed the summe of all our Authors blasphemous Froth, but neither the total summe, nor any particular of what the Doctor has ever asserted: The summe of the Doctors words is this: <hi>That God is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge of all the Earth, and that it's a righteous thing with him to render to every Man according to his Works, and yet he has pleased to admit of Satisfaction to be made by his Son Iesus Christ, who most willingly offer'd himself a Propitiatory Sacrifice to God; In which Son of his, whoever shall believe, God is ready to pardon and forgive him:</hi> And now must the plain Truth of the Gospel be thus muffled up, and disguised in ugly Expressions, to render it lyable to scorn and contempt? Thus have the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists array'd the Martyrs of Jesus in the <hi>Sambenit</hi> or <hi>Devils-Coat,</hi> first shewing them <hi>as Hereticks,</hi> and then sacrificing them to the flames. I see he has
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105027:105"/>
furnish'd himself with a Creep-hole, It's not <hi>as he, but as others say;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As 'tis applyed it's his own, and yet it hits not nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the Devil is never <hi>so pleased as to become Good,</hi> nor God ever <hi>so displeased as to become Evil:</hi> Nay, the Devil is then <hi>worst</hi> when he is <hi>pleas'd,</hi> for the <hi>greatest evil pleaseth him best,</hi> and God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously excellent when he is <hi>displeased,</hi> for the <hi>greatest Evil</hi> is the Cause of his <hi>displeasure.</hi> But let this pass for an Ornament of our Authors style, which is indeed embellished with Figures, but none more beautifies it than this, which we may well call <hi>a Satanismus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has not yet done, he has not loaded the Truth with Reproach to his mind, and therefore one <hi>id est</hi> will doe it. <hi>That is, he would not believe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, should he make never so many Promises of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and gracious to Sinners, unless he were sure he had first satisfi'd his Revenge.</hi> But let him not be angry: We believe <hi>every Promise</hi> that God has made of being <hi>gracious to Sinners,</hi> but we say, we cannot find one such, without Provision first made for the securing Gods Righteousness. Shew us a Promise that is, <hi>Yea and Amen, and not in Christ.</hi> Produce that Promise wherein God is engaged <hi>to justifie a Sinner,</hi> and <hi>not be just himself;</hi> quote us the place from whence we may flatter our selves, that God will destroy any of his Attributes to save a Sinner. However therefore our Author has <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented God,</hi> he has thus <hi>represented himself.</hi> 1. That he is a Holy God, <hi>A God of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold evil, and that he cannot</hi> (which is the Word so displeases the Man) <hi>look on iniquity;</hi> he cannot
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105027:106"/>
                  <hi>but see it</hi> wherever it is, as he is omniscient; and yet he <hi>cannot see it,</hi> cannot look on it, wherever it is, without Abhorrency: He is a holy God, and from his Natural and Essential Holiness does it arise, that he cannot behold sin with Approbation, and therefore must and will punish it: Thus has he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee; The foolish shall not stand in thy sight, thou hatest all the workers of Iniquity.</hi> 2. God further testifies of himself, that he is <hi>the righteous Iudge of all the Earth,</hi> Governing and Judging the World according to his <hi>own holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the Rules of <hi>his holy Law;</hi> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Authors <hi>good Nature,</hi> and <hi>the Rules</hi> that he shall prescribe to him; and therefore, 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his <hi>holy Nature,</hi> and <hi>holy Law;</hi> it shall <hi>not be with the Righteous after the way of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> nor <hi>with the Wicked after the way of the Righteous,</hi> for <hi>the Iudge of the whole Earth must do right;</hi> This God has revealed, and we believe, and as much more as shall be made known to us to be of his Revelation. But that God is <hi>so indifferent</hi> about Sin, as these men would perswade us, that those Scoffers, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>The Lord will not doe good, neither will he doe evil,</hi> did charge God wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we do not believe; but that he insists upon <hi>the Honour</hi> of his Attributes, <hi>the Credit</hi> of his Laws, <hi>the Vindication</hi> of his Authority; which Ends if they may be otherwise attained than by Christ, and his Sacrifice, yet our Author has not yet discover'd to us the Way; and however he has confessed that <hi>Christ is the best and most effectual Means of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:105027:106"/>There are a few drops which follow this Storm, yet behind. The Doctor had said, <hi>p.</hi> 96, 97. <hi>That God does sometimes bear with Sinners, and forbear them long, and yet there may be no special design of Mercy in it neither: But now evidently and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, the End of the Patience and Forbearance of God which is exercised in Christ, and discovered in him to us, is the saving, and bringing unto God those towards whom he is pleased to exercise them; God is now taking a Course in his infinite Wisdom and Goodness, that we may not be destroyed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our sins:</hi> which a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 97. <hi>sect.</hi> 15. he explains to be, by <hi>leading us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Now I knew it would be no difficult task to a willing Mind, to put an <hi>ugly Vizor</hi> upon the <hi>fairest Face,</hi> which thus he has done. <hi>As before, the least Sin could not escape without a just Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so now the Iustice of God being satisfied by the Death of Christ, the greatest Sins can do us no harm, but we shall be saved notwithstanding our sins.</hi> But I doubt our Author will be miserably disappointed in his Markets, and lose Money by his dirty Ware. 1. <hi>The least Sin cannot escape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Punishment.</hi> Very true, we own it; <hi>The wages of Sin is Death:</hi> the Threatning is level'd at Sin, <hi>as Sin,</hi> and therefore against <hi>all sin: A quatenus ad Omne valet Consequentia:</hi> and therefore go scold with the Apostle, that which will bring him off, will bring off the Doctor. 2. The Justice of God is <hi>Natural and Essential</hi> to him. Well, let him mend himself how he can, we are of the same mind still, and are like to be so. 3. He cannot <hi>forgive sin,</hi> without <hi>punishing</hi> it: Goe on; somewhere or other the Punishment <hi>must lye,</hi> which amounts to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105027:107"/>
no more but this, that God cannot forgive sin, but in such a way as may secure his Glory. 4. <hi>The Iustice of God is satisfied by the Death of Christ:</hi> It is so; but that Satisfaction is <hi>applyed</hi> to particular persons, in that way that God has appointed, that no other of his Attributes may be damnified. 5. <hi>Now the greatest sins can doe us no hurt.</hi> Nay, there our Author is quite out: For Unbelief, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, Unregeneracy, obstruct the Sinners having any share in the Satisfaction of Christ, or the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits procured by it: But, 6. The Doctor had said, <hi>We shall be saved notwithstanding our sins;</hi> He does say, we shall <hi>not be destroyed;</hi> and let that amount (if he pleases) to We <hi>shall be saved.</hi> That is, 1. <hi>Former Sins repented of,</hi> shall not be charged upon the Sinner <hi>to Condemnation.</hi> 2. Such sins as are <hi>consistent with the state of Grace,</hi> the Power, and Predominancy of Godliness shall not eventually ruine the repenting Sinner; and for those that <hi>are inconsistent</hi> with that state, he that undertook to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for them, will also take care they shall <hi>not commit them,</hi> that he may not lose the Fruit of his Death and Sufferings, and therefore he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that <hi>he will put his Fear into their hearts, that they shall never depart from him.</hi> And now I think our Author has either lost Money by his Discourse, or got it over the Shoulders: All his hopes were to perswade us, That the Doctor design'd to assert, that <hi>the satisfaction of Christ would save sinners, notwithstanding their sins lived in, continued in, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and dyed in; in sensu composito:</hi> but let an ordinary Understanding, with ordinary diligence read over that Paragraph, and he shall find all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring with that great Truth, <hi>Without Holiness no</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:105027:107"/>
                  <hi>man shall see God:</hi> And thus he has talk'd his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure about <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Gods <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which most gloriously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this design of Saving sinners by Christ, the Doctor had said, Com. 98. <hi>That Gods Wisdom in managing things for his own Glory, is clearly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Christ:</hi> And if Wisdom display it self in the works of Creation and Providence, and in his holy Law, yet still Wisdom is most eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in a Mediator; and he was the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened thus to speak, because he had encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>We preach Christ crucified, to the Iews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness, but to them who are saved, both Iews and Greeks, the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God:</hi> And here I confess our Author had just Cause of Complaint, That the Apostle should so unluckily place <hi>this Wisdom in a crucifyed Christ,</hi> to the utter undoing <hi>that laudable Invention</hi> of Christ for an Office, a Church, a Doctrine; and this might well vex every vein of his heart: But still the Doctor proceeds (and for ought I can see, minds our Author no more, than you would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about that peevish thing that infests your skins as you walk the streets with impotent Noyse,) shewing, That <hi>this Wisdom of God is such a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, such hidden Wisdom, such manyfold, variegated, curiously wrought Wisdom, that the Angels desire to pry into it, and the Wisdom thereof lyes much in this; That by Christ, things are recovered into such a state, after the Confusion wherein they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved by the Curse, as shall be exceedingly to the advantage of Gods glory.</hi> P. 98, 99. This indeed was pungent, and galled that tender part, which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105027:108"/>
cannot endure to hear too much Good spoken at once of Christs Person: <hi>For,</hi> (says he) <hi>if Justice be so Natural to God, that Nothing could satisfie him but the Death of his own Son, this may discover his Justice, but not his Wisdom.</hi> Why so? Oh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is plain: <hi>Wisdom consists in the choyce of the best and fittest Means to attain an End, where there are more wayes than one of doing it, but it requires no great wisdom where there is but one possible Way.</hi> Where I am stumbled at our Authors Philosophy, as much as at his Divinity. For, 1. Saving to our Author his good Learning; Wisdom lyes also in <hi>Managing fit Means</hi> in such a Way as may <hi>reach their Ends effectually,</hi> that there be no disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Issue by male Administration; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Gods Wisdom seen, that he <hi>carries on,</hi> as well as <hi>layes the Design</hi> of saving Sinners, with <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Success,</hi> maugre all the Counterminings, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Contrivances of Hell; <hi>One way</hi> that reaches the End <hi>effectually,</hi> is worth a thousand, that prove <hi>addle,</hi> and bring forth nothing but Wind; and he might have learnt so much from the Fable, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. Wisdom lyes in <hi>reconciling differing Interests,</hi> in <hi>adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various Pretensions</hi> and Claims of the concerned Parties; these Contrasto's of bandying Parties clashing one with another, render Healing designs difficult: <hi>The Iustice of God</hi> demands <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> the holy Law of God abetts that Demand, the Truth of God backs both their Claims; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace and Mercy can be actually exercised towards the Sinner, some Expedient must be found out to content those Demands; and all this God hath done in Christ, in whom <hi>Mercy and Truth have</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:105027:108"/>
                  <hi>met together, Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other,</hi> Psal. 85. 10. 3. Its Wisdom to find out a Means to reach an End, though there be but <hi>that one Mean</hi> to be found in the whole Circle and compass of Beings. We should not much reproach that Physician that should discover to his dying Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient an effectual Remedy, though it prove the onely one in the world; and we will own him for an <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> that will prescribe to our Author a good round dose of Hellebore, and yet it's more than probable, it's the onely Drug upon Earth that can purge out that frantick, insulting, petulant humour which in his Writings fills both Pages: At length seeing there is no other Remedy, our Author will allow <hi>some small Wisdom</hi> to appear in the Design, but then <hi>the Knowledge of it all is owing to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the Gospel, and not to any fanciful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Christ.</hi> Still we are haunted with that old Fallacy, which by this time I had hoped had been quite worn out at the Elbowes; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the knowledge of this Wisdom is owing to the Gospel Revelations, therefore nothing is due to him, who is the Reason and Ground of this wise and happy Contrivance: And so this Bolt also is soon shot.</p>
               <p>(2) The second Addition the Doctor is charged with, is: <hi>That a great part of our Wisdom lyes in the knowledge of our selves, and that both in respect of Sin, and Righteousness, and that we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to these but in and by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, [1] For Sin, the Doctor had said, <hi>p.</hi> 110. Com. <hi>That our disability to answer the Mind and Will of God, in any of that Obedience which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, is in Christ onely to be discovered.</hi> And the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105027:109"/>
Doctor has herein asserted two things: 1. That there is in every man <hi>a Natural Impotency</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Will of God: And he seems not to be so peremptory in it as the Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves, all our sufficiency is of God: It's God that works in us to will and to doe of his own good pleasure;</hi> and if we be deceived by these and many other such Testimonies, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was misled by them as well as we: <hi>Art.</hi> 10. <hi>The Condition of Man after the Fall of Adam, is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own Natural strength.</hi> Our Author durst once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Experience of the whole world; will he stand before the same Tribunal, and be judged in this Case? There are such <hi>universal Complaints</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this very thing, and such dismal stories all men tell of their <hi>Impotency,</hi> and <hi>disability</hi> to answer Gods Laws, that that Man should labour under insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable prejudices that will controle all mens Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; I know They talk most of <hi>the Easiness of keeping Gods Law,</hi> who never tryed it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if they were well pump'd, they mean nothing but how <hi>easie it is to break it:</hi> Let any man set himself in his own strength to discharge one single Command of God in its full extent and latitude, keeping it with his whole heart, laying out his whole strength and might therein, which that holy Law challenges, let him attend to the Purity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that, and severely compare himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, dress himself in that Glass; and when he has made some fruitless Essayes, and been foyled and baffled with vain attempts, he may then perhaps see more need of Christ than before, and may spare the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105027:109"/>
Experience of <hi>the whole World;</hi> for his <hi>own singly</hi> will convince him of <hi>his disability to answer the Law of God, in all or any of that Obedience which he therein requireth.</hi> 2. The Doctor conceives, That <hi>this Impotency of ours is discovered clearly in the Death of Christ,</hi> wherein he is warranted by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ dyed for the ungodly.</hi> In his Divinity we see, <hi>a Sinner,</hi> and <hi>one without strength,</hi> are <hi>convertible terms,</hi> and that the Death of Christ supposed it. All the difficulty here will be, How our Author shall expose this Truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it to its greatest disadvantage; but he has a singular Talent that way, and whereof we need never to despair. <hi>That is,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>It's impossible for us to do any thing that is good, but we must be Acted like Machines by an external Force, by the irresistible Grace and Power of God;</hi> And the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is done:</p>
               <p>But, 1. Our Author is hugely out, in supposing the Doctor to assert that, <hi>It's impossible to doe any thing that's good.</hi> Some good thing a Man may do, and yet not doe all that's required in doing it; <hi>the Material part</hi> of a Duty he may doe, and yet not perform it in such a way that it may <hi>answer Gods Law,</hi> or be <hi>acceptable to him. Bonum oritur ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegris,</hi> there must be <hi>a right Principle,</hi> a <hi>right End,</hi> and all circumstances must concurre to make it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely good: I think there are none that deserve the Name of Christians, who do not pray to God for <hi>his Grace to enable them to do their Duty;</hi> but if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they could perform it <hi>in their own strength,</hi> I see not what that Prayer would signifie more than <hi>a Complement; Quid foris quaeram cùm domi habeam?</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:105027:110"/>
Why should a rich Man turn a Beggar? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Heathens Principles hung together with more Consistency, who would not trouble their Gods for what they had in their own Power, nor thank them for that which they had earned with their own fingers-ends. <hi>Quia unusquisque sibi vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem acquirit, nemo sapientum de eâ gratias Deo egit. Since every man is the Procurer of his own Vertue, no wise man ever gave thanks to the Gods for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He is no less mistaken, if he presumes upon his Power to tye the Doctor to use what Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he pleases in signifying his own Thoughts; it may be he will not use that term of <hi>irresistable,</hi> it will satisfie him, if Grace work <hi>efficaciously in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Will:</hi> And if by <hi>irresistable Grace</hi> no more be meant than a <hi>powerfull</hi> and <hi>effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> of the <hi>principle of Grace</hi> in the Soul, it's no more than what God has promised in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>A new heart also will I give them, and I will take away the heart of Stone out of their flesh, and I will give them an heart of Flesh:</hi> And he that removes the <hi>onely resisting Principle</hi> in the Soul, [the Heart of Stone,] may be said well enough to act <hi>irresistably</hi> in the working of Grace: Nor can I see any danger in ascribing such a way of working to the Holy Spirit; nor did the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.—<hi>who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him up from the dead:</hi> where the Apostle is not afraid, nor ashamed to ascribe <hi>the working of Faith</hi> to the <hi>same Power</hi> that <hi>raised up Christ from the dead;</hi> and he that had a mind to make a fluster with Greek like our Author, could

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105027:111"/>
had said: <hi>There are Four things in sin, that clearly shine forth in the Death of Christ,</hi> 1. <hi>The Desert of it.</hi> 2. <hi>Mans Impotency by reason of it.</hi> 3 <hi>The Death of it.</hi> 4. <hi>A New end put unto it.</hi> Against the <hi>two former,</hi> he has sufficiently Discovered his feeble Passion, the third he waves, and now against the fourth he Rises up with incredible Zeal and Fury. For, says the Doctor, <hi>Sin in its own Nature tends merely to the Dishonour of God, the Ruine of the Creature; but now in the Lord Iesus Christ there is the Manifestation of another, and more Glorious end,</hi> viz. <hi>The praise of Gods glorious Grace, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveness of it, God having taken order in Christ, that that thing which tended merely to his Dishonour, should be managed to his Infinite Glory.</hi> And here our Author has need of all his Machines and Engines, that he may disorder things so as to serve his turn of them, and therefore upon good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise no doubt reserved them all for this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>One Machine</hi> which he plies, is that <hi>old Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Engine,</hi> called <hi>Invidious Representation;</hi> and this will do good Service still for want of a better. <hi>That is</hi> (says he) <hi>lest Gods Iustice and Mercy should never be known, to the World, he appoints and Ordains sins to this end, that is Decrees that Men shall sin, that he may make some of them Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Wrath, and others the Vessels of his Mercy, to the praise of his Grace in Christ.</hi> It's a sad Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery to satisfie wilfully blind Malice: For what more plain from the Doctors words, than that he speaks not Hot or Cold of Gods <hi>Ordaining men to sin,</hi> but of his <hi>putting a New end to sin, upon supposition that it is already in the World.</hi> Cannot God bring <hi>Good out of Evil,</hi> but our Author must go Mad?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105027:111"/>
It's a very Ruful cause that needs such Subsidies to maintain it. Let any one Read the Doctor again, pag. 112. <hi>Sin in its own Nature tends merely to Gods Dishonour. In the Lord Iesus Christ, there is the Manifestation of another end:</hi> And as he said before, pag. 106. <hi>There's a New end put to it:</hi> of Gods <hi>Ordaining, and Appointing, and Decreeing men to sin</hi> not a word, not a syllable, only he says, that <hi>supposing sin to be already in the World,</hi> carrying on its <hi>fatal Designs</hi> of <hi>Dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, Damning Souls,</hi> God has in <hi>Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Curb'd and Restrained its Natural Tendency, Over-rul'd its native malice against, and thirst after the blood of souls, and made it Comply with his own Glory. So said <hi>Austin: God is so Good that He would never suffer sin to be in the World, if He were not also Omnipotent, to bring Good out of the Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Machine which our Author plies upon those words, is, <hi>That famous Engine of Archimedes,</hi> of which he used to boast, that <hi>Give him but a place out of the World where to fix his Engine, and he would undertake to Unhinge the Earth from its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The same Confidence has our Author in this Machine, which indeed never failed him: And no less truly, than commonly called a <hi>Down-right false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> Let the Reader mark it well; he charges the Doctor for saying, pag. 112. Com. <hi>That the glorious end whereunto sin is appointed, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is discovered in Christ for the Demonstration of Gods Vindictive Iustice, in Measuring out to it a meet recompence of Reward.</hi> Now remember the old Caveat, <hi>Hic nervus est sapientiae nihil fidere:</hi> Take the Book and read with <hi>all the Eyes</hi> you have, and can borrow, and there you shall find the clear contrary. <hi>The Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>

                  <hi>and Threatnings of the Law, do manifest one other end of sin, even the Demonstration of Gods Vindictive Iustice, in measuring out to it, a meet recompence of Reward; but here the Law stays, with it all other Light, and discovers no other use or end of it at all; but in the Lord Iesus Christ, there is the Manifestation of another, and more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end,</hi> &amp;c. And now after all this sorrow, we shall have a fine Scene of Mirth for our Divertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Nature</hi> (says he) <hi>would teach us, that so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely glorious a Being as God is, needs not sin, and misery to recommend his Glory, and Perfections:</hi> What Nature will teach us, so great a Darling of hers, the Privado to all her Mysteries cannot be Ignorant of; but in my Judgment he fetches a huge Blow to do Nothing: We believe God was <hi>perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> from all Eternity <hi>in the Enjoyment</hi> of his <hi>own Self</hi> and <hi>Infinite Perfections,</hi> and needed not have <hi>recommended his Glory</hi> to his Creatures; he made not the World because he needed it, but by our Authors good leave, or without it; <hi>supposing that God will recommend his Glory,</hi> he must have something <hi>out of himself,</hi> to which he may recommend it: And on like Supposition that <hi>He will Manifest his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace and Mercy,</hi> there must be <hi>a fit Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject capable of that Grace and Mercy,</hi> unless our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from his <hi>too much familiarity with Nature,</hi> can tell us how God <hi>can Pardon</hi> one that is <hi>no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or <hi>forgive</hi> him that is <hi>not guilty.</hi> Though <hi>every sinner</hi> be not <hi>an Object qualified</hi> to receive <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet he must be a <hi>sinner</hi> upon whom par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning <hi>Mercy is exercised;</hi> though <hi>all Misery</hi> be <hi>not a fit</hi> Object of pity, yet <hi>Pity</hi> supposes <hi>Misery;</hi> some of Gods Attributes <hi>create their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>

as <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> but others do <hi>suppose them</hi> as Sin pardoning Grace; and so God may be said to need Sins and Misery to recommend some of his Perfections, I am sure supposing sin and misery to exist, God has <hi>recommended his Son to us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. Of the same bran is that which follows: <hi>God would not Truckle and Barter with the Devil and Sin for his Glory.</hi> It's like he would not, but when the <hi>Devil and Sin</hi> had confederated against God, I know not why God might not <hi>Over-reach</hi> them in <hi>their Designs,</hi> and as he has made <hi>the wrath of Man,</hi> so he might also <hi>the policy of Satan</hi> to <hi>serve and praise Him;</hi> and thus he fixes <hi>a New end upon sin,</hi> which the Devil never <hi>dreamt</hi> on, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did not <hi>design:</hi> But I perceive our Author is wondrously pleased with the fine Notion of <hi>Truck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Bartering,</hi> and that we might not loose <hi>the beauty of it,</hi> he warns us <hi>amongst the Errata,</hi> (I would there were no worse) that <hi>for Truckle,</hi> we read <hi>Truck.</hi> Oh be sure (Courteous Readers) you do not mistake, for there's some weighty Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie depends upon it, which the <hi>Coffee-house,</hi> and the <hi>Inch of Candle</hi> must determine. But further Nature teaches him, <hi>That God had much rather be Glorious in the Happiness and Perfection and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Creatures, than in their sin and misery.</hi> Nature is an excellent School Mistress I see, and this is one of her highest Mysteries, that God delights in Obedience more than Sin: But what now if Sin and Disobedience have got in? for my part I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether Nature will teach him that God <hi>had rather, much rather,</hi> or however how <hi>much rather</hi> he had be more Glorious in exacting <hi>one</hi>

That vindictive Justice, and pardoning Mercy are both <hi>equally</hi> Gods Attributes. 2. They are not the <hi>less Essential</hi> and <hi>primary Attributes,</hi> because they were not <hi>Eternally</hi> exercised, for then neither would Omnipotency be such: God was <hi>Eternally Omnipotent</hi> though he Created not the World from Eternity, and he was also Eternally a God of pardoning Mercy, and a God of punitive Justice, though to the Exerting the outward Acts proper to those Eternal excellencies there was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Object capable of receiving them: This, Nature and Scripture teaches us, and we are not much concern'd in our Authors <hi>Theologie;</hi> but to close up all, he gives us an Inference from his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and a Reason of that Inference; His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was this: <hi>Vindictive Iustice, and Pardoning</hi>

Hence the enquiry of every one convinc't of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and the Judgment to come is, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteousness to appear before this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God: The first thing that offers it self for Direction and Assistance is [<hi>the Law</hi>] which hath many fair Pleas to prevail with a Soul to close with it for a Righteousness: It was given out by God himself for that end, it contains the whole Obedience that God requires of the Sons of Men: It has the promise of Eternal Life annext to it: [<hi>Do this and Live.</hi>] But there are two things that discover the Vanity of seeking Righteousness in this Path, 1. That they have already sinned, and come short of the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. So that though they should for the time to come, fulfil the whole Law, yet there is a Score upon them already, they know not how to answer for. 2. That if former Debts were blotted out, yet they are no way able to fulfil the Law for the future; many other Devices men have found out, but in the Issue the matter comes to this. They look upon themselves, 1. As sinners obnoxious to the Law of God, and the Curse thereof, so that unless that be satisfied, it's in vain from thence to seek after an appearance before God. 2. As Creatures made to a Super-natural end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105027:114"/>
bound to answer the whole Mind and Will of God. Now both these being beyond the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of their own endeavours, it's their wisdom to find out a Righteousness that may answer both these to the utmost; now both these are to be had only in the Lord Christ, who is our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: Who, 1. Expiates former Iniquities. 2. Fulfils the whole Law by his active Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10.</q> We are saved by his Life. And now the Doctor has told you the <hi>short of his Story:</hi> But our Author confutes him <hi>much shorter,</hi> and without Cicumlocution replies: <hi>This is a mighty comfortable Discovery, how we may be Righteous without doing any thing that is good or Righteous.</hi> I'le warrant you a whole Cart-load of Books hath been Written of this Subject, all which with <hi>Laconick Brevity</hi> our Author has blown away with one Puff: And is not this a Compendious way of Dispatching Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies out of the World? It is a Truth that <hi>none is Righteous but he that doth righteousness,</hi> and as great a Truth, that <hi>None is righteous before God,</hi> because <hi>he doth righteousness: Without Holiness no man shall see God;</hi> and without <hi>something more than his own holiness</hi> no man shall see God, or it were <hi>better</hi> he had <hi>never seen</hi> him. But more distinctly: 1. It's seasonable to enquire what is the Mind of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Matter, and She speaks freely, <hi>Art.</hi> 11. <hi>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ; by Faith, and not for our own Works.</hi> Pray ask her then, Whether we may be Righteous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing that is Righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which we are so accounted in the sight of God? And whereas he says with a Scoff, <hi>This is a mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi>

                  <hi>Doctrine:</hi> The Church in that very Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle determines in earnest: <hi>Wherefore that we are justified by Faith only, is a most whole some Doctrine, and full of Comfort.</hi> Either then that Article <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes his Assertion,</hi> or his Assertion <hi>confutes the Article.</hi> Again, Art. 13. <hi>Works done before the Grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasant to God, for as much as they spring not of Faith in Christ.—And for that they are not done as God hath Commanded them to be done, no doubt but they have the Nature of sin.</hi> Hence it were easie to argue against our Author: Those works which <hi>are not pleasant to God,</hi> which <hi>have the Nature of sin,</hi> cannot justifie the doer of them: But all works done <hi>before the Grace of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Inspiration of his Spirit,</hi> which <hi>spring not from Faith</hi> are such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore they cannot justifie the doer of them before God. Either then we must <hi>never be justified,</hi> or else we must be <hi>justified without good Works,</hi> as that <hi>for which</hi> we are justified at least; though the Article would conclude <hi>something more.</hi> It's very uncomely to see <hi>ill taught Children</hi> to spit in <hi>their Mothers</hi> face; and we account that an evil Bird that defiles its own Nest. 2 It will be no less seasonable to enquire into the mind of the Spirit also: And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> seems to speak high, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for righteousness:</hi> And more modesty would become him than to quip the Apostle, and tell him <hi>This is a comfortable discovery how a man may be righteous, without doing any thing that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Again, In the business of Election, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle argues thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>If it be by Grace, then</hi>

It's seasonable to enquire whether our Author had not better have understood the Doctor better, before he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to answer him: For when he asserts that <hi>we are justified by Christ,</hi> he excludes not <hi>the way and means</hi> that God hath appointed to make <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ to become ours.</hi> He that saith <hi>we are justified by Christ,</hi> doth not deny <hi>we are justified by Faith,</hi> and therefore <hi>not without doing something that is good:</hi> Nay, he excludes not <hi>Inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> from the Soul, nor <hi>Gospel obedience from the Life,</hi> only he excludes them <hi>as too defective and imperfect to make us stand before God in the judgment.</hi> And herein he seems a more dutiful Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> than our Author, let the <hi>12th.</hi> Art. judge: <hi>Albeit Works which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Iustification cannot put away our sins, and endures the severity of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out</hi> (<hi>necessarily</hi>) <hi>of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known, as a Tree discerned by the fruit.</hi> Whence it is obvious: That if <hi>our good Works which are the fruits of Faith,</hi> which <hi>follow Iustification,</hi> cannot <hi>endure the severity of Gods judgment,</hi> What shall become of those that are <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruits of Nature,</hi> and <hi>go before Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Again, If those Works which <hi>are pleasing and acceptable to God</hi> in Christ, yet <hi>cannot endure the severity of Gods Iudgment;</hi> Where then shall those appear, that being <hi>done before Iustification, have the Nature of sin,</hi> and <hi>are not pleasant to God?</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:105027:116"/>
As the <hi>13th.</hi> Art. determines; To whomsoever then this is <hi>comfortable Doctrine,</hi> I am sure it was <hi>once so</hi> to our Author, who <hi>by Subscribing</hi> these <hi>very Doctrines,</hi> got a Living of very <hi>comfortable Importance,</hi> and might have had the Civility with them of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to have owned; <hi>By this Craft we get our Living.</hi> But if our Author like not the <hi>Doctors way,</hi> let him prescribe <hi>his own,</hi> only let him be sure it <hi>be a better,</hi> and <hi>safer way;</hi> That he will: <hi>The Scripture tells us expresly, he is righteous that doth righteousness, and without Holiness no man shall see God; that the only way to obtain the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our sins is to repent of them, and forsake them, and the only thing that gives a right to the promises of Future glory, is to obey the Laws, and imitate the Example of our Saviour, and to be transformed into the Nature and Likeness of God.</hi> We must crave his leave to take his words in pieces, that we may the better deal with them.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>The Gospel</hi> (says he) <hi>makes a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of it, tells us expresly that he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous that doth righteousness.</hi> But say I, This is <hi>no representation of our justification different</hi> from what the Doctor has assigned. And let the words be Interpreted how he will, they make nothing against the Doctors assertions. 1. Let these words [He is Righteous] signifie [He is Inherently righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or holy] and then the plain Sence is; that he that <hi>doth righteousness,</hi> that <hi>practises an Uniform, and Universal conformity in his Life</hi> to the Gospel, may-<hi>charitably be judged by others,</hi> and certainly known <hi>by his own Conscience</hi> to be such a one; as a Tree is known by its fruits: For so are we war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by our Saviour to make a Judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:105027:116"/>
7. 16. And the same warrant we have from the Church of <hi>England: Art.</hi> 12.—<hi>Insomuch that by them</hi> [good Works, that necessarily spring of a true and lively faith,] <hi>a lively Faith may be as evidently known, as a Tree discerned by the Fruit.</hi> 2. Let the words be interpreted of <hi>that Righteousness by which, in which, and for which we stand accepted as Righteous before God;</hi> yet it meets in the same point; he that from an honest and good heart brings forth holy Fruit, most certainly justified in the sight of God, and is accepted of him; we may argue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> hope (without Offence) <hi>from the Effect to the Cause,</hi> and yet the Cause and the Effect are <hi>two things.</hi> He that is sanctified, is justified; and yet Sanctification is not Justification: we may safely conclude an <hi>imputed Righteousness</hi> from an <hi>imparted Righteousness,</hi> and yet that Righteousness which we have <hi>in Christ</hi> may be another thing from that Righteousness which we have by influence from Christ, as our Head.</p>
               <p>(2.) Sayes he, The Gospel tells us, that <hi>without Holiness no man shall see God.</hi> It does so indeed; but does it tell us, that <hi>Holiness</hi> is inconsistent with our <hi>Iustification by the Righteousness of Christ?</hi> Or does it tell us, that upon the account of <hi>our own Holiness,</hi> we shall be <hi>justified before God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>The onely way to obtain the Pardon of Sins, is to repent of them, and forsake them.</hi> That <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance</hi> there's no possibility of obtaining Pardon of Sin, we freely grant; they must be <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> that <hi>need</hi> a Pardon, and they must be <hi>penitent Sinners</hi> that are <hi>qualified</hi> to receive one: The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel has annex'd by express Promise the Pardon of Sin to Repentance. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we confess our sins, he is faithfull and just to forgive us our sins,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:105027:117"/>
                  <hi>and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</hi> But what an absurd way of procedure is this, to jumble and confound things together, which ought to have their <hi>several Apartments,</hi> and <hi>distinct Interests</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to them <hi>in one and the same Effect:</hi> The Grace of God <hi>as the great Spring</hi> and Fountain of all Mercy, must have <hi>a place</hi> in the <hi>Pardon of a Sinner;</hi> and the <hi>blood of Iesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cause,</hi> justly challenges a great room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Eph. 1. 7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in our Lord Jesus Christ, will come in for a share too, as it gives us an Interest in what he has suffered by way of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God, and Expiation of our sins; and <hi>godly sorrow for, hatred</hi> of, and <hi>turning</hi> from sin in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and Resolution, at least must have its proper Concern therein too: But to assert, that <hi>Repentance is the onely way of procuring Pardon, excluding Faith, and the Propitiation made in the Blood of Christ,</hi> needs more grains of Allowance than he will afford to any he deals with, to make it justifiable. But the vanity of this Fallacy lyes in this: That he opposes <hi>the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Means whereby it's applyed</hi> to our Persons: As if one would stiffly contend that we are <hi>justified by Faith alone,</hi> and therefore <hi>not by the Righteousness of Christ;</hi> whereas we are <hi>therefore justified by Faith,</hi> because we <hi>are justified by Christ;</hi> we are justified by the Righteousness of Christ <hi>alone,</hi> as that which God <hi>onely considers</hi> in the Justification of a Sinner, to answer his Law, his Justice: and we are justified by <hi>Faith alone,</hi> as that which makes Christ ours. Say the same here: Repentance is <hi>a Means</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:105027:117"/>
to qualifie us for the receiving the pardon of Sin, God will never give forth a Pardon to that Sinner that is not brought upon his knees, throughly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his Transgressions, yet still that which God respects in the pardon of a Sinner, is the Blood of his Son; <hi>without shedding of which, there is not, there cannot be any Remission,</hi> Hebr. 9. 22. But no man shall perswade our Author to distinguish betwixt <hi>Christs procurement</hi> of so great a Mercy, and the <hi>Way of the Gospel appointment</hi> for the Applying it to our selves.</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>The onely thing that gives us a right to the Promises of future Glory, is to obey the Laws, and imitate the Example of our Saviour, and to be transformed into the Nature and Likeness of God.</hi> For my part, I conceive far otherwise; That though <hi>our Holiness</hi> give us <hi>a Meetness and Fitness</hi> to partake of <hi>the Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> yet it was the Lord Jesus Christ that procured <hi>our right and title to it,</hi> and the Promise of it. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was of the same Opinion, when it decreed, <hi>Art. 13. That works done before the Grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasant to God, neither do they make men meet to receive Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And then we may presume, will not <hi>make us meet to receive Glory,</hi> much less give us <hi>a right and title to the Promises of it:</hi> And <hi>Art. 12. That the works which follow after Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, are those that are pleasing and acceptable to God;</hi> and I think we may equally take it for granted, that <hi>upon our justification with God, we have a right to the Promises of future Glory:</hi> But, if this be true, <hi>that the onely thing that gives us this right, be Obedience to, Imitation of Christ, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:105027:118"/>
                  <hi>to the Nature of God;</hi> we may have a Right to, when we have actual Possession of Glory; for till then, it will hardly be true, that we have obeyed all Christs Laws.</p>
               <p>But our Author had Wit in his Anger, and was aware of an Objection that was coming against him, and wisely layes in for it as well as he could. It might be returned to all that he had said, How can <hi>so imperfect an Obedience</hi> as ours is, so every wayes <hi>lame and defective,</hi> and short of <hi>the exact Law of God,</hi> ever give us <hi>a right to the Promises of future Glory?</hi> Yes, (sayes he) <hi>for though it be not exact, and perfect in every thing, yet if it be sincere, we shall be accepted for the sake of Christ, by vertue of the Covenant that he hath Sealed with his Blood:</hi> But I am afraid, he has conjured up a Spirit that he cannot lay again with so sorry a Charm. For, (1.) I do not find that God has abated any thing of his <hi>Law,</hi> but is as peremptory as ever; for, [<hi>Do this and live,</hi>] Nothing will please God less than exact and perfect Obedience, though <hi>in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace</hi> he is pleased to <hi>admit Another,</hi> a Mediator <hi>to doe it for Believers.</hi> I had rather he would hear the Reverend and Learned Bishop <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> upon <hi>Psal. 110. p. 492. In point of Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Invalidity, there can be but Five things said of the Law: 1. Either it must be Obeyed, and that it is not; for,</hi> all have sinn'd, and come short of the Glory of God, <hi>Rom. 3. 23. Or, 2. it must be Executed upon Men, and the Curse and Penalty thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and that it is not neither; for,</hi> there is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sus, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. Or, 3. it must be Abrogated or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, and that it is not neither; for,</hi> Heaven and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105027:118"/>
Earth shall sooner pass away. <hi>If there were no Law, there would be no Sin, for sin is the Transgréssion of the Law: And if there were no Law, there would be no Iudgement, for the World must be judged by the Law: Or, 4. it must be Moderated, and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably interpreted by Rules of Equity, and that it cannot be neither; for it's inflexible, and one jot or tittle must not be abated. Or, lastly, the Law it self remaining, the Obligation thereof notwithstanding, must, towards such or such Persons, be so far forth dispensed withall, as that a Surety shall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (upon a Concurrence of all their Wills who are therein interested; God willing to Allow, Christ wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Perform, Man willing to Enjoy,) both to doe all the Duties, and to suffer all the Curses of the Law, in behalf of that Person, who in Rigor should have done or suffer'd all, so that the Law, nor one jott or tittle thereof is abrogated in regard of the Obligation therein contained, but they are all reconciled in Christ,</hi> Thus far he. But, (2.) That Sincerity which he talks of, is indeed allow'd in the Gospel, in the Matter of <hi>Inherent Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> there it has a proper and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place, but comes not into <hi>the business of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> at all: And (3.) This Sincerity will be but <hi>a Cover-slut</hi> for the Omission and Neglect of our Duty; for if Sincerity will do the work <hi>without Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality and Integrity of Obedience,</hi> the best way will be to shrowd our selves under <hi>a profound Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of Gods Commandements, and then <hi>the less</hi> we know of Gods Will, <hi>the safer we are</hi> under the shelter of Sincerity. And, (4.) The Question will be, <hi>How much shortness of Obedience will this Sincerity compound for?</hi> It may be <hi>our Author</hi> will
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105027:119"/>
prescribe <hi>a Drachm of Sincerity</hi> to <hi>a Scruple of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> but then Another will make <hi>a Grain of Sincerity, a very little upon a knifes point,</hi> serve <hi>to sweeten a whole Pound of Defect in Duty;</hi> and thus every Mountebank, with <hi>a dose of his Electuary of Sincerity,</hi> will pretend to <hi>heal</hi> mens Consciences of <hi>those wounds</hi> that <hi>Sin has given</hi> them. (5.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Author addes, that <hi>we shall be accepted for the sake of Christ,</hi> it's <hi>a meer Iuggle;</hi> for when he comes to enquire, <hi>What Influence the Righteousness and Death of Christ have upon our acceptation with God;</hi> he professes he can find nothing in the world, but that <hi>God will pardon us, if we believe and obey the Gospel,</hi> p. 320. which doubtless he would have done without him: But this is onely to make the same use of Christ, that Politicians doe of the <hi>Foxes Case, to piece the Lyons skin when it's too short;</hi> just so must Christ serve to <hi>eke out the shortness</hi> of their Obedience with his own, and when they have stretcht their own Righteousness upon the Tenters as far as it will hold, to be beholden to Christ for the Rest: God <hi>for Christs sake</hi> does indeed accept our imperfect Duty, Obedience, Service, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the shortness of it, according to the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace, but not that it should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by stand <hi>for our Iustification,</hi> which we have <hi>onely upon the Account of what he has done and suffered for us, made ours by accepting him upon his own Terms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) We are come with much adoe to the third and last Addition, that these men make, or are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to make to the Gospel, Viz. <hi>Concerning our Wisdom to walk with God.</hi> To which (thinks Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi>) there is required <hi>Agreement, Acquaintance,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:105027:119"/>
                  <hi>Way, Strength, Boldness, and aiming at the same End, and all these, with the Wisdom of them, are hid in the Lord Iesus.</hi> It were worth the while to transcribe the Doctors discourse upon all these Heads, but our Author has saved me the Labour; <hi>The summe of all is this: That Christ having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated our sins, and fulfilled all Righteousness for us, though we have no Personal Righteousness of our own, but are as contrary to God as Darkness is to Light, and Death to Life, and an universal Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Defilement, to an universal and glorious Holiness, and Hatred to Love; yet the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ is a sufficient, nay the onely Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Agreement, and (upon that) of our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God.</hi> Now without doubt our Author would have his Reader believe, that the Doctor has said all this, and that he intends we may have Communion with God, whilest we continue thus: I confess, at the reading hereof, I was amazed, knew not what to think. Have I been all this while so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watching the Doctor, that <hi>a false Print,</hi> much less <hi>a false Doctrine,</hi> could not escape me, and is our Author come after me, and findes all this filth and abominable stuffe? Once again therefore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I durst not trust my own Eyes or Ears, and am under a Vow never to trust our Authors Tongue or Pen, speaking evil of the Doctor,) I took down the Book, and what I find I will transcribe, and let all the world judge. <hi>Com. p. 119.</hi> 
                  <q>The Prophet tells us, that two cannot walk together unless they be agreed, <hi>Amos 3. 3.</hi> Untill Agreement be made, there is no Communion; God and Man by Nature, (or whilest Man is in the state of Nature) are at the greatest Enmity; He declares nothing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105027:120"/>
to us but wrath; neither do we come short of him, yea we first began it, and continue longest in it: In this state, the wisdom of walking with God, must needs be most remote from the Soul: He is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all; we are Darkness, and in us is no Light at all; he is Life, a living God; we are dead Sinners, dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sins; he is Holiness, and glorious in it; we wholly defiled, and an abominable thing; he is Love, we Hatred, hating and being hated; Surely, this is no Foundation for Agreement, or (upon that) of Walking with God; Nothing can be more remote than this Frame from such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</q> Let now the Reader (and it's no great matter whether he be ingenuous or disingenuous, partial or impartial) compare what the Doctor has written, with what is fixt upon him: The Doctor sayes, <hi>Whilest we are such and such, we can have no Communion with God, cannot walk with him.</hi> Nay (says our Author) the Doctor sayes the clean contrary; that <hi>though we are as contrary to God as Light is to Darkness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet the Righteousness of Christ is a sufficient Foundation for Agreement:</hi> So again, p. 121, 122. Com. <hi>There must be moreover a Way wherein we must walk with God; and Christ is that way,</hi> Isa. 35. 8. <hi>an High-way, a Way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> No (sayes our Author) <hi>though we be as contrary to God, as universal Pollution to universal Holiness, yet the Righteousness of Christ is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Foundation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As the Doctor sayes.</hi> The Error then of the Doctor being so gross, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation must needs be as easie; for I observe, our Author is very kind to himself, and will not set himself a hard Task: One Text will easily doe it;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105027:120"/>
                  <hi>1 Iohn 1. 6, 7. If we say, we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness; we lye, and do not the Truth: but if we walk in the light, as God is in the light, then have we fellowship one with another, and</hi> [then] <hi>the blood of Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sins.</hi> Where he has <hi>fallaciously</hi> foysted in a little word [then] though somewhat bigger than the Doctors [by] to seduce the unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a Conceit; then <hi>when we have walk'd in the light as God is in the light,</hi> for <hi>some competent time,</hi> at last we shall have <hi>some benefit by the blood of Christ</hi> to cleanse us from sin. And now he falls to please himself in his old Humour of either <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly mistaking,</hi> or <hi>maliciously abusing</hi> the Doctors words: <hi>Our onely acquaintance with God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, is hid in Christ, which his Word and Works could not discover, as you heard above:</hi> It is very true, we have heard our Author bespatter him <hi>thus above,</hi> and shall do so again <hi>beneath, before,</hi> and <hi>behind,</hi> on <hi>the right hand,</hi> and <hi>the left;</hi> but that the Doctor ever spoke a syllable that <hi>opposes the Person of Christ,</hi> and <hi>the Revelations of the Gospel;</hi> that he supposes <hi>any Mysteries</hi> learnt from an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with Christs <hi>Person,</hi> wherein <hi>the Gospel</hi> is <hi>deeply silent,</hi> is a shameless Falshood; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we would give it a more gentle Name than it deserves, may be called <hi>a Sherlocisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One blow more he must give the Doctor for a parting blow, and then he will give us leave to take a little breath. The Doctor it seems had said; <hi>That in Christ we design the same End that God doth, which is, the Advancement of his Glory.</hi> And is he a Christian that denyes it? Ought not all that wear <hi>the Livery of a Redeemer,</hi> to pursue the great End
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105027:121"/>
of Advancing Gods glory? If the Doctor had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>twice Two to make Four,</hi> our Author is bound in Conscience to deny it; but is there never a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase that may dress them up in some ugly hew? O yes, one of his <hi>id est's</hi> will do the feat: <hi>That is,</hi> (sayes he) <hi>by trusting to the Expiation and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ for salvation, without doing any thing our selves, we take care that God shall not be robbed of the Glory of his Free-grace, by a Competition of any Merits, and Deserts of our own.</hi> That <hi>little policy</hi> there is in these words, lyes in that <hi>short Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis,</hi> which with more <hi>cunning</hi> than <hi>honesty</hi> he has wedg'd into his own gloss, [<hi>Without doing any thing our selves.</hi>] But <hi>where, when,</hi> in what <hi>Book, Chapter, Section, Page,</hi> or <hi>Paragraph,</hi> has the Doctor encouraged any to look <hi>for salvation by Christ, without doing anything our selves?</hi> Cannot we <hi>design the Glory of God, trusting to the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Righteousness of Christ,</hi> but <hi>all Obedience</hi> must presently be <hi>excluded?</hi> And yet his Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis is capable of a double sence: 1. As exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Obedience <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>absolutely,</hi> and so they are <hi>none of the Doctors words,</hi> but a <hi>crafty Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of our Authors, to mislead us into this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Doctor has quite cashiered Obedience from having any place in our Salvation; a thing so abhorred by all his Principles, so contrary to all his Writings, that nothing could have been either more <hi>unjustly forged</hi> against, or <hi>basely fixed</hi> upon him: 2. They may be construed as excluding Obedience <hi>in some respects,</hi> for <hi>some Ends and Purposes;</hi> and thus though the Doctor has not said it in <hi>that place,</hi> yet I suppose he <hi>will say</hi> it, and <hi>maintain it</hi> when he has done: That Believers may, and ought to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>

               <p>I think there cannot <hi>a more proper</hi> defence of wronged Innocency be found out, than to repeat the <hi>foul-mouth'd language</hi> of Detraction: Hear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what our Author sayes. <hi>The Reason of all this is very plain from our Acquaintance with Christ, for he is our Physician, and therefore we must not think of healing our selves, but must goe to him with all our diseases and sores about us, that he Alone may have the Honour of healing us.</hi> Mock on: <hi>He is a Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness, and therefore we must goe to him with all our Filthiness, to be cleansed and washed; for if we be first clean, there's no need of a Fountain.

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:105027:130"/>
The form of the Marriage-Covenant <hi>in the Liturgy</hi> is not <hi>so absurd</hi> as he would <hi>render it,</hi> but that it may with <hi>decency</hi> express <hi>the Process of Christ and a Believers joyning in Covenant:</hi> But I fear, if we should sift the business a little more narrowly, we shall find our Author as far to seek <hi>in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> as he is <hi>cross to the Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> brings in <hi>the Spouse</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, <hi>With my Soul I thee worship;</hi> but <hi>the Liturgy</hi> teaches <hi>the Man</hi> to use those words to <hi>his Spouse, With my Body I thee worship:</hi> So that I see <hi>no great Danger</hi> that ever <hi>Christ and a Believer</hi> should be <hi>marryed by the Liturgy.</hi>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:105027:133"/>
and to <hi>Obey without Obedience,</hi> is not so easie as he imagines. He that answers that <hi>Call of Christ</hi> [Come unto me] <hi>therein obeyes him:</hi> and <hi>believing in Christ,</hi> has been reputed <hi>a considerabe part</hi> of Gospel-Duty, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>This is his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Iesus Christ:</hi> That there are <hi>several Duties</hi> which <hi>flow from Faith,</hi> the <hi>Scripture, Church of England,</hi> and <hi>all men living</hi> doe acknwowledge, but that <hi>this Believing</hi> is also a Duty, they must equally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So that here's <hi>one proper place,</hi> or <hi>at least a Corner</hi> of a place, where he may <hi>wedge in</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if he pleases. 2. (Sayes he) <hi>When the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is consummated, there's less need of it than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:</hi> Nay, there his Non-sence is too open; He supposes them to own <hi>consequential Duties, such as follow the Marriage-covenant,</hi> and yet now he would perswade us, that <hi>there's less need of them, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marriage-Covenant.</hi> If he can invent a way how <hi>consequential Duties</hi> should <hi>goe before</hi> the Marriage Covenant, by my consent he shall have the sole honour of the Discovery: In my poor Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and I am perswaded most men are of my Judgement) <hi>consequential</hi> Duties doe <hi>follow,</hi> or to humour him, <hi>following</hi> Duties ought to be <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential.</hi> There was once <hi>a Learned and Friendly Debate</hi> betwixt a <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>his Brethren,</hi> what the Question was, I am not very certain, but one wiser than the rest, had reduced the Matter to this Head: That if they could but make it out, that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>third</hi> reigned <hi>before Edward</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> they should carry the Cause: And if our Author can find any place, <hi>proper</hi> or <hi>improper,</hi> for <hi>consequential Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before</hi> that thing <hi>to which</hi> they are <hi>consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:105027:133"/>
he shall be Registred amongst the great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to our understandings. But yet in spight of Fate, he will <hi>not allow any place for Consequential Duties after Marriage, for then we have less need of them than before.</hi> A fine Argument if well Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, to satisfie men in the <hi>Lawfulness of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Adultery:</hi> But why not? 1. Then we are <hi>adorned with the Beauty of Christ: Ergo,</hi> we need <hi>no Inherent beauty.</hi> Then we are <hi>Iustified: Ergo,</hi> we need not be <hi>Sanctified.</hi> 2. Then we <hi>are Holy with Christs Holiness: Ergo,</hi> we <hi>need not be Holy.</hi> 3. Then we are <hi>delivered from the Guilt of sin by his Expiation: Ergo,</hi> we need not be <hi>delivered from the filth of sin.</hi> 4. Christ <hi>must look to see the Debt discharged</hi> [to God] <hi>which he hath taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: Ergo,</hi> we owe <hi>no Debt of Gratitude to the Father for his Son, to the Son for his Love.</hi> 5. We are then <hi>righteous with his Righteousness, which gives us an actual right to Glory: Ergo,</hi> we need no <hi>Inherent righteousness to make us meet for Glory, and to partake of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> All I shall say is this, If men may Argue at this Rate, they are the most <hi>formidable Disputants;</hi> we may <hi>cast our Caps</hi> at them; and it's as safe to handle <hi>the Torpedo,</hi> as to touch them with <hi>a long Pole.</hi> But <hi>such Merriment</hi> he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Divert his <hi>we aried Reader</hi> withal, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>for Variety</hi> it may be <hi>Grateful,</hi> but really <hi>too much</hi> Nonsence in a Discourse is <hi>very odious.</hi>

               <p>For <hi>the Place</hi> (or rather <hi>no Place</hi>) <hi>of Obedience</hi> thus far: An enquiry in <hi>the Reasons</hi> of it, seems also necessary. And for that, he says, <hi>It's conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on all hands, that this</hi> (Obedience) <hi>is but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential Duty, that which ought to follow the</hi>

                  <hi>Espousals. But the Reason of it is not Evident:</hi> The Reason <hi>of the thing not Evident?</hi> Why, the <hi>thing it self</hi> is <hi>not evident:</hi> Would he have an <hi>evident Reason</hi> of <hi>Nothing?</hi> A <hi>Foundation</hi> for <hi>a Castle in the Air?</hi> Can he find <hi>no place for Obedience,</hi> and yet would he have <hi>a Reason</hi> for it? But for all this Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Conscience tells him that they <hi>do allow a place</hi> for it, and can produce a <hi>Reason for it too,</hi> and perhaps a <hi>more proper place,</hi> and <hi>stronger Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> than our Author is able to show.</p>
               <p>[1.] <hi>Some tell us</hi> (says he) <hi>it's due upon the account of Gratitude, and thankfulness to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> And methinks, <hi>a great deal</hi> of Obedience will rest upon <hi>that Basis:</hi> Has he come into this World (whither none that loved his ease would come?) Has he <hi>taken our Nature</hi> upon him, and (as if that were a light Matter) <hi>our sins?</hi> Has he endured <hi>the Displeasure of men,</hi> and (as if that were little) did it <hi>please God himself to put him to Grief?</hi> Did he <hi>Die for sinners?</hi> Does he <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> for them? Has he <hi>revealed</hi> the whole Counsel of God to them concerning their Salvation? Has he given them the <hi>Holiest Laws,</hi> and <hi>the best En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to Obey them? Did he <hi>Promise,</hi> and has he <hi>sent his Holy Spirit</hi> to dwell in their Hearts? Is it <hi>he through whom</hi> their Duties are accepted, and shall not <hi>these</hi> Obey? Here's <hi>enough,</hi> and yet there's <hi>much more</hi> to Engage all the <hi>Love, Service, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> of Redeemed ones for ever: And so the thing is (at least) <hi>a hairs breadth longer than 'tis broad.</hi> But here our Author is at a Loss; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>so well understand this:</hi> But whose fault is that?

Now for that he quotes <hi>plain I.

Davus</hi> has made <hi>a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but where's an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to <hi>resolve</hi> it. Christs Terms are, that <hi>the Soul shall give it self in Love and Obidence for ever:</hi> He requires that <hi>the Soul should be wholly and entirely his, and not for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and this is <hi>so far</hi> from being <hi>Irreconcileable</hi> to (what he calls <hi>ridiculously</hi>) <hi>the Essential condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of accepting Christ,</hi> that it's directly <hi>Included in it.</hi> And this he might have been Taught from the Doctor, had he not been too Proud to Learn. <hi>Ibid.

my way, that it might have been partly of my Endeavours, and as it were by the Works of the Law; but I am now willing to receive Thee, and to be saved in thy Way, merely by Grace.</q> We have already seen that what he has <hi>Quoted</hi> and <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd in</hi> these words for, was marvellously <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent</hi> to the <hi>pretended purpose;</hi> But that which will not make á <hi>Shaft,</hi> will make a <hi>Bolt.</hi> Never did our Author meet <hi>that thing,</hi> but he could make <hi>some use</hi> on't: As they that study <hi>the Philosophers Stone,</hi> though they miss of <hi>the main Design,</hi> yet stumble upon <hi>some pretty Experiments</hi> by the way, that makes them flatter themselves they have not <hi>quite lost</hi> their <hi>Oyl and Labour.</hi> Thus, however our Author may be Frustrated in his <hi>primary Project,</hi> which was <hi>Confuting the Truth,</hi> yet probably he may find or make <hi>some advantage</hi> to <hi>slur the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor:</hi> You may see him here like the great <hi>Hanibal,</hi> making his way over the <hi>Alps</hi> with <hi>Fire and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> If there be Matter for a Slander <hi>above Ground</hi> he will have it, and if not, <hi>Acheronta movebit.

Before our Author takes his leave of his Reader, (which he does with much Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility) he lets him know what he has had for his Money. First, (he tells him) <hi>He has given him an entire Scheme of a New Religion, resulting from an acquaintance with Christs Person.</hi> But we crave leave to Demur to that. It's neither a <hi>Scheme,</hi> much less an <hi>entire Scheme</hi> of any Religion New or Old, only <hi>a Wispe,</hi> that he set up to himself <hi>to Scold at:</hi> Next he lifts up his <hi>Masque,</hi> that we may see <hi>the full Face of his Design,</hi> for hitherto he has been in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> and that he tells us was <hi>to Expose these Mens Principles to Scorn:</hi> But that we saw through his <hi>Vizor,</hi> and needed not <hi>his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> to give us <hi>an Advertisment,</hi> that his <hi>chiefest Talent</hi> lies in <hi>Misrepresenting mens Persons,</hi> their Expressions and Intentions, in casting Dirt upon the the <hi>sincerest Actions,</hi> and Invidiously traducing the <hi>greatest Truth of the Gospel.</hi> Thirdly, He tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That every considering Person cannot but discover how Inconsistent the Religion of Christs Person and of his Gospel are.</hi> But this Distinction was but <hi>the Superfoetation</hi> of his own <hi>Parturient Brain;</hi> we

               <p>The Reader cannot but Observe, that (<hi>how Hotly soever</hi> our Author is Engaged in the Pursuit of his Design, yet) he can always find leisure to have <hi>a Fling at the Acquaintance of Christs Person.</hi> If there were <hi>but two things</hi> in all the World to <hi>Rail at,</hi> one of them should be <hi>Acquaintance of Christs Person.</hi> Hence it is that he has not got <hi>a finer Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,</hi> for those he would Vilifie than, <hi>the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances of Christ.</hi> Thus, pag. 56. <hi>As these bold acquaintance and familiars of Christ use to speak,</hi> p. 68. <hi>As another great acquaintance of Christ speaks,</hi> which though it be <hi>perfect Nonsence,</hi> yet serves to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his <hi>Scolding Humour</hi> well enough: Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I cannot Divine what should thus <hi>give Fire</hi> to his Choler, and <hi>enflame his Passion</hi> against <hi>acquaintance with Christ.</hi> It must be either <hi>the Name,</hi> or <hi>the thing it self,</hi> that I am satisfied in.

What he therefore addes, is most Vain, that <hi>this would make him less good in Redeeming than in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though Creation cost him no more than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Power, but Redemption the Expence of his Blood.</hi> For, 1. <hi>One Soul redeemed</hi> argues more Love than <hi>many created,</hi> which is <hi>proved</hi> by that <hi>very Reason</hi> which our Author has brought to <hi>overthrow</hi> it; because, <hi>to Redeem one Soul, cost more than to create many.</hi> But, 2. What warrant he has to <hi>measure</hi> betwixt <hi>Redeeming Love,</hi> and <hi>Creating Love,</hi> I cannot tell; This I know, they are <hi>both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our reach;</hi> yet I think, that the <hi>Blood of Christ as a Man,</hi> separated from that <hi>consideration of it</hi> as <hi>satisfactory to Gods Iustice,</hi> cannot be said to be

of <hi>more worth or dignity</hi> than the <hi>Creating Power of God.</hi> But to conclude, <hi>God made Man righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> there was his <hi>Creating Love;</hi> he qualified him <hi>thus made,</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment of his Maker;</hi> If now he shall <hi>voluntarily</hi> loose his <hi>fitness,</hi> and leave his <hi>relation</hi> to God, and thereby make himself <hi>lyable to the Curse,</hi> whenever this <hi>Creator</hi> shall please to <hi>undertake a Recovery,</hi> I suppose he may (without <hi>impeachment of Partiality</hi>) do with his <hi>own Grace</hi> what <hi>he pleases,</hi> and bestow it <hi>where he pleases,</hi> and not fear to be called to Account by every <hi>Malapert Caviller:</hi> And Now he <hi>clenches</hi> the <hi>Nayl</hi> with a <hi>sure stroke.

But to <hi>be recovered</hi> is the Method of <hi>being Recovered;</hi> to <hi>be converted,</hi> is the way to <hi>be converted;</hi> and that's a very sure way, I promise you; for, <hi>Omne quod est in quantum est, Necesse est esse:</hi> But this one of his peculiar Excellencies: <hi>p.</hi> 18. <hi>The way to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is to live as Christ lived;</hi> or which is all one, <hi>The way to be perfect, is to be perfect:</hi> If any one can make any better of this, he shall have my free leave: <hi>When we are so affected with all the powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments contained in Christs Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as to be sensible of the shame and folly of sin, and to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the love and practice of true Piety, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; Then</hi>—The English of which is this: When we are once holy, then we are holy. And this is his New way or Method of a Sinners Recovery by Christ. But, 2. We have been made to believe hitherto, That <hi>Method, is a convenient sorting and marshalling of Matters which relate each to other, into such an Order, as may tend best to the reaching the End in practical Disciplines, and making out the Truth in Theories:</hi> But herein our Author is wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly out of the way: For first he tells us, we must be <hi>so affected with all the powerfull Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Christs Intercession,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>then we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Merits of his Sacrifice, and find the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Intercession for us.</hi> That is, we must set <hi>the Cart before the Horses,</hi> which is an excellent Method; Seeing we <hi>cannot partake of the Fruit of Christs Intercession, before we partake of the Fruits</hi>

                  <hi>of his Sacrifice;</hi> for it is unquestionable, that <hi>the Intercession</hi> of Christ is <hi>available</hi> by <hi>virtue of,</hi> and operates by <hi>his Sacrifice.</hi> 3. His Method is very lame upon this Account, that he tells us we must be <hi>affected with all the powerfull Arguments contained in Christs Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. and yet never tells us, <hi>how these Arguments</hi> become <hi>effectual to affect us,</hi> which is a main thing in this Method. A Method he supposes, and yet never informs us, whether it be onely a way that <hi>God prescribes</hi> us to <hi>recover our selves by,</hi> using the best of <hi>our own Natural</hi> strength, or whether it be <hi>Gods Way and Method</hi> which he <hi>proceeds</hi> in, for <hi>the effectual</hi> recovery of a Sinner to himself. 4. Here's a Method pretended, how a Sinner is recovered, and yet no Consideration had, what part and share <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> bears in it, which must needs be marvellously ridiculous to him that considers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Except a man be born again, of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Our Saviour had said, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> but not contenting himself to have shew'd, how absolutely necessary Regeneration is to Salvation; <hi>v.</hi> 5. he shews the <hi>Spirits concernment</hi> in that work, and that <hi>all other Endeavours</hi> after Conversion <hi>without his powerfull Operation,</hi> will amount to no more than <hi>flesh; The streams</hi> will not <hi>rise higher</hi> than <hi>the Spring.</hi> V. 6. <hi>That which is born of the Flesh is Flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit:</hi> But yet, 5. It's equally absurd to speak of <hi>a Sinners Recovery,</hi> and never shew <hi>from what</hi> he is recovered: As if he should promise to Open to us <hi>the Nature of Motion,</hi> and yet never shew us <hi>from whence</hi> the Motion <hi>takes its rise,</hi> nor
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:105027:157"/>
                  <hi>whither it tends:</hi> Sinners are here talk'd of, to be <hi>recovered,</hi> but whether there be <hi>a state of corrupt and sinfull Nature,</hi> a state of <hi>Enmity against God,</hi> a state of <hi>blindness</hi> and <hi>darkness of Mind,</hi> from which this Recovery must <hi>move;</hi> we are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with half a word. 6. Here's a recovery to <hi>Acts of Obedience,</hi> love, and practice of Piety, but nothing of <hi>a New Heart, a New Nature,</hi> which the Scripture makes <hi>the Vital Principle</hi> of all <hi>New Obedience:</hi> Here we are told a little of <hi>the Fruit the Tree brings forth,</hi> but nothing <hi>how the Tree was made good,</hi> that it might bring forth good Fruit. 7. He assigns <hi>a sensibleness of the Shame and Folly of Sin,</hi> as <hi>the Means</hi> to get <hi>a Title</hi> to the <hi>Promises of the Gospel,</hi> and yet some of <hi>those Promises</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>an Engagement</hi> of God to give that <hi>New heart, new spirit,</hi> which <hi>he</hi> makes <hi>the Condition</hi> of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a Title to the Promises.</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>I will take away the heart of Stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of Flesh.</hi> I am perswaded that if we should all study seven years to be Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and Ridiculous, there are not many that could reach, or equallize our Authors Attainments.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Secondly,</hi>) The other part of his Task, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is always most Admirable, is, <hi>To pluck down those Methods which others have, or are supposed to have Built.</hi> And 'tis certainly an easier province to <hi>find faults,</hi> than to <hi>amend them.</hi> Now first, he enlightens us with this Doctrine: That <hi>the design of Christs coming into the World, was not to distract mens minds with the Terrors of the Law, and the Inexorable Iustice of God, not to bring us under a Legal Despensation of Fear and Bondage:</hi> Now all the Colour of this trifling Sophistry lies in two
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:105027:158"/>
things. 1. In putting in the word [Distract] to make his <hi>Negative</hi> seem <hi>Tenable:</hi> For though Christ came to <hi>Humble,</hi> to <hi>Abase,</hi> to <hi>Awaken the guilty Consciences</hi> of sinners, yet it would be hard to say, he came <hi>to fright men out of their Wits,</hi> to prepare men for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and the slipping in <hi>such an useful word,</hi> will make a <hi>Negative</hi> justifiable upon <hi>any</hi> of the Designs of Christ: But can sinners be <hi>more Mad</hi> than they are, who go on securely in a state of <hi>Impenitency,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God? No sure: That which some call <hi>distracting of sinners,</hi> is but really a step towards <hi>the helping</hi> of them to <hi>their Wits.</hi> 2. The Design of Christs coming into the World is either <hi>Subordinate,</hi> which relates still to <hi>some further</hi> end and design of Christ, or <hi>Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> to which all others do <hi>submit,</hi> and give <hi>defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Now 'tis true, <hi>To awaken guilty Consciences with the Terrors of Gods Iustice,</hi> to bring the Soul <hi>into a spirit of Bondage,</hi> were not that which Christ did aim at <hi>as his great End,</hi> but that he aimed at these things also <hi>in the way</hi> to his farthest End: That is, he <hi>used the Law</hi> to <hi>rowse the sleepy sinner</hi> to see his danger, and provide for his safety: He <hi>wounded</hi> men that they might <hi>seek after</hi> healing; and <hi>laid load</hi> upon their guilty minds, that they might be content <hi>to take his Yoke upon them.</hi> And that this is so: 1. We have an Argument, which is, <hi>Instar omnium,</hi> a Thousand Reasons by it self: That is what our Author says; <hi>That we must be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with all the Arguments of Christs Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so as to be sensible of the shame and folly of our sins.</hi> Now how a man should be <hi>ashamed of sin,</hi> till he sees its <hi>vileness and baseness;</hi> and how he should see its <hi>vileness and filthiness,</hi> till its brought
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:105027:158"/>
to <hi>the Test of Gods Holy Law,</hi> which is the <hi>Rule of righteousness,</hi> the <hi>Measure of Good and Evil;</hi> is past my Conjecture. Nay further, that <hi>shame</hi> which fills a Soul, does not merely arise from a sence of the Souls <hi>vileness;</hi> but as <hi>compared with Gods Holiness,</hi> who is a God <hi>so Pure, so Holy,</hi> &amp;c. that the Soul may well <hi>be ashamed,</hi> and filled <hi>with Confusion of face,</hi> to appear before him. Now <hi>shame</hi> upon the account of <hi>the filthiness;</hi> and <hi>dread</hi> upon the account of the <hi>guilt of sin,</hi> are very near <hi>Neighbours: Shame</hi> expresses the Souls <hi>sence of its own unworthiness</hi> to appear before God, upon the score of its <hi>baseness</hi> and <hi>deformity;</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses but the sence of Gods <hi>Authority,</hi> which he hath Impressed, and Stampt upon his Holy Law, with the Souls reflection upon it self, <hi>that it has vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that Law, and thereby become liable to that Penalty which his own guilt has bound him over to.</hi> And this was clear in <hi>Adams</hi> case: He was <hi>Naked,</hi> and therefore <hi>ashamed;</hi> he was <hi>guilty,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>feared</hi> to appear before <hi>this Holy God, and Iust Iudge.</hi> Now our Author will allow it lawful to fetch Arguments <hi>from Christs Incarnation, Life, Doctrine, Death,</hi> and what you please, to make us <hi>ashamed of sin,</hi> but by no means to <hi>be afraid</hi> of the Great God: But the very truth is, none say, that it is <hi>the duty of Men</hi> to be <hi>Distracted,</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged</hi> in mind with <hi>slavish fears,</hi> and <hi>Hellish ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> of Gods Justice: But that <hi>this Dread</hi> may possibly run up <hi>some</hi> poor Creatures <hi>so high,</hi> as to a <hi>literal distraction,</hi> when the apprehensions of <hi>the Curse</hi> due to the Transgression of a righteous Law, of a Holy, and Jealous God, shall <hi>overset</hi> a weak Judgement, and dark Mind, that sees its <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

               <p>IT's storied of <hi>Messa la Corvinus,</hi> (once a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Orator) that he got such a Crack in his Pericranium, that he quite forgot his own Name; the most unhappy man, certainly, in all the World, to have been Employed <hi>in the Management of a Lye;</hi> the Mystery whereof consists mainly in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Ends so handsomely together, that it may not Ravel out into Thrums. Our Author has Managed a severe Charge against <hi>some,</hi> that they <hi>Deduce all their Religion from an acquaintance with Christs Person, without consulting the Scriptures:</hi> And yet now, <hi>The truth is</hi> (says he) <hi>if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult their Writings, you will find them stuffed with Scriptures.</hi> These things did not Cotten very Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and he was as much put to his Trumps to make both ends meet; as the Gentleman, who told it with great Confidence, <hi>That he shot a Deer with one Arrow through the right Ear, and the left Foot behind.</hi> But he has an old Friend, that never fails his Servants at a Pinch, and he lifted him over the Style with this: <hi>They do but accommodate Scriptures to their own Fancies.</hi> Their Crime then in <hi>the last Result,</hi> is this: That they are not <hi>so happy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Scripture</hi> as himself: They have <hi>the same</hi>

Text, but they want his Head-piece to Comment on't: They have the <hi>same Materials</hi> to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they want <hi>his Tools:</hi> Or (as one of his Friends expres'd it) they have <hi>his Fiddle,</hi> but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get <hi>his Fiddle-stick.</hi> But to <hi>reproach</hi> them upon <hi>this Account,</hi> is to reproach (by far) the greatest part of Mankind. All were not Born under his <hi>smiling Stars,</hi> nor had the same <hi>benign Aspects of the Planets</hi> in their <hi>Nativity:</hi> It's not every mans happiness, to have the <hi>Bees swarm</hi> about his <hi>Cradle,</hi> or to be entranced upon <hi>the Top of Parnassus:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (after all the Scuffle) we have gain'd <hi>this Point,</hi> that we may <hi>joyn Issue</hi> with him upon <hi>the Question,</hi> and modestly Debate it, Whether <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they</hi> do best understand the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Two great Faults (and they are great ones indeed) he finds in their Writings: First, That <hi>they Expound Scripture by the sound of Words:</hi> And secondly, That <hi>they reason about the Sence of Scripture, from their own preconceived Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[1.] They <hi>Expound Scripture by the sound of words.</hi> Our Author had discovered to us, <hi>p.</hi> 80. the <hi>Danger of using a way of Reasoning that would serve any Mans turn, that had but any Quickness and Vigour of Fancy.</hi> What a dangerous way then must this be, that will serve <hi>any Mans turn,</hi> though he be not blessed with <hi>his Quickness and Vigour of Fancy!</hi> For though his Antagonists <hi>Pulse</hi> toll as <hi>heavily</hi> as <hi>Tom of Lincoln,</hi> though he never drew <hi>his Breath</hi> but in <hi>Boetia,</hi> nor ever had his <hi>Temples crown'd</hi> with the <hi>Ignis Lambens,</hi> yet he can with as <hi>much ease,</hi> and <hi>more truth,</hi> Retort all his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. <hi>When mens Fancies are so possessed with Schemes and Idaea's of Religion, what ever they look</hi>

                  <hi>upon, appears of the same shape and colour, where with their Minds are already Tinctur'd; like a Man sick of the Iaundies, or that looks through painted Glass, who seeth every thing of the same colour that his Eye or the Glass gives it.</hi> Some such Medium, the poor Priest used to Prove, that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was <hi>Prophesied of,</hi> from the <hi>beginning of the World;</hi> because he had made a shift to read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Congregationem aquarum vocavit Maria:</hi> And with the same learned skill did the Rector of—Convince his obstinate Parishioners, that it was their Duty to Pave his Chancel for him; from <hi>Paveant illi, ego non Pavebo.</hi> And let me tell our Author, for all his <hi>Vapouring,</hi> and that he <hi>looks so goodly</hi> on't, he has not a more <hi>serviceable Engine</hi> than <hi>this one,</hi> in all his Arsenal. For having once double-dyed his Fancy with a strong Conceit, that the word [Christ] signifies a <hi>Church,</hi> an <hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Doctrine;</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Quote <hi>that</hi> Text, where the <hi>Word</hi> occurs, but his Fancy Chimes <hi>all in;</hi> just as <hi>Imagination</hi> thinks, so <hi>Scripture</hi> clinks; and every thing he sees, <hi>turns round</hi> to that <hi>Crotchet,</hi> when all the while the <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mill</hi> is in his <hi>own Head.</hi> If you should but ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to say, that <hi>for an Orator,</hi> our Author is <hi>truly excellent;</hi> but <hi>for a Logician,</hi> he is but <hi>Ordinary.</hi> Il'e undertake from <hi>the sound of that one word,</hi> he shall conceit himself at first Dash, to be <hi>a Bishop.</hi> So easie it is for a <hi>French</hi> Cook to make <hi>Suffolk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street Soupe,</hi> of a <hi>Stool-foot;</hi> and most Ravishing <hi>Minc't- Pies,</hi> of an Old <hi>Boot-top,</hi> or a <hi>Leather Doublet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is a Ridiculous procedure, to make <hi>the sound of words</hi> the <hi>Measure of our Interpretation,</hi> so is it <hi>no less perverse</hi> a Method, to Expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105027:162"/>
by the <hi>Ranverse,</hi> and go just <hi>cross to the sound of words.</hi> The <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Literal</hi> sence commands our Reception; unless the <hi>Context</hi> and <hi>Coherence, Evident contradiction</hi> to some other <hi>plain Scripture,</hi> or some <hi>gross Absurdity,</hi> and <hi>insuperable Difficulty,</hi> compell us to Recede from it. But now according to our Authors <hi>Rule</hi> (which he has <hi>most Religiously</hi> observed throughout his Book) the further any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation departs from <hi>the sound of words,</hi> the better it is, that is to say, <hi>for his own purpose.</hi> As suppose you should meet with this word [Heaven,] let not the <hi>Chiming, and Tinckling of your Fancy,</hi> betray you into a Notion of some <hi>Glorious place,</hi> where <hi>the spirits of Iust men made perfect,</hi> are Blessed in the enjoyment of God; for that would be but to Gratifie your Tinctured Imagination, with the <hi>sound of a word</hi> that Rhimes pretty well to your own Conceits: But rather work up your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to the prospect of some dreadful Dungeon, where nothing but Ratling of Chains, Blowing of Bellows, Hissing of Serpents, and the Yellings of Griesly-people strike a Horror into your Mind; and then to be sure you shall purchase our Authors good word, and never be Taxed for Interpreting by <hi>the Sound</hi> and <hi>Clink of words.</hi> Thus if you meet with that Expression [the Son of God,] be sure you do not understand <hi>a Person, but a Thing;</hi> and if at the long Run, you should chance to Interpret it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>No thing,</hi> it will do <hi>best of all;</hi> For then you may lay your Life on't, you have not <hi>Interpreted Scripture by the sound of words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as much as our Author pleases himself with his Humour in this thing, the truth is, he did but Steal, (or to make the best on't) Borrow it from
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105027:163"/>
one of those he hopes to wound with it: And well might the Eagle sigh, to see her self <hi>shot through</hi> with <hi>a Dart,</hi> which had borrowed its <hi>Feathers</hi> from her <hi>own Wing.</hi> I will only burden him with one Passage: <hi>The Papists having hatched that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Figment of Transubstantiation, upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any Expressions amongst the Antients,</hi> (<hi>though made use of to another end</hi>) <hi>cry out, and Triumph, as if they had found the whole Fardel of the Mass, in its perfect Dress, and their Breaden God in the midst of it: Iust so</hi> (says he) <hi>it is in the case of</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>Men of these latter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, from what they saw in being, and the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of it to their Desires and Interests, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antiquity, not to Instruct them in the Truth, but to Establish their Opinion, whatever Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they find that fall in as to the sound of Words, with what is now Insisted on, instantly they cry out,</hi> Vicimus Iö Poean. And now either our Authors <hi>guilty Conscience,</hi> or his <hi>Acumen,</hi> will tell him to <hi>whom</hi> he <hi>stands Indebted,</hi> for Observing to him <hi>the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Interpreting by the sound of words:</hi> And let him take this Caution along with him, to <hi>forbear using that way of Reasoning, which serves any mans turn as well as</hi> (and most mens better than) <hi>his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be now time to descend to Particulars, that we may reduce his Rule into Practice: And he has singled out these Expressions, of <hi>knowing Christ, Christ's being made Wisdom to us. Having the Son.</hi> To give us an Experiment what Wonders his Rule will work.</p>
               <p>And, (1.) For the <hi>Knowing of Christ.</hi> They that Interpret Scripture <hi>by the sound of words,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:105027:163"/>
the Phrase; <hi>of Knowing his Person, and all his Personal Excellencies, and Beauties, Fulness, and Preciousness,</hi> &amp;c. And so has the Expression been used, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is Life eternal to know thee, the only True God, and Iesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi> Where the <hi>Person of the Messiah,</hi> under that <hi>Personal Excellency</hi> of being <hi>sent of God, Anointed, and Appointed</hi> by him to <hi>Reveal,</hi> and <hi>procure Eternal Life,</hi> is made the <hi>Object of our Knowledge,</hi> Again, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 33. <hi>I knew him not, but he that sent me to Baptize with Water, the same said unto me, upon whom thoushalt see the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, the same is He; and I saw, and bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that</hi> [<hi>this is the Son of God.</hi>] Where to <hi>Know Christ,</hi> is Interpreted by knowing Him to be <hi>the Son of God:</hi> And all the fault of this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, that it comes a little <hi>too near the sound of words.</hi> But that Learned Doctors <hi>practical</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, who interpreted <hi>Iesus</hi> by <hi>Iudas,</hi> would have pleased our Author infinitly, because it was more modest, and durst not come <hi>so near</hi> the <hi>sound of the word.</hi> Well, But how does the <hi>Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> expound the Phrase? Nay, as to that, he is in <hi>a brown study,</hi> and says never <hi>a word;</hi> and that I assure you is <hi>a safe way</hi> to avoid the <hi>Odium</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it, <hi>by the sound of words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, (2.) Christ is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>To be made Wisdom to us.</hi> And amongst many others, I find <hi>Beza</hi> thus expounding it: <hi>Datus est nobis a Deo, ut in ipso omnem sapientiam consequeremur</hi> (<hi>quae quidem eo nomine verè digna sit</hi>) <hi>quum in Uno, possumus Deum, &amp; ejus Arcana contemplari, quae ne suspicari quidem unquam cautissimi homines potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> 
                  <q>He is given to us of God, that in him we
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105027:164"/>
might attain Wisdom (that truly deserves the Name) seeing that in Him alone, we may behold God, and his Secrets, which the most discerning Men otherwise could never have Ghessed at.</q> Let this Interpretation (because it comes too near the sound of words) only serve for <hi>a Foyle,</hi> to set off <hi>the Lustre</hi> of our Author: <hi>Some</hi> duller men (says he) <hi>can understand no more by it, than the Wisdom of those Revelations Christ hath made of Gods Will to the World.</hi> But I fear it's more their <hi>Sullenness</hi> than their <hi>Dulness,</hi> that they can see no more of <hi>Wisdom in Christ,</hi> than <hi>a meer Ravelation of Gods Will.</hi> For had they not worn <hi>Racovian Spectacles,</hi> they might have seen <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Divine Justice in <hi>his Death,</hi> as well as a <hi>Declaration of Gods Will to us,</hi> issuing from his Mouth.</p>
               <p>But then, (3.) Here's another great Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, What [having of the Son] should signifie? But before we fall upon that, we must deliver our selves from <hi>an Ambuscado,</hi> secretly laid for our utter Ruine: <hi>When men have Learnt</hi> (says he) <hi>from an acquaintance with Christ, to place all their hopes of Salvation in a Personal Union with Christ,</hi> &amp;c. He might for his <hi>Credits-sake,</hi> have produced his <hi>Vouchers,</hi> to make good his <hi>Charge:</hi> I do indeed believe, that as the <hi>Person of the Husband</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the <hi>Person of the Wife,</hi> and yet there is no <hi>personal Union</hi> made, though they are <hi>one Flesh,</hi> yet they continue <hi>two distinct Persons,</hi> or <hi>Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences;</hi> so Christ and Believers are <hi>Personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> each to other in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and are one <hi>Mystical Body,</hi> one Spirit; and yet they are not taken into <hi>Personal Union</hi> with Christ. Nay, our Authors <hi>Conscience</hi> was <hi>fast asleep,</hi> when he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105027:164"/>
wrote this Twang: For, <hi>pag.</hi> 198. He Quotes these words from Doctor <hi>Iacomb; This Mystical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an Union of Persons, but yet no Personal Union;</hi> And if our Author know not how to Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish these <hi>two Expressions,</hi> he's <hi>sadly Accoutred</hi> to Manage <hi>this Controversie.</hi> And being now freed from all Danger in <hi>the Rear,</hi> let us Advance to the Question. What this [having of the Son] should mean? 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi> Now the clearest way to resolve this Doubt that I can think on at present, is to Examine, <hi>who,</hi> or <hi>what,</hi> is meant by the <hi>Son;</hi> and when we have Settled and well Fixt the Notion of <hi>that,</hi> to try what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light we may get into the Phrase of <hi>Having the Son:</hi> For the former, <hi>Who</hi> or <hi>what</hi> the Son is? I know no more Hopeful and Promising way, than to look into the Chapter, to see if peradventure the Apostle has fixt the Notion for us. And <hi>ver.</hi> 5. we read, <hi>Who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that</hi> [Jesus is the Son of God?] And, ver. 6. <hi>This is he that came by Water, and by Blood, even Iesus Christ.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>This is the Witness of God, which he hath Testified of his Son.</hi> And, ver. 10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself.</hi> And, ver. 11. <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi> And then follows the words under Examination: <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life.</hi> I conclude then, that if by [<hi>Son,</hi>] <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he meant the <hi>very Son of God,</hi> our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> then <hi>by Son,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. is meant <hi>the very self same Person.</hi> And I am the more Confirm'd in my Opinion, because our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 101. will
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105027:165"/>
not allow any to <hi>separate a single Sentence from the Body of the Discourse, to make the Scripture speak their own sence.</hi> Though I confess he intended it as a <hi>Caution to others</hi> that they may <hi>avoid it,</hi> but <hi>a Canon to himself,</hi> that he might observe it: What <hi>to others</hi> was set up for <hi>a Buoy,</hi> to discover <hi>a Rock;</hi> to himself is hung out for a <hi>Lanthorn,</hi> to discover <hi>his way:</hi> But I shall take his Caution, and charitably believe so well of the Apostles sincerity and judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Discourse, that he would not speak of <hi>one thing</hi> in one Verse, and <hi>another</hi> in the next, under <hi>the same words,</hi> without <hi>sufficient intimation</hi> of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But now for [having the Son of God] that is the remaining enquiry: Now in this our Author speaks more Truth than he is aware of: <hi>What can</hi> [having the Son] <hi>signifie</hi> (says he) <hi>but having an Interest in Him? Being made</hi> one with Him, <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we remember, that it is called</hi> [being in Christ] <hi>and</hi> [abiding in him] <hi>which must signifie a very near Union between Christs Person and ours?</hi> It must so! If [the Son] signifie the <hi>very Son of God,</hi> we must <hi>have Him,</hi> as he is <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>being had;</hi> and that's only <hi>by Interest</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> through Compact agreement, and the Constitution of God in a Gospel Covenant. Ay, but (says our Author) <hi>Some will be so Perverse as to understand it of believing, and Obeying his Gospel.</hi> Well, and if they will be <hi>so Perverse</hi> without a Reason, we shall take the freedom to be <hi>as Perverse</hi> as they can be, and believe no more than we have proof for. But let us practise with <hi>his Gloss</hi> a little: By <hi>the Son,</hi> he understands the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and then his Paraphrase of <hi>v. 5.</hi> will run thus smoothly: <hi>Who is he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the World, but he that believeth that</hi> Jesus is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105027:165"/>
the Gospel; that is, he that believes a Lye, he is the man that <hi>overcomes the World.</hi> Ay but we must remember that by <hi>Iesus,</hi> he has understood <hi>the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> also; and then indeed you will have a Paraphrase <hi>compleat in all Points: Who is he that overcomes the World, but he that believeth that</hi> the Gospel, is the Gospel. And sure he must be a <hi>Dull thing</hi> indeed that <hi>cannot,</hi> and a <hi>Perverse one</hi> too, that will not believe, and Subscribe so <hi>Self-evident a Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But the World is full of <hi>perverse People,</hi> and therefore no wonder if some will so understand it. And amongst many others, one <hi>Volkelius, lib. 3. de verâ Relig, p. 37.</hi> in John 1. 4. <hi>In him was Life.</hi> Hoc est, <hi>Ipsi commissa est vitae Eternae &amp; viae ad eam ducentis Anunciatio, quâ Hominum animos miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficè collustravit, &amp; Ignorantiae tenebras (quantum in ipsa fuit) ab iis depulit, quod idem alio in loco edisserit,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. <hi>dum ait. Hoc est Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium, quod Deus Testatus est de filio suo, quod vitam Eternam nobis dedit Deus, &amp; haec in filio ejus est.</hi> 
                  <q>That is, to him was committed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Eternal Life, and of the Way that leads thither, whereby he wonderfully enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Minds of Men, and scattered the Darkness of Ignorance from them (as much as in him lay) which he Discourses also in another place, <hi>1 Iohn</hi> 5. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> The Reader cannot but observe the Parenthesis, That <hi>Christ enlightned men,</hi> [as much as in him lay] if he <hi>could</hi> have done <hi>more,</hi> he <hi>would:</hi> But what would they expect from <hi>a Man?</hi> Now, when I observe our Author, in this very place, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding the Hopes of them, who <hi>expect to receive free Comunications of Pardon and Grace, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Salvation, from our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:105027:166"/>
Methinks I see, [<hi>Quantum in ipso fuit,</hi>] and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he filled his <hi>Vessel</hi> from <hi>that Cistern</hi> or no, is not <hi>so clear;</hi> but this is certain, that all came <hi>from the same Fountain.</hi> To conclude this Head, the Gloss of this Text according to the Proportion and Analogy of our Authors Faith, must be this: <hi>He that</hi> believeth and obeyeth <hi>the Gospel,</hi> believeth and obeyeth <hi>Life; and he that</hi> believeth not, and obeyeth not <hi>the Gospel,</hi> believeth not, obeyeth not <hi>Life:</hi> But our Gloss is this, He that hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ, hath an Interest in Life, and he that hath not in the one, hath not in the other, but the Wrath of God abides on him; there being no means discovered whereby we can escape it, but by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>It would have been small Satisfaction to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to <hi>pervert the Sence,</hi> unless he might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also to pour Contempt upon <hi>the Phrase of the Scripture;</hi> which he has carried on to that height of Daring-provocation, that I am certain he never met with <hi>his Superiour,</hi> and do hope he may never find <hi>an Equal.</hi> He is at last grown almost weary of Reproaching the <hi>Expressions of Men, too mean</hi> a Quarry for one of <hi>his Wing</hi> to stoop at; and now the <hi>Expressions of the Holy Ghost</hi> must find him Game, that he may appear truly Great, by <hi>great Enmities. Erostratus</hi> was resolved to <hi>Eternize his Name,</hi> though by Firing the <hi>Temple of Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> And <hi>Nero</hi> conceived great hopes from the <hi>Burning of Rome,</hi> and his <hi>unsampled Butcheries,</hi> to Inoculate his Name into History, that he might upon any Terms survive his Funeral. It's <hi>some Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation</hi> to them who <hi>Groan</hi> under <hi>the burden of Obloquy,</hi> that they meet with <hi>no harder Measure</hi>

than their Lord and Master: And it might quiet the <hi>grieved Spirit</hi> of a <hi>righteous Lot,</hi> when <hi>his</hi> words are wrested; when <hi>the holy Spirit of God</hi> is <hi>grieved</hi> with the Affronts put upon his <hi>Expressions: The Disciple is not</hi> (ought not expect to be) <hi>above his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor the Servant above his Lord: It's enough that the Disciple be as his Master, and the Servant as his Lord: If they have called the Master of the House Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the Houshold?</hi> Mat. 10. 24. Let them therefore <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess their Souls in patience, and comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with these words.</hi> And thus our Author enters upon his Business: <hi>It's Self-evident, that before we can be</hi> United to Christ, <hi>we must</hi> [go to Him]: <hi>And therefore</hi> Faith, <hi>which is the</hi> Instrument <hi>of this</hi> Union, <hi>is very Luckily called</hi> [coming to Christ,] <hi>from whence it is very evident, that to</hi> [believe in Christ] <hi>is to</hi> [go to Him] <hi>for Salvation: Which Metaphors</hi> [of coming, and going] <hi>are a very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Explication of</hi> Believing. But does this Gentleman think we have not <hi>sins enough of our own</hi> to answer for, but we must be <hi>Responsible for all the faults</hi> the Black-Jaundies of Malice can find <hi>in Scripture?</hi> Or does he Fancy that we Penn'd the Scriptures, and therefore must lie at Stake for all the Incongruous expressions that he is able to suppose in them? Well, thanks be unto God, that the Scriptures never yet found a Match able to Cope with them. For, 1. It's apparently false which he says, <hi>These Metaphors</hi> of coming, and going, <hi>are a very Intelligible explication</hi> of Believing: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, <hi>Believing</hi> is that which Explicates <hi>those Metaphors of</hi> [Coming, and Going.] With the same Fore-head he might have reviled Christ, for
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105027:167"/>
Interpreting <hi>the Preaching of the Word,</hi> by <hi>the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sowing his Seed;</hi> whereas <hi>the Sower sowing his Seed,</hi> is explicated by <hi>the Preaching the Word.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith</hi> (says he) <hi>is very Luckily called coming to Christ.</hi> I shall spare him that Ignorant Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that Faith is called coming to Christ:</hi> No Sir, not <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Believing;</hi> not the <hi>Peace,</hi> but the <hi>Acting</hi> of that Grace is <hi>so called.</hi> But I shall not wave his <hi>blasphemous Flirtings of the holy Spirit:</hi> What ever Expressions he has used to express Faith, or its Acts by, were upon <hi>advice with his own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> who will not learn <hi>of him</hi> how to guide the Heads, and Hearts, and Tongues, and Pens of his <hi>Amanuenses,</hi> in revealing to us the Mind and Will of God. He has better Authority to Justifie <hi>Quod scripsi, scripsi,</hi> than either <hi>Pilate</hi> who <hi>once really</hi> Crucified Christ: Or <hi>that other</hi> who has <hi>often</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him <hi>in Essigie.</hi> It was <hi>advisedly</hi> so called, but <hi>unluckily</hi> reproached. 3. Those Metaphors of <hi>coming, and going,</hi> do very aptly, and <hi>Intelligibly</hi> express <hi>the Motion of the Soul in its turning from sin to God,</hi> by Faith in Jesus Christ: For as in all <hi>Local Motions,</hi> there is <hi>a Term from which,</hi> and <hi>a Term unto which</hi> we move; so in this <hi>Spiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there is <hi>a State, or Term from which</hi> we pass, that <hi>of Sin and Enmity</hi> against God; and <hi>another to which</hi> we pass, that of <hi>Holiness and Peace</hi> with God. Our Saviour thought meet, and we are to Acquiesce in his Sovereign Wisdom, sometimes to employ <hi>a Metaphor in the Explicating of a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi> Mat. 13. 19. <hi>Then comes the wicked one, and catcheth away the word that was</hi> sown <hi>in his heart,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>Yet hath he not</hi> Root <hi>in himself,</hi> ver. 22.—<hi>The deceitfulness of Riches</hi> Choak <hi>the Word:</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:105027:167"/>
and yet till of late he was never branded for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible explicating</hi> of his Notions.</p>
               <p>If now the Reader would have an Instance, to what Height <hi>encouraged Prophaneness</hi> may rise, let him read what follows. <q>But when the Soul is <hi>come to Christ,</hi> is this enough? No sure: the Soul then must <hi>receive Christ,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>1 Ioh. 12. To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God:</hi> That faith which serves us for Leggs to goe to Christ, must be a Hand to Receive him, and to apply all his Merits, and Fulness, and Righteousness to our Souls: And now when we have Received him, we must embrace him in our Arms too, as good old <hi>Simeon</hi> did, when he found him in the Temple, which is a little nearer <hi>Union,</hi> as plainly appears from the Example of the Patriarchs, who saw the Promises afar off, and embraced them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Heb. 11. 13.</hi> and now we have Christ, we must trust and lean upon Him, as we are often commanded to doe: which signifies that Act of Faith, whereby feeling our own weakness, as unable to support our selves, we do lean, and rest on Christ, and if leaning be not enough, we may make a little more bold, and Roll on him, as appears from <hi>Psal. 37. 5.</hi> Roll thy wayes on the Lord, as the Original [<hi>Gal</hi>] sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; which is that Act of Faith, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary, and heavy laden with sin, and seeking Ease, at last discharge our load, and cast it on Christ, and this is plain, from the phrase of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ, and on him; for what can that signifie, but leaning and rolling on him, laying and building our selves on him as on a Foundation. And now we have thus brought our Souls to Christ,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:105027:168"/>
we must commit them to his trust, to take charge of them, and if they perish, it shall be his fault, he must give an account of it: Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>2 Tim. 1. 12.</hi> I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded, that he is able to keep that I have committed unto him against that day: and Now we must hide our selves in Christ, from the fierce wrath of God, as the Dove in the Rocks. But this is not enough yet, for we must be cloathed with the Righteousness of Christ.—And when we are thus united to Christ, and made one with him, then All Christ is ours, as the Apostle tells us, All is yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods. The Merit of his Death is ours, to free us from the Guilt and Punishment of sin; and his Active Obedience to the will of God, his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is ours, for our Justification, as is plain in that he is called, <hi>The Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and as <hi>I. O.</hi> well observes, we are reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, and saved by his Life, <hi>Rom. 5. 10.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And now I hope there's none needs question but our Author is laid in with <hi>a Competency</hi> of those Endowments, that may enable him to Deride the whole Bible, from the first of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the last of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> If our Author does not judge <hi>with others</hi> about the <hi>Meaning of these phrases</hi> and Expressions of Scripture, he had the liberty (for ought I know) <hi>to discover,</hi> and (if he must needs) <hi>to expose</hi> their <hi>Mistakes;</hi> but to droll upon <hi>the very Expressions</hi> of Scripture, without reference to any Interpretation, and (if to any) to that which is most evidently the True, is a <hi>Degree</hi> above the <hi>superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of Blasphemy. Let others admire which of his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:105027:168"/>
Talents they see good; for my own part, I read more of Ignorance in it, than of all his other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. 1. One gross piece of Ignorance is, that he makes <hi>the Patriarchs embracing of the Promises,</hi> explain <hi>Simeon</hi>'s <hi>embracing Christ in the Temple.</hi> 2. That in his <hi>goodly supposed Method</hi> of the Souls coming to Christ; he fancies, first that we <hi>have Christ,</hi> and <hi>trust and lean upon him,</hi> and yet after a while (as if it were a new degree of Faith) he tells us, <hi>we must commit our Souls to him.</hi> 3. He fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that to <hi>come to Christ,</hi> to <hi>receive him, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him,</hi> are <hi>several Acts</hi> of Faith, distinguished by <hi>some Intervals of time:</hi> But let us hear <hi>the guilt</hi> of these Scriptures, and his little Glosses: Why they offend against his great standing Rule, <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting things by the sound of words. For</hi> (says he) <hi>what better proof can you desire for all this, than Express words?</hi> Really, the Laws upon which we must be permitted to discourse with our Author, are very severe; for, <hi>p. 78.</hi> he laid it down as a Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that none must dare to <hi>Draw one Conclusion from the Person of Christ, which his Gospel hath not</hi> expressely <hi>taught:</hi> Well, we accepted the Tearms, and have brought him <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,</hi> and <hi>expressely express</hi> words, and do speak as <hi>Volkelius</hi> commands us, <hi>dilectis luculentissimis<expan>

                  <hi>in the beginning, by whom were all things made;</hi> who <hi>upholds all things by the Word of his Power;</hi> the <hi>Socinians</hi> have now a compendious Answer. Ay, this is to interpret Scripture <hi>by the sound of words:</hi> And the Atheist has an inckling of it too; he can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>all the Scriptures as True,</hi> but when you urge him that <hi>God created all things out of Nothing;</hi> that he is <hi>the Owner, Governour, Iudge of the whole World;</hi> they are provided with <hi>a short Answer:</hi> Yes, this is interpreting Scripture <hi>by the sound of words:</hi> And whether every Drunkard, Swearer, Adulterer, all <hi>the Rakehells</hi> and <hi>Rakeshames</hi> upon Earth, may not in time make their advantage of it, I cannot tell; That <hi>Ministers do but fright them with a sound of words:</hi> Thus have some dealt with the <hi>Sacerdotal Office of Christ;</hi> He is <hi>a Priest</hi> (they confess,) he offer'd <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> was a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> made <hi>an Atonement,</hi> did <hi>expiate sin;</hi> but have a care you do not interpret these things <hi>as the words sound:</hi> he did indeed <hi>something</hi> like a Priest, offer'd <hi>something</hi> like a Sacrifice, but <hi>truely</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> he was <hi>nothing,</hi> did <hi>nothing</hi> of All this. It had been therefore more plain-heartedly and ingenuously done, had our Author written a <hi>Confutation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> proving that <hi>the Spirit</hi> did not speak <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly;</hi> but <hi>All in good time,</hi> he has <hi>Materials ready</hi> for the work. <hi>P.</hi> 100. <hi>The wildest, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Opinions that were ever yet vented under the Name of Religion, have pretended the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture for their Patronage:</hi> And yet he knew, how first to <hi>break its head,</hi> and then <hi>make it a Playster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This famous Rule of our Authors, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>all things under the Sun;</hi> but there are
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:105027:169"/>
two Principles onely that he will examine by it at present.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>The spiritual Impotency of all men without grace to perform that which is Acceptable to God: This</hi> (says he) <hi>they prove wonderfully from our being</hi> dead in trespasses and sins; <hi>and therefore, as a Dead man can contribute nothing to his own Resurrection, no more can we towards our Conversion.</hi> I wonder when the Scripture will <hi>be able</hi> to speak <hi>so plain,</hi> that <hi>deaf men</hi> will understand it? One would have thought, the Spirit of God should never have chosen that Expression of being <hi>Dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> to signifie, what <hi>mighty power and abilities</hi> the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has <hi>to Obey:</hi> But we are instructed better from this <hi>usefull Caveat;</hi> not to interpret Him, by <hi>the sound of his words;</hi> for now we must understand by [Being dead] [Being Alive,] and proportionably by [Sins and Trespasses,] we must understand [Duty, and Obedience,] and then to keep <hi>close to our Instructions,</hi> and <hi>far enough from the sound of words,</hi> To be <hi>Dead in Sins and Trespasses,</hi> is to be <hi>Alive to all Duty and Obedience.</hi> And thus that other vexing place, <hi>Rom. 5. When we were without strength, in due time, Christ dyed for the ungodly;</hi> must be Paraphrased, <hi>When we were strong and Active, and had no need of Christ, he dyed for the godly.</hi> And this I think (if that be good for ought,) is very remote from grating our Ears with <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant sound of words.</hi> Ay, but (says our Author) <hi>This is true of Natural Death, but will be hard to prove of a Moral Death.</hi> Hard to prove! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we want his <hi>wonted out-facing</hi> Confidence: But why so hard to prove? Has not the Spirit of God selected those words borrowed from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:105027:170"/>
                  <hi>of one Naturally dead,</hi> to instruct us in the true <hi>Condition of one Morally dead?</hi> It's true <hi>of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and therefore not <hi>of a Moral Death.</hi> Nay, it's therefore <hi>true of a Moral Death,</hi> because it is so of <hi>a Natural Death.</hi> What wild Similitudes would he impose upon the Holy Scriptures? <hi>Even as one that's Naturally dead can contribute Nothing to his Resurrection,</hi> just so, <hi>one that's Morally dead can contribute something to his Conversion.</hi> This is the great Illustrator of dark Metaphors. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth this Morall Death consist? Oh (says he) <hi>In the prevalency of vicious habits contracted by long Custom, (which was the Case of the Heathens whom the Apostle there speaks of) which do so enslave the Will, that it's very difficult, though not impossible, for such Persons to return to the love and practice of Vertue.</hi> But who can tell, whether by [enslaving the Will] which is a Luscious Metaphor, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would not have us understand, [enfranchising the Will,] lest we should border too near upon <hi>a sound of words?</hi> But I am not illuminated with our Authors Reasonings: For, (1) <hi>Moral Death</hi> doth not <hi>consist in the prevalency of vicious Habits,</hi> it is the general Condition of <hi>all men born into the world;</hi> who are <hi>privatively Dead</hi> in respect of that Life we <hi>all once</hi> had in the <hi>first Adam;</hi> and <hi>Negatively Dead,</hi> in respect of that Life which is attainable by <hi>the second Adam.</hi> And in those dayes, when men studyed not Aequivocations to <hi>subscribe every thing,</hi> and <hi>believe Nothing,</hi> it was not question'd in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Art. 10. <hi>The Condition of</hi> Man <hi>since the Fall is such, that he cannot Turn and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself, by</hi> his Own Natural Strength, and <hi>good Works, to Faith, and calling upon God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:105027:170"/>
                  <hi>we have</hi> no power <hi>to doe good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without</hi> his Grace <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that we may have</hi> a good Will, <hi>and working with us when we have that Will.</hi> But, (2) Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that this <hi>Moral Death did consist in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of vicious Habits, contracted by long Custom,</hi> yet such may be <hi>the prevalency of them,</hi> into <hi>such a slavery may the Will be brought,</hi> that it may be <hi>not onely di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ficult but impossible</hi> (without the effectual assistance of the Spirit,) for the Sinner to return to God. <hi>Ier. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may ye also doe good, that are accustomed to doe evil:</hi> Whence the Prophet shews, that such is <hi>the prevalency of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Habit, contracted by long Custom,</hi> that it's as possible for the Black-Moore to wash himself white, (which is the <hi>Embleme</hi> of <hi>Labour in Vain</hi>) or the Leopard to rub out his Dapples, as for <hi>such a one,</hi> so <hi>enslaved,</hi> to doe good. And if <hi>difficulty onely</hi> be designed in the Comparison, there's great <hi>danger of seduction,</hi> to have <hi>the Case of habituated sinners</hi> thus described. (3) Our Author is much mistaken, to say, That <hi>the Apostle speaks of the Case of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi> The place is, <hi>Eph. 2. 1. And you hath he quickened, who were Dead, in Trespasses, and Sins,</hi> &amp;c. And these things are exceeding clear: 1. That to be <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> (let it signifie what it will) is a Condition <hi>common to Iew and Gentile.</hi> v. 3. <hi>Amongst whom also</hi> we all <hi>had our Conversation in times past, in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the Mind, and of the Flesh, and were by Nature the Children of wrath, even as others.</hi> v. 5. <hi>When we were dead in sins.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have heard <hi>a very learned Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> against <hi>interpreting Scripture by the sound of words;</hi> and now we shall have <hi>another Oration</hi> against Metaphors, Similitudes, Allegories, Types, Figures, and all this <hi>under the same Head.</hi> If they say, Christ is <hi>our Righteousness, our Wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. then they interpret all by the <hi>sound of words;</hi> and if they say, the <hi>Pearl,</hi> the <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>Rock,</hi> &amp;c. signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Christ,</hi> which seems to be very <hi>remote from,</hi> yet that is interpreting Scripture by, the <hi>sound of words</hi> also; so that we are in a <hi>Fork, Snick or Snee;</hi> and both wayes equally undone: Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> thinks that <hi>The Pearl</hi> in the Parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 46. may be accommodated <hi>to Christ;</hi> for, as <hi>the Pearl</hi> is there said to be <gap reason="foreign">

But, 1. Our Author forgets himself to say, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> uses these Metaphors to <hi>prove,</hi> when all the Service they doe him, is to <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate</hi> his Doctrine, sufficiently <hi>otherwise confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from innumerable Scriptures: If our Author will not allow <hi>the Pearl</hi> to signifie Christs <hi>Preciousness,</hi> yet it's very clear that Christ is <hi>precious.</hi> If he boggle, that the <hi>circular Figure of Manna</hi> should denote Christs <hi>Perfection,</hi> yet that he is <hi>Perfect,</hi> is undenyable. 2.

                  <hi>most eminent</hi> of their Natural Excellencies, and then consider which of Christs <hi>spiritual Excellencies</hi> syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretize with them, all the hurt thats in it is, that those Types are <hi>more beholden</hi> to Christ, than he to them. And, 3. We ought to consider, that there's a <hi>greater latitude</hi> of Expression allowed in <hi>Open handed</hi> Discourses <hi>ad Populum,</hi> than in your <hi>Double-fisted</hi> Disputations in the Schools: Our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour does accommodate his Discourses to his Disciples, and preach <hi>as they were able to hear</hi> him; and Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> does not alwayes preach or write, to such <hi>long-ear'd People</hi> as our Author is. And thus after all, Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> may be <hi>very Innocent;</hi> but whosoever is in the <hi>the Right,</hi> our Author will be sure to be in <hi>the Wrong;</hi> for when all that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course had spent it self to perswade us, that Christ is excellent, that he deserves our Love, our Service and Obedience; our Author could make no better use on't, than to throw a Flout upon the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our Redeemer: <hi>Who</hi> (says he) <hi>can forbear being smitten with so lovely a Person?</hi> Really he may do well to consider, whether his <hi>License</hi> will <hi>justifie</hi> him to Scoffe at Christs Person, <hi>toties quoties</hi> he meets with any that shall dare to give him a <hi>good word:</hi> I have known some so <hi>prodigal</hi> of their <hi>Friends,</hi> that they would sell the best they had for <hi>a sorry frothy Iest:</hi> but should our Author forfeit the Favour of Christ, when he shall most need it, for a poor half-witted Conceit, it would be more than he would ever get by it. But hence we learn, how difficult it is, for any to have <hi>a little more Wit</hi> than his Neighbours, and not to <hi>discover it;</hi> though it had been more comely to have been facetious any where, than against A Saviour; and may he in time
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105027:173"/>
come to himself, least he be <hi>smitten with Christ</hi> in a fence not to his good liking.</p>
               <p>[2] The Second Way whereby <hi>these men</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Scripture is, that <hi>they argue from their own preconceived Notions and Opinions, about the sence of Scripture.</hi> And (to have sav'd charges) <hi>both these</hi> might have been mustered <hi>for one,</hi> but then it would not have born <hi>such a Port,</hi> nor carryed so much state and Majesty in its looks: The first way was, <hi>When they find any words in Scripture which chime to the Tune of their private Conceits, they interpret them by the sound of words:</hi> And this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>second way</hi> is the <hi>first way,</hi> in other words; <hi>when they Argue from their own</hi> pre-conceived <hi>Notions:</hi> But perhaps there may be some subtle <hi>Essential difference,</hi> between [their own Conceits,] and their [own preconceived Notions,] which though <hi>he can,</hi> every <hi>one cannot</hi> discover: Now of this <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>second,</hi> or <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> or <hi>no Way,</hi> (call it which he pleases) he will give us some few Instances.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>There are</hi> (says he) <hi>a great many places, which expressely tell us, we are justified by Faith, have Remission of sins by Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Now the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will be, how we shall <hi>Reconcile these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their Notion of being justified by Christs Righteousness. For</hi> (as he acutely observes) <hi>Faith certainly is not</hi> the Righteousness of Christ <hi>in their Notion of it:</hi> (No nor in his neither, if he rightly understands himself.) Now <hi>those other men</hi> have a way to Reconcile our <hi>being Iustified by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ onely,</hi> and our <hi>being justified by Faith onely;</hi> and it is this: <hi>When Faith is said to justifie, they understand not this</hi> Absolutely, <hi>as if Faith did justifie, either as it is a</hi> Work <hi>wrought</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:105027:174"/>
                  <hi>iin us, or an</hi> Act <hi>performed by us; but</hi> relatively, <hi>as t makes us</hi> one with Christ, <hi>by whom we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> And they assign this Reason for it: <hi>Because, had Iustification been promised to any thing wrought in us, or done by us, it had been by Works:</hi> And this Conciliation of the true Interest of Faith, and Christ, in the business of Justification, is justified by the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Art. 11. <hi>We are accounted Righteous before God, onely for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deservings; wherefore, that we are justified by Faith onely, is a most wholsom Doctrine.</hi> Now our Author might with great Applause have placed out his <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling skill</hi> upon this Article: How we can be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied [for the Merit of Christ onely,] and yet [by Faith onely]? And again: How we can be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied [by Faith onely,] or indeed at all, and yet [not for our own Works?] we find in Scripture, that <hi>the same Effects</hi> are attributed <hi>to Faith,</hi> which are attributed <hi>to Christ: Iustified by Christ,</hi> Isa. 53. 11. and <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. We <hi>live by Christ,</hi> Joh. 6. 57. and <hi>we live by Faith,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Are <hi>pardon'd by Christ,</hi> Act. 13. 38. are <hi>pardon'd also by Faith,</hi> Act. 26. 18. <hi>Have peace with God by Christ,</hi> Col. 1. 20. have <hi>peace with him also by Faith,</hi> Rom. 5. 2. <hi>Have Access to God by Christ,</hi> Eph. 2. 18. have <hi>Access also by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3. 12. Are <hi>sanctified by Christ,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. and <hi>sanctified by Faith,</hi> Act. 15. 9. <hi>Overcome the World by Christ,</hi> Joh. 16. 33. and <hi>so also by Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4, 5. <hi>The Sons of God by Christ,</hi> Eph. 1. 5. and <hi>so by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 26.</p>
               <p>These things being thus, it seems to be a worthy

Enquiry, what <hi>Part and Share</hi> Christ may <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> and what <hi>Faith</hi> may <hi>claim</hi> in the Justification of a Soul before God; that so we may <hi>give unto Christ the things that are Christs,</hi> and <hi>unto Faith</hi> the things that are <hi>Faiths.</hi> And, 1 It's very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that their Concerns are <hi>really Distinct;</hi> Christ Justifies <hi>in one respect,</hi> Faith <hi>

                     </gap>in another:</hi> It's possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that some (<hi>ver.</hi> 9.

It's evident from those very Places where the Concerns of Christ, and of Faith, are <hi>joyntly mentioned,</hi> not only that they have <hi>really distinct Interests,</hi> but that Christ carries the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and that Faith has only <hi>a subservient Concernment</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Therefore being justified by Faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Whence it's plain, that <hi>whatever Faith contributes</hi> to our <hi>peace with God,</hi> yet <hi>even that</hi> Operates <hi>through</hi> Jesus Christ, <gap reason="foreign">

It's no loss evident, that Christ by his <hi>Death</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:105027:175"/>
                  <hi>and Sufferings,</hi> has removed those <hi>insuperable Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,</hi> which lay in the way of a sinners Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Reconciliation with God, Expiation of sin,</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> could not possibly Undertake, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve. 4. That what ever Parts Christ and Faith have in this Glorious work, yet no more must be Ascribed to either, than can consist with a <hi>Free,</hi> and <hi>Gratuitous Iustification,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>Being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And, 5. It's evident that <hi>the Sacrifice, Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. of Christ, and that Reconciliation and Atonement procured by them, do not in the least Enterfere with Justification by Free-Grace; for Christ himself is Free-gift, and that God would admit a Mediator, to Interpose on our behalf, that he would accept a Propitiation for us, is all due to Free-Grace; and therefore Free-Grace and Jesus Christ are joyned together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</hi> 6. It is also as evident, that to ascribe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification to Faith <hi>as it is our Work, or Act,</hi> will take off <hi>just so much</hi> from the freedom of Grace, as is ascribed to it, <hi>as a work in us, or done by us;</hi> and therefore Faith must needs Justifie us by vertue of that respect that it carries towards a Redeemer; and to assign it any other Interest, is to Entrench upon that free Justification, which the Gospel does so abundantly Preach: Now <hi>what Title</hi> to give to Faith as it Justifies, whether that of <hi>an Instrument, or a Condition,</hi> I dispute not; let the proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Faith and Christ be secured, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Actings kept Inviolable, and Sacred, and if any can find more apposite, and significant Terms, than Protestants have used, I shall be very
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:105027:175"/>
well content: But now our Author will favour us with a Reason, why <hi>Iustification by Faith</hi> as it is <hi>our own Act,</hi> may consist with <hi>Iustification by Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Grace. Modest men</hi> (says he) <hi>who dream not of Meriting by every thing they do, would have thought, that Free-Grace and Faith, might have been easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> had justified as our own Act, since the Reward and Recompence, does so infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Work that there can be no suspition of Merit; and where there is no Merit, the reward is of Grace, and not of Debt, what ever the Condition of the Promise be.</hi> But, 1. Gods Free-Grace will not be beholden to, nor stand to the Courtesie of Mans Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; and besides, all men are not so Modest as our Author is; and if they were, it would be hard Trusting them: Man is indeed, a very Proud and Haughty Creature, till Free Grace tames him, loth to stoop to those Methods of Gods Wisdom for the abasing the Creature, that Grace may be magnified in his Mercies. And I see plainly, that God has Contrived the way of shewing favour to a lost Sinner, in such Wisdom that <hi>every Mouth shall be stopped,</hi> that <hi>Boasting</hi> shall be <hi>excluded,</hi> and that <hi>no Flesh shall glory in his presence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 29. 2. It's not what men <hi>will do</hi> out of their <hi>sweet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> that comes here into Consideration; but what they <hi>may do,</hi> God has taken a <hi>Course</hi> they <hi>shall not, cannot</hi> have cause to <hi>Glory;</hi> but if the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be justified by <hi>his own Act, as 'tis his,</hi> he has <hi>whereof to boast,</hi> Rom. 4. 2.

               <p>Protestant Divines in the explicating the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Faith in our Justification, that they might Accommodate their Discourses to the Capacity of them with whom they deal, have found out <hi>certain Similitudes,</hi> which do well express their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, when they say: <hi>Faith justifies us not as our own Act, but by vertue of its Relation to Christ,</hi> who is <hi>our Righteousness.</hi> Thus we say, <hi>the Ring</hi> stanches Blood, and yet we intend no more than that the <hi>Haematites</hi> set in it, has <hi>that Vertue:</hi> That <hi>our Hand</hi> relieves us, and yet perhaps it contributes no more towards it, than that it <hi>receives the Charity of another:</hi> That a <hi>Bucket</hi> quenches our Thirst, yet all it does, is to <hi>bring us the Water</hi> from the Fountain, which quenches it. And many others they have Invented, <hi>the best they could find,</hi> none so <hi>mean</hi> but is above <hi>Contempt,</hi> yet none so <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> to be above <hi>Malice.</hi> The use they make of them is (as I said) to <hi>cloath their Conceptions,</hi> and <hi>give some Light</hi> into the Thing, but by <hi>no means to prove</hi> the Truth, when it is drawn into Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. But from hence, our Author is taking another
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:105027:176"/>
Ramble, and going to run his old Wild-Goose Chase of Prophaneness, and Scurrility; the easiest way of Confutation certainly, that ever was Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But let his own Folly chastise him, or if not, delight him; and in the mean time excuse me from bearing him Company.</p>
               <p>(2.) Another Instance, and <hi>but another,</hi> he will give us: How <hi>Men argue from their preconceived Notions,</hi> and that is about <hi>the Necessity of Good Works. For</hi> (says he) <hi>when they are pressed with those Scriptures that urge the Necessity of Good Works.</hi>—What do they then? Nay, that he could not tell, but carries on <hi>a suspended Sence,</hi> for almost two whole <hi>Pages,</hi> and in the end leaves it <hi>unintelligible Nonsence.</hi> But however, let us hear those Texts that are <hi>so pressing</hi> for Good works, and a holy Life. Why? <hi>VVithout Holiness, no Man shall see God: The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all Unrighteousness and Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men.</hi> Truly, these Scriptures do <hi>press</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>our Consciences,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> but not upon our <hi>Principles:</hi> Well, then there are others that assert, <hi>Our Acceptation with God, depends upon a Holy and Vertuous life.</hi> I promise you that presses indeed! But it does not press me: <hi>Our Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, depends upon a Holy life,</hi> as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,</hi> but it depends upon Christ for <hi>Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But the places are, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 35. <hi>God is no Respecter of Persons, but in every Nation he that feareth God, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him.</hi> Well, let us examine whom this Text does press most? The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Discourse, <hi>ver.</hi> 43. tells us: <hi>To him</hi> [Christ] <hi>give all the Prophets witness, that through his Name,</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:105027:177"/>
                  <hi>whosoever believeth in Him, should receive Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins.</hi> Whatsoever of <hi>acceptation with God</hi> then, they that <hi>fear God, and work Righteousness</hi> do obtain, still it's <hi>through the Name of Christ.</hi> The Text then presses not us, he must call for more weight, if he designs to Press us to Death: But as I remember, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. our Author with much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence would bear us down, that <hi>the Iews who knew nothing at all of Christ, yet unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>stood God to be a Sin-pardoning God.</hi> And yet the Apostle assures us, 1. That <hi>all the Prophets gave witness to Christ.</hi> 2. That their Testimony was this, <hi>That they were</hi> to expect <hi>Remission of sins, through the Name of Christ.</hi> 3. That the Means of acquiring the Remission of sins through Christ, was by <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Him.</hi> And now let him ask his <hi>own Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whether this Text does not press him; But there is another Scripture that will break their bones, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And what was their <hi>Righteousness?</hi> Why he tells us: They were a company of <hi>Immoral Hypocrites, who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all their Righteousness in observing the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, without the purity of their Hearts and Lives.</hi> Well, and we think a Man may Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel a great many Leagues beyond <hi>such Debauches,</hi> and never <hi>come near the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Let them then Groan under the weight of it, who place their Religion in <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and <hi>prophane Drollery;</hi> it presses not them, who professing <hi>Faith in our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>Repentance from Dead works,</hi> subject themselves to his Gospel. Well, but there is one more that will Grind them to Powder, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105027:177"/>
                  <hi>He that breaks the least of these Commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> And this will certainly press them, who Renouncing their part in the Satisfaction given to God by Christ, trust to their <hi>own Imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> wherein there are <hi>so many Flaws,</hi> as will amount to the breach of some Commandment, and then our Author has quite shut them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Section, our Author has one round Fling at Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and it is <hi>ex Officio,</hi> no doubt: I suppose he may <hi>hold</hi> some <hi>fair Estate</hi> by <hi>this Tenure,</hi> That he Persecute the Doctor with Fire and Faggot, <hi>as far as a pair of Shooes of a great price will carry him.</hi> The Question is, What <hi>necessity there is of Obedience?</hi> The Doctor had said, That <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Obedience and good Works,</hi> are <hi>Indispensibly necessary to Salvation;</hi> by <hi>the sovereign appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Will of God.</hi> To this our Author answers: <hi>This is not one syllable to the purpose!</hi> Why then, <hi>It's the end of the Fathers electing Love.</hi> That's <hi>not one syllable to the purpose!</hi> It's <hi>the end of the Sons redeeming Love.</hi> That's <hi>not one syllable to the purpose!</hi> It's <hi>the end of the Spirits sanctifying Love.</hi> That's <hi>not one syllable to the purpose!</hi> Well, but it's necessary <hi>to the Glory of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> That's <hi>not one syllable to the purpose neither.</hi> If neither the <hi>Sovereignty of God over us,</hi> the <hi>Love of God to us,</hi> nor the <hi>Glorifying of God by Us,</hi> be to the purpose of Obedience; let our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor speak <hi>to the purpose.</hi> So he will: <hi>God hath commanded Obedience, but where's the Sanction of the Law? Will he Damn all that will not Obey for their Disobedience?</hi> Where's <hi>the Sanction of the</hi>

                  <hi>Law?</hi> I am sure that Question is <hi>very little to the purpose.</hi> It's <hi>the Command it self</hi> that makes <hi>a Duty,</hi> that creates a <hi>necessity:</hi> The <hi>Authority of the Law-giver,</hi> lays the <hi>Obligation</hi> upon the <hi>Subject.</hi> It's <hi>our Interest to Obey,</hi> upon the account of <hi>the Sanction;</hi> but it's <hi>our duty to Obey</hi> upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it self:</hi> But not to hold him in suspense, <hi>God will Damn all those that will not Obey, for their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Author has now quite run himself a Ground, and is Pumpt dry of his Drollery, and therefore turns Catechist, and Persecutes us with Impertinent Queries. I have heard some say, that <hi>an Ideot</hi> may tye <hi>more Knots</hi> in an <hi>Hour,</hi> than a <hi>Wise-man</hi> can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye <hi>in a day.</hi> But however, though we might plead it's <hi>Coram non Iudice,</hi> yet for once, let him suppose himself <hi>in his Desk,</hi> and his poor <hi>Catechumens</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly waiting upon his <hi>Foot-stool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Will God Damn those who do not Obey for their disobedience? Answ.</hi> Yes, and it please you Sir. Qu. <hi>But will he save, and reward those who do Obey for their Obedience? An.</hi> He will reward <hi>their Obedience,</hi> but not save them for <hi>their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Qu. <hi>But will the Father Elect none but those that are Holy? An.</hi> Yes, and it like your good Learning, he Elects them that they <hi>may be Holy,</hi> but not because they <hi>are Holy,</hi> Ephes. 1. 4. Ephes. 2. 10. Qu. <hi>But wil the Son Redeem none but those that are holy? An.</hi> Yes, indeed Sir, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for a Redeemer <hi>supposes</hi> them to be <hi>sinners,</hi> and Captives under sin. Qu. <hi>But will he reject and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate all that are not Holy? An.</hi> God has not Reprobated all that were, or are not holy; for then he had Reprobated all the World, but he will reject
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105027:178"/>
all that <hi>continue unholy</hi> to the Death. Qu. But tell me, <hi>Doth this Election, and Redemption, suppose Holiness in us, or is it without any regard to it? An.</hi> Neither the one nor the other: It's <hi>Fallacia plurium Interrogationum:</hi> They neither presuppose Holiness in us, nor are they without all regard to Holiness; it is a necessary Effect but not a Cause of Election and Redemption. Qu. Dost thou stand chopping Logick with thy Betters? <hi>If we be Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Redeemed without regard to our being Holy, our Election and Redemption is secure, whether we be Holy or no. An.</hi> Good Sir excuse me, we are Elected <hi>to Grace,</hi> as well as <hi>to Glory,</hi> and he that appoints <hi>to the end,</hi> appoints to the <hi>necessary means</hi> leading to the end. Qu. <hi>But is holyness ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary on our parts? An.</hi> Yes, indeed Sir, that we be so, but it's necessary also that Grace make us so, unless we can make our <hi>selves</hi> so. Qu. <q>
                     <hi>But</hi> how can Obedience be for the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, when the necessity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is so destructive to free Grace?</q> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in <hi>its proper place,</hi> and for its <hi>proper end,</hi> is not <hi>destructive to free Grace:</hi> But when Hypocrites will assign it <hi>a room</hi> which God has not <hi>appointed,</hi> as to <hi>justifie us before a righteous Iudge,</hi> and give us <hi>a proper right</hi> to Heaven, then it <hi>crosses the design of free Grace.</hi> Qu. <q>But how can Holiness be for our honour, in making us like God, when the perfect Righteousness of Christ would be more for our honour?</q> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> Good, Sir, be not angry, and Il'e tell you: <hi>Inherent</hi> Righteousness is much for <hi>our honour,</hi> being compleat in its <hi>kind;</hi> but <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> righteousness is more for <hi>our honour,</hi> being absolutely <hi>compleat.</hi> Qu. But you say, <hi>Holiness</hi>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:105027:179"/>
                  <hi>is for our Peace; Must we then at last fetch our peace from our Duties and Graces, is not this to renounce Christ? An.</hi> Pray, Sir, be not so hasty, we have our <hi>Reconciliation with God,</hi> and Security from his Wrath, <hi>by the Blood of Christ;</hi> but we have our <hi>inward peace</hi> in the Conscience, from the <hi>evidence</hi> of our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Qu. But does not Doctor <hi>O.</hi> say, <hi>That we must not set about correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lives;</hi> for by the deeds of the Law, no man is Justified, and that if God should mark what is done amiss, there's no standing before him? <hi>An.</hi> Yes indeed does he, <hi>That we must not set about correcting</hi> our Lives, in order to Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Righteous Judge of all the Earth. Qu. <hi>But how can Holiness serve for the Conviction of Enemies, when it is not Essentially necessary to his Friends? An.</hi> Indeed, Sir, if you will believe me, it's <hi>Essentially necessary to all his Friends;</hi> and I pray it may prove more <hi>serviceable to the Conviction of his Enemies.</hi> Qu. Wilt thou dare to Contradict me? I tell thee, I am resolved, they shall hold, that <hi>Holiness is not necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An.</hi> Nay, pray Sir, do not <hi>force them to that:</hi> And if you can make any shift, Rail at them upon some other account. Qu. <q>But how can Holiness be necessary to the Conversion of others, when men may be Converted without it?</q> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> Ay, indeed, if your Worship can Inform us how to conceive of <hi>Conversion</hi> without <hi>Holiness,</hi> you shall be owned for the Wisest man in all the Parish. Qu. <q>But why cannot the Righteousness of Christ keep the Judgments of God from others, more effectually than the Holiness of men?</q> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>visible Holiness</hi> honours God most before men
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105027:179"/>
and therefore he will honour it most with <hi>visible Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Qu. <hi>But how can Obedience be necessary to the state of justified Persons, when they are cloathed with the Robes of Christs righteousness, which is the only Foundation of our Communion with God? An.</hi> Very well, Sir, for though <hi>Christs righteousness</hi> be <hi>the Foundation of our Communion,</hi> yet <hi>Holiness and Obedience,</hi> give us a <hi>meetness and fitness</hi> for the exercise of that Communion. Qu. <hi>But how can Holiness be ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>essary to Sanctification? An.</hi> Holy Obedience is necessary to Sanctification, because the new Creature is Nourisht by suitable Acts of Obedience; even as all other things are fed by those things of which they are made. Qu. But is not this <hi>Idem per Idem? An.</hi> No, I assure you Sir, for the <hi>Vital Principle</hi> of Obedience, and the <hi>Living Fruits</hi> of it are really <hi>two distinct</hi> things. Qu. But yet I cannot see any necessary Obligation to Holiness, from those mens Principles, what should be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? <hi>An.</hi> I can soon tell you that, Sir, do younot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, you <hi>almost Pored out your Eyes,</hi> in the second Section. Qu. I have one question more, answer me that, and take all: <hi>Is Holiness necessary to Salvation, as a means to an End?</hi> Now speak to the purpose. <hi>An.</hi> Really, Sir, it is <hi>absolutely and indispensibly necessary.</hi> Qu. This is indeed, Home, Pertinent, and somewhat to the purpose; bút yet I have a question or two more, I am sure will Choak you: Come on your ways, young Man: What say you? What, <hi>Holiness necessary to Eternal Life, and yet neither the Cause, Matter, nor Condition? An.</hi> Sir, I perceive you have a frail Memory, for you quoted the Doctor just before, saying, <hi>It was neither Matter, Cause, nor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:105027:180"/>
                  <hi>of our Iustification:</hi> And now you put the question about its being <hi>the Cause, Matter, or Condition, of Eternal Salvation.</hi> Qu. Did you spie that? <hi>An.</hi> Do you think your Readers have all <hi>pored their Eyes out,</hi> as well as your self? Quest. Well, hold your peace, I will now Irrefragably prove, <hi>Holiness to be a Cause, at least</hi> Causa sine quâ non, <hi>of Eternal Life:</hi> What say you to that? <hi>An.</hi> Pray spare your pains, lest you spoil the Cause; for if you can prove it no better a Cause, you had as good let it alone, for <hi>Causa sine quâ non, non est Causa;</hi> we allow it to be both the Condition and the Matter also of Eternal Life: It's the Condition, for the Doctor has owned expresly, <hi>That none shall come to the end, who walks not in the way:</hi> And it's the Matter too, for <hi>Grace is Glory begun, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is Holiness perfected.</hi> Qu. <hi>Well, I will not Dispute about words, I am content it should only be a necessary way to Eternal Life: But what becomes of Christ then, who is the only way? An.</hi> Take you no care for that, Christ is the <hi>only way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Purchase,</hi> and <hi>Procurement;</hi> but Holiness is <hi>a way of Means,</hi> preparatory <hi>Meetness,</hi> and <hi>Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for Eternal Life. I suppose you sometimes read the <hi>11th. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t.</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which acquaints you, that we are Justified <hi>only for Christs Merits,</hi> and yet <hi>justified by Faith only.</hi> There may be several Only's in the same Effect, and yet each the <hi>Only one,</hi> in suo genere. Qu. <hi>But is not the Righteousness of Christ able to save us, without an additional righteousness of our own? An.</hi> No, Sir, for the <hi>Righteousness of Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>made ours,</hi> by the <hi>appointment, constitution,</hi> and <hi>free Gift of God,</hi> we must enjoy the benefits
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105027:180"/>
of it, <hi>in that Method</hi> it pleases the Donour to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. It's reason <hi>the Giver should dispose of his own Gift:</hi> And yet it's true, <hi>the Righteousness of Christ</hi> is able to save us <hi>without any of our own,</hi> employed for that special end for which the <hi>righteousness of</hi> Christ is used. <hi>Qu.</hi> 
                  <q>But do the Active and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Righteousness of Christ both free us from Guilt and Punishment, and give us an actual Right and Title to Glory, and yet can we not be saved without walking in the ways of God?</q> 
                  <hi>An.</hi> Concerning <hi>Active and Passive righteousness,</hi> I shall say little; but, never flatter your self, without walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Ways of God you can never be saved. For it's plain, That <hi>no Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall Inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Qu. <hi>But what then becomes of Free-Grace? An.</hi> It's quite shut out of <hi>some mens Principles;</hi> but as to us, we own it the great Spring of all our present enjoyments, and future Expectations. Qu. <hi>But is not this to Eke out the righteousness of Christ with our own? An.</hi> I have told you, our Holiness is <hi>no Patch</hi> to Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but has its <hi>Distinct concerns, Peculiar uses,</hi> and <hi>Proper employment,</hi> in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>Qu.</hi> Say you so? I protest thou art the most Pertinacious, Refractory, and Obstinate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever I Catechised in my life: But I let thee know, I am resolved, that <hi>they shall hold, in spight of their teeth,</hi> that <hi>Holiness and Obedience, are not necessary to Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the short of all this long Discourse, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives us in these words: <q>That to know Christ, is not to be thus acquainted with his Person, but to understand his Gospel in its full Latitude and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105027:181"/>
Extent: It's not the Person of Christ, but the Gospel of Christ, which is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</q> To which I only say, 1. It's a strange Definition of <hi>the Knowledge of Christ,</hi> that it is, <hi>not to know Him:</hi> To know, is to be Ignorant; to see, is to be Blind. 2. It's impossible to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>the Gospel in its Latitude,</hi> but we must <hi>thus know Christs Person;</hi> he has Learnt little that has not Learnt <hi>the reconciliation made in the Blood of Christs Cross.</hi> 3. Though the Scriptures be <hi>the way and Means,</hi> yet the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> is the <hi>way of Mediation,</hi> whereby we come to the Father: And though we have <hi>Direction, Instruction, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi> from the Scripture, to walk in the way of Holiness, yet we have <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> from the Lord Jesus Christ, who is <hi>a Head of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> as well as Authority, to all that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, to walk in that Way.</p>
               <p>At length, the Gentleman having Discharged the Office of a <hi>Catechist,</hi> will let us know how terrible he is for <hi>an Exorcist:</hi> He falls a Raving, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring at the <hi>acquaintance with Christ,</hi> that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles seem to <hi>burn blew,</hi> the <hi>Ground to tremble;</hi> and in this Sulphureous Vehicle, we shall see him Raise his Spirit. <q>Acquaintance with Christs Person is only a work of Fancy, teaches the Arts of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, undermines the Fundamental Design of the Gospel, makes Men incurably Ignorant, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Talkers, insolent Censurers, and every Boy learns to Despise the Ignorance of his Teachers.</q> Our Author is Whistling over to himself his wild Notes, just like a Black-Bird in the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> that he may not be to seek in <hi>March:</hi> So here he gives us a <hi>Synopsis of Scolding;</hi> the <hi>brief</hi>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:105027:181"/>
                  <hi>Heads of things</hi> upon any of which he can Write a Book as long as this: But what is the Matter? Why, <hi>Boys despise the Ignorance of their Teachers.</hi> I had rather they should despise their Ignorance than their Knowledge: Ay, but they despise them <hi>for not knowing Christ, and the Mystery of the Gospel:</hi> Alas! you do <hi>not pretend</hi> to know him, but have described <hi>the Knowledge</hi> of Christ <hi>by Ignorance</hi> of him: Oh! but <hi>the Laws of Christ will not down with them.</hi> At this rate (I believe) they never will: All Reverence to his Laws must cease, when his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is exposed to Contempt: He that Teaches men to Mock at the Personal Excellencies, Beauty, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Fulness of the Law-giver, does more surely, though more slowly undermine the Foundation of Gospel-Obedience, than he that brings his Mattocks to the Commandment itself. The Reader perhaps is not aware what design our Author has upon him: Why, <hi>He hopes that</hi> good <hi>People will hereafter have better thoughts of him,</hi> and his Fellows, <hi>that they are not such Strangers to Christ, as they may Imagine;</hi> for <hi>he has a greater Reverence for him, than to be so Rude and Unmannerly, than to make bold with his Person, and with his Laws.</hi> I could heartily wish, indeed, our Author were no stranger to Christ, (but it's better so than worse) to be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Him, may perhaps prove his best Plea for Enmity against Him: For his Boldness, I cannot tell how more unmannerly he could well be; he has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his <hi>chiefest and most glorious Titles,</hi> whereby the Spirit of God has Recommended him to our best Affections, the Gospel Portraitures of <hi>Christs Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> &amp;c. he calls <hi>Romantick Descriptions;</hi> he has Overthrown and Confounded, all his Offices,

               <p>Four Notable Observations he makes to us in this one Section.</p>
               <p n="1">[1] That <hi>those Metaphors which describe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between Christ and Christians, do primarily referre to the Christian Church, and not to every Individual Christian.</hi> I am sorry that it must still be my great unhappiness to dissent from him, but seeing all Accommodation is desperate, we must bear the shock of his Reasonings as well as we can: <hi>Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is called a Head, but he is the Head of his Church, which is his Body, as the Husband is the Head of his Wife; No particular Christian is the Body of Christ, but onely a Member in this Body.</hi> This indeed would do pretty well, but that it wants two small Circumstances, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Pertinency;</hi> which being so inconsiderable, we may well spare in any of His Writings. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Methinks I want that sorry <hi>circumstance of Truth</hi> in his Argument. <hi>Christ is the Head of his Church, as the Husband is Head of his Wife;</hi> but the <hi>Headship of the Husband over the Wife,</hi> will not <hi>exactly measure</hi> the <hi>Headship of Christ over Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> we must call in assistance from <hi>another Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi> that of <hi>the Head in the Natural Body over</hi>

                  <hi>the Members:</hi> Christ is <hi>a Head of Influence,</hi> as well as <hi>Authority;</hi> he communicates <hi>Grace to Obey,</hi> as well as <hi>commands Obedience.</hi> And this is that the Apostle would teach us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 15, 16.—<hi>The head, even Christ, from whom all the Body fitly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together and compact, by that which every joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual working, in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body, to the edifying of it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Much of the Poverty and Beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Types, lay in this, (those <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105027:186"/>
of my Assertion; for though <hi>a shadow</hi> may describe <hi>the general</hi> Lineaments of its Body, yet it will not paraphrase upon <hi>the Complexion:</hi> To supply this defect, it has pleased the Wisdom of God to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that numerous train of Types, that so what could not be express'd <hi>by any one,</hi> might yet in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels be described by Another. Hence is it, that <hi>one Type</hi> represents <hi>the Death of Christ</hi> as a Sacrifice for Sin; as <hi>the Goat of the Sin-offering,</hi> Lev. 16. 15. Another, <hi>the Intercession of Christ</hi> at the right hand of the Father; as <hi>Aarons</hi> appearing in the Most Holy place upon the Feast of Expiation: The same Wisdom has it pleased the Spirit of God to exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>cise, in describing to us the Union and Relation betwixt Christ and Believers; for, seeing that <hi>no one single Metaphor,</hi> however borrowed from the nearest, and most intimous Relation upon Earth, could possibly convey to our understandings all that Mercy, Grace and Love, which from Christ issues to all that are in Covenant with him; nor all that Reverence, Love and Duty, which from Believers is due to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; therefore has he chosen out many, that so by putting together the Mercy and Duty which is comprehended in each, we might spell out the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is wrapt up in that Relation wherein we stand to him. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It wants <hi>Pertinency</hi> as well as Truth: For, what if <hi>no particular Christian be the Body of Christ.</hi> yet is he <hi>a Member</hi> of that Body; and Christ, <hi>as Head of that Body,</hi> is related in particular to him, <hi>without the Intervention</hi> of the Body. <hi>A Body</hi> is nothing else but <hi>the result</hi> of all the Integral parts put together in their <hi>due Scite,</hi> and <hi>proper Order:</hi> and <hi>the Church</hi> is nothing else but <hi>the aggregate</hi> of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105027:187"/>
many Christians united <hi>under their proper Pastor:</hi> And as <hi>the Head</hi> in the Natural Body is <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> related to all the parts, so is Christ <hi>immediately</hi> related to <hi>every true Christian.</hi> If then he will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, <hi>No particular Christian is the Body,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ is <hi>primarily</hi> related <hi>to the Body;</hi> any one with as much honesty may inferre, <hi>Every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Christian is a Member of Christ,</hi> therefore, <hi>Christ is primarily related to every particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:</hi> And thus the Conclusion will be as far to seek as ever; Whether <hi>this Metaphor</hi> of <hi>a Head</hi> does <hi>primarily</hi> referre to the <hi>whole Body,</hi> or <hi>particular Members.</hi> But let us go on: <hi>Christ is called a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> (says he) <hi>but then the whole Church, not every particular Christian, is his Spouse, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>tells the Church of Corinth,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I have espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you a chaste Virgin to Christ.</hi> To which renowned Argument, I have many things to oppose. 1. If the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was the Spouse of Christ, then the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that of <hi>Coloss,</hi> that at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and to be sure the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will put in their claims with equal right to that Title; and then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of what he asserts, <hi>p.</hi> 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And, 2. If Christ hath <hi>but one Spouse,</hi> and yet <hi>every particular</hi> Church be <hi>his Spouse;</hi> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s but crumbling the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor into <hi>more minute particles,</hi> and then he may be <hi>a Husband to every individual Believer.</hi> 3.

may <hi>perhaps more fitly</hi> express Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>particular Churches,</hi> than <hi>particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> yet this hinders not, but that <hi>Christ</hi> may be <hi>primarily related</hi> to <hi>particular Believers:</hi> For <hi>the Metaphor</hi> does not express <hi>the Order</hi> of Christs Relation, but <hi>the Relation it self.</hi> The word <hi>Church</hi> is onely <hi>a Term of Art,</hi> which expresses the <hi>same Persons collectively,</hi> who <hi>distributively</hi> taken, are each <hi>immediately</hi> related to Christ. Again, <hi>Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is a Shepheard, and the Christian Church is his Flock, for the Relation between Shepheard and Sheep, doth primarily concern the whole Flock.</hi> This is but <hi>one Doctors</hi> opinion at most, and will hardly mount it up to the Credit of <hi>Probability.</hi> For, 1. A Shepheard may be related to <hi>one single Sheep;</hi> and that one is enough to keep alive, and maintain the Relation; <hi>one Sheep</hi> will denominate him <hi>a Shepheard,</hi> though there must be <hi>more than one</hi> to constitute <hi>a Flock.</hi> As there was <hi>a first Man,</hi> related to God, as a Creature to his Creator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was <hi>A Church;</hi> so there was <hi>a first Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> a first Believer, or Convert, and <hi>that one</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pastoral Charge and care of Christ the great Shepheard, <hi>ipso facto, as a sincere Convert, and sound Believer,</hi> and yet <hi>that Individual</hi> would not make <hi>a Society</hi> under Bishops or Pastors. 2. A Flock is made up of <hi>many Sheep;</hi> now that which <hi>constitutes,</hi> is at least in order of Nature before <hi>the thing constituted:</hi> The whole is made up of parts; and I have been taught to presume, that the <hi>parts</hi> are in order of Nature before the <hi>whole:</hi> A Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard does not muster a company of howling Wolves, and roaring Lyons, and then by that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection make them a Flock of Sheep; but he gathers
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105027:188"/>
particular Sheep together, unites them into one Fold, and thereby they become a Flock. The way of Christ is not, to amass a Medley of debauched Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Scoundrels, and by making them a Church, make them Christians; but he seeks out for his own Service, particular Christians, and out of these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials he forms his Church. Again: <hi>Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is the Rock upon which his Church is built, and the Christian Church is a Holy Temple.</hi> Let him take it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or granted, if it will do him any service; but is <hi>this Rock, this Foundation,</hi> this <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> related <hi>primarily</hi> to the Building, or to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Stones? The Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> who was a wise Master-builder in Church-work, understood the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod much better: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>To whom coming as to a</hi> Living Stone; <hi>ye also as</hi> lively Stones, <hi>are built up a spiritual House:</hi> Hence ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings would conclude, that <hi>the building</hi> did not make <hi>the materials,</hi> but the <hi>materials</hi> made <hi>the building;</hi> the <hi>Spiritual House</hi> did not make the <hi>Lively Stones,</hi> but the <hi>Lively Stones</hi> made <hi>the Spiritual House:</hi> Such Language the Apostle durst use; <hi>these lively Stones</hi> were <hi>first united</hi> to the <hi>living Corner-stone,</hi> and the product of all was, a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Fabrick: And thus was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple built; <hi>the materials</hi> were exactly <hi>fitted,</hi> and <hi>squared</hi> for their <hi>respective uses</hi> and places, and there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe but to joyn them together, and out of those (after seven years Labour) there <hi>grew up a Holy Temple:</hi> Had He built of <hi>Bricks,</hi> the Edifice would never have converted them into <hi>hewen Stones;</hi> and had he used onely <hi>Sycamores,</hi> they had never been turned into <hi>Cedars</hi> by being Sleepers in the wall. I must therefore abate him an Ace or two of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:105027:188"/>
his general Conclusion: <hi>All these Metaphors in their first, and most proper use, referre to the whole Society of Christians.</hi> In <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6. Christ is called <hi>the Everlasting Father,</hi> which Metaphor (if it be a Metaphor) does primarily express the Relation of Christ to <hi>every adopted child,</hi> and not the Relation of Christ to <hi>Children</hi> in gross, and in the Lump: A Father is as really so to <hi>one child,</hi> as to <hi>Twenty;</hi> he may be a Father <hi>to more,</hi> but <hi>not more</hi> a Father. It will sound harshly in the Ears of any that have not lost them under the Cataracts of <hi>Nilus:</hi> to say, That <hi>Father</hi> does not <hi>primarily</hi> describe the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Philip</hi> (<hi>v. g.</hi>) to <hi>Alexander, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. but to <hi>children,</hi> in the first place, and then at <hi>second hand,</hi> and through a remove or two, to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Thus is the <hi>Everlasting Father prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> related to <hi>every childe,</hi> by virtue of his Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Regeneration; and <hi>secondarily</hi> to them all as <hi>brethren,</hi> related to one another, living under the same Discipline, and Laws of the Family.</p>
               <p n="2">[2] He observes further to us for our Learning: That <hi>the Union of particular Christians to Christ, is by Means of their Union to the Christian Church:</hi> Which he as Learnedly proves from 1 Cor. 12. 27. <hi>Ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi> Where the strength of this Argument lies, I confess, I see not: That <hi>the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>was the Body of Christ,</hi> That I plainly see: That <hi>every particular Member of that Church, was a Member of Christ;</hi> I think I see that too: But that it was <hi>therefore a Member of Christ,</hi> because it was <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Body</hi> of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> I own my Dulness, <hi>that</hi> I cannot see: And I have some scruples that makes me Halt, and not so Nimbly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:105027:189"/>
                  <hi>go on both Feet</hi> into our Authors Opinion. For, 1. If <hi>particular Christians</hi> by being United to <hi>the Body,</hi> become the <hi>Members of Christ,</hi> then what <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Union</hi> have these particular Churches to Unite them to Christ? We poor Folks of <hi>the Laity</hi> have an Expedient found out to Unite us to Christ, namely, by Uniting us to the Church under the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Pastors: But what shall become of the Bishops and Pastors themselves? What Provision is made for them? VVhich way shall they be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ? Some (indeed) talk of Uniting them by their <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and them again by their <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and then these by the <hi>Pope:</hi> But who shall Unite <hi>him, poor man?</hi> I see here's a Design laid to prove <hi>the Pope</hi> to be <hi>Antichrist.</hi> 2. VVhen a Church is <hi>first Collected,</hi> I am perplexing my self how the <hi>first Convert,</hi> the <hi>first Believer</hi> comes to be United to Christ, when there is <hi>never a Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting by which he should be United: And it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me to think, what a long while that unhappy Creature may be Holy, and very Religious, and yet cannot be united to Christ, because others will not consent to become a Church; and thus he must necessarily perish, though he be thus Holy, and Devout, because others will not go to Heaven with him. But, 3. VVe must suppose, that <hi>Baptism U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites us to the Visible Church:</hi> Now, either this single Person was United to Christ before his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, or not: If he was, then <hi>the Cause is lost;</hi> for then <hi>Union with the Visible Church,</hi> is not <hi>the only Means</hi> of our Union to Christ. If not, then, 1. What a sad Generation of Wretches must be <hi>the Ingredients</hi> of a Church? And some will define it, as others have made it; <hi>A Cage of unclean Birds,</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:105027:189"/>
                  <hi>and a Hold of every filthy and unclean Spirit.</hi> And then, 2. It will be the unquestionable Duty of the Pastors of the Church, to admit into the Society, the most Profligate Rascals, that offer themselves: For what would you have them do? Shall they be so Barbarous and Inhumane, such bloody Murtherers of Souls, to deny them <hi>the only Means</hi> of their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christ? And what would you have the poor wicked wretches do? Repent, and believe, and turn from their sins? Alas! all's to no purpose, they can never be United to Christ, without <hi>the only Means</hi> of Union; were they as Meek as <hi>Moses,</hi> as Patient as <hi>Iob,</hi> as Believing as <hi>Abraham,</hi> they are never the nearer Christ; and therefore as good come Loaden with all their Villanies, and Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Rogueries, and be but united to the Church, and all in good time, they may come to be United to Christ: But surely the Church of <hi>England</hi> has Instructed her Children otherwise. I shall not press our Author with the <hi>Articles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he's no great admirer of them; but because he so adores the Catechism, I shall remit him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Satisfaction. Qu. <hi>What is required of Persons to be Baptised? Ans.</hi> 
                  <q>Repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they forsake sin; and Faith, whereby they sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly believe the Promises of God made to them in that Sacrament.</q> If now <hi>such a Faith, such a Repentance,</hi> as are here described, must qualifie a Person for Baptism, that he may be <hi>United there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the Church,</hi> and so to Christ; I would gladly learn, whether <hi>such a faith, and such a repentance,</hi> will not serve to Unite him to Christ, antecedent to his Baptism? And if not, whether the Church can contribute any more to his Union with him?
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:105027:190"/>
Another Reason of our Authors, proceeds thus: <hi>The Church is Christs Flock, and every Christian who is of this Fold, is one of Christs Sheep.</hi> In good time! but is he <hi>therefore,</hi> and <hi>onely therefore,</hi> one of Christs Sheep because he is <hi>one of this Fold?</hi> Or rather taken into the <hi>Fold,</hi> because he was <hi>first one of Christs Sheep?</hi> But if indeed this be the real way to Create sheep, by taking any thing that has <hi>four Legs</hi> into the Fold, it will be a Noble piece of Charity to revive the <hi>Tribute of Wolves;</hi> and if the Breed should be worn out in <hi>England,</hi> we know <hi>from whence</hi> to recruite the Sheepfold; but still he proceeds, and I perceive he has a mind to prove something if he knew what. <hi>The Church is Christs Spouse, every Christian is a Member of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which Christ owns for his Spouse, but every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is not Christs Spouse.</hi> No? Why not? Now comes the Knocking-argument: <hi>He is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Poligamy, and hath but one Spouse.</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful! So is Christ <hi>a great Enemy to Monsters,</hi> and Prodigies, and has but <hi>one Body:</hi> And yet for all this, our Author could allow <hi>the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> to be <hi>his Spouse,</hi> to be <hi>his Body,</hi> and then I will allow the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to have been his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>his Spouse,</hi> and others (as their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lead them) will no doubt allow other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches to be <hi>his Body, his Spouse;</hi> and then Christ shall have as many particular <hi>Bodies,</hi> and <hi>Spouses,</hi> as there are particular <hi>Churches</hi> upon the Face of the Earth; and so this Doughty argument Vanishes into Smoak, and nothing: and in lieu of it, I will offer him another. It's impossible to be <hi>United to Christ,</hi> without the <hi>only Means</hi> of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it's possible to be <hi>United to Christ,</hi> without
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:105027:190"/>
being United to a <hi>particular Church,</hi> therefore to be <hi>United to a particular Church,</hi> is not the only Means of Uniting us to Christ. The former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position we will for once humbly beg at his hands, and do not doubt but he will charitably grant it; the second is Evidenced from hence: When particular Churches are broken in pieces by Persecution, or otherwise, yet the <hi>true believing Members</hi> are not <hi>thereby</hi> separated <hi>from Christ;</hi> they cease not to be <hi>Christs Friends,</hi> because the World is <hi>their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> Yea indeed (says our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 165.) If <hi>there be no Visible Society (as it may happen in time of Persecution) it must of necessity alter the Case.</hi> That is in plain <hi>English;</hi> his Discourse had been <hi>Strong,</hi> if it had not been <hi>Weak;</hi> and our Union to the Church had been <hi>the only Means</hi> of our Union to Christ, but for one ill favoured Business, that there is <hi>another Means</hi> of our union to him, and we may be united to him <hi>without it.</hi> I grant (indeed) with much readiness, that it is our unquestionable Duty, and when all Circumstances concur, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible Duty for every Christian to joyn himself <hi>to some particular Church;</hi> the Command of Christ has made it so: The <hi>Edifying our own Souls</hi> in Faith, Love, Comfort, adds to that necessity; the <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our God, and our Redeemer,</hi> in a visible Profession of, and Subjection to all his Ordinances, heightens that Necessity; the <hi>enjoyment of many Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Ordinances</hi> which presuppose a Church-state, add more weight to the Necessity, and that our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ has <hi>more Bonds</hi> laid upon it, by this means, I freely own; but that <hi>our Union with the Church,</hi> is the only means to Unite us to Christ, I must see better Arguments to prove it, before I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:105027:191"/>
know how to believe it: Our Union with Christ, is by <hi>Invisible and Internal</hi> Ligaments, and if there were no other, than what a <hi>Visible Church</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, I do not see, but all Christians are Obliged to be Hypocrites. The great Promises of the Gospel, those of Justification, Adoption, and Sanctification, are made <hi>to Individuals,</hi> and how to apply them <hi>to whole Churches,</hi> otherwise than <hi>by the Individuals,</hi> is unconceivable: They are <hi>single Persons,</hi> that are Justified, Sanctified, Adopted, Pardoned, and Saved, and not a Complex Notion, which is only an Operation of the Mind conceiving of singular things, as they relate one to another.</p>
               <p>There is yet one Text of Scripture, which our Author has reserved as the <hi>Triarij</hi> to the main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and though his Jelites be Cut off, and his Body shaken, yet so long as his Reserves are entire, and unbroken, he cannot be totally Routed. The place is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman.—Abide in me, and I in you. As the Branch cannot bear Fruit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.</hi> Now because he lays such a Stress upon, and places all his Hopes and Confidence in this place, I shall particularly Examine, 1. His Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. His Reasons for that Interpretation. 3. The Use he makes of this Interpretation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) For his Interpretation, it has more Faces than <hi>Ianus;</hi> and more Colours than the Rainbow. <hi>I am the true Vine: Where</hi> [I] <hi>signifies Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Church:</hi> There's one Face. But <hi>pag.</hi> 146. He repents that ever he took <hi>the Person of Christ</hi> into the Paraphrase, for fear some ill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons should make an ill use on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Glosses it thus: <hi>I am the true Vine, that</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:105027:191"/>
                  <hi>is the Church:</hi> So [<hi>I</hi>] is grown a Church. But yet that neither will not answer all his Occasions, nor stop all Gaps, and therefore it must put on another shape: <hi>pag.</hi> 147. <hi>When Christ speaks in the first Person</hi> [<hi>I</hi>] <hi>he cannot mean this of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but of his Church, Doctrine, and Religion:</hi> And yet for all this it will not do the Feat, but it must pass through one Metamorphosis more, and it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, <hi>a sincere and hearty Belief of the Gospel.</hi> So here we have got <hi>the Act</hi> and <hi>the Object</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together in this one word [<hi>I:</hi>] A man would conclude he had found at last <hi>Aristotles Materia Prima,</hi> it's <hi>Omnium formarum capax:</hi> Nothing <hi>in Act,</hi> but every thing <hi>in Power,</hi> a piece of <hi>soft Wax,</hi> that's plyable to any Impression, a mere <hi>blanck Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> you may Write down your own Conditions: But what is meant by the Vine? Why that's the Church too, <hi>pag.</hi> 146. <hi>That is, the Church, which is founded on the belief of my Gospel, is the only true Church:</hi> Or, <hi>I am the Vine,</hi> that is, the Church is the Church; but let us proceed. <hi>He that abideth in me:</hi> [In me] that is, <hi>the Christian Church:</hi> [I in him,] that is, <hi>the Christian Doctrine; For without me, you can do uothing:</hi> That is, <hi>without a sincere belief of my Gospel.</hi> And now he presumes he has laid his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so Closely, Evenly, and Regularly together, that he may defie the Cunning of the most expert Caviller to disturb them. And yet to deal openly with him, he has not lead me Captive by his fair Colours and regular Proportions. For, 1. I find his way of Interpretation meerly <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> such as has no other Foundation but the <hi>Soveraign will</hi> of the Commentator; he deals with Scripture as if it were his <hi>perfect Vassal,</hi> and he the <hi>absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:105027:192"/>
of the Word of God; and that his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase knew no other Language than his <hi>Car tel est nostre plaisir: For such is our Will and Pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Let the Reader take but a taste: <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him.</hi> Where [<hi>Me</hi>] must signifie the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and [<hi>I</hi>] <hi>the Christian Doctrine.</hi> For we must know for our Learning, that [<hi>Me</hi>] in <hi>the Ablative case,</hi> must always signifie <hi>a Church;</hi> but [<hi>I</hi>] in <hi>the Nominative case,</hi> that's <hi>the Christian Doctrine.</hi> And if any peevish Fellow shall Object that it's a huge Wonder that such a slight Variation of the Case, should alter the Signification. Every puisny Shool-Boy will inform him, that the varying the Case, does wonderfully alter the Case. Now had it been Referred to a Hundred Systematical, Heavy-headed Divines, they would have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, One and All; that if [<hi>I</hi>] signifie a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> [<hi>Me</hi>] will signifie the same: And if [<hi>Me</hi>[ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>a Church,</hi> [<hi>I</hi>] will signifie neither better nor worse, but a Church too; but when a <hi>Zaphnath Paaneah,</hi> a Revealer of Secrets, shall take the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, he will shew you the difference. 2. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Exception I have against this Interpretation, is, That Christ has often spoke in the first Person, He has compared himself to many other things, and yet never intended any thing by [<hi>I</hi>] but his own Self, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 11. <hi>I am the good Shepherd.</hi> And besides that, we have had our Authours Suffrage to it, the thing it self makes it evident that Christ speakes there neither of <hi>Church,</hi> nor <hi>Doctrine. The Fold,</hi> must signifie <hi>the Church: The Pasture,</hi> will <hi>answer the Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> they are <hi>the Sheep,</hi> but <hi>Christ himself</hi> is <hi>the Shepherd.</hi> And yet one significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more for this poor [<hi>I</hi>] will do the business, let it signifie the <hi>Pastors and Bishops,</hi> and that will heal all.

Abide in me:</hi> But this is in the <hi>5th. verse, Without me.</hi> And so the Rule will be this; That whensoever you find it in the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative case,</hi> in the <hi>4th. verse</hi> of any Chapter, then it signifies <hi>the Church;</hi> but if it fall out to be the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative case,</hi> and the <hi>5th. verse,</hi> then believe it, you shall do well to Interpret it by <hi>Gospel or Doctrine:</hi> But still here's an odd Scruple behind; For what will become of <hi>ver.</hi> 4? <hi>Abide in Me, and and I in you: As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.</hi> Now our Authors Gloss is this, [<hi>abide in Me,</hi>] continue in <hi>the Church;</hi> and [<hi>I in you,</hi>] let <hi>my Doctrine continue in you.</hi> And then the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words must be thus Paraphrased: <hi>As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye</hi> [abide in the Church:] Which spoken of a particular Church, is utterly false; and there's no help left, but only this standing Rule: That [<hi>Me</hi>] in the <hi>beginning</hi> of a verse, signifies <hi>a Church;</hi> but in the <hi>latter end</hi> of a verse, it always signifies <hi>a Doctrine.</hi> And then the <hi>5th.</hi>

               <p n="2">(2.) His Interpretation being so <hi>Arbitrary, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, Self-Inconsistent,</hi> and <hi>Ridiculously false,</hi> I need not much trouble my self with his Reasons; nor should I, but that they also discover its <hi>

                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:105027:194"/>
Reason 1. <hi>The Iewish Church is frequently in the Old Testament called a Vine,</hi> Isa. 5. 1. <hi>I will sing to my Beloved a Song concerning his Vineyard. My Beloved had a Vineyard: Iudge between me and my Vineyard.</hi> And now he must be very blind, that does not see <hi>the Church is compared to a Vine;</hi> though some will be so Peevish, as to fancy some small difference between <hi>a Vine, and a Vineyard.</hi> But yet <hi>it is called a Vine,</hi> Jer. 2. 21. Very true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> What? Why therefore Christ is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Vine, in the New Testament. And therefore it must signifie Doctrine, Gospel, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Twenty things more. But, 1. Tell me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously: Did God, or any of the Prophets, ever say, <hi>I am the Vine;</hi> and then teach the <hi>Iews</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant thus upon it? That is, <hi>The Church which is founded on the belief of Moses his Doctrine, is the only true Church.</hi> When the Prophet will describe <hi>the Church by a Vine,</hi> he tells you expresly <hi>what he intends;</hi> and there's an end of all Controversie: And so would our Saviour if ever he intended to be understood, till <hi>a happy Head</hi> should, after Sixteen Hundred Years, light upon the Mystery. Ay, but <hi>the Christian Church is expresly called an Olive Tree, and the Members of it called Branches,</hi> Rom. 11. 17, 18. Expresly? And must we then <hi>split against that Rock,</hi> and Interpret the place, <hi>by the express the sound of words?</hi> Two things let him consider at his Leisure, 1. Whether it be the Christian Church that is there compared to the Olive-Tree. 2. Whether it be said, that <hi>Christ is the Olive-Tree:</hi> Which expression if he can produce, and then make it out, that <hi>[I] am the Olive-Tree,</hi> signifies <hi>the Church is so;</hi> we will then freely confess he has bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:105027:194"/>
fair towards a probability for the truth of his Interpretation. 2. Because <hi>God is called the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who takes care to Dress this Vine, which cannot be understood of Christ, but of the Church.</hi> This Reason seems to carry <hi>some civility</hi> towards Jesus Christ, and therefore deserves a fairer Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than <hi>the strength</hi> of it can challenge. Let this suffice: The Father is called <gap reason="foreign">

Ans.</hi> Many things are said <hi>to be,</hi> which only <hi>seem to be.</hi> There's nothing more ordinary than for <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,</hi> to wear the Livery of <hi>Realityes:</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are said to be in Christ <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:105027:195"/>
                  <hi>speaks in the First Person</hi> [I,] <hi>and</hi> [in Me,] <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean this of his own Person, but of his Church, Doctrine, and Religion.</hi> But where lies the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this great Demonstration? Why Christ says, <hi>I am the true Vine, and ye are the Branches; He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much Fruit, for without me you can do nothing.</hi> Well, what of all this? Why, our Author <hi>would willingly Learn what sence can be made of all this, if we understand it of the Person of Christ:</hi> And I will as willingly Teach him, if he be not too proud to Learn, <hi>I Iesus Christ, the Mediator of the New Covenant, am very fitly compared to a Vine; and ye my Disciples are as fitly compared to the Branches of a Vine. Now he that really abideth in me by a true lively faith, and I in him by the Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening Operations of my Spirit, the same bringeth forth much Fruit of holy Obedience; for without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of Grace from Me your Root, you can do nothing that is truly good, and acceptable to God.</hi> Oh! but he has two or three formidable Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against this Interpretation. 1. <hi>It's not very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, How we can be, or abide in Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi> No more it is: If we bring <hi>Capernaitical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi> along with us, who Puzled their Heads with a gross Notion of Carnal <hi>eating the Flesh, and drinking the Blood</hi> of Christ. If by [being in Christ] were understood, a Local, Physical, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>being in Him,</hi> it were somewhat Unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, but when no more is meant by it, but that every true Believer is by Constitution of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, one Person morally with Christ; so considered and dealt with by God, there's no more insuperable Difficulty, than what unbelief
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:105027:195"/>
will create in the clearest Truths of the Gospel. But, 2. <hi>It's more unintelligible still; How we can be in the Person of Christ, and the Person of Christ at the same time be in us; Which is a new piece of Philosophy, called Penetration of Dimensions.</hi> But there's no great danger in that: Christ may <hi>dwell in us by his Spirit,</hi> and <hi>we in him by Faith,</hi> and yet <hi>Faith and the Spirit,</hi> never disturb each other in their Motions; but what <hi>the Dimensions of the Soul,</hi> in its actings of Faith, or of <hi>the Spirit</hi> in it's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace are, this I confess, is to me <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible:</hi> And that a Christian should <hi>be in the Church,</hi> and <hi>the Church at the same time be in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> had been equally <hi>Unintelligible,</hi> and as much danger of the <hi>Penetration of Dimensions:</hi> But that our Author stumbled upon a happy Expedient; that [<hi>I</hi>] should signifie <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> and [<hi>Me</hi>] a Church, to heal the Contradiction. 3. <hi>That our Fruitfulness should depend on our Union to Christ, is as hard to my understanding.</hi> Truly, I cannot help that, I have no Medicine to cure Crazed Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals: He that cannot understand that Believers do receive Actual assistance from Christ by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to help them in the way of their Duty, and to encourage them against the Difficulties they meet withal in their Duties, cannot (I presume) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand very many Lines in the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Our last Task is, to Examine what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has made of this Interpretation, and in short it is this: <hi>That the Union of particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to Christ, consists in their Union to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</hi> And now I am abundantly satisfied, that our Author is a very <hi>Philomel, Vox &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea nihil;</hi> One, whose Volubility of Tongue,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:105027:196"/>
and Pen, supplies the place of Argument, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration: I hope our Author will not meet with many Readers, who have so far parted with their Memories, as not to remember what that was he Propounded to himself to Evince, <hi>viz. That the Union of particular Christians to Christ, is</hi> by means <hi>of their Union with the Christian Church:</hi> And yet now when he comes to cast up his Accounts, we have gotten another Conclusion; <hi>That the Union of particular Christians to Christ,</hi> consists <hi>in their Union to the Christian Church.</hi> Surely, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind will espie some small difference: <hi>Eating</hi> is <hi>a means</hi> to <hi>Living,</hi> yet none but a Swine of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Stye, will say, that <hi>Living</hi> consists in <hi>Eating.</hi> The High-road is a means to bring the Traveller Home; yet it will be hard to perswade us, that <hi>being at Home,</hi> consists <hi>in Travelling:</hi> Trading is <hi>a mean</hi> to Riches, yet <hi>Riches do not formally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <hi>in Trading:</hi> The end may possibly be separated from the Means, but nothing can be separated from that thing wherein it consists. But let that pass: If he has proved <hi>either the one, or the other,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he be reputed an Artist. The thing he has a good will to prove, is: That <hi>the Union of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians to Christ, is either</hi> by means <hi>of their Union to the Christian Church;</hi> or else that it <hi>consists in it.</hi> Now for the Proof of this: He has told us, That <hi>the Church is</hi> the Body <hi>of Christ:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the Temple <hi>of Christ:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the Spouse <hi>of Christ:</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is the Flock <hi>of Christ.</hi> And had it been referred to a thousand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not one but would have thought, that, <hi>that Christ</hi> who is the <hi>Head</hi> of that Body, is <hi>a Person:</hi> He that is the <hi>Husband</hi> of that Spouse, is <hi>a Person:</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:105027:196"/>
He that is the <hi>Shepheard</hi> of the Flock, is <hi>a Person:</hi> and He that <hi>Dwells</hi> in that Temple, is <hi>a Person:</hi> But things are not so far gone, but our Author shall have his Opinion, and choose what he will abide by; for my part I am much unconcern'd, let him please himself, he shall not displease me at all. Say then: Shall it be <hi>Christs Doctrinal,</hi> or <hi>Christs Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> that is the <hi>Head</hi> of this <hi>Body?</hi> The <hi>Husband</hi> of this <hi>Spouse?</hi> The <hi>Shepheard</hi> of this <hi>Flock?</hi> I can rest satisfied. But then the Sence runs thus: <hi>A Doctrine, or a Church,</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church: A Doctrine, or a Church,</hi> is the <hi>Husband</hi> of the <hi>Church: A Doctrine, or a Church,</hi> is the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> of the Church. If this does not please him, let him try the other way, and allow it to be <hi>a Person</hi> that is all these. <hi>A Person,</hi> that is the Head, Husband, and Shepheard of the Church: And now I must plainly acquaint him, That he has Entangled his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in such confusion, that he will never be able to Extricate them. For, 1. If the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ be here intended, then it seems at last, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>means be of that Union,</hi> yet there is <hi>an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Person of Christ;</hi> and whereinsoever that <hi>Union</hi> consists, yet <hi>such an Uunion</hi> there is: How absurd would it be, to enquire <hi>whether our Union to Christ's Person,</hi> consists in <hi>our Union with a particular Church?</hi> If, <hi>Union to Christs Person</hi> be a Non-entity? Or, <hi>Whether our Union with a particular Church,</hi> be the means <hi>to our Union with Christ?</hi> If there be <hi>no such thing?</hi> And then, 2. He is as much concern'd, as his poor Neighbours, to salve the Difficulties of <hi>being in Christs Person;</hi> and yet at the same time, <hi>Christs Person being in us;</hi> of the <hi>depending of our Fruitfulness upon that</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:105027:197"/>
                  <hi>Union,</hi> with whatever other Incongruities a strong Fancy may impute to it. And then 3. If <hi>the Person of Christ</hi> be intended in the Question, then his last and tedious Argument from <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 1. which he has managed with <hi>so much Industry,</hi> upon which he has bestowed <hi>so much Cost,</hi> and in which he places <hi>so much Confidence,</hi> concludes something very near to Nothing: For the Abstract of his <hi>Medium</hi> is this, that <hi>Christians are in the Church;</hi> which will never conclude, that therefore <hi>our Union to a particular Church is</hi> the Means <hi>of our Union to Christ,</hi> much less, that <hi>our Union to Christ</hi> consists <hi>in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Scriptures we are posted over to the Ancient Fathers; who (if we may believe him) <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all those Metaphors which decypher the Union between Christ and Christians to signifie, the Love and Unity of Christians among themselves.</hi> He that will reproach <hi>his own Mother,</hi> will not much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence <hi>the Fathers:</hi> They do indeed argue <hi>from the Unity between Christ and Christians,</hi> to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Necessity of <hi>Unity between Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> they are <hi>members of one body,</hi> under <hi>one common Head,</hi> and therefore it presses sore upon them, that there be no <hi>intestine Broyls</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: they are <hi>Sheep of the same Fold,</hi> under <hi>one Shepheard,</hi> and it were unnatural for <hi>Sheep to devour one another,</hi> which is the Province of Wolves; they are <hi>subjects in the same spiritual Kingdom,</hi> under Christ <hi>the Sovereign Monarch</hi> of the Church, and therefore all heats and animosities, all seuds and broyls, are alien from that place and Relation they fill up towards Christ, and each other: So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so the Scriptures argue: <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:105027:197"/>
                  <hi>why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother?</hi> The Process of the Argument is very clear, if we be <hi>Children of one Father,</hi> we ought to love <hi>our Brethren;</hi> but to conclude from thence, that <hi>A Childs Relation to his Father</hi> consists in <hi>the Love and Unity of the Children among themselves,</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than ridiculous. Thus from <hi>the Union between Christ and Christians,</hi> there is an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable Argument drawn for <hi>the Unity of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans amongst themselves;</hi> but that the Union of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians with Christ, <hi>does formally consist</hi> in their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agreement and Concord each with other, is a piece of Logick for which we are indebted to our Author; but <hi>thus Chrysostom expounds</hi> Eph. 2. 19, 20, 21. <hi>where the Apostle speaks of that spiritual building which is erected on the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ</hi> [himself <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] <hi>being the chief Corner-stone, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Unity of the Church in all Ages, that both the Iewish, and the Christian Church are united in Christ, as the several parts of the building are kept together by the Corner-stone.</hi> Now though <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> be little beholden to our Author for traducing his honest meaning, yet we are all beholden to <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> For then, 1. There have not been so many sorts of Churches in the World, as he would perswade us, but both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one universal catholick Church, though differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Oeconomy, and some variety of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; both the Jewish and Christian Church are the several parts of one and the same Building. And then, 2. The <hi>Iews,</hi> we may presume knew something at least of Christ, what he was to be <hi>to them,</hi> what he was <hi>to doe for them,</hi> if <hi>they and we,</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:105027:198"/>
Jews and Gentiles <hi>in all Ages</hi> are <hi>United in him. To the same purpose St.</hi> Ambrose: (Yes I believe it; as little to our Authors purpose as St. <hi>Chrysostom:</hi>) <hi>Duos Populos in se suscepit Christus Salvator, &amp; fecit unum in Domino, sicut Lapis Angularis duas parietes continet in Unitate Domûs firmatas:</hi> which our Author Englishes thus: <hi>Christ united two Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in himself, and made them one in the Lord, as the Corner-stone unites two Walls in a building, and makes it but one house.</hi> Now if we cannot agree about <hi>the Construing</hi> a piece of familiar Latine, we shall strangely differ in <hi>the Interpretation</hi> of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and tendency: And here <hi>Ambrose</hi> is less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to our Author than <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> for, that he may not cross our <hi>Authors sence,</hi> he is made to speak <hi>Non-sence. Christ united two people, and made them one:</hi> That is, <hi>he made them one,</hi> and <hi>made them one;</hi> or <hi>he united them, and united them;</hi> for, what <hi>uniting</hi> should be, but <hi>making one,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not divine. But <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Latine runs thus: <hi>Duos populos in se suscepit, &amp; fecit unum in Domino.</hi> He took two people upon himself, and (so) made them one in the Lord: He <hi>bore their Iniquities, carryed their sins in his body upon the Cross,</hi> and thereby <hi>reconciled them to God,</hi> and then their <hi>reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one Another would</hi> be easie: but our Author, (who is never wanting to his Concerns) was not at leisure to take notice of that: However (says he) this <hi>is the plain design of the place, to prove, that Christ hath taken away the enmity which was between Iew and Gentile, and hath reconciled them both to God.</hi> Well, I can be content it should be the Plain design, but not the Main design, not the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the place: Some men think themselves won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:105027:198"/>
witty in the Contrivance, that they have found out <hi>some Reconciling work</hi> for Christs Death: But then it must not be, to reconcile God and Sinners, but to remove an old grudge between <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;</hi> (which is an Invention of the latter dayes, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown to the Ancient Fathers, and the whole Catholick Church,) that they might not seem to say, there's <hi>no Reconciliation</hi> by the Blood of Christ: I would turn over our Author for satisfaction in this point to <hi>the Reason,</hi> not <hi>the Authority</hi> of Dr. <hi>E. Stillingfl.</hi> against <hi>Crellius, p.</hi> 558. <hi>A Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed between God and Man, on the account of sin, no reconciliation can be imagined but what is mutual: For, did Man only fall out with God, and had not God just reason to be displeased with Men, for their Apostacy from him? If not, what made him so severely punish the Old World, for their Impieties, by a Deluge? what made him leave such Monuments of his Anger against the Sins of the World, in succeeding Ages,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Well then, supposing God to be averse from men by reason of their sins; shall this displeasure alwayes continue, or not? If it alwayes continues, men must certainly suffer the desert of their sin: If it doth not alwayes continue, then God may be said to be reconciled, in the same sence that an offended party is capable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him who hath provoked him. Now there are two wayes, whereby a party justly offended, may be said to be reconciled to him that hath offended him: First, when he is not onely willing to admit of Terms of Agreement, but doth declare his Acceptance of the Mediation of a third Person, and that he is so well satisfied with what he hath done in order to it, that he appoints it to be published to all the world, to assure</hi>

                  <hi>the Offender, that if the Breach continues, the fault lyes wholly upon himself: The Second is, when the Offender doth accept the Terms of the Agreement offer'd: And these two we assert, must necessarily be distinguished in the Reconciliation between God and us: For, upon the Death and Sufferings of Christ, God declares to the World, that he is so well satisfied with what Christ hath done and suffer'd, in order to the Reconciliation between himself and us, that now be publishes Remission of sins to the World, upon those Terms which the Mediator hath declared by his own Doctrine; but because Remission of sins doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follow upon the Death of Christ, without supposition of any act on our part, therefore the state of Favour doth commence from the performance of those Conditions that are required of us,</hi> &amp;c. And now let the Authority of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose: Art. 31. [Of the one Oblation of Christ, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished upon the Cross:] <hi>The Offering of Christ once made, is that perfect Redemption, Propitiation and Satisfaction for the sins of the whole World, both Original and Actual, and there is none other Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for sin but that alone.</hi> But we shall be soundly pelted with the Fathers, and therefore he cites a great many more from <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and from all concludes: <hi>That according to the sence of this Holy man, particular Christians are united to Christ by Means of their Union to the Christian Church; otherwise I cannot understand how our Union to Christ, can be an Argument to Union and Concord among our selves.</hi> But if that be the worst on't, that he cannot understand it, Charity commands me to relieve his labouring understanding: It's a good Argument, that Children should entirely love one
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105027:199"/>
another, because they are Children of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet for all that, they become not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Father, by means of their Union one to another as Brethren; but they are therefore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, because they are Children of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It's an Argument, that Subjects should study and follow the things that make for Peace among themselves, because they are all Subjects to the same Prince, aud his honour, the strength, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his Kingdom, lyes much in it; and yet their Union among themselves is not the Means whereby they become related to their Prince; but because they are all Subjects to him, they become fellow-subjects each with other. And now methinks, a very ordinary pair of Brains might have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, how our Union to Christ is an Argument to Christians to unite amongst themselves, though by their union amongst themselves they had not been united to Christ: And thus he might as well have quoted the Ancient Father <hi>Mercurius Gallo-Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> as either <hi>Ambrose</hi> or <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> but that we are all mightily concerned to know, that he reads the Fathers, to very little purpose.</p>
               <p>But from hence he will give us a very seasonable word of Exhortation: <hi>That they would seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, who boast of their Union to Christ, and yet rend his Church into a thousand little Factions:</hi> I am glad however that they are not great Factions: And I would have them seriously consider it also, who broach such Doctrines, so contrary to the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Gospel, that if owned by any Church, must necessitate an absolute and total separation, if we will be true to Christ. There have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sad Controversies amongst us, but they have been
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105027:200"/>
about Mint, Anise, and Cummin, in comparison of the great and weighty things of the Gospel; but the Question now must be, Whether Christ be a true and proper High-priest, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> death upon the Cross be a proper Sacrifice offer'd unto God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him to sinners? The Question is now, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must hold Communion with God in Prayer or no? Whether Faith and Repentance will unite us to Christ? Nay, whether there be any such thing as an Union with Christs Person or no? Nay, upon the Matter, whether there be a Person of Christ or no? or that all must not be interpreted into Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Church, Office, and I cannot tell what? Some I perceive are hugely afraid, least differences should be accommodated; they dread <hi>The tombe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi> almost as much as their Own; they are more solicitous how Quarrels may live, than about their own Deaths; and therefore fearing those small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Bones of Contention would not set the World together by the ears long, they have thrown more considerable ones before us; to entail Contentions upon Posterity, and propagate Divisions to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It's the Interest of some men, to make loud clamours against Divisions, variety of Opinions, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Judgements, and yet to take special care that there shall never want matter for them; to complain of the Fire, and yet pour in Oyl to quench it; and if they may but warm their own hands, can sing over the flames which they have kindled, and do still foment. It has been the Policy of <hi>Rome,</hi> to build partition-walls of Separation, and then to rail at all that cannot leap over them; to thresh the Wheat out of the Floor, and then rage at it for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding from the Chaffe; to beat their Servants out
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:105027:200"/>
of doors, and then send Huy-and-cry after them, with all the Marks and Descriptions of Run-awayes. Thus far our Author has led us out of the way, and it will be high time to return.</p>
               <p>The Fathers may now go to bed, and sleep, our Author will give them no further trouble: Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is but an inartificial Argument, and now have at us with down-right Demonstration, and Club-law. <hi>Those Sacraments our Saviour hath instituted, are a plain demonstration, that our Union with Christ consists in our union with the Christian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For Baptism. <hi>Baptisme is the Sacrament of our Admission into the Visible Church;</hi> but <hi>in Baptisme we make a publick Profession of our Faith in Christ; Therefore the Union of particular Christians to Christ, is by Means of their Union with the Church.</hi> This is that plain Demonstration we are threatned with; and in a while, if our Author does but eat a dish of Beans and Bacon, it will be a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: In Baptism we make a <hi>visible Profession of our Faith in Christ;</hi> and if this Profession be <hi>true,</hi> such a one as the Church of <hi>England requires as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite</hi> to Baptism, we are <hi>thereby</hi> United to Christ <hi>antecedently to our Baptism.</hi> If Baptism finds us not in Christ, it puts us not into Christ: If it finds us not qualified for a Church state, it makes us not so; it is <hi>a Symbol,</hi> but it <hi>supposes</hi> the thing signified, and conferrs it not: It is a Seal, but presupposes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: But that we are admitted into the visible Church by it, he will prove; and indeed he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent at proving what none deny; and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward at proving the thing in Question; but hear his proof; 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body. In which</hi> (says he) <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:105027:201"/>
                  <hi>Apostle seems to allude to Baptism; which conferres the same Holy Spirit on us All, and thereby makes us all Members of that one Body, which is his Church.</hi> I think he is resolved never to produce a pertinent Scripture, to prove the plainest Truth: For, 1. here's but <hi>an Allusion</hi> at most; and has he scolded all this while against Allusions, Allegories, and must he lay the main stress of his Argument upon an Allusion? 2. It but <hi>seems to Allude</hi> neither, and that weakens the Credit of it exceedingly: An <hi>Allusion,</hi> a <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allusion; A shadow,</hi> the <hi>dream of a shadow:</hi> Any thing or Nothing will serve his turn for <hi>plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;</hi> when <hi>a Mans Name is up</hi> for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Man, <hi>he may lye in bed till noon.</hi> 3. <hi>This Baptisme</hi> (says he) <hi>conferres the same Holy Spirit upon us all:</hi> But the Apostle sayes no such matter, but the contrary; <hi>by the Spirit we are baptized;</hi> and not <hi>by Baptism receive the Spirit:</hi> Thus the Spirit <hi>Unites us to Christ;</hi> then comes Baptism, which looks <hi>backward</hi> as a Seal of what <hi>we have received,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> to our <hi>visible</hi> state in the Church; and hence it appears, that our <hi>Union to Christ,</hi> is the Reason of <hi>our Union to the Church;</hi> and not our <hi>Union to the Church,</hi> the Means to <hi>unite us to Christ.</hi> 4. Baptism admitts not into <hi>a particular Church,</hi> but the <hi>visible Church at large,</hi> and then it will be harder still for our Author to prove from thence, that <hi>the Union of particular Christians to Christ, is by Means of their union with a particular Church under the Bishops and Pastors:</hi> But if Allusions will not pass currant; <hi>Then</hi> (sayes he) <hi>more expressely in</hi> Eph. 4. 4, 5. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, as you are called in one hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism: That is, the Christian</hi>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:105027:201"/>
                  <hi>Baptism is but one; and is A Sacrament of Union; making us all the Members of that one Body of Christ; this is called being Baptized into Christ:</hi> i. e. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Christian Church by a visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith in Christ:</hi> Now for a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I could grant him all this, and yet despair of seeing his Conclusion: <hi>Baptism is but one;</hi> be it so: <hi>It's a Sacrament of Union;</hi> take it for granted: <hi>It makes us all Members of that one Body of Christ, which is his visible Church;</hi> let it be supposed: But still I wait for proof of this, That <hi>by Baptism we are all really united to Christ.</hi> But here are some things very pretty: 1. <hi>Baptism is but one, and is a Sacrament of Union:</hi> Very good; and so is <hi>the Spirit but one,</hi> and therefore <hi>he is the Means of Union.</hi> 2. By <hi>Baptism we are made Members of the one Body of Christ;</hi> that is, of the Visible Church: but is there <hi>no means</hi> to make us Members of <hi>the Invisible Church?</hi> 3. <hi>This is called, being Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Christ.</hi> But is there no other way of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to Christ, but by Baptism. 4. <hi>We are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Christian Church by a publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith in Christ:</hi> Very true; we are solemnly admitted into a Visible Station in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, thereby alwayes supposing <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereby we forsake sin; and Faith, whereby we steadfastly believe the Promises of God made to us in that Sacrament,</hi> which has <hi>already united us to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lords Supper is a Sacrament of Union, and signifies that neer Conjunction between Christ and Christians:</hi> Signifies it? It presupposes an Union both with Christ, and a particular Church: All are supposed, in one sence or other, to be in
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:105027:202"/>
the Church, to be in Christ, that are admitted to it: Read over the Exhortation in the Liturgy at your best leisure. <hi>My duty is, to exhort you to consider the Dignity of this Mystery.—And so to search and examine your Consciences, that you should come holy and clean, to a most Holy Feast: for otherwise, receiving of the Holy Communion doth nothing else but encrease your Damnation.</hi> Again, in the other Exhortation: <hi>For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart, and lively Faith, we receive that holy Sacrament, (for Then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood, Then we dwell in Christ, and he in us,) so the danger is great,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore, if any of you be a Blasphemer of God,</hi> N. B. <hi>an hinderer, or a slanderer of his Word,</hi> N. B. <hi>an Adulterer, or be in Malice,</hi> N. B. <hi>or Envy, or any other grievous crime, bewail your sins, and come not to this holy Table, least the Devil enter into you, as he did into Iudas.</hi> But what can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? our Author supposes we are united to the Church, united to Christ by Baptism; and therefore surely this other Sacrament confirms our Union, and does not first Create it.</p>
               <p>I have long waited for an Argument to enforce his Conclusion, and now we shall have it: <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Lord and Saviour in what he did and suffer'd for us, was not to reform and save some single Persons, but to erect a Church, and to combine all his Disciples into a publick Society.</hi> A fairer Truth never dropt from his Pen, which some will like the better, because it is so handsom and proper a Confutation of the whole Section: For, if this be Christs design <hi>to combine all his Disciples into a publick Society,</hi> then sure they were his Disciples,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:105027:202"/>
related to him as their Lord and Master <hi>before such combination:</hi> Now to be a true Disciple of Christ, is no such slighty and trivial matter, that we may be such a one, and yet not united really to Christ: It implyes Self-denyal, taking up the Cross, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Christ; and that will go a great way to an Union with Christ; and yet of such as these it's granted, the Christian Society must be composed: But he copes up all this with a little Reason: <hi>And therefore our Saviour does not own any Relation to particular men, as such, but as they are Members of his Body.</hi> As such? Now for an Explication of the <hi>Quà: He owns no Relation to particular men as such;</hi> that is, <hi>as particular men:</hi> No, I am very well satisfied of that; for then he should own a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>to all particular men;</hi> for, <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet consequentia:</hi> But does he own a Relation to <hi>particular Believers,</hi> as <hi>Believers?</hi> will he own a Relation <hi>to a Disciple, as a Disciple?</hi> I am sure he has promis'd to own those, that own them <hi>as Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> and I am as sure, that if <hi>a particular Church</hi> be <hi>a combination of Disciples,</hi> he will own his Disciples wherever he finds them; so that I was just a concluding the clear contrary, if our Author had not given me timely Notice, That <hi>because Christ does combine all his Disciples into publick Societies,</hi> that therefore he does own, and is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to, united with, and will have a special care of, his Disciples, as they are such: and he has eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his owning of them, and care for them; that he unites them into such Societies, wherein they may mutually discharge all Christian Offices to each other; edifie one another in Love, and be meet helps to one anothers Salvation. That Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:105027:203"/>
owns a Relation to <hi>particular men,</hi> though not <hi>as men,</hi> but <hi>as holy men,</hi> is evident, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Both he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren:</hi> Nor was he ashamed to own <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>a chosen Vessel to himself,</hi> upon his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conversion,</hi> nor to bestow the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon him, and yet all this before Baptism, before his publick profession of the Christian Religion, and admission into the Visible Church.</p>
               <p>At length we are assaulted with a kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. <hi>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and truely our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> Here are so many sad misadventures in this one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that I know not where to begin; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun, it will be as difficult to know where to make an end of pointing at them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Gloss is very Notable: <hi>That which we have seen and heard:</hi> That is, (says he) <hi>The whole Doctrine, and History of the Gospel.</hi> And thus we have gained <hi>one signification more</hi> of Christ, that we never heard of before: Christ is now not onely <hi>a Doctrine, a Church, an Office,</hi> but <hi>a History</hi> too, and ere long he will cut him short by <hi>an Aphaeresis,</hi> and and make him <hi>a Story.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That his Gloss might pass without suspicion, he has concealed the Apostles words, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, and seen with our eyes, which we have looken upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life:</hi> This was certainly <hi>the same Person,</hi> of whom the same Apostle, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. affirms, That <hi>he was in the</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:105027:203"/>
                  <hi>beginning with God;</hi> whom being <hi>made flesh, he saw, and looked upon with his eyes; whom he touched with his hands:</hi> the <hi>same Person</hi> who lay in the Bosom of the Father, <hi>and manifested that Eternal Life that was in the Father:</hi> And yet as he has handled the Matter, it shall be <hi>the handling of a History,</hi> the <hi>handling of a Doctrine.</hi> Really the <hi>Socinians</hi> are well-bred Gentlemen to our Author: for though they contend hotly about <hi>the Beginning,</hi> in which Christ is said to be, yet they confess it was <hi>the Person of Christ who was in the beginning.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Author has quite lost his Question; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it gave him the slip, I cannot tell, but gone it is to <hi>Iamaica:</hi> For the Question was about <hi>the Means of our Union to Christ?</hi> and the Answer is, about <hi>the Means of our Fellowship with Christ:</hi> The Enquiry was, <hi>Which way we are related to Christ?</hi> and he answers very gravely, to <hi>the Way of our enjoying the Priviledges that flow from that Relation:</hi> Alas, if he had but once asked it, we would, for a word of his Mouth, have granted his Petition; That <hi>our Union with a particular Church, is a Means to let us into Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Iesus Christ;</hi> to admit us <hi>into many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priviledges, and happy advantages, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly otherwise be obtained;</hi> only we would say, there must be <hi>a previous Union,</hi> an <hi>antecedent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Christ,</hi> as the Foundation of our <hi>Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisement in that Church,</hi> whereby we are ensta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and installed in all those Priviledges.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Communion we enjoy with the Church, will not prove that we are united to Christ thereby, any more than it will prove, that a Servant becomes
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:105027:204"/>
related to his Master by Means of his Relation to his Fellow-servants, because they eat, and drink, and work together; which is no tremendous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Those words, <hi>That ye may have Fellowship with us,</hi> are very ill glossed: That is, <hi>become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Christ;</hi> for the Apostle writes unto them <hi>as Members of the Christian Church actually;</hi> otherwise the whole Epistle is unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible: <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>I write unto you little Children, because your sins are forgiven you for his Names sake: I write unto you Fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning: I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Those words, <hi>That ye may have fellowship with us,</hi> doe not denote, that <hi>the Fellowship of particular Believers</hi> must of necessity be <hi>with the Church immediately,</hi> and then <hi>with the Father and Christ,</hi> at the second hand; but that the Fellowship of the Apostle and all Believers, is joyntly and equally with the Father, and with Christ: His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was, that others might enjoy the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>both,</hi> that he enjoyed. And now the Reader will easily see the dreadfull Mischief of not stating the Question, and distinguishing its Terms at the first: It was obvious to every Man, (and I was aware of it) into what Confusions he would lead us, by the Ambiguity of <hi>Church, Union, Means, Communion;</hi> but I resolved he should run his Trundle, and when he had tyred himself in a Labyrinth of Errour, it would be a more seasonable time to talk with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:105027:204"/>His last Argument (which is therefore the best, because it is last) is taken from Excommunication.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>This</hi> (says he) <hi>is a plain Demonstration: That our Union to Christ, is not an Union to his Person, but consists in the Spiritual communion with the Christian Church: Otherwise this External com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, could be no visible signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Union to Christ; nor could our Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the visible Church, signifie our Separation from him.</hi> This is another plain Demonstration, if you will take his word for it. Two things call for our Consideration: 1. What he would prove. 2. How he proves it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) What he would prove: And I assure you, that is grown a great Secret of late: One while he would prove, That <hi>our Union with a particular Church, was</hi> the means <hi>of our Union to Christ;</hi> and within an hour after, he would prove: That <hi>our Union with Christ,</hi> consists <hi>in our union with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church:</hi> And now he will prove (or it shall cost him a fall) that our <hi>Union to Christ, is not an Union to his Person.</hi> And thus here's another Hare risen up before us, which whilst we pursue, it's ten to one we shall lose them all. If I might counsel our Author, before I would be Tormented with a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, Vagabond, Protean Question, that's never two Hours in one mind, nor ever tarries two Hours in one place, I would clap it in Irons, and Chain it to a Post. For if the Reader will give me Credit in so small a Matter, I verily thought for some while, that he had been Hammering out a Proof; That <hi>our Union to Christ, is by means of our union to the Church.</hi> At last, I perceived another Conclusion <hi>just Peep out of the shell;</hi> That <hi>our Union to Christ, consists in our union with the Church:</hi> And all along,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:105027:205"/>
I Dream't, that, <hi>that Christ</hi> about whom the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was; He that was the <hi>Shepheard,</hi> to whom the <hi>Sheep are United;</hi> the <hi>Husband,</hi> to whom the <hi>Spause is United;</hi> the <hi>King of the Church,</hi> to whom <hi>all Christians are United;</hi> had been <hi>a real, and very Person,</hi> and that it had been supposed that Christians are some way or other, United to him; Only all the Question was, Whether they were so United <hi>by Means</hi> of the Church, or no? For if we are <hi>not united</hi> to Christ <hi>at all,</hi> it s a needless En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>How, or by what means</hi> we are United to him? Or, <hi>wherein</hi> that Union consists? For this takes away the <hi>Subject of the Question:</hi> What is it then, wherein this Union with Christ consists? Why, <hi>It consists in a sincere and Spirituall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Christian Church.</hi> And now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion must be Trimed over again: <hi>Whether our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, consists in a sincere communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church?</hi> That is, <hi>this Face</hi> of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will do best in <hi>this place;</hi> for I always observe, our Author Writes just <hi>from Hand to Mouth;</hi> and if he can but make a <hi>Rubbing shift</hi> for the <hi>present Page,</hi> let <hi>the next</hi> take care for it self.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) And now let us hear his plain Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Otherwise</hi> (says he) <hi>this External commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, could be no visible signification of our Union to Christ.</hi> A notable Argument (no doubt) if any Living-body understood it. In the words fore-going, he tells us: He means <hi>by Union with Christ,</hi> a sincere and <hi>Spiritual communion with the Church:</hi> And then the old question would have stood thus: <hi>Whether our union with a particular Church, be the means of our sincere and spiritual communion with the Church:</hi> And if he had thus <hi>spoke out,</hi> I am assured he had met with no Opposition: But he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:105027:205"/>
another thing then, and entertain'd new Councels upon new Successes, and greater hopes from atchieved Victories. But still the Reader is Importunate for the Demonstration: Then take it, and make your best on't: <hi>External communion with the Church, is a visible signification of our Union to the Church;</hi> (that he means by Christ) and therefore <hi>our Union to Christ, consists in a sincere and Spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Christian Church.</hi> And if he had told us plainly, that there is no such thing as <hi>Union with Christ;</hi> but that the Phrase of <hi>Union with Christ</hi> is an empty Name, and has no more in it, than <hi>union with a Church;</hi> it had been easie to have understood the strength of his Will, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Reason, without half this Circumlocntion.</p>
               <p n="3">[3.] His next Observation is; <hi>That the Union between Christ, and the Christian Church, is not a Natural, but a Political Union: That is</hi> (says he) <hi>such an union as is between a Prince and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> It was but just now, that he told us, That <hi>our Union with Christ, is not an union with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> and yet now he will <hi>explain the Nature of this Union, between Christ and the Church.</hi> And indeed, he has so Bewildred himself, that it needs a great deal of Explication, and I doubt, all will be too little to deliver it from Non-sence: For his Explication must be this: <q>The Union between the Church and the Christian Church, is not a Natural, but a Political Union; such an union as is between a Prince and his Subjects.</q> Now this has two Faults in it: First, That if it <hi>were true,</hi> it would Over-turn his whole Design; which I can be very well content withall. And, Secondly, (which is the Misery on't) <hi>its False,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:105027:206"/>
will neither Overthrow, nor Support his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign: And therefore his Interest will lie in this one <hi>

                     </gap>hing,</hi> (if he could but see it) to Prove his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>be False,</hi> that there may be <hi>some hopes left</hi> of his conclusion.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As it stands, it apparently Overthrows his whole Design. For if this Politick Union be such a one as is between a Prince, and his Subjects: Then, 1. There is such a thing alive again in the World, as Union with, and Relation to Christs Person: For surely, Subjects are Related to, and united with the Person of their Prince. 2. Then <hi>this Union to Christ,</hi> denotes <hi>Primarily</hi> a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, and Union with the <hi>Person of Christ;</hi> and only <hi>Secondarily,</hi> an Union with, and Relation to his <hi>Laws and Commands,</hi> and the rest of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects. For I think, the Reason why Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects give Obedience to any Laws, is, because they are the Laws of him who is the Legislator: The Reason why the Sheep are subject to Pastoral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is, because they are the Orders, and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him who is their Shepheard, and has a right to Enjoyn them: And the Reason why the Wife subjects her self to the Commands of her Husband, is, because she is united to him, upon those Terms in the Marriage-covenant. All Duty is founded in Relation; It's impossible to conceive Conjugal Duty, without a Preconception of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Relation: If therefore such be our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Christ; such our union to Him; as of Sheep to Shepheard, Wife to Husband, Subjects to a Prince; then are we first Related to his Person, and as far as such Relation will Unite, united to his Person; and then his Negative is blown up:
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:105027:206"/>
That <hi>our Union to Christ is not an union to his Person, but consists in our communion with his Church.</hi> Which is, as if he should say, Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our Prince, is no Relation to his Person; but consists in our Union to the Common-wealth; which is a neat Engine to hook in Democracy.</p>
               <p n="2">But (2) It s False, which is the worst on't; <hi>our uuion to Christ</hi> is not fully explain'd by a <hi>Political union.</hi> It's true, <hi>It is not a Natural union;</hi> but yet it's well <hi>Explain'd by,</hi> and bears a full Analogy with <hi>a Natural union:</hi> The Relation is not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but Spiritual; and yet it has pleased the Holy Ghost to express the <hi>Spiritual Relation, by the Natural.</hi> The Relation between a Prince and his Subjects, expresses something of that Relation that is between Christ and Believers, but not the whole: All the Similitudes used in Scripture, to Illustrate the Relation between Christ and Christians, have <hi>something in common</hi> with each other. All imply <hi>absolute Soveraignty, and Authority,</hi> contempered with <hi>tenderness of Affection</hi> on Christs part; and all imply an <hi>absolute Subjection</hi> to be given to Him, with <hi>delight and complacency</hi> on our parts; yet some of them express a <hi>nearer union,</hi> and more <hi>endeared Affections</hi> than others: That of a Master, Lord, and King, express Authority, and Power, yet not that <hi>Intimacy,</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> which is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by that of <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Wife:</hi> That of a King, implies Christ to be <hi>a Head of Government;</hi> but that of the <hi>Head in the Natural Body,</hi> implies the Communications of Grace, of Strength, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and Power to Obey; and withal, that there's such an Intimate union between Christ and true Believers, that the Members in the Natural are
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:105027:207"/>
not more (though in another way) united to the Head, and one to another, than Christ and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are in this, which may be called <hi>a Mystical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for Christ and Believers are hereupon called, <hi>One Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 12. <hi>As the Body is one, and hath many Members, even so is Christ:</hi> That is, so is the Lord Christ and his Church. When therefore (he says) <q>That Christ is called a Head, and the Church his Body; a Husband, and the Church his Spouse; which two Metaphors signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same thing, and are both of them Names of Power and Authority:</q> It is <hi>something</hi> of the Truth, but not the <hi>whole Truth,</hi> nor <hi>nothing else</hi> but the Truth. <hi>Something of truth</hi> there is in it: <hi>Christs Headship,</hi> denotes <hi>Authority:</hi> But then it's not the <hi>entire Truth:</hi> Christs Headship denotes <hi>more than bare Authority:</hi> And then there's something more than the Truth: Those two Metaphors <hi>do not</hi> denote the <hi>same thing:</hi> That of the Husband over the Wife, denotes Power mixed, and sweetly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Love, and Pity: But that of the <hi>Head over the Members,</hi> denotes a continual Influx of all saving Grace into his Members. I wish therefore, he would leave Trifling with his Hackney Fallacy; <hi>That because Christ is a Head of Authority, He is not an Head of Influence:</hi> For he that can assert, that the <hi>Union and Relation between Christ and Christians, has no Spiritual correspondency with a Natural Union;</hi> (which yet is Explicated by it) may when he sees his own time, deny, That the Union between Christ and Christians, has any Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>with <hi>a Political union,</hi> though he has (<hi>Pro hâc vice</hi>) Explicated the Union by it.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more, wherein our Author
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:105027:207"/>
shows himself a great Divine, and a mighty States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for the <hi>very sound of Political Union,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Inspire a Man that is prepared for such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses. <q>Our Union to Christ (<hi>says he</hi>) consists in our Belief of his Revelations, Obedience to his Laws, and Subjection to his Authority: As Obedience to our Prince, is the strongest Bond of a Political Union, which is Dissolved and Broken by Rebellion and Disobedience.</q> But this is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>truly Asserted,</hi> nor <hi>wisely Explained.</hi> 1. Not truly asserted: For our <hi>Union to Christ,</hi> does not consist in <hi>that Obedience,</hi> which we give him <hi>as our Lord, our Shepheard, our Husband;</hi> but in that <hi>Act of Obedience</hi> whereby <hi>at first</hi> we <hi>take him for our Lord, Shepheard, and Husband;</hi> and <hi>give up our selves</hi> sincerely to him again, to be <hi>his Sheep, Subjects, Spouse.</hi> 2. Nor wisely Explicated: For if Relation to a Prince, does formally consist in Obedience, and <hi>that Union</hi> be <hi>dissolved</hi> by Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; then whenever a Rebel shakes hands with <hi>Actual subjection,</hi> he <hi>absolves</hi> himself from <hi>the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Obey,</hi> which would save the horrible Charges of the <hi>Popes</hi> Bull. Our Author has acquainted the World with a very fine way, how to live a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Twenty years, and yet never commit but one single sin at first, but all the <hi>after</hi> acts will be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: For if Rebellion <hi>dissolve,</hi> and break in pieces <hi>the Union</hi> between Prince and Subject, then he ceases any longer to be a Subject; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whatever sins he commits, must be called by other <hi>Names,</hi> for it can be <hi>no Rebellion:</hi> When the Relation ceases, Duty ceases; Obedience is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving cause of Union,</hi> but the Union lies not in it: He that does not perform his Duty, yet is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:105027:208"/>
an Obligation to perform his Duty; the Union continues, though many acts unsuitable to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are committed. But should we be so charitable as to grant him all this, he will be weary on't in a while; as little Children, that make a heavy and piteous moan for a Gewgaw, and when they have it, throw it away.</p>
               <p>Thus after all his <hi>Rodomontade,</hi> That this Union is a <hi>Political union,</hi> such as is <hi>between Prince, and Subjects;</hi> as if his Book could never have been Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, if he had talk'd of any thing below Crowns and Diadems, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: Yet <hi>pag.</hi> 162. he tells us, That <hi>God has laid aside, in a great Measure, that severe Name of a King, and calls himself our Father, to signifie that Liberty we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy under the Gospel, in Opposition to the Bondage, and Servitude of the Law of Moses.</hi> Well, whatever opinion he has <hi>of Monarchy, the severity of it's Name, the Bondage and Servitude that it brings Men under;</hi> I know many, who if they might choose, had rather come under that <hi>severe Name of King,</hi> as to their Religious concerns, than feel the more smooth, and Debonair Treatment, of some <hi>Spiritual Fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's very Tiresome to Travel out of the way, for the further we go on, the further we have to come back; and yet thus has our Author seduced his Reader, but now we shall come to a vein of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for having reduced all the benefit Believers have from Christ as their Head, to <hi>Political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> there is but <hi>one thing more,</hi> which if he can cleverly compass, the day is his own; and this is to strip Christ of that <hi>little Power and Authority</hi> he had left him: To this end we must observe further:
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:105027:208"/>
                  <q>That though Christ be our Lord and Governour, he does not Govern us immediately by Himself, for he is Ascended into Heaven, where he power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Intercedes for his Church, and by a Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Providence, superintends the affairs of it; but he has left the Visible and External conduct and Government of it, to Bishops and Pastors, who preside in his Name,</q> and by his Authority. To which I answer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Christs committing <hi>the External conduct</hi> of his Churches to his own Officers, may very well consist with his own <hi>Internal and Invisible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of his Peoples Souls, and their Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever Authority Christ has <hi>vested his Officers</hi> with, he has <hi>Devested himself</hi> of none, he continues sole Head of the Church still; <hi>All Power is committed to him in Heaven, and in Earth:</hi> And though there are some that would ease him of the <hi>Trouble,</hi> yet I have not heard that he has laid down <hi>his Commission,</hi> nor taken any into <hi>joynt Commission</hi> with himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Christ has given <hi>an Authority</hi> in the Churches to all <hi>his own</hi> Officers, but he has not given to any of them <hi>his Authority:</hi> And indeed, unless he could Communicate <hi>to them his Power,</hi> as well as <hi>his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> it would signifie little. But, I hope, they know their places better than so; they are Servants of Jesus Christ, tied up to their Instructions, as all Ambassadors are, though they come <hi>in the Name</hi> of their Prince; and their Commission runs, to <hi>teach us to Observe whatsoever Christ has Commanded in the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>External Conduct</hi> of the Church,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:105027:209"/>
Christ has left it as much to Princes, as to Bishops, and more; for several Reasons that I know of, but one is this: That every <hi>Supreme Magistrate is next and immediately under Christ, Supreme Head and Governour of the Church, within his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Well, but what Reason does he favour us with? Why Christ doth not immediately Govern us <hi>Himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He is ascended into Heaven:</hi> Well: Yet he knows how to be present with all and every one of his, to the end of the World: And, <hi>Where two or three meet together in his Name, he will be in the midst of them:</hi> He has sent <hi>Vicariam vim Spiritus sancti,</hi> who does Manage for him <hi>a Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in the Souls of all <hi>the Elect:</hi> And since I have named two such dangerous words, as <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> I had best bethink my self of good Security; and that I have from the Church Catechism. Quest. <hi>What dost thou learn chiefly in these Articles of thy Belief? Answ.</hi>—<q>I learn to believe in God the Holy Ghost, who San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth me,</q> and all the Elect People of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He powerfully Intercedes for his Church.</hi> Why sure <hi>Intercession</hi> with the Father, is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with <hi>immediate Rule and Government</hi> over his Saints. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By his vigilant Providence, he Superintends all the Affairs of it:</hi> Why then he Governs it: Nay, Soft a-while: He will allow Christ a <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Superintendency,</hi> but no proper <hi>Episcopal Iurisdiction:</hi> That is, he may be <hi>a Spectator,</hi> or a By-stander, and look on to see how Squares go, but must not meddle with the Immediate Government of us; for he has put that out of his Hands, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105027:209"/>
                  <hi>left it to the Bishops and Pastors:</hi> Which I confess, is the worst News that I have heard this Seven years. But now for the Conclusion: <hi>This is</hi> (says he) <hi>a plain Demonstration, That the Union of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Christians to Christ, is by union with the Christian Church.</hi> Shortly, If our Author does but give <hi>a grave Nod,</hi> it will amount to <hi>a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;</hi> but if he should please to give <hi>a Lusty Hum,</hi> it will be <hi>a plain Demonstration:</hi> Though others are so perverse, they will not own it for <hi>a probable Conjecture;</hi> for the Spiritual subjection of the Soul and Conscience, is immediately to Christ: As the Emperour once said, <hi>Non tibi sed Petro;</hi> so may every Christian, <hi>Non tibi sed Christo.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Command the Officers of Christ bring us in his Name, their Commission is Patent, and we must search the Scriptures to see whether it be so or no; if it carrys the Signature of Christs Authority, we Obey him in hearing them; and if they have, or pretend to have any private Instructions, or <hi>Cabala,</hi> we may fairly demur to them, or bring a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> against them.</p>
               <p>And now at last, he will leave his Imperious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, and come to Disputation: <q>If our Union to Christ, consist in our Subjection to him as our Lord and Master, Head and Husband, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that we cannot be United to Christ, (<hi>that is, cannot own his Authority</hi>) till we Unite our selves to the publick Societies of Christians.</q> But the former is true. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> To the Consequence of the former Proposition, all I say, is, It's Feeble and very Sick. Our union to Christ may consist in our subjection to him as King, Lord, and Husband, and yet we may be united to him thus, before our
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:105027:210"/>
Actual union to a particular Society. Well, he will prove it thus: <hi>This Authority of Christ is not Exercised immediately by Himself, but by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Pastours of the Church.</hi> To which I return:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If he means that only <hi>Christ exercises not a Visible Authority by himself,</hi> but by the Guides and Pastors of the Church, it may be true; but then it will prove no more than this. That we <hi>are visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christs Name, by our Uniting to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church,</hi> under the Guides and Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is not the thing in Question.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he means that <hi>Christ exercises not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Authority over the Soul, immediately by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> I must return to my former Answer, which is a peremptory denial.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether this Authority be exercised <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> by Christ, or not? Our <hi>Union with Christ</hi> may be <hi>immediate:</hi> For our acceptation of Christ as Lord, King, and Husband, is <hi>the Bond of our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and the Exercise of all Authority of a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in those Relations, must still of necessity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose the Union, and Relation. But as to our Antecedent: <hi>That our Union to Christ, consists in our Subjection to him as our Lord, Head, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:</hi> Which is very true, of that <hi>Act of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> whereby at first we accept of him to be all these to us, and give up our selves to be all the other to him; but very false of those <hi>subsequent Acts of Obedience</hi> which <hi>flow from,</hi> but do not <hi>Constitute</hi> the Relation: And therefore it was prudently done, to Explain <hi>Union to Christ,</hi> by <hi>owning his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> For however it be false, yet every one will not spie that, who Rides on a Trotting Horse; and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:105027:210"/>
it will serve to make a Semblance of saying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It's true, we <hi>cannot own Christs Authority,</hi> if we <hi>Derogate from his Commands;</hi> but yet our union with Christ, and our relation to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must precede our owning his Authority over us. And for this, our Author has fitted us with a Similitude, which may befriend Us as well as it's owner. <hi>As no man can be said to submit himself to his Prince, who denies Subjection to Subordinate Magistrates, who Act by his Commission: For the union of Bodies Politick, consists in Order and Government, when all the Members keep their proper places, and are knit together by a faithful Discharge of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> I could not hope for more Weakness in an Adversary, than I shall be sure to find in this Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>None can be said to submit to his Prince, who denies Subjection to Subordinate Magistrates:</hi> And thus none can be said to submit himself to Christ, who denies Obedience to his Officers, who act in his Name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As Submission to Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, is not that wherein <hi>our Relation to our Prince con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ists,</hi> but an <hi>effect of it;</hi> so <hi>a due subjection</hi> to our spiritual Guides, is not that <hi>wherein our Union to Christ consists,</hi> but a Consequent of it: We first owe a subjection to Christ, and from thence to them who Command us in his Name. Thus the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>They first gave themselves to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to us,</hi> by <hi>the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>No man can be said to Submit, who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</hi> (A weighty truth:) But he may be said to <hi>owe submission,</hi> though he rebells: His Prince has
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:105027:211"/>
not lost <hi>his right</hi> to Command, though he (like a Villain) want<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Grace to Obey.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It's very Childish, and spoken like a Green headed Statesman, <hi>That the union of Bodies Politick, consists in Order and Government.</hi> For, <hi>Order and Government,</hi> are for <hi>the preservation of the Union,</hi> and not <hi>the first union</hi> of these Bodies Politick. The union of Prince and People, consists in their first relation to one another as such; and <hi>the exercise of Government,</hi> is to secure that union, and the advantages of it: If union consists in Order and Government, then Disorder and ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would dissolve the union, and relation, and by consequence discharge all Subjects from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their Duty; which is very dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and a wide Gap to all Rebellion: What a pitiful plight were Princes in, if the Foundations of Government, the Essential reasons of the Peoples subjection, were to be Discanted upon by every Churchman. The <hi>Childs relation</hi> to his Father, does not consist in his <hi>filial Obedience,</hi> but is <hi>the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of it: The <hi>Subjects relation</hi> to his Prince, does not consist <hi>in Subjection,</hi> but is <hi>the true Ground of it:</hi> The Wife, <hi>her relation</hi> to her Husband, does not consist in <hi>her submission</hi> to her Husband, but is <hi>the Spring</hi> of it: A disobedient Child is a Child still, he cannot shake off the relation; a rebellious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though he deserves not the honourable Title of a Subject, yet he is a Subject, and cannot put off that relation: An untoward Wife, is a Wife still; and every act, nay, many acts of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot dissolve the Copula: For otherwise, the way to be rid of a relation, would be to Violate
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:105027:211"/>
the Duties of it; and then all future Disobedience would be no sin: Because, when the union is once Null, and the relation dissolved, there's no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which the Superiour can build a claim to Duty; and this would be a short Cut, and save abundance of time and Charges, in sueing out a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce: For, let but the Wife disobey, and the union which consists in Obedience, Vanishes.</p>
               <p>A little Divertisment will now be seasonable, both for our Author and his Readers; and therefore he will give us <hi>a plain Account of the only cause that can justifie Separation.</hi> In the mean time it seems, <hi>there is a Cause,</hi> though <hi>but one only Cause</hi> that will justifie it; and separation will not always argue S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hism: And now all you that would know the one, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one Cause in all the World, that can justifie a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a true Church, draw near and give your attention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When any Church prevaricates in the Laws of Christ.</hi> Prevaricates? How many thousands of Schismaticks will shrowd themselves under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of <hi>that one Word?</hi> He has opened a Gate, at which three Coachful of Separatists, may Drive all-a-Brest. If then a Church shall pretend to give us the Laws of Christ in <hi>Scriptis,</hi> (such was the Knavery of a Cardinal in the Consistory, before the Conventicle of <hi>Trent</hi>) and yet by Preaching and Practice, destroy those very Laws, or the Ends of them; if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall talk Big words of <hi>Holy Mother Church,</hi> and yet embrace in her arms as her Children, the vilest Varlets, and shut out none but the Good, unless now and then an old Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or some such like Vermine, that want Money

to Buy off, or Commute for Penance; this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Prevarication, and if it shall certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, will justifie a separation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When it corrupts Religion:</hi> And this will go a great way (I promise you) in some particular Churches. Corruption may be by Addition, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, Multiplication, or Division: The end of the Keys may be perverted, those shut out whom Christ would receive: and they admitted whom Christ would exclude: It may strike with the back of the spiritual Sword when it should use the edge, and wound with the edge when it should sleep in the Scabbard; Christs Religion may be corrupted by mingling our own inventions, with this pure and plain institutions: and then we have a cause, or a piece of a cause that paves our way for separation, as broad as that by which Israel departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> five in a rank.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When it undermines the fundamental design of Religion which is to make men good, and vertuoùs.</hi> So that though they do not openly assault it by batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and escalado, yet if they shall secretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Godliness, by denying the office of the holy spirit in Creating men to good, and vertuous works, and teach men to trust to their own natural strength, and shall craftily oppose the Doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Church of <hi>England: That the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man after the fall is such, that he cannot turn by his own natural strength, without the Grace of God preventing him, that he may have a good will:</hi> or if they shall disown the satisfaction of Christs death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cross to Gods holiness, and his justice found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon, which is the bottom of our return to God
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:105027:212"/>
and of our holy walking with him, why then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well! as far as the shooes of the Gospel will carry you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When we cannot obey our spiritual rulers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disobeying the Laws of Christ:</hi> when Christs commands, and they forbid; when he forbids, and they command; then we have our pasport to be gone, and travel to the utmost ends of the Earth: These are those four things, all in one that will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a separation from a particular society, and if our Authour would preach this Doctrine to his Parisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he might leave it to them to make the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But now on the otherside, <hi>if the Church we live in acknowledges the Authority, and submits to the Laws of Christ, we are bound to live in Communion with it.</hi> Very true, but not true for our Authors Reason, <hi>because this Unites us to Christ,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but go on! <hi>when nothing is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Communion, which is expressely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Laws of the supreme Lord, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Authority in our subjection to our spiritual guides.</hi> Now here are many things might be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let it be considered whether <hi>an implicite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> from the supreme Lord be not sufficient to make <hi>a condition of Communion</hi> unlawful? and I cannot but wonder that our Authour in this case is all for <hi>an expresse prohibition,</hi> when perhaps that may signifie <hi>a Command</hi> if he follows but his own rule, <hi>not to interpret phrases by the sound of words.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. In submitting to such conditions of Communion as <hi>are not expressely forbidden,</hi> the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:105027:213"/>
herein we submit to Christs authority? and this I confesse I stick at: And the Reason of my doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hesitation is this. Because it supposes <hi>an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Christs Authority,</hi> where he has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed his Authority: supposes him to speak, where he is silent, and to Command obedience where he commands nothing; nay where he has <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> though <hi>not expressely forbidden</hi> that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Now as I am not bound to obey <hi>an inferiour Magistrate,</hi> unlesse his particular command be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted <hi>by his Commission,</hi> though it be <hi>not forbidden</hi> in his Commission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so it seems I am not bound to Obey <hi>a particular Church,</hi> in a particular imposed condition, if not authorised by Christs instructions, though it be <hi>not forbidden</hi> there, at least no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of obedience can be interpreted <hi>to be a disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christs Authority,</hi> because he is supposed <hi>to have determined neither Pro nor Con.</hi> If we turn back to p. 164. Our Authour has these words: <hi>No man can be said to submit himself to his prince, who denies subjection to those subordinate Magistrates who act by his Commission:</hi> so no man can be said to resist his Prince who gives subjection to all inferiour officers in all things wherein they act by his Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion; for he may passe for a very tolerable good Subject who does all things that are commanded him, so in this case; no man can be said to Obey Christ who denies subjection to the Pastors of the Church who act according to their instructions from the supreme Lord of the Church: nor any be said to resist Christs authority, though they refuse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance in those things to the Officers of the Church, wherein they act besides their Commission. But let
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:105027:213"/>
us a while wholly set aside the consideration of the lawfulness or unlawfullness of these new conditions of Communion: yet still me thinks there's a great deal of <hi>disingenuity</hi> in the Pastors of a Church, to make <hi>new Terms of Communion</hi> with them, for if it be <hi>so necessary</hi> as is pretended, to <hi>our Union with Christ,</hi> that we be <hi>United to the Church:</hi> and then again <hi>so necessary to our Salvation</hi> to be <hi>United to Christ:</hi> and then further <hi>so necessary</hi> to our <hi>Union with the Church,</hi> to submit <hi>to those conditions</hi> that the Pastors shall appoint, every new condition is a Bar to, and a Clog upon our Salvation. We must come up <hi>to the condition</hi> e're we can be <hi>United to the Church,</hi> and we must be <hi>United to the Church,</hi> e're we can be <hi>United to Christ,</hi> and we must be <hi>United to Christ,</hi> e're we can <hi>be saved:</hi> That condition therefore how <hi>small soever</hi> it be <hi>in it self,</hi> how <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> soever in its <hi>own Nature</hi> is thereby made <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation,</hi> because indispensably required to <hi>that which is so:</hi> Now I will not clamour, and make a noise at this as an evil thing, but yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it does not look as if it had <hi>over much good Nature</hi> in't, for a Church to deal thus with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Church received a Religion from Christ at first, that had <hi>no incumbrance</hi> upon it, and that the Church should leave it <hi>deeplyer engaged</hi> than she found it, I think is not very handsome: if the Church found the door <hi>wide open;</hi> why does shee set it on <hi>half-charrs:</hi> when she could march in with <hi>a full body,</hi> why should others be forced to crowd in and wedge themselves through a narrow wicket sidelings? why should the Pastors bind heavy burdens on others fhoulders, when Christ laid none upon theirs? or
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:105027:214"/>
why should they raise the Markets so high in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age, when they had it so cheap in the primitive times? It was a good plain saying of King <hi>Iames</hi> to the pragmatical <hi>Spalatensis,</hi> when he would be new modelling affairs at <hi>Winsor. Extraneus es! Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que res sicut eas invenisti.</hi> Come Reader, there's no false Latine in't, had former Ages heard and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the advice, we could have been content with the <hi>Primitive light,</hi> though we had wanted <hi>sumptuous Candlesticks;</hi> the <hi>power of Religion,</hi> had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for <hi>its plainnesse;</hi> and <hi>golden Officers,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed <hi>woodden chalices:</hi> Thus far at our Authors invitation we have step't out of the way, and are now ready to return with him into it.</p>
               <p>The next thing considerable wherein he ingages, is a description of the <hi>New nature,</hi> whereof the Holy Ghost makes frequent mention, as that from which all <hi>new Obedience</hi> must proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This New Nature,</hi> (says he) <hi>the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents under several Notions.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>By the subjection of our minds and Spirits to Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>By a participation of the same Nature, which is the necessary effect of the subjection of our minds to him.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>If a man would study to be cross all his days, and resolve to trade in no figure but <hi>Hysteron Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> he might hardly hope to equalize our Author in this discourse. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What <hi>subjection of mind, and Spirit, can be given to Christ,</hi> without a <hi>new</hi> Nature, from whence that <hi>Act of subjection</hi> should proceed? the most <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Obedience are yet <hi>but Acts:</hi> the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:105027:214"/>
most <hi>spiritual and refined workings</hi> of the soul are still <hi>but works,</hi> and have alwayes for their root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, a good and an honest; a new, and a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart and Nature. Thus we see 'tis in Nature: there must be <hi>a principle</hi> of motion, before there can be <hi>natural motion,</hi> all the rest is <hi>violent,</hi> and against the hair. And this order our Saviour has described in the most plain, and familiar way to gratifie our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings that they could desire. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 33. <hi>Either make the tree good and the fruit good; or the evil and the fruit evil,</hi> and Math. 7. 17. 18. <hi>Do men gather Grapes of thornes, or Figs of Thistles. Even so every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, and a corrupt Tree brings forth evil fruit:</hi> But our Authour has found out a way called Transmutation of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: to make <hi>a Thorn</hi> become <hi>a Vine,</hi> and to Transubstantiate <hi>a Thistle</hi> into <hi>a Figtree:</hi> I know the Reader has a grudging of the old curiosity to see the experiment: The operation therefore is this, teach a Thistle to produce Figs for one seven years, and you shall see it become as very a Fig-tree as any is in the world, thus let the natural and unregenerate man perform multiplyed Acts of the best obedience he can, and without any efficacious working of the Holy Ghost he shal acquire a new heart, which I shall believe at the same time, when I see a thousand Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers give themselves the significancy of one figure. Our Blessed Saviour has long ago determined this to our hand. John 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</hi> Let the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pollinctors practise upon it, let them sweeten perfume, and season it with the spicery of <hi>India,</hi> and all the balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> it will be but flesh still, all its operations carnal.</p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:105027:215"/>
               <p n="2">2. It will be of good use in this matter to enquire, wherein lay the Image of God in <hi>Adam,</hi> what relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it had to his obedience, and thence perhaps we may get some light what order the Image of God in us observes: That it mainly consists in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true holinesse, no man can doubt that reads the Apostles description, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. but now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Adam</hi> did not procure <hi>this Image</hi> of God, by <hi>repeated Acts of obedience,</hi> it was not the result of many <hi>particular duties,</hi> it was no acquired habit, but it was concreated with him, as a condition due and meet for a Creature made to such sublime, and glorious ends as the enjoyment of his God, and from this Nature, this Image of God, proceeded all that Obedience which he payed, all that which God required, and accepted. And if this be so, it's evident that all who are renewed, who are born again, who are Created unto good works go through the same method. So the Apostle Col. 3. 10. <hi>And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him, that Created him:</hi> The order of Gods working is conformable to his promise, we may be sure he will do both what, and how he has promised, Ezek. 36. 26. <hi>A new heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your Flesh, and give you an heart of Flesh; and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them:</hi> where the order and method of God in this great work is laid down, with such a convincing evidence that he must have no eyes or shut those he has who does not see it. And,</p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:105027:215"/>
               <p n="1">1. God promises that he will <hi>remove the great principle of resistance,</hi> that which makes head, and opposition to the Commands of God: <hi>the stony, hard, inflexible-Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2, That he will <hi>bestow another, a better, a new heart, a soft Spirit, a heart of Flesh:</hi> that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and close in with Gods Commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That from <hi>this new heart,</hi> all <hi>new obedience,</hi> all service acceptable to God must proceed as from its spring or root. <hi>I will put my Spirit into you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That all obedience, <hi>inward and outward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> keeping the Commandements of God with the heart, and doing them in the practice of our lives, yet all must proceed <hi>from this new heart,</hi> this new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which God promised, to put within them.</p>
               <p>But he comes to close Argument, we are exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that the same mind be in us that was in Christ,</hi> Phil. 2. 5. <hi>And to be his disciples is to learn of him, who was meek, and lowly in spirit,</hi> Math. 11. 29. We question not that, its our duty <hi>to imitate Christ;</hi> to copy out all his imitable excellencies, and if he can prove that we can do this, <hi>viz. imitate Christ</hi> in Acts of self denyal, taking up the Crosse, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach, forgiving enemies, without a better heart, and Nature, than we brought into the world with us, he will then begin to speak to the purpose: <hi>But</hi> (says our Authour) <hi>Christ transcribed his own nature into his Laws, and therefore a sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Laws is a conformity to his Nature,</hi> To which I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that <hi>transcribed his Nature</hi> into his own
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:105027:216"/>
Laws, must yet <hi>transcribe it once more,</hi> even into <hi>the heart of a son of</hi> Adam, e're he can give to him <hi>that new Obedience</hi> which is acceptable to him: It was not enough that God wrote his Lawes in Stone, unless they be written upon the Tables of the heart with the finger of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obedience to the Laws of Christ does <hi>increase our conformity</hi> to the Nature of Christ, but still there must be a renewed heart and Nature, upon which all progressive conformity to Christ in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Transcribing of Christs Nature into his Lawes is a Metaphorical expression, which our Authour may explain how he pleases, but I observe alwayes, when he can cloath an Argument with Metaphors, he is then secure: yet still he presses upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us from, Rom. 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his.</hi> That is (says he) <hi>Unlesse he have the same Temper, and disposition of mind that Christ had:</hi> Now let the Reader look well about him, and he shall see rare sights: we do all remember that to be <hi>United to Christ,</hi> or to be <hi>one of Christs,</hi> signifie to be <hi>United to a particular Church:</hi> And now we are told: That by <hi>having the Spirit</hi> of Christ, is meant <hi>being of the same temper and disposition:</hi> and now from hence we have these consecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if any man be not of <hi>the same Temper with Christ,</hi> that is be not holy, as he is holy: he cannot be United to a particular Church: And our Saviour has vouched for it, John 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be regenerate and born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> We must be <hi>like minded</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:105027:216"/>
                  <hi>with Christ,</hi> and thereby become <hi>one of his:</hi> and what is now become of the great Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has filled so many pages. That <hi>the only means of Uniting as to Christ is by our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with a particular Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He tells us that <hi>Union to Christ is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by having the Spirit:</hi> and then having the Spirit is interpreted by <hi>being of the same Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with Christ:</hi> so now we have got another Doctrine: <hi>That our Union to Christ consists in being of the same Temper, and disposition with him.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have here an excellent expedient to discharge the World both of the Person of Christ, and of the Spirit too: For as he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Christs <hi>Person into Doctrine,</hi> office Church, Religion, Bishops, Baptism; so he has interpreted the Spirit into Temper, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and when an exigency calls for it, he may explicate it by <hi>a strong wind,</hi> or <hi>a vapour,</hi> and then his work is done. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the explicating of the new Nature, he tells us <hi>there is a closer Union which results from this, which consists in a mutual, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal love,</hi> which I am glad of, amongst other Reasons for this; that now it will be lawfull <hi>to Love Christ,</hi> without persecution, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided alwayes we do not <hi>over love him,</hi> nor be <hi>passionately</hi> in love with him: but yet there are a few inconveniences which attend this explication. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we be <hi>United, and closely United to Christ by Love,</hi> then <hi>a Political Union,</hi> is not the onely one betwixt Christ and Christians. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:105027:217"/>2. Then it seems (for all the sorrow) a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be United to Christ without being U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to a particular Church: for we therefore love Christians because we love Christ, and are taken with the imperfect holiness which is copied out into their Natures, and lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are surprized first with a delightful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Him who is the grand exemplar of all perfect Holinesse, 1 John 5. 1. <hi>He that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him.</hi> 3. Why may not this <hi>Union with Christ</hi> signifie an <hi>Union with the Church</hi> as well as the other? and then <hi>to love Christ</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more than <hi>to love his Church,</hi> and so we are but where we were.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its very strange, that <hi>our Love</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from <hi>our obedience,</hi> and <hi>subjection,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as its hard to conceive how the soul should give subjection without Love, and if it should give any, a forced subjection without its principle of Love, would find as <hi>cold</hi> a <hi>well-come</hi> in Christs heart, as <hi>that cold heart</hi> it came from: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had described obedience as the result of love. John 14. 15. <hi>If ye Love me keep my Commandements.</hi> No (says our Authour) keep my Commandements, and then you will fall in Love with me: but let him give light to his own Notions: <hi>when we are transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image of Christ, he loves Us as being like him; and we love him too, as partaking of his Nature. He loves us, as the price of his blood, as his own workmanship created to good works, and we love him, as our Saviour, and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:105027:217"/>
                  <hi>now love is the great Cement of Union which unites interest, and thereby does more firmly unite hearts.</hi> It is not then quite so bad as was pretended, to Love the Lord Jesus Christ, provided we have but our Authours license to love him: but now the Question will be this: <hi>whether our Union to Christ consists in a mutual and reciprocal love?</hi> And if our Authour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been judge a little while since, he would have resolved it in the Negative, That <hi>our Union to Christ consists in our Union to a particular Church:</hi> and that it is <hi>a political union,</hi> such a one as is between Prince, and Subject, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a belief of his revelations, obedience to his Laws, and subjection to his Authority.</hi> I shall only note a few things, and dismisse it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is <hi>a love of Benevolence and good Will,</hi> a designing, purposing love in Christ towards us, before we bear his Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription: this love he bears towards those that are unlike him, Rom. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. God <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love to us, that when we were yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Christ dyed for us:</hi> verse 10. <hi>When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There must of necessity be the interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Union, <hi>a likenesse, a Conformity of Natures,</hi> before there can be supposed <hi>a love of mutual complacency,</hi> and <hi>reciprocal delight</hi> in each other, for this love, this delight, must have something to work upon. As there must be a <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> before the Husband can
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:105027:218"/>
                  <hi>take delight</hi> in his Wife, <hi>as his Wife;</hi> and the Wife in her Husband <hi>as her Husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>love of good will</hi> in Christ, is the <hi>Original Reason</hi> of our transformation into <hi>the Image of Christ;</hi> whereby we become meet objects for <hi>that other love of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Its true that <hi>we love him,</hi> as partaking of <hi>his Nature;</hi> but then its also <hi>as true</hi> that those Acts of love to, and delight in Christ, proceed from that <hi>New Nature</hi> which we derive from him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Love wherewith Christ Loves us, <hi>as the price of his blood,</hi> is a differing love from that wherewith he loves us <hi>as his workmanship</hi> created in Christ Jesus to good works.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I rejoyce however that we are owned to be <hi>Christs workmanship Created to good works:</hi> which it were not so, we had more reason <hi>to love our selves,</hi> to admire and deifie our own natural Abilities, which effected that <hi>glorious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi> And I see of late our Authour, <hi>takes to the Church Catechism;</hi> which had he attended to in time, had saved him half the Labour of his Book:- <hi>My good Child! know that thou art not able to do these things of thy self (to love God, to believe in him, to fear him, with all thy heart with all thy mind, withal thy strength, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him to give him thankes to put thy whole Trust in him,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>nor to walk in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and serve him without his special Grace, which thou must learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer.</hi>

               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:105027:218"/>
               <p n="7">7. The more we <hi>exercise our selves</hi> in the Love of Christ, the more <hi>like him we grow;</hi> and the <hi>stronger bonds</hi> are layd upon our Souls, to maintain the Union inviolable; but still there must precede <hi>an Union,</hi> which is the true Foundation of the Exercise of this Love of Delight and mutual Complacency. Ay but (says he) <hi>Love is the great Cement of Union, which unites Interests, and thereby more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unites hearts.</hi> Let him call it <hi>the Cement,</hi> or the <hi>Soder,</hi> or <hi>the Glew,</hi> it's all one to me; I conceive that <hi>Interest is the Cement of Love,</hi> and not <hi>Love the Cement of Interest:</hi> Men love because it's <hi>their Interest</hi> so to doe; but whether that Love that flutters up and down the world, a thing so unstable and desultory that we cannot tell where to have it, be a fit Pattern for the <hi>heigths, and lengths, and depths, and breadth of the Love of Christ,</hi> ora just Measure of it, I very much question.</p>
               <p>Many things we meet with that are full of delight, but one may take a Surfeit of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, and therefore I shall onely trouble the Reader with his Concluding Argument, taken from the Sacraments: <hi>Which are</hi> (says he) <hi>the Instruments and Symbols of our Union with Christ.</hi> And if by Christ he understands <hi>the Church,</hi> it's not worth the while to make a Controversie on't; we will grant, That Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church consists in Union with it; and the surest Means to be United to the Church, is to be United to it; and this way seldom fails: But if he had a mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:105027:219"/>
something else, he had done like a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have informed us; for I must needs confess, I am in the dark: But yet we shall not lose all our labour: <hi>For these Sacraments represent both our external and real Union with him.</hi> And it's worth all our pains and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to hear one of his Lectures upon this Subject:</p>
               <p>First, for our External Union; <hi>Baptism is a publick Profession of the Christian Religion, that we believe the Gospel, own his Authority, and submit to his Government:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>These Sacraments signifie our Reall Union to Christ:</hi> Thus <hi>Baptism signifies our Profession of becoming New men, our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Conformity to Christ in his Death and Resurrection.</hi> Now look how much <hi>Conformity to Christs Death and Resurrection,</hi> is better than <hi>owning his Authority, and submitting to his Government,</hi> just so much is our <hi>Real Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> better than <hi>our external,</hi> which if one so exactly versed <hi>in the essential differences of things</hi> as our Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not told us other wise, ordinary Capacities had judged to be <hi>both one:</hi> That little advantage there is, <hi>the External Union</hi> carries it: For as to our <hi>External Union,</hi> Baptism (he tells us) <hi>is a Profession</hi> of it; but as to our <hi>Real Union,</hi> Baptism onely <hi>signifies</hi> a profession of it; and then it will be somewhat better to <hi>make a Profession</hi> of <hi>submission to Christs Government,</hi> than to make a <hi>signification</hi> of a Profession <hi>of Conformity to his Death.</hi> I shall therefore
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:105027:219"/>
rather acquiesce in the Judgement of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism about the Signification of Baptism, than in our Authors; which makes this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <hi>What is the inward and spiritual Grace?</hi> Ans. <hi>A death unto sin, and a New Birth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteousness; for being by Nature born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are hereby made the children of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[4] His last, and most famous Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is: <hi>That Fellowship and Communion with God signifies, what he calls a Political Union:</hi> And would we knew what that was: why it is this: <hi>To be in fellowship with God and Christ signifies to be of that Society which puts us into a peculiar Relation to God; that God is our Father, and we his Children, that Christ is our Head and Husband, and Lord, and Master; and we his Disciples, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, his Spouse, and Body.</hi> It's below the generosity of the Eagle, to catch Flies; an Employment more suitable to the impertinent humour of <hi>Domitian;</hi> and therefore it may be expected, that our Author should scorn to play so mean a Game, as to impose upon our weakness with the Ambiguity of a poor word. [To be in Fellowship,] carries a sound to a mere English Ear very like to [Union,] but if we examine either the Synonymous word [Communion,] or the Greek words, [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, are Terms ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately Measuring each other: There must be <hi>first a Relation,</hi> before there can be <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi> of those good things which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose the Relation. Thus the Love of a Father to his Child, his Care over him, his Bounty to him, is founded in his Relation to him, as his Son; and the Childs filial Love, Duty, Fear, are all b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>tomed upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which he holds to his Father. Thus we conceive first a Real Union between the Head and the Members, before we can conceive the Head should communicate spirits to all the parts, to quicken them to Motion. And this the Apostle expresses, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. That they who do not, <hi>Hold the Head,</hi> [that are not united to Christ,] can never receive from him those supplies, or Communications of Spiritual <hi>Nourishment,</hi> that they may <hi>encrease with the encrease of God.</hi> And thus must there be <hi>an Union</hi> between the Husband and the Wife, before there can be a Communication of what is in each others power: That is, they must give what they <hi>are,</hi> before they can give what <hi>they have:</hi> And this Order and Method is well observed in the Liturgy, (though our Author is pleased to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very merry with it) where the Man first <hi>takes the Woman to be his wedded Wife;</hi> and then assigns, or makes over <hi>what he has</hi> to her Use; <hi>with all my worldly Goods I thee endow:</hi> For he that gives <hi>Himself,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

stick at <hi>a'l the Rest.</hi> And thus the first thing that God gives to his in Covenant, is <hi>Himself:</hi> Heb. 8. 10. <hi>I will be their God;</hi> and then follows the Communication of all his <hi>Covenant Mercies.</hi> v. 12. <hi>I will be mercifull to their Iniquities, and remember their sins no more:</hi> And in the same Order the Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in its Restipulation with God: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>First gave their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the Union be <hi>a more general Union,</hi> the Relation <hi>a more common Relation,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications in due proportion will be more general, and Common; we are Related to <hi>all men,</hi> none are so remote, but they are <hi>our Neighbours;</hi> but yet we have <hi>a more special and peculiar</hi> Relation to all Christians: And hence is it, that the Apostle apportions out to us, the Nature of those good things that we ought to commuicate to both, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Doe good to all, but especially to them that are of the houshold of Faith.</hi> The great God <hi>as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is Related <hi>to all;</hi> and therefore <hi>does good to all.

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 9. has no such Influence upon <hi>Verse</hi> 10. but the Rise of his Discourse is from <hi>Verse</hi> 3. <hi>Grace be unto you, and Peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Where you have:</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Authors Memory is very Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous.

Believers to joyn in the <hi>same special League and Covenant,</hi> with Unbelievers.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> (says he) <hi>it's called a Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it signifies,</hi>

               </list>
               <p>That is, it's called <hi>a Communion</hi> because it's <hi>no Communion,</hi> but onely <hi>the sign</hi> of a Communion. There is indeed an <hi>outward and visible sign;</hi> and there is also <hi>an inward and invisible Grace,</hi> really exhibited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from Christ by the Ordinance, to the worthy Receiver. And thus much he might have learn'd from the Church Catechism:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the <hi>inward part, or thing signified?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:105027:224"/>Ans. <hi>The Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and indeed taken, and received of the Faithfull in the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. What are</hi> the Benefits <hi>whereof we are</hi> partakers <hi>Thereby?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. The strengthning and refreshing <hi>of our Souls, by the Body and Blood of Christ; As</hi> our Bodies <hi>are by the Bread and Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Liturgy in the Office of the Supper, expresses, not onely a Communication of <hi>reall Nourishment</hi> from Christ, to our Souls; but <hi>a mutual communication</hi> of <hi>our Praise and Thanksgiving</hi> to God for Christ, and to Christ for his Flesh and Blood; which <hi>compleats the Communion: The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for</hi> Thee, <hi>preserve thy Body and Soul into Everlasting Life; and</hi> Take, <hi>and</hi> Eat <hi>this, in remembrance that Christ dyed for thee; and</hi> feed on him <hi>in thy Heart</hi> by Faith, <hi>and be</hi> Thankfull.</p>
               <p>But to put this out of doubt, That all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is grounded upon Union, I will quote our Author to our Author; for Nothing cuts the Diamond like it self. <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains us at</hi> his Table <hi>as his</hi> own <hi>children.</hi> Why then, let it be referred to the Man that comes next; Whether <hi>sitting at</hi> Gods Table, <hi>does not presuppose us to be Children?</hi> Surely, we are not <hi>therefore Children</hi> because we <hi>sit at the Table;</hi> but we <hi>therefore sit at the Table,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>we are Children.</hi> Again, <hi>p.</hi> 152. Our Author (whose word ought to go far with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) assures us, That <hi>Baptism is the Sacrament</hi>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:105027:225"/>
                  <hi>of our Admission into the Church.</hi> There's <hi>our Union</hi> then however; and <hi>the Lords Supper</hi> finding us <hi>already united,</hi> affords us <hi>a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or <hi>a participation</hi> of those Priviledges, which flow <hi>from that Union.</hi> So that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>our Union to Christ,</hi> consist in <hi>our Union to the Church,</hi> or no; yet still there must be <hi>an Union to the Church,</hi> before we can <hi>hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it,</hi> in those <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Blessings</hi> which Christ has <hi>entailed</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>And thus has our Author made a quick dispatch of Communion with Christ in the Lords Supper; could he but as fairly dispatch it out of all other Exercises of Religion, he might seriously Triumph, that he had cut off the Neck of all Religion at one Blow: Well, success waits upon the Bold Undertaker, and there's no hurt in a daring Attempt. <hi>Prayer</hi> (says he) <hi>and Meditation, and such like Acts of Devotion, are no where called Communion with God.</hi> Our Author is just now turning Quaker. <q>Thou man, where dost thou read, that the People of God put off their Hats, or wore Ribbands and Lace?</q> But to satisfie him, Prayer and Meditation are <hi>not called, nor are</hi> they <hi>Communion with God;</hi> but <hi>Means whereby,</hi> and <hi>Wayes of Gods appointment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> we hold Communion with him: In these and other Ordinances we communicate to him the Actings of our Faith, Fear, Love, delight, Praise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by these he communicates to us of his Grace, Strength, Favour, Mercy, to help us in the time of our Need. In Prayer we <hi>pour</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:105027:225"/>
                  <hi>out our hearts before him,</hi> Psal. 62. 8. In Prayer and Meditation, <hi>We lift up our Souls to the Lord,</hi> Psal. 25. 1. Hence that frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Ancient Christians, <hi>Sursum Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> continued in the Liturgy: <hi>Lift up your hearts:</hi> Ans. <hi>We lift them up to the Lord:</hi> But a few dribling Objections he has against this also.</p>
               <p>1 Object. <hi>Communion does not consist in Transient Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Communion does consist in those <hi>permanent Effects</hi> conveyed by <hi>transient Acts;</hi> the Effect of Prayer abides, when the Act is over.</p>
               <p>2. The Lords Supper is <hi>a Transient Act,</hi> both in opposition to <hi>Permanent</hi> and <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> and yet there is <hi>a real Communion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and Believers therein.</p>
               <p>2 Object. <hi>You will not say, a poor Man has Communion with his Prince, when he puts up a Petition to him, to begg his Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It's more than our Author can tell, whether we will say so or no. If a Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Subjects, to make their Addresses to him, in all their streights; promising, that the great distance between them shall not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their Supplications, and shall appoint a Person near and dear to himself, to receive from them, and present to him all their Petitions, that in his Name they may find Acceptation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; if now his poor Subjects shall give faith to his Promises, make use of his Indulgence, own their Relation to him, and improve the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:105027:226"/>
Mediation of that Master of Requests, and upon the Relief of their Wants, Redress of their Grievances, shall return their humble and hearty thanks; and learn to love their Prince more, to serve him better, to become more loyal Subjects; methinks here's that which may be called Communion grounded upon Union.</p>
               <p>3 Obj. <hi>To Pray to God, is an Act of Homage which we owe to him as our Creator and Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I looked every moment when he should Confute himself; for now he will not deny, that <hi>Relation to God</hi> as our Creator and Father, precedes this Communion: <hi>It's a Duty</hi> (says he) <hi>that results from Relation.</hi> Therefore, (say I) It's not <hi>the Relation it self:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall still conclude, that Communion does properly denote <hi>the Communication of good things, bottom'd upon that Union and Relation we have to and with each other;</hi> and that our Author has most wretchedly abused his Time, and his Reader, in a weak Endeavour to prove, That <hi>Communion consists in Union;</hi> and has merited the Character of <hi>Hanno</hi> the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> (given him by the great Historian,) That he was a Person <hi>very skilfull in the Art</hi> of seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reverend.</p>

               <p>I suppose our Author will be content, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Worship</hi> be committed to the <hi>Churches</hi> care; but for reducing <hi>the Doctrine,</hi> that's <hi>a Burden</hi> he has reserved for his <hi>own shoulders:</hi> And methinks I see him (like the sign of the <hi>Atlas,</hi> supporting the Globe) chearfully heaving at the weight, and yet never so much as once crinkle in the Hams.</p>

                  <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>was pleas'd to institute a</hi> great many <hi>Ceremonies, and</hi> many <hi>of them of very</hi> obscure Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now let the Reader substract <hi>A many,</hi> out of <hi>A great many,</hi> and <hi>the Remainder</hi> will inform him, just <hi>How many</hi> of God's Institutions, had <hi>Any light</hi> in them. Had this Divinity faln into some mens fingers, they would perhaps have made desperate work with it: For, 1. Some might say, Nay then, if <hi>God's own Ceremonies</hi> were invented to <hi>aw Childish Minds,</hi> we can never hope for better from <hi>Humane Ceremonies,</hi> but that they should fright <hi>the Churches Children</hi> out of <hi>their wits.</hi> 2. Others would censure it as guilty of horrid Prophaneness, to assign such a Reason for God's sacred Institutions, as must imply, That he was forced to go <hi>subtly to work</hi> with his people, and to use the Artifice of Mormo's and Scarce-crows to fright them into Reverence; as women terrifie their children with <hi>Robin</hi>—with the <hi>Raw-head</hi> and <hi>Bloody-bones.</hi> And 3. Some would not stick to say, That surely some prying pate or other would have discovered the design, and then instead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating more Reverence, it would certainly have exposed his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> if not <hi>the Author</hi> of them,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:105027:227"/>
to contempt. But they who had seen Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> all on flame, and smoak; they who had heard the sound of that dreadful Trumpet, who felt the Earth-quake without, and a greater Heart-quake within at the presence of the Almighty God, were convinced that God needed not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to those <hi>little slights</hi> of Ceremonies to <hi>aw their Childish Minds into a Veneration of his Majesty.</hi> 4. Others expect when our Author should make God himself <hi>a Ceremony,</hi> contrived to manage this bulky and unruly World with more ease: For some it seems, have got it by the the end, that <hi>Primus in Orbe Deos fecit Timor.</hi> 5.

                  <hi>Grace; and this Faith receiving Christ,</hi> 1 John 13. <hi>it must also unite us to the Person of Christ:</hi> But of this our Author <hi>doubts, because men are not united to every thing they receive.</hi> Alas-a-day! yet when <hi>a Master receives</hi> any one to be <hi>his Servant,</hi> that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> is the bottom of his Relation. <hi>If a Woman</hi> receives a person to be <hi>her Husband,</hi> that <hi>Reception</hi> creates <hi>an Union.</hi> But I had rather the Reader would give himself the satisfaction to peruse the Doctors Book, where he shall find these things laid down with Modesty, backed with strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Scripture, and the suffrage of Learned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: And if our Author thinks, that a few Squirts and Flashes (which he is resolved to call Wit) be a sufficient Confutation, he shall enjoy the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of admiring his own Excellencies, without any Rival. Again; This Union (says the Doctor) may be thus described, '<hi>Tis that Supernatural, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Intimous Oneness, and Conjunction between the Person of Christ, and the Persons of Believers, through the Bonds of the Spirit and Faith; upon which there follows mutual and reciprocal Communion each with other.</hi> I will not conceal from the Reader my thoughts; I really expected, that our Author should have highly commended the Doctors <hi>Modesty,</hi> who in a subject so Sublime, as might well exercise the Tongues of Angels, should draw his Description with <hi>a Peut estre,</hi> it [may be described:] And the rather, because by that means he has not excluded our Authors greater Abilities from travelling in the subject, but left room enough for his Defining Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: But instead of that, I s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whether they will prove Arabic, or Syriac, or Welsh or Wild-Irish: But to be sure, they came but lately into <hi>England,</hi> and are not yet made Denizons to <hi>purchase</hi> our Author's <hi>favour.</hi> The great danger is, lest we should mistake <hi>this Conjunction,</hi> for one of the <hi>Eight parts of Speech.</hi> Oh Sirs! what inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable perplexities has this one lewd word involved the Nation in, since it landed? The old <hi>Shiboleth</hi> was an <hi>innocent Chrysom</hi> to it. <hi>Political Union</hi> and <hi>Machine,</hi> are sorry Sneaks to it: Indeed <hi>Tetrachyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogon,</hi> and <hi>Syncategorematical</hi> come pretty near: But Oh <hi>Conjunction!</hi> This <hi>Conjunction</hi> is not to be tolerated in a Land professing the Seven Liberal Sciences. And yet after all this, I dare venture an even Wager, That as many understand <hi>Conjunction,</hi> as <hi>Opposition,</hi> and more than know what to make of <hi>Antithesis;</hi> and yet that never choak'd our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but he could swallow it without making any <hi>Bones of it,</hi> or a Vespasian-<hi>face at it,</hi> p. 264. But if some small splinter should stick in his throat, the Doctor will be that <hi>charitable Crane</hi> to pluck it out; for he adds, <hi>Believers are said to be joyned to the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17. Now if no words will down with him but such as <hi>melt in the mouth,</hi> let him sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <hi>Ioyning</hi> for <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and that will serve for a <hi>Vehicle,</hi> with <hi>a spoonful of Syrrup of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to supple the passage.</p>
               <p>Our Author finding that the Doctor has <hi>bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himself,</hi> will endeavour to help him out. <hi>It's a plain case</hi> (says he) <hi>if Christ and Believers are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their Persons are united too; for the Person of Christ, is Christ himself, and the Persons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are Believers themselves; and I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how they should be united without their Persons;</hi>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:105027:231"/>
                  <hi>but then they are united by mutual Relations, as the Person of a Prince and his Subjects, of a Husband and his Wife, are united by mutual affections.</hi> This I confess a surpassing kindness; and therefore that frequent reckonings may make us long Friends, I shall call some small Follies to account, ere they be forgotten. 1. I am more confirm'd in my old Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, That our Author <hi>writes only from hand to month.</hi> He has told us, <hi>p.</hi> 157. That <hi>our Union to Christ, is not an Union to his Person, but confists in a sincere Union to his Church.</hi> And so again, <hi>p.</hi> 151. and yet now, <hi>If Christ and Believers are united, their Persons are united too; for he cannot understand</hi> (no not for his heart, I warrant you) <hi>how they should be united without their Persons.</hi> 2. He charges the Doctor with owning <hi>an Adhesion, nay a Natural Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion of Persons.</hi> I confess, I never admired any mans Confidence more; that in the face of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors words, which he himself had quoted, directly affirming the contrary, should charge him with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, <hi>a Natural Adhesion of Persons:</hi> Thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Doctors words, <hi>The Person of Christ and Believers are united, and yet it's no Personal Union.</hi> Again, the Doctor thus, <hi>It's a Spiritual, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Conjunction.</hi> Our Author had need tell nothing but Truth; for he is the poorliest qualified for <hi>a Lyar,</hi> that I have met withal: And now let it be referred to the Groom-Porter, Whether <hi>Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> be not as like to choak narrow throats, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</hi> 3. He says, <hi>Christ and Believers are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mutual Relations:</hi> And then makes a Quaere upon't, Whether <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Absurdities</hi> he would fasten upon the Doctors words, will not recoyl upon <hi>his own:</hi> For it signifies no more, than if he had said,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:105027:231"/>
Christ and Believers are <hi>united</hi> by their <hi>Union,</hi> and <hi>related</hi> by their <hi>Relation;</hi> and thus Christ, is Christ; and Believers, are Believers; and Union, is Union.</p>
               <p>The Truce is now expired, and he is once again falling upon Dr. <hi>Owen:</hi> For as the Serpents in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> lay aside their Poyson whilest they drink, and then presently suck it up again; so I was pretty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, our Author would lick up that vomit again, which he had cast in Dr. <hi>Iacomb</hi>'s face, that he might serve the other with the same sawce. But whilst I am considering his Extravagances, there comes to my hand an Answer from the Doctor, wherein since he has condescended to chastise our Author in person, it may justly supersede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt of mine in his Vindication.</p>
               <p>At <hi>p.</hi> 243. I meet again with our Author, where he falls upon that weighty point of Justification: In his exposing of which Truth, he takes occasion from a passage in Dr. <hi>O.</hi> (I see I must mention him again) <hi>Com.</hi> p. 55. <hi>There is no man whatever, that hath any wants, in reference to the things of God, but Christ will be to him that which he wants: (I speak of those</hi> [N. B.] <hi>who are given him of the Father.) Is he Dead? Christ is Life! Is he weak? Christ is the Power of God! Hath he a Sense of Sin upon him? Christ is Compleat Righteousness!</hi> Jer. 23. 6. <hi>The Lord our Righteousness.</hi> Which words being fortified with <hi>express Scripture,</hi> it concerned our Author to take <hi>good advice,</hi> and to go gingerly to work in pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. Two Artifices he uses, which like <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> will make the <hi>strongest Cloth</hi> shrink. And, 1. He lops off one whole Sentence, <hi>p.</hi> 214. and then exclaims. <hi>This sounds like Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption!</hi> What, down-right Arminianism? Really
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:105027:232"/>
I am sorry for't! Is the Doctor sheer gone over to the <hi>Remoustrants?</hi> Come! come Sir! you have a Card in your Sleeve; pray produce it! <hi>I speak</hi> (says the Doctor) <hi>of those who are given him of the Father.</hi> Now where are <hi>your ears?</hi> Does this <hi>chink</hi> like <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Redemption?</hi> But so true is the old Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>He that is prepossest with an Opinion, finds it in all he reads.</hi> 2. If that way fails, another will hit: <hi>What Comfort is this to us</hi> (says he) <hi>that Christ was Righteous, if we continue wilful, and incorrigible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Yes,</hi> says the Doctor, <hi>hast thou a sense of sin upon thee? Christ is Compleat Righteousness.</hi> Fie upon it! put on a Mask for shame! Is the Soul that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under <hi>the sense of some particular sin, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and incorrigible sinner?</hi> It's the repenting, the broken, and the sorrowful sinner, that the Doctor directs to Christ. Our blessed Saviour has invited those that <hi>labour, and are heavy-laden, to come unto him;</hi> promising, that he <hi>will give them rest.</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Author could forbear twitting <hi>him,</hi> that he encouraged <hi>wilful and incorrigible sinners?</hi> But, pray, what would our Author say to a Soul that has <hi>the sense of sin upon him?</hi> without peradventure, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thy sin, forsake thy sin,</hi> &amp;c. And does he think that <hi>Repentance</hi> will save a <hi>wilful and incorrigible sinner?</hi> one that <hi>Repents and sins,</hi> and <hi>sins and Repents again,</hi> and goes on <hi>in a circle of sinning,</hi> and <hi>half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance?</hi> Say but the same for the Doctor: He Counsels the Soul, <hi>under the sense of sin,</hi> to believe; but then it's only <hi>the Repenting sinner</hi> that <hi>will,</hi> that <hi>can,</hi> that <hi>ought</hi> to make his Address to Christ, that he may <hi>find rest to his Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our Author's Method in prosecuting <hi>this great Point,</hi> I dare not warrant it. Such as it is,

               <p n="1">[1.] His first enquiry will be, <hi>In what sense Christ is called our Righteousness?</hi> and what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intends by those Phrases of, <hi>The Righteousness of God;</hi> the <hi>Righteousness of Faith;</hi> or, <hi>The Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God by Faith?</hi> He begins with <hi>that famous place,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. <hi>where Christ is expresly called the Lord our Righteousness.</hi> To which our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns three things; A pitiful <hi>Scoff,</hi> a woful <hi>Evasion,</hi> and a wretched <hi>Answer,</hi> worse than both. 1. He begins with a Scoff: <hi>A very express place to prove that Christ is our Righteousness; that is, that the only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, wherewith we must appear before God, is the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us.</hi> Who <hi>these men</hi> should be that thus expound it, I cannot Divine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be <hi>the first Reformers of this Church?</hi> and they do indeed tell us, <hi>Artic.</hi> 11. That <hi>we are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, and not for our own Works and Deservings: Wherefore that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine, and full of comfort.</hi> And I believe our Author experienced it to be <hi>a most sweet and comfortable</hi> Doctrine, when he subscribed it for <hi>a fat Benefice:</hi> But in the mean time, <hi>these men</hi> (whoever they be) have a very <hi>hard task on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t.</hi> For one while they must <hi>not draw one Conclusion from the Person of Christ, which his Gospel has not</hi> expresly <hi>taught;</hi> to use their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to deduce <hi>one single Inference</hi> from Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premises, is present Death. But what now if they produce <hi>express Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Christ is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?</hi> Why, that's as bad! for this is to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scripture by the sound of words.</hi> 2. He retreats
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:105027:233"/>
to <hi>a most woful</hi> Evasion, <hi>Is there no other possible sense to be made of this Phrase?</hi> If it be <hi>possible</hi> to procure another Sense for Love or Money, it shall never go thus: The Cause looks with a very <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate face,</hi> when once it comes to this; when men are ready to shoot the Pit, and only watch for the Creep-hole of <hi>a bare Possibility.</hi> If they intended honestly, they would lay things together as well as they can; labour to find out the meaning of God's Spirit, with Sobriety and Humility, and never strain their Wits, and vex and torture the Scripture with <hi>utmost Possibilities:</hi> The Text tells us, that <hi>the nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> whereby Christ shall be called, is the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> Now it's granted, that this was not design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his <hi>Praenomen,</hi> or <hi>Cognomen,</hi> that which should distinguish him <hi>in Common Discourse</hi> from other persons; and therefore, <hi>He shall be called,</hi> is no less than, <hi>He shall Really be our Righteousness:</hi> Thus, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called</hi> (that is, that we should become) <hi>the sons of God:</hi> Isa. 9. 6. <hi>His name shall be called</hi> (i. e. he shall Really be) <hi>Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</hi> The true intent and meaning of which place, I know how some have attempted to elude, by this fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>the Possibility of another meaning;</hi> and whether our Author sharpned his weapon at their forge, he knows best. But, 3. He returns an Answer worse than both the other: <hi>Righteousness in Scripture is a word of a very large sense, and sometimes signifies no more than Mercy, Kindness, Beneficence; and so the Lord our Righteousness, is the Lord who does us good.</hi> But, 1. Is it not vainly supposed, That for Christ <hi>to do us</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:105027:233"/>
                  <hi>good,</hi> is inconsistent with being <hi>our Righteousness?</hi> 2. Though Christ be a Redeemer of <hi>Mercy, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Beneficence;</hi> yet he is no-where called, <hi>The Lord our Mercy, The Lord our Kindness, The Lord our Beneficence:</hi> Which clearly proves, that when he is called, and really is, <hi>The Lord our Righteousness,</hi> the expression implies more than <hi>an Imparting,</hi> or <hi>Communication</hi> of <hi>good things to us.</hi> Hence some would say, That if our Author's Conscience were not larger than the sense of this word, he had never given so stretching an Answer. But (says he) <hi>Righteousness signifies that part of Iustice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in relieving the oppressed.</hi> Isa. 54. 17. <hi>Their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is of me, saith the Lord, which is a parallel expression to,</hi> The Lord our Righteousness, <hi>and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more, than that the Lord would avenge their Cause, and deliver them from all their Enemies:</hi> So that all the benefit we are to expect from Christ, is <hi>Temporal Salvation</hi> and Deliverance. To which I answer: 2. That <hi>the Reason</hi> of Christ's glorious Name, <hi>The Lord our Righteousness,</hi> assigned by the Prophet, that <hi>in his days Iudah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely,</hi> is interpreted by the Angel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. to be this, <hi>He shall be called Iesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.</hi> And the end why God raised up his Son Jesus in the World, is expresly assigned to be, <hi>To bless his people, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of them from their iniquities,</hi> Acts 3. 26. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Out of Zion shall come the Deliverer, and he shall turn away ungodliness from Iacob.</hi> To <hi>turn away iniquity from us;</hi> and to <hi>turn us away from iniquity,</hi> is I hope something of a more useful import, than to <hi>relieve the injured and oppressed, and deliver them from their Enemies.</hi>

I do not at all envy our Author therefore the glory of his discovery, that <hi>for God to justifie good men, is to deliver them from the violence and injuries of their Enemies:</hi> And I would gladly hope, that all good men have something better wherein to glory. In <hi>Ier.</hi> 33. 16. the Church is called, <hi>The Lord our Righteousness;</hi> because she only glories in the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, her <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband;</hi> to whom being <hi>so nearly related,</hi> and with whom being <hi>so closely united, his Righteousness,</hi> is <hi>her Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> and therefore she, who upon the account of the imperfection of her <hi>Inherent Righteousness,</hi> can find, <hi>no, not the least,</hi> matter of <hi>boasting</hi> before God, yet has whereof to <hi>Triumph</hi> in Christ her Saviour; Isa. 45. 24. <hi>Surely, shall one say, In the Lord have I Righteousness: In the Lord shall all the seed of Iacob be justified, and shall glory.</hi> Now the Apostle, whom I take to be a competent Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, assures us, that God has taken special care, that in his dispensing of Grace to sinners, <hi>No flesh shall glory in his presence,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29. which he has well provided; for <hi>ver.</hi> 30. since <hi>Christ is made unto us of God for Righteousness;</hi> and therefore <hi>he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord:</hi> Which is exactly parallel to that of <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 24. <hi>In the Lord shall all the seed of Iacob be justified, and shall glory.</hi> Come we now to our Author's Interpretation of <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 11. which is of <hi>the same leaven</hi> with the former: <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God: For he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation, and covered me with the robe of Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c.

If our Saviour had mentioned the Imputation of his Righteousness a thousand times over, he could easily have <hi>evaded</hi> it at his rate of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering; for he might have said, This is but to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture by the sound of words;</hi> or if that had been too frigid, that <hi>it's sufficient to say, The words may possibly have another meaning,</hi> though he could

not tell what that should be; or, that by <hi>the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christ's Righteousness,</hi> no more is meant, but the <hi>Accepting of our own Righteousness,</hi> which Christ has <hi>commanded in the Gospel.</hi> 2. It may be of good use to him to consider, Whether Christ's <hi>Silence</hi> raised his <hi>prejudice</hi> against the Doctrine; or <hi>his own prejudice against the Doctrine,</hi> raised the conceit that Christ was <hi>silent</hi> in it? Whether it was the want of <hi>an Object</hi> to be seen; or the want <hi>of eyes</hi> to see the Object? For most men are <hi>deaf,</hi> when they have no mind <hi>to hear;</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> when they have <hi>no will to see.</hi> For, 3. Christ in his Sermons has plainly revealed the case to be such between God and man, that without a better Righteousness than their own, they are all lost for ever, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>He that breaks the least of these Commandments, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>shall never come there.</hi> Now the universal Suffrage of all mens Consciences is, That <hi>there is no man that lives, and sins not;</hi> and therefore Christ has determined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he shall <hi>never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> I never yet heard, that God has dispenced with one jot or tittle of the Moral Law; but, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is as strictly exacted as ever: So that unless <hi>a Surety</hi> be admitted, and the Righteousness of another owned, the case of all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> is deplorable and desperate. To deny then <hi>the Righteousness</hi> where in the believing sinner may stand before <hi>this Righteous and Holy God,</hi> is to affirm the Eternal Damnation of all the World. 4.

               <p>A second Prejudice that is deep-rooted in our Author's breast against this Doctrine, is, <hi>That Christ</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:105027:236"/>
                  <hi>exacts from men a Righteousness of their own, if they would find mercy with God.</hi> A Righteousness of their own? Ay, but let them be sure they come honestly by it. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ</hi> must be <hi>made ours,</hi> or else we shall never find mercy with God: We must also have <hi>another Righteousness of our own,</hi> an <hi>Inherent Righteousness,</hi> if ever we expect to enter into <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and find mercy with God in his great Day. But what is that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <hi>for which</hi> we are just and accepted with God? But for the removing of this small preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, may he please to consider: 1. How easie it is to vapour and make a flourish with those Texts that require <hi>an Inherent Righteousness,</hi> as <hi>a necessary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for Eternal Salvation;</hi> and yet how hard to produce one place that mentions <hi>our own Inherent Righteousness,</hi> as that which answers God's holy Law, makes Reconciliation with God, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stutes the sinner <hi>spotless and blameless</hi> before God, the Holy, Righteous Judg; yet such a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we want, and such a one we must have. 2. Our own Righteousness is <hi>very pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, being the fruit of Faith, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Iustification.</hi> So says the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Artic.</hi> 12. <hi>But</hi> (says She) <hi>Works done before the Grace of God, and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasing to God, for as much as they spring not out of Faith in Christ,</hi> Artic. 13. Which two Articles I shall leave to our Author to confute, at his best leisure.</p>
               <p>A third Block which I perceive lies in his way is, <hi>That our Saviour should never once warn his Hearers, to beware of trusting to their own Righteousness.</hi> But, 1. Christ preach'd <hi>to the Iews,</hi> who had had warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:105027:237"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>now to beware of splitting upon that Rock: They might have taken warning from the Churches Confession, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteousnesses are as filthy rags.</hi> All the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World signifies nothing to them that are resolved to interpret, <hi>Our own Righteousness,</hi> by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and Hypocrisie.</hi> Had Christ inculcated the danger, even to Tautology, all may be evaded by <hi>that happy Gloss,</hi> which he keeps <hi>Leiger</hi> by him: <hi>True indeed, he warns us to beware of our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> but he intends no more hereby, than <hi>the works of the Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>external acts of the Moral Law.</hi> 3. Christ had indeed given them fair <hi>warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but if they will not take it, the sin must lie at their <hi>own doors,</hi> and the Condemnation upon <hi>their own heads,</hi> Luke 18. 9. <hi>He spake a Parable to them that trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised others,</hi> &amp;c. Now it may seasonably be here remembred: 1. What was <hi>the design of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> And that the Evangelist tells us, was to meet with them <hi>that trusted in themselves,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, men that presumed very highly upon their own Abilities, <hi>to answer the Law of God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>despised others,</hi> who made such a stir about <hi>their own Impotency</hi> to keep it; and kept such a coyl about the shortness of their obedience to it; like the <hi>poor Publican,</hi> who being conscious to himself of both, makes his retreat to, and shelters himself in the free Grace, and rich Mercy of God to <hi>miserable sinners.</hi> 2. It will be seasonable to enquire, <hi>What that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness was,</hi> upon which the Pharisee <hi>in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> so stiffly insisted, as that in which he durst ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to appear before God? And that (as our Saviour puts the case) was <hi>a Righteousness made up</hi>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:105027:237"/>
                  <hi>of obedience to Gods Commands:</hi> And those both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitory, he was <hi>no Extortioner, no Adulterer, no Unjust Person;</hi> and Affirmatively, he <hi>paid his Tythes exactly,</hi> (which will go a great way) <hi>and fasted twice a-week.</hi> 3. Let it be considered, that however many of the Pharisees of those days were <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> yet our Saviour frames his Parable of <hi>a Pharisee,</hi> not according to what <hi>many of them were,</hi> but what they <hi>seemed to be,</hi> and were <hi>reputed for</hi> amongst men, who admired their <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and <hi>reverenced their Devotions;</hi> and therefore he describes <hi>not a Person</hi> acting his part well upon the Stage, but living up to very high Attainments of Nature. For, 1. The duties instanced in, are only <hi>some particulars, in the name of all the rest:</hi> He instances in his <hi>praying</hi> to, and <hi>praising of God,</hi> which comprehend all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>First Table:</hi> His freedom from <hi>Adultery, Extortion;</hi> and in a word, from <hi>Injustice,</hi> which is the whole of <hi>the Second Table.</hi> Again, He instances in duties of the <hi>Iudicial Law, paying Tythes;</hi> and of the <hi>Ceremonial, Fasting;</hi> with a little touch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of <hi>Supereragation,</hi> [<hi>Twice in the week.</hi>] 2. When Christ introduces a person, saying, he was <hi>no Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,</hi> we may reasonably suppose, he taught him to speak in the proper sense of the word which Christ himself allows. Now in Christ's Dialect, to be <hi>no Adulterer,</hi> is <hi>not to commit it with the heart,</hi> Mat. 5. still abating for Humane Frailties. And, 3. This is evident, because our Savióur describes not this Pharisee, as praying in the <hi>corners of the streets,</hi> or <hi>in the Synagogues, to be seen of men;</hi> but in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's Command, <hi>Going up to the Temple to pray;</hi> and there praying to God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in his own heart, between God, and his own Soul:
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:105027:238"/>
All which evidently prove, that our Saviour puts not the case of a <hi>stinking Hypocrite,</hi> but of one who went as far as Natures legs would carry him. But, 4. The miscarriage of this Pharisee lay not in this, that he <hi>was,</hi> what he pretended he <hi>was not;</hi> or <hi>was not,</hi> what he pretended he was; but that he <hi>trusted to himself</hi> for a Righteousness, to be compounded out of all these Ingredients, wherein he would dare to stand before God, and in despising others, which is the natural Product of Self-Righteousness: And yet upon our Author's Principles, I see not why he might not trust to himself, that he was Righteous, if Righteousness be to be made out of Obedience; and despise others too, since <hi>his own free-will</hi> exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>natural strength</hi> improved, had made him differ <hi>from another,</hi> even from <hi>that Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet, 4. There's one Prejudice more remaining, which perhaps may stick more with him than all the rest: <hi>He is apt to admire our Saviour's Sermons in the first place, before the Writings of the Apostles, though inspired men.</hi> I should be loth to weaken his Admiration of our Saviours Sermons: But he may do well to examine, Whether his Aptness to admire them before <hi>other Sermons</hi> given forth by <hi>the same Spirit,</hi> may not proceed <hi>from great Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>a worse</hi> Principle? For though <hi>our Saviour's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had more Authority than <hi>the Persons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;</hi> yet <hi>the Writings of the Apostles</hi> are of <hi>equal</hi> Authority with <hi>those of the Evangelists,</hi> to command our Faith and Obedience. <hi>The Epistles</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> are indited by <hi>the same Spirit</hi> by which hepenned <hi>the Gospel:</hi> 'Tis <hi>the Authority</hi> of Christ <hi>in both;</hi> the Infallible <hi>Spirit</hi> speaking <hi>in both,</hi> which are <hi>the Reason</hi> of our Belief of both: <hi>All Scripture is given</hi>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:105027:238"/>
                  <hi>by Divine Inspiration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 18. The same Spirit of Christ that spake in <hi>the Prophets of the Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles in the New,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11. And <hi>such Comparisons</hi> must needs be very <hi>odious,</hi> where the Spirit of God has made none.</p>
               <p>But the total sum of all these Prejudices, we shall have in one Dilemma; <hi>Did not our Saviour instruct his Hearers in all things necessary to Salvation? or have the Evangelists given us an imperfect account of his Doctrine? If the first; then our Saviour was not faithful in the discharge of his Prophetical Office: If the latter; you overthrow the Credit of the Gospel.</hi> Well! I hope we may out-live this horned-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for all the terrour of its looks: 1. Christ was <hi>faithful in his Prophetical Office;</hi> he instructed his Hearers <hi>in all things necessary to Salvation:</hi> But then there are <hi>some great and weighty Doctrines,</hi> which it was necessary to the Salvation of the Gentile World to know, wherein <hi>the Iewish Church</hi> had been sufficiently <hi>instructed already.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Atoning God,</hi> making <hi>Reconciliation for sin,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating Transgressions, was abundantly clear from <hi>their Sacrifices:</hi> The Theory <hi>of God's justifying a sinner,</hi> was evident from thence; they knew what <hi>Imputation</hi> signified, by the <hi>transferring of the guilt</hi> of the sinner, upon <hi>the head of the Sacrifice:</hi> And therefore when Christ came, his main business with the Jews, was to convince them, that he was <hi>the Messiah</hi> promised of old, and typified in <hi>their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:</hi> His Work they knew, all the Question was, Whether <hi>he was the Person?</hi> Matth. 11. 3. <hi>Art thou he that should come? or do we look for another?</hi> Joh. 10. 24. <hi>If thou beest the Christ, tell us plainly.</hi> Christ's Sermons therefore <hi>suppose them instructed</hi> in the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:105027:239"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine of Iustification:</hi> But when the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who is called, <hi>The Apostle of the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> comes to preach and write to the Gentiles, he must be <hi>more express;</hi> they knew <hi>little</hi> of God, and <hi>nothing at all of a Redeemer,</hi> they must be taught <hi>their Catechism,</hi> and the <hi>first Rudiments of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;</hi> and therefore do we find <hi>these great Points</hi> more <hi>explicitely</hi> handled in <hi>his Discourses,</hi> which are more <hi>sparingly</hi> and more <hi>covertly</hi> delivered by <hi>the Evangelists.</hi> 2. <hi>The Evangelists have given us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect account of Christ's Doctrine;</hi> but then <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectness of that account,</hi> is not to be measured by what <hi>Christ preached,</hi> but by what they were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to record</hi> and transmit to Posterity. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>faithful in giving us a perfect account of Christ's Sermons;</hi> but his <hi>faithfulness,</hi> and the <hi>entireness of the account he gives us</hi> thereof, is not to be taken from <hi>every Miracle</hi> Christ wrought, or <hi>every Sermon</hi> he preach'd; for he omits <hi>that whole famous Sermon preach'd by Christ in the Mount,</hi> recorded by <hi>Matthew.</hi> And S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was also <hi>faithful in his account,</hi> and yet he omits the excellent Prayer recorded by <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 17. and yet both of them, and both the other, have conveyed down to us, <hi>whatsoever, was delivered to them,</hi>

as if I <hi>at all questioned,</hi> much less <hi>denied,</hi> that the Doctrine of Christ's Righteousness imputed, is laid down by the Evangelists, though some mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices will not permit them to see it, either there, or any-where else; but that it is there spoken to more implicitly, our Saviour doing <hi>another thing,</hi> &amp; touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it <hi>by the way,</hi> as supposing them <hi>already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in it:</hi> And that the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, qualified to preach to the Gentiles, by the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit upon them, have <hi>more clearly</hi> commented upon that, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Doctrines, and beaten out that Gold which was before <hi>in the Lump;</hi> and though of <hi>equal weight,</hi> yet not <hi>so dilated:</hi> So that there remains no more just cause of Dispute about these matters, with them who believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God: And as for others, they can never want Objections, whilst their Corruptions and Unbelief continue in full force, strength and power.</p>

               <p n="3">[3.] His Next step is, towards the deciding the Controversie about <hi>the way of</hi> Abraham'<hi>s being justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God:</hi> And a great and weighty Question it is; for <hi>Abraham</hi> being called, <hi>The Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> it might seem strange, that the <hi>Father</hi> should be justified <hi>one way,</hi> and his <hi>Children another;</hi> when <hi>Believers</hi> are <hi>therefore,</hi> and <hi>only therefore, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> because they walk in <hi>the steps of his Faith, Rom.</hi> 4. 12. And seeing (as our Author Confesses) <hi>he was set forth as a Patern of our Iustification;</hi> It were to be admired, If the Exemplar, and the Copy; the Archetype, and Ectype, were of <hi>Divers kinds.</hi> It will be of good use therefore to enquire, What way <hi>Abraham was justified?</hi> Though <hi>the best way</hi> to resolve it, is to enquire, What way <hi>Believers under the Gospel are justified?</hi> Now the Apostle is very punctual herein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Abraham received the sign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which he had yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, that Righteousness might be imputed to them</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:105027:242"/>
                  <hi>also.</hi> Look what way <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, the same way are all true Believers justified (for he is Father of the faithful; and they his Children only, because they tread in the steps of the same Faith:) but <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>justified by Faith,</hi> by <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith,</hi> and in a way of Imputation (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever these Expressions signifie;) therefore Believers under the Gospel are justified by Faith, by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith, and in a way of Imputation. Again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Even as</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness:</hi> v. 7. Know ye therefore, that they which are <hi>of Faith, are the Children of faithful</hi> Abraham: Where the Apostle demonstrates, that <hi>the sameness of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Faith with</hi> Abrahams, is as able to denominate him <hi>one of</hi> Abraham's <hi>Children,</hi> as if he came <hi>out of his loyns.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>So then, they which are of Faith, are blessed with faithful</hi> Abraham. If they have the <hi>same Faith</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> they shall have <hi>the same Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with <hi>Abraham;</hi> for says he, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us; that the Blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles, through Iesus Christ.</hi> All the advantage the Gentiles receive by Christ (and they need no more to make them perfectly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally blessed) is, that <hi>Abraham's Blessing may come upon them:</hi> But if we have not <hi>Abraham's Faith,</hi> we must never expect <hi>a part</hi> in <hi>Abraham's Blessing:</hi> Nay (says the Apostle) <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the same Gospel preach'd to him, that we have. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture foreseeing</hi> (that is, the Spirit of Christ which gave forth the Scripture) <hi>that God would justifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Gospel to Abraham.</hi> Now <hi>the preaching of the Gospel,</hi> is the

               </p>
               <p>But what is our Author's judgment in the case? I confess that's hard to discover, <hi>p.</hi> 243. he gives us, <hi>The Righteousness of God,</hi> the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>Synonima's.</hi> And again expresly, <hi>p.</hi> 245. he <hi>observes it</hi> to us for a choice dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; <hi>That the Righteousness of God, is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith, or Righteousness by the Faith of Christ.</hi> And now <hi>p.</hi> 246. he is peremptory, That <hi>this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith, and this alone, can recommend us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to God: Which</hi> (says he) <hi>the Apostle proves from the example of</hi> Abraham; and adds, <hi>That</hi> Abraham, <hi>who was the Father of the faithful, was set forth for a patern of our Iustification.</hi> Now scarce one of his Readers in a thousand, but would have been trying Conclusions out of his premises: <hi>Abraham's</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, was <hi>the Righteousness of Faith:</hi> But the Righteousness of Faith, is <hi>the Righteousness of Faith in Christ;</hi> therefore <hi>Abraham's</hi> Righteousness was the Righteousness of Faith in Christ. Again (says he) <hi>the Apostle proves, that this Righteousness of Faith, and this alone, can recommend us to God.</hi> If then there be <hi>but one only Righteousness</hi> that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to God, either <hi>Abraham</hi> and Christians have one and the same Righteousness, or else one of them must needs want a Righteousness that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to God. But now from these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, our Author concludes, that Abraham's <hi>Faith, was not a Faith in Christ.</hi> Then say I, <hi>His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:105027:243"/>
                  <hi>was not the Righteousness by Faith in Christ:</hi> And then it was not neither <hi>the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> no, nor <hi>the Righteousness of God;</hi> for our Author has warranted us, <hi>p.</hi> 243, and 245. <hi>That the Righteousness of Faith, the Righteousness of God, and the Righteousness by the Faith of Christ,</hi> are but <hi>all one Righteousness.</hi> But here we have the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence and <hi>Elixir</hi> of our Author's rational Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: To this purpose he argues, The Father of the faithful, and his believing Children, are justified both one way, But <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful was justified one way, and therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are his Children, are justified another. Now I like our Author's Conclusions dearly, when they are together by the ears with their premises. Again, Thus he reasons; Abraham <hi>was set forth for a patern of our Iustification:</hi> But nothing ought to be like its patern; and therefore you may be sure if <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified one way, Believers are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied another. Again, <hi>The Apostle proves what way Believers are justified, from the example of</hi> Abraham: But now the Apostle you know, always argues from one sort of things to another, his way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding is by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Faith, you may conclude from thence, then Christians are justified by Works; and if Believers are justified by Faith in Christ, then to be sure <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified some other way. The plain truth is, our Author is got into a Cramp, and has so hamper'd and bangled his matters, that I am very confident none of his Readers do understand him, and it were well, if he understood himself.</p>

                  <hi>forth;</hi> but he saw also that it was <hi>upon the account of Christ,</hi> a Mediator, that God would communicate to him <hi>the Blessings</hi> of the Covenant opitomized in that, <hi>I will be thy God.</hi> And this was that Gospel or Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings which was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3. 8. But our Author threatens we shall hear more of this presently: And I promise him when we do, it shall be fully considered. 2. He answers Affirmatively, Abraham <hi>believed God.</hi> To which I say, <hi>Subordinat a non pugnant:</hi> To <hi>believe God,</hi> and to <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> are very well consistent. That <hi>Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God,</hi> and therefore he <hi>believed in Christ,</hi> seems to me to carry <hi>as fair Reason,</hi> as that other of his: Abraham <hi>believed God,</hi> and therefore <hi>he did not believe in Christ;</hi> for the Scripture represents them as well agreed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Through Christ we believe in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">[4.] Our next Task must be to Combate with our Author's scruples, and certainly never did man so snithe with prejudices against Truth: <hi>It's hard to conceive how</hi> Abraham <hi>should learn this Mystery from that general Promise,</hi> [In thy Seed shall all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be blessed.] Prejudice will, I confess, make <hi>an easier matter</hi> than this very <hi>hard;</hi> and unbelief, <hi>impossible</hi> to be conceived: And yet were there not something worse than Prejudice at the bottom, the difficulty could not be insuperable: For, 1. <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>one Promise</hi> that we know of, to clear up the meaning of this. Several Promises give Reciprocal light to one another: The <hi>first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> assured him, That <hi>the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head:</hi> This shews to <hi>Abraham</hi> the necessity of having <hi>that Enmity</hi> removed, which the Devil <hi>by sin had sowen</hi> between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:105027:246"/>
the removing of <hi>this Enmity</hi> could not be, whilst Satan had the Dominion over the Creature: <hi>A Seed</hi> is therefore promised, to heal all that misery which sin brought into the World. This Promise was committed to the Church of God, which was a <hi>faithful Guardian,</hi> to keep <hi>so precious a Iewel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to its trust: In this Seed (which God had now revealed should come <hi>out of the Loyns of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) God promises <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which mutually sends light to the <hi>other Promise,</hi> that God would not only by the Promised Seed, <hi>Deliver from evil,</hi> but <hi>bestow all good.</hi> 2. <hi>Abraham</hi> might have other and better Comments upon <hi>both these Promises,</hi> than we are concerned to know; it's enough for us, that we are taught in general, that <hi>Abraham was justified the same way</hi> that <hi>we are;</hi> and what that is, the New-Testament abundantly declares: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's more ingenuous to conclude, That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was <hi>justified by a Faith in Christ,</hi> because <hi>we are so;</hi> than, That we are <hi>not justified by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ,</hi> because <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>not so.</hi> 3. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> understood <hi>the true use of Sacrifices,</hi> which are a clear Paraphrase upon the Promise, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God would reconcile the World to himself, namely, by <hi>laying the sins of the Offender upon the head of that Sacrifice,</hi> which in the fulness of time should be offered for <hi>a Propitiation to God.</hi> In the Faith of which grand Propitiation, all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers lived and died: And when at length he was exhibited to the World, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist points to him, as the Accomplishment of <hi>all their former Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiees,</hi> and the Answer of all their Prayers and Hopes: <hi>This is that Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the World,</hi> John 1. 29. But, 4. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>

                  <hi>it self</hi> is not so obscure neither, but that upon this single Supposition, That God would <hi>bless the World with spiritual Blessings</hi> in <hi>the promised Seed;</hi> they might <hi>easily conclude,</hi> they could not be <hi>blessed in themselves;</hi> and therefore <hi>not in their own works and deservings,</hi> but <hi>in the Righteousness of another,</hi> who must be more acceptable to God than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 5. We ought to entertain <hi>charitable thoughts</hi> of God, of his Goodness and Mercy, that he would not preach to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Gospel <hi>in an unknown tongue;</hi> that is, would not give him <hi>a Promise,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>full latitude and extent</hi> of its meaning. And, 6. We are assured of the matter of fact that God did, because he had the same Gospel preached to him, <hi>That God would justifie the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then through Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 8. Now as it's a strange way of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to speak in <hi>a Language not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;</hi> so it's as strange <hi>a Gospel</hi> that knows <hi>no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; no Redeemer.</hi> Whatever then was <hi>the Object</hi> of a Gospel-Faith, was <hi>the Object</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith (for substance) and whatever did constitute <hi>a Gospel-Righteousness,</hi> made up <hi>his Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet after all this, our Author has muster'd up more self-created Prejudices, to stumble his own belief of the way of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Justification: For he supposes, that <hi>Abraham</hi> must <hi>believe</hi> many things <hi>incredible,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> many things <hi>not knowable,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could come to the knowledg of <hi>the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ's Righteousness:</hi> As, (1.) <hi>He must be well assured, that the Blessings here meant are spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> &amp;c. But if this be the worst on't, it would stumble me more to believe, how he could believe <hi>Blessedness,</hi> without <hi>pardon of sin, and eternal life.</hi> I cannot tell whether I shall satisfie another, but I

have satisfied my self in this matter, from these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: 1. That <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his believing, was <hi>justified in the sight of God;</hi> and methinks it looks like a mere whimsey, to fancy <hi>a Notion of Iustification in his sight,</hi> that has neither <hi>pardon of sin</hi> included in it, nor <hi>eternal life</hi> attending of it. It's strange to me to hear of <hi>Iustification before God</hi> against <hi>Temporal Evils:</hi> And if <hi>Abraham</hi> had no other, I think he was <hi>never perfectly justified.</hi> 2.

When I read, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>so earnest to see Christ's day by Faith,</hi> and when he got <hi>a sight of it,</hi> he was glad; I begin to think with my self, what should be the ground of so great a joy, at so great a distance. <hi>Spiritual Promise</hi> he is allowed none; and was it worth the while to rejoyce in the foresight of <hi>some temporal Advantages</hi> that should come to the Jews, when he should be turn'd to dust and nothing? especially, seeing <hi>the coming of Christ</hi> either brought <hi>spiritual Mercies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

set their wits on work, and serue, and torture, and vex, and wrest every letter and syllable, and in all this forsake the Conduct of God's Spirit, and scorn the Catholick Judgment of the Church in all Ages, to gratifie their Airy Crotchets, I do not remember a Promise of God to secure them <hi>against mistaking his Promises.</hi> Ay! but (says he) <hi>we know that the whole Iewish Church did so for many Ages.</hi> If he knows it, he knows more than I do (but that is no great wonder) and than <hi>any man alive besides his own Knowing self: And yet they had more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Promises concerning Christ than that was, and yet expected only a temporal Prince.</hi> I will deal openly with him; I do not believe, that <hi>the whole Iewish Church</hi> for <hi>any Age,</hi> much less for <hi>many Ages,</hi> no not for <hi>any one day in any Age,</hi> did expect a Messiah to deliver them <hi>only from temporal evils:</hi> That there was <hi>great degeneracy</hi> in that Church <hi>in some</hi> Ages, I deny not (there is so amongst Christians) especially towards the <hi>latter times</hi> of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: But that ever <hi>the whole Church</hi> so far degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as to lose the expectation of a Redeemer to deliver them from sin, and its consequents, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow them with spiritual Blessings, I demand better proofs than Confidence, before I subscribe. And, 1. For <hi>Abraham,</hi> it's evident he sought <hi>a heavenly Country;</hi> and therefore I conclude, That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, <hi>who had</hi> (says our Author) <hi>more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promises concerning Christ,</hi> sought <hi>a heavenly one</hi> too; or <hi>their more express Promises</hi> were ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on them, <hi>Heb. 11. 9. By Faith, he</hi> (Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) <hi>dwelt in the promised Land, as in a strange Country.</hi> The promised Land was a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to him that sought a heavenly one, whereof
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:105027:248"/>
that was but the figure, the rind and bark; for that Promise had greater excellencies underneath, to his discerning Faith; <hi>ver. 10. For he looked for a City that had foundations, whose builder and maker is God:</hi> Vers. 13. <hi>All these died in the Faith—Confessing that they were Strangers and Pilgrims; for they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Vers. 16. <hi>But now they desire a better, that it, a heavenly Country; therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.</hi> 2. It's evident, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah was promised, <hi>Isa. 53. 4. To bear their sins, and carry their sorrows.</hi> Vers. 5. <hi>To be wounded for their transgressions, and bruised for their iniquities.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>To have all their iniquities laid upon him.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>To be stricken for the transgression of God's people.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>To have his Soul made an Offering for sin:</hi> And now to assert, That <hi>the whole Iewish Church</hi> expected only <hi>a temporal Monarch,</hi> is to throw such dirt in the face of God's people, as is very scandalous. 3. If any of them at any time expected <hi>temporal Deliverances,</hi> temporal Honours, Revenues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Messiah, it was <hi>not inconsistent</hi> utterly with an expectation of <hi>better things</hi> from him; for the Disciples themselves had been hammering some such conceit in their heads, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6. (perhaps mistaking in the Chronology, and Antedating that Mercy, which in its season they might have reason to expect) and yet by our Author's good leave, I will be so charitable as to presume they looked <hi>for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, and eternal life from Christ:</hi> Nay, I could name instances nearer home of those that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>from the Gospel</hi> large in-comes, and yet we may reasonably believe, have nobler things in their eye, and would scorn his Atheistical spirit, who would

not forgo his part <hi>in Paris,</hi> for his share in <hi>Paradise.</hi> (2.) <hi>He must know, that Christ was to die for our sins, without which (according to our Doctor) it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God should forgive sins, considering the Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Vindictive Iustice to him.</hi> Now to untie this knot in the Bulrush: 1. I question not that <hi>Abraham</hi> understood clearly, That God was essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially holy, and that his <hi>Rectoral, or Governing Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> was founded therein, <hi>Gen. 18. 25. Shall not the Iudg of all the Earth do right?</hi> That it should be <hi>with the righteous, as with the wicked;</hi> or with <hi>the wicked as with the righteous,</hi> were far from God: Which Consideration might <hi>stagger his Faith</hi> about the pardon of his own sin, and his only relief could be from the Faith of the Messiah's undertaking with God: In which he had this satisfaction, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he found difficulties in the way of believing, yet still he gave <hi>credit to God,</hi> and his Testimony concerning a Redeemer, leaving <hi>the Modes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of the Mediatory Office, as a secret in God's bosom. 2. I am confident our Author can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove, that <hi>Abraham knew nothing</hi> of Christ's death. This I know, he had <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which might sufficiently instruct him in <hi>the demerit of sin,</hi> and what the <hi>sinner had deserved,</hi> and in <hi>the necessity of Compensation</hi> to be made to God's Justice, for his violated Law, and reproached Government: And whether <hi>Abraham</hi> might <hi>not once open</hi> his <hi>mouth to God,</hi> to be instructed in their noblest signification and design, I cannot tell. 3. I do not know of any <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> should understand the <hi>Circumstances</hi> that should lead towards <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Mediator's work,</hi> or in <hi>what particular way</hi> God would justifie a sinner: It was enough
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:105027:249"/>
that God had <hi>firmly revealed,</hi> that he had made <hi>sufficient provision</hi> for it by a Mediator. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed stedfastly, that <hi>the means</hi> God had chosen were <hi>proportionable to their end,</hi> and the rest was to be left to God. 4. And herein lay <hi>much of the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> that Believers were in: Under the Old-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Covenant of Grace, they had not <hi>so satisfactory an account</hi> of the <hi>particular means</hi> how the Redeemer should work out their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; <hi>which way</hi> he should accomplish the great work of Propitiation; and therefore when <hi>fresh guilt,</hi> contracted by <hi>fresh sin,</hi> lay upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their faith was staggered, and peace broken, because they had <hi>a clear Objection</hi> against their <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> from their <hi>sins;</hi> but not so <hi>clear a Solution</hi> from the promise of the pardon of it; the Promise being <hi>encumbred with so many intricacies,</hi> that the <hi>only refuge</hi> was a <hi>Retreat to the Faithfulness of God in general:</hi> Which yet was <hi>no easie work,</hi> under the Scruples and Cavils of <hi>present guilt,</hi> and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of Conscience.

                  </hi> Was it so? Then, 1. They could never know it to the World's end: For if <hi>telling,</hi> and <hi>express tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> will not make us <hi>know,</hi> there's no remedy, we must be content to be ignorant: But this is our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's humour, to reproach all the World for <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis true, had Christ's work been <hi>no other</hi> than what our Author has <hi>cut out for him,</hi> he might have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it, without <hi>an absolute sinless Perfection:</hi> A <hi>Prophet</hi> might have <hi>revealed the whole will of God,</hi> and afterwards <hi>confirmed his Doctrine by his death;</hi> but to be <hi>a Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> this required that Christ the Antitype, should <hi>be holy, harmless, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and separated from sinners:</hi> And in this God was <hi>punctual and precise,</hi> under the Law, that <hi>the Sacrifice of Atonement</hi> should be <hi>without spot, and without blemish.</hi> And thus much <hi>Abraham</hi> might learn from <hi>his own Sacrifices;</hi> and had he conceived <hi>the least suspicion,</hi> that Christ would prove <hi>a sinner,</hi> it had <hi>damped his joy and triumph</hi> in the foresight of his day. Ay! but (says he further) <hi>he must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that he fulfilled all Righteousness, not for himself, but for us. Answ.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>unknown to us,</hi> yet that he had <hi>a knowledg,</hi> is not so. If God revealed this to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, I doubt not but he believed it: That he <hi>did not,</hi> is <hi>more</hi> than our Author <hi>can prove.</hi> If he shall attempt it, his Arguments may be considered; in the mean time, his Conceits and Crotchets ought not to prejudice the Truth: But if God did not reveal it, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith might <hi>live,</hi> though not be <hi>so vigourous and strong</hi> without it. 2. <hi>Abraham</hi> might know, that what Christ suffered, he suffered <hi>not for himself,</hi> but <hi>in the stead of those</hi> for whom he suffered; for he saw the <hi>Sacrifices die,</hi> and yet <hi>not for their own sins.</hi> And why he might not conclude, That what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer did was <hi>for others too,</hi> I cannot tell. 3.

               <p n="5">[5.] And now conformable to his <hi>old awkward humour,</hi> our Author will attempt the deciding the Controversie, <hi>Which way</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified,</hi> from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.

               <p n="1">(1.) For <hi>the Act of Faith: It is</hi> (as he says) <hi>such a firm and stedfast perswasion of the truth of those things that are not evident to sense, as makes us confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hope for them.</hi> But this seems to me to be <hi>a hungry description</hi> of the Act of justifying Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Scripture has other apprehensions of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which describes the Act of faith by <hi>receiving,</hi> John 1. 12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Where, if the Evangelist may be trusted to make his own <hi>Exegesis, Receiving of Christ,</hi> and, <hi>Believing on his name,</hi> do mutually interpret each other. It's not enough that <hi>the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> be engaged in this work, which may be found in the worst of men and Devils; <hi>the Will</hi> must also conspire with <hi>the Understanding:</hi> For that which Faith is conversant about, being not only <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>good,</hi> there must be <hi>an Act of Choice,</hi> as <hi>Knowledg,</hi> that <hi>the whole man</hi> may be employed about it.</p>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:105027:253"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) Says he, <hi>The Object of Faith must be unseen things; As the Being, or Providence of God, or a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state, something past or to come, the Creation of the World, or the final Dissolution of it, or the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of any Promises or Predictions.</hi> I grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>these things</hi> may be called tropically, <hi>the Object of our Faith;</hi> but as they are things <hi>to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> they are <hi>more properly</hi> the <hi>Object of our Hope:</hi> But that which Faith <hi>primarily</hi> eyes, that which is its <hi>proper Object,</hi> is the <hi>reason of its Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:</hi> And thus <hi>God in Christ,</hi> through the Promise, is the <hi>proper Object</hi> of a justifying Faith. The mercles of the Covenant of Grace, are many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>for a future estate,</hi> when the Soul shall be <hi>better qualified</hi> to enjoy them; but Faith respects God <hi>actually giving himself</hi> in Covenant to be <hi>our God, through a Mediator:</hi> When we say, we <hi>believe Heaven,</hi> we <hi>belief Life Everlasting,</hi> &amp;c. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only this, we believe God has promised to <hi>give Heaven, to give Life Everlasting,</hi> through Jesus Christ: I believe such a thing <hi>will be;</hi> that is, <hi>I believe God,</hi> who has engaged that such a thing <hi>shall be.</hi> The <hi>Authority of God speaking in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> is the <hi>true Reason, and proper Object of Faith,</hi> and the things contained in the Promise, <hi>as they are such,</hi> are not <hi>the Object</hi> of my Faith <hi>properly,</hi> but have <hi>other powers of the Soul</hi> that are concerned about them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The different sorts of Faith</hi> (says he) <hi>result from the different Objects and Motives of it. The Apostle takes notice of two kinds of Faith in this Chapter</hi> (Hebr. 11.) <hi>and faith in Christ makes a Third, which are all the kinds of Faith the Scripture mentions.</hi> Now I am afraid I shall grow every day
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:105027:253"/>
less in love than other with our Author's Accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Divinity: For, 1. What a mad way is this, to distinguish Faith into its <hi>several kinds and sorts,</hi> from the <hi>multiplicity of the things</hi> that it believes! for at this rate he could have minted not <hi>three only,</hi> or <hi>threescore,</hi> but <hi>three hundred sorts and kinds</hi> of Faith. The <hi>different sorts, or kinds of Faith result</hi> (says he) <hi>from the different Objects and Motives of it. But</hi> (say I, in his sence) <hi>the Objects and Motives of Faith are innumerable,</hi> and therefore the <hi>sorts and kinds</hi> of Faith are innumerable also. <hi>The Object of Faith</hi> (says he) <hi>must be unseen things; The Being, or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, or a Future state, something past or to come,</hi> &amp;c. Now according to this Doctrine we must believe <hi>the Being of God</hi> with <hi>one sort</hi> of Faith, his <hi>Providences</hi> with <hi>another;</hi> the <hi>Creation of the World</hi> with <hi>one kind</hi> of Faith, its <hi>Dissolution</hi> with <hi>another; Heaven</hi> with <hi>one kind</hi> of Faith, <hi>Hell</hi> with <hi>another;</hi> things <hi>past</hi> with <hi>one kind,</hi> things <hi>to come</hi> with <hi>another;</hi> Prophesies with <hi>one kind</hi> of Faith, <hi>Promises</hi> with <hi>another:</hi> And then for <hi>the Motives</hi> of Faith, they are <hi>various;</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> of God, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, <hi>our Experience</hi> of God, the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God: So when I believe any thing, and take <hi>the Power of God</hi> able to accomplish it, for my <hi>Motive;</hi> I believe it with <hi>a Faith of another kind</hi> from that whereby I believe <hi>the same thing,</hi> and take <hi>the goodness of God</hi> for my motive: And now there's a Foundation laid for one of his <hi>plain Demonstrations,</hi> that <hi>Abraham's Faith differed</hi> toto genere <hi>from</hi> Pauls; because <hi>Abraham</hi> in believing, took his <hi>encouragement</hi> from the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of him that had promised;</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> from his <hi>Abilities to keep what he had committed unto him:</hi> So that I think I have not over-shot my self
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:105027:254"/>
in saying, That he may upon these principles, coyn <hi>as many several sorts, and distinct kinds of justifying Faith,</hi> as he can possibly spend <hi>in seven years time,</hi> and as he grows <hi>out of sorts,</hi> he may stamp <hi>as many more.</hi> 2. I am not satisfied that the Apostle mentions <hi>two,</hi> and but <hi>just two sorts</hi> of justifying Faith in this Chapter: For the Apostle mentions <hi>one and the same Faith;</hi> By Faith, <hi>we believe the Worlds were created;</hi> by Faith, <hi>Abel sacrificed;</hi> by Faith, <hi>Enoch walked with God;</hi> by Faith, <hi>the Elders obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;</hi> by Faith, <hi>Noah took Gods warning;</hi> by Faith, <hi>Sarah conceived;</hi> by Faith, <hi>Abraham offered up Isaac, &amp;c.</hi> But if <hi>these Faiths</hi> were <hi>of several sorts and kinds,</hi> the Apostle could not manage his Argument with <hi>Consistency;</hi> nor should he <hi>so insensibly</hi> have passed <hi>from one sort</hi> of Faith to <hi>another,</hi> without <hi>fair warning,</hi> that he had <hi>no plot upon his Readers imbecillity.</hi> 3. It's full as easie to make <hi>All the sorts of Faith</hi> appear in the Chapter, <hi>as two,</hi> if it had pleased the Painter: For, 1. Here's evidently the Faith of Christians, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Through Faith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi> [we Christians] <hi>that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God.</hi> 2. There's <hi>Enoch</hi>'s and <hi>Abel</hi>'s <hi>Faith,</hi> which our Author allots for a <hi>second kind</hi> of Faith. And then, 3. The Faith of <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and all the rest, and their's constitutes <hi>the third sort</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Faith. 4. Much less am I satisfied, that <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> makes <hi>a third kind</hi> of justifying Faith, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from the <hi>other two:</hi> Faith is but <hi>one;</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into which our Faith is <hi>ultimately resolved,</hi> is but <hi>one;</hi> the <hi>Mean</hi> whereby we <hi>believe in God,</hi> is but <hi>one,</hi> even Jesus Christ, <hi>by whom we believe in God:</hi> But <hi>the things,</hi> the <hi>good things</hi> propounded in the Promises are <hi>infinite:</hi> So that I doubt not when
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:105027:254"/>
any necessity shall urge him, he can reduce all these <hi>three sorts of Faith</hi> into <hi>one</hi> again by <hi>Synaeresis,</hi> or split <hi>any one</hi> of them into <hi>a couple,</hi> by a <hi>Diaeresis:</hi> But now let us look into his three sorts of Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. §. <hi>The first</hi> (says he) <hi>we may call, A natural Faith.</hi> I confess <hi>he may call</hi> things what he pleases, only let him be sure he do not <hi>miscal them;</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because he has not <hi>Adams</hi> faculty, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection into <hi>their Natures.</hi> But what is this <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faith? A belief</hi> (says he) <hi>of the Principles of natural Religion, which is founded on natural Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, and moral Arguments, as, that God is, and that heis a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> But I am still of the same mind, that there is <hi>no such</hi> thing, (nor ever was) as a Religion of sinners, whereby they can <hi>draw nigh to God, and worship him with Acceptation,</hi> but what supposes <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> as <hi>the means of Manifestation;</hi> and <hi>a Redeemer, as the medium of Reconciliation.</hi> It is owned, that this is a Principle of all Religion, that <hi>God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> But there must be <hi>somewhat more</hi> than this, namely, <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> from God, that we <hi>may diligently seek him,</hi> and a Mediator through whom we <hi>may seek him, with him, with Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But (says he) <hi>This was the Faith of</hi> Abel, <hi>and</hi> Enoch, <hi>whereby they pleased God. Answ.</hi> There was <hi>this</hi> in their Faith, but this was <hi>not the whole</hi> of their Faith: Well! he will prove it; 1. <hi>There's no mention made of the Faith of</hi> Abel, <hi>and</hi> Enoch <hi>in the Old-Testament.</hi> A worthy Argument! A non scripto negativè, in <hi>a matter of Fact!</hi> The Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament <hi>mentions it not,</hi> therefore there was <hi>no such</hi>

                  <hi>thing;</hi> this is pure trifling: For though the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament mentions not <hi>expresly</hi> their Faith, it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>their Acceptation</hi> with God, which <hi>without Faith is impossible</hi> to be obtained. And secondly, The New-Testament mentions both <hi>their Faith, and their Acceptation:</hi> Which Faith was of <hi>the same kind</hi> with the rest of those eminent Worthies mentioned with them; as is evident from that <hi>even Tenour</hi> of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the Apostle uses: By <hi>Faith</hi> Abel, by <hi>Faith</hi> Enoch, by <hi>Faith</hi> Noah, by <hi>Faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without <hi>any ground of the least suspicion</hi> that he leaps from <hi>one sort of Faith to another.</hi> 2. <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>required no more of these good men. Answ.</hi> 1. But there was something <hi>required</hi> to make them <hi>good men.</hi> 2. How can he prove, that <hi>God required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> more of these good men?</hi> God required more of <hi>Adam,</hi> even Faith, <hi>in that first Promise</hi> of a Mediator; and how <hi>Abel</hi> should lose it, or having it, not believe it, and yet be <hi>such a good man,</hi> is past my skill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. 3. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 26. That <hi>God afforded good men the frequent Apparitions of Angels:</hi> The head of whom was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> who, <hi>in praeludium futurae incarnationis,</hi> frequently <hi>appeared to the ancient Fathers:</hi> And he is not sure either what God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to them,</hi> or required <hi>of them.</hi> 4. God required more of <hi>Abel, a Sacrifice;</hi> and that not meerly as <hi>a part of his Obedience,</hi> but <hi>as Propitiatory,</hi> which by <hi>the blood and the fat,</hi> which always accompanied that kind of Sacrifices, is evident. 3. Says he, <hi>They had no other particular Revelations of God's with Answ.</hi> If they had <hi>no other,</hi> they had <hi>none at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

concerned as well as <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>concernid so deeply,</hi> I shall not question <hi>his fidelity</hi> in deriving it to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, without proof. 3. <hi>Abel</hi> had <hi>the use of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> which suppose <hi>Revelation:</hi> For <hi>what Light of Nature</hi> could teach me, that God would delight in <hi>the death of his Creatures,</hi> that had not transgressed <hi>the Laws</hi> of their <hi>Creation: Abel's</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

We are sure, that <hi>Enoch</hi> had <hi>the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prophet in his days, and therefore had <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Revelations;</hi> and amongst many, <hi>one Revelation of Christ,</hi> Jude, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.

And therefore I cannot but conclude, That he who had <hi>a particular Revelation of Christ's coming to judg the World,</hi> had <hi>particular ones also,</hi> that he should <hi>come into the World</hi> to redeem it. And now how vain must our Author's Argument needs be, from <hi>the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Old-Testament,</hi> to infer, That <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had <hi>no particular Revelation,</hi> when the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament proves, that <hi>Enoch</hi> had <hi>particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi> And if <hi>Enoch</hi> had <hi>this Revelation,</hi> which yet is not mentioned either in the Old-Testament or

That which abundantly proves, that they had <hi>particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and <hi>Revelations of Christ too,</hi> through whom <hi>God is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> is this, That their Sacrifices in God's Institution of them, and their own Application of them, from <hi>the first rise of them,</hi> had respect to Christ, who is therefore called, <hi>The Lamb slain from the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World,</hi> Rev. 13. 8.

               <p>§. 2. His <hi>second sort</hi> of justifying Faith, he calls <hi>a Faith in God:</hi> Which puts me to a stand, Whether he would have us take <hi>the former</hi> for <hi>a justifying Faith</hi> or no. If the former were <hi>not a Faith in God,</hi> how could it justifie? If it was; then how comes <hi>Faith in God,</hi> to constitute <hi>a new and distinct kind of justifying Faith?</hi> But what is this Faith in God? <hi>A belief</hi> (says he) <hi>of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Revelations, which God made to the Fathers of the Old-Testament.</hi> From whence it is easie to prove, that every time our Author repeats his Creed, <hi>I believe in God,</hi> we are bound to take him for <hi>one of the Fathers of the Old-Testament:</hi> If this be a true Definition of Faith in God, all <hi>the Saints in the New-Testament</hi> are <hi>misbelievers.</hi> But <hi>of this</hi> (says he) <hi>the Apostle gives us many examples,</hi> Noah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Abraham, Sarah, Moses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perhaps the Reader will wonder why <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> should be left out of the Catalogue of <hi>the Fathers of the Old-Testament;</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:105027:256"/>
but he must reflect, and remember, that they are rank'd already <hi>in the Classis</hi> of examples for <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faith:</hi> And truly, if he had pleased, he might have created <hi>a new sort of Faith</hi> for <hi>every Pair</hi> in the whole Chapter: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> would have done well in a Form by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; nay, to have advanced the Conceit, he might have created a <hi>particular kind of Faith,</hi> for <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person</hi> of them: Each of them had their <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelations,</hi> and <hi>particular Motives; Noah,</hi> believed <hi>the Deluge; Abraham,</hi> the <hi>promise of a Son;</hi> and <hi>David, the warning that God gave him of his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> &amp;c. Now we are told, that the <hi>object of Faith is something to come, or something past,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>the different sorts of Faith, result from the different Objects and Motives of it:</hi> and therefore it had been easie to have allotted to each of them <hi>a different kind of Faith:</hi> But let us hear him improve his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Noah</hi> (says he) <hi>believed God, when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned him of the Deluge, and in obedience to him, provided an Ark; and this was imputed to him for Righteousness: He became the Heir of Righteousness, which is by Faith:</hi> But I find no such thing in all the Copies that I have, that <hi>it was imputed to him for Righteousness.</hi> This I find, that <hi>he became Heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith:</hi> Which two <hi>things</hi> are <hi>more different</hi> than any of <hi>his three kinds of Faith. Noah</hi> was <hi>an Heir of Righteousness,</hi> that is, he inherited <hi>those advantages,</hi> which come <hi>by Righteousness;</hi> he had <hi>the peaceable fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi> As a Son by being his <hi>Fathers Heir,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the Purchases, Possessions, Honours of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus <hi>Noah</hi> by being <hi>an Heir of Righteousness,</hi> enjoyed whatever <hi>Priviledges the Promise of God</hi> had

               <p>He proceeds to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Who <hi>in obedience to the divine Revelation, left his Country, went into a strange Land, offered his son</hi> Isaac, <hi>which seem'd to thwart that former promise,</hi> In <hi>Isaac</hi> shall thy Seed be called; i. e. <hi>That from</hi> Isaac <hi>should proceed that numerous Off-spring which God had promised</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; <hi>and yet he was so well assured of the power and faithfulness of God, that whatever Impossibilities Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason suggested, he would neither disobey Gods Command, nor distrust his Promise.</hi> Now here would arise several Queries: As, 1.

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:105027:257"/>
our Author (had he been in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) ought not <hi>by his own Principles,</hi> to have <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, and distrusted God</hi> both in his Precept and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, because they did <hi>not approve themselves to his Reason.</hi> 2. It might be enquired, <hi>What inference</hi> he will make from hence? and that he tells us is, That <hi>the Faith whereby</hi> Abraham, <hi>and all good men were justified before God, was such a firm belief of the Being, and Providence of God, and all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Revelations God made to them, as made them careful to please God in all things:</hi> Now this is still the Question, and is like so to continue, for any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance we are like to have from our Author's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. But, 3. There is one thing that I shall particularly examine, Whether that Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 12. <hi>In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed be called,</hi> be made good in that <hi>numerous Off-spring that issued from</hi> Isaac'<hi>s loyns?</hi> Now if any regard might be had to the Apostle, he would soon decide the Controversie, Rom. 9. 7, 8. <hi>In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed be called,</hi> that is, <hi>they which are the children of the Flesh, are not the children of God; but the children of the Promise, are counted for the Seed.</hi> See here now the vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in mens judgments. <hi>In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed be called; id est,</hi> (says our Author) <hi>from</hi> Isaac <hi>should proceed that numerous Off-spring:</hi> No, says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed be blessed;</hi> id est, <hi>The children of the Flesh, are not the children of God; but the children of the Promise, are counted for the Seed.</hi> Again, Rom. 4. 16. <hi>Therefore it</hi> [the Promise] <hi>is of Faith, that it might be sure to all the seed; not only to that which is of the Law, but to that which is of the Faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the Father of us all.</hi> Gal. 3. 29. <hi>And if ye be Christs, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>Seed, and</hi>

                  <hi>Heirs according to the Promise.</hi> 4. It were easie to evidence, that what the Apostle speaks of <hi>Abraham's Faith in offering up his son,</hi> related not to <hi>the Act of it,</hi> whereby <hi>he was justified,</hi> but to the Evidence of his Justification. His third sort of Faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>From hence</hi> (says he) <hi>we learn what</hi> Faith in Christ is, <hi>which is now imputed to us for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> From hence! From whence? If we never learn <hi>what faith in Christ is,</hi> better than from the Faith of <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> which are <hi>the whole Heavens asunder</hi> each from other, as he has ordered the matter, we must be content to be ignorant of it till our lives end. For who could learn <hi>the special Nature</hi> of one thing, from another that differs from it <hi>in the kind?</hi> But let us give him the hearing! <hi>Our faith in Christ must signifie such a stedfast belief of all those Revelations which Christ hath made to the World, as governs our lives and actions.</hi> Why so? <hi>To make our faith in Christ, answer to the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and all good men in former Ages; without which, the Apostles Argument from</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham'<hi>s being justified by faith, to our Iustification by faith, is of no force.</hi> There is a necessity then granted, that <hi>our faith in Christ and</hi> Abraham's, <hi>do answer one another,</hi> lest the Apostle should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd with a <hi>Non-sequitur:</hi> Now to perform this, instead of making <hi>Abrahams</hi> to be <hi>a faith in Christ,</hi> as it really is, he debases <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> as <hi>low as,</hi> if not, <hi>below the faith of</hi> Abraham: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>under-prop</hi> the Apostles Argument, but really he <hi>undermines it;</hi> and whilst he seems to provide <hi>an Expedient,</hi> that his Reasonings <hi>may not</hi>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:105027:258"/>
be invalidated, he renders them more than Nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. For, 1. How can <hi>faith in Christ, answer to the faith of all those good men in former times?</hi> Abel, Enoch? when their's was Faith <hi>without Revelations,</hi> but <hi>faith in Christ</hi> is a Faith <hi>grounded upon Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The Motive</hi> of their Faith, was <hi>Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations;</hi> the <hi>Reason of ours</hi> is <hi>Revelation:</hi> The <hi>Object of our Faith</hi> (in his sense) is <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> but whether they had <hi>any such thing</hi> in their eye, our Author will not grant; for he that will not allow <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose Faith was grounded upon <hi>Revelations,</hi> to have had <hi>any spiritual Promises,</hi> will less allow those <hi>poor good men</hi> the priviledg, whose Faith was <hi>only built</hi> upon <hi>Natural Demonstrations.</hi> 2. How can <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> answer to the faith of <hi>Abraham?</hi> He has laid it down as the bottom of this Discourse, <hi>p.</hi> 252. that, <hi>The different sorts of Faith, result from the different Objects and Motives of it:</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith had <hi>different Objects and Motives</hi> from ours, (as he tells us): And therefore it's of <hi>another nature, sort and kind</hi> than ours; for so he says expresly, <hi>The Apostle takes notice of two kinds of Faith, and faith in Christ makes a third:</hi> Now will it not be hard for the Apostle to maintain his great Principle, That <hi>Abraham</hi> is <hi>the Father of the faithful,</hi> if Abraham's <hi>Faith and theirs</hi> differ <hi>toto Genere?</hi> Those things that differ in their <hi>special Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> may yet agree in their <hi>common Nature;</hi> but those things that are of <hi>divers kinds,</hi> wherein shall they agree? But all this is but a scandal thrown upon the Apostle, who proves from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s way of being justified, the way of Christians being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.

Again, vers. 13. <hi>That the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles, through Iesus Christ.</hi> If we have <hi>his blessing,</hi> surely he had <hi>our Faith:</hi> Or could <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> get the blessing <hi>without Christ;</hi> but Christians <hi>no other way,</hi> but <hi>in Christ?</hi> But thus has our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor vindicated the Apostles Reasonings, as if he had secretly design'd (as he openly professes of the Wriings of others) to expose them to contempt.</p>
               <p>It may be now seasonable to examine his Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Gospel-Faith; <hi>viz. Such a stedfast belief</hi>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:105027:259"/>
                  <hi>of all those Revelations which Christ hath made to the World, as governs our lives and actions.</hi> If this be <hi>to define,</hi> put but a company of Letters <hi>in a bag,</hi> shuffle them <hi>well together,</hi> then <hi>shake them</hi> out, and they will <hi>tumble</hi> into as good <hi>a Definition</hi> as this comes to: But thus did Atoms by dancing in Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Eternal Spaces, justle one another so long, till at last they produced this beautiful Fabrick of Heaven and Earth.

Because <hi>the whole Priestly Office of Christ</hi> is excluded by it; Propitiation, Atonement, Expiation of sin, are shut quite out of <hi>all consideration;</hi> and the <hi>Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> of Christ of no regard, unless perhaps they may come in <hi>by way of Motive,</hi> to believe his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as a Prophet. And if this be his Faith, I must profess, I would not venture my Salvation <hi>in his Church,</hi> for the hopes of <hi>all the good,</hi> or fear of <hi>all the evil</hi> this World can either flatter or affright me with; however I beg Grace from God that I may not.

I except against it, because it may be found <hi>in Hypocrites:</hi> They may so far believe the Revelations of Christ, as to govern their <hi>lives and actions,</hi> and yet their hearts never be purified by that Faith. 3. It pretends to define Faith, and yet gives us no <hi>Genus</hi> of it: <hi>Faith is such a Belief, as governs our lives and actions;</hi> that is, <hi>Faith, is Faith that governs our lives and actions:</hi> But the Question is, What is <hi>that Faith,</hi> that will so <hi>govern our lives and actions?</hi> For it describes not any <hi>direct influence</hi>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:105027:260"/>
of Faith upon <hi>our Iustification,</hi> but <hi>our obedience.</hi> And whereas he pretends to assign <hi>some differences,</hi> that may distinguish it from <hi>all other Faith,</hi> true or false; yet in plain terms they do <hi>nothing less.</hi> 1. <hi>It's a belief of those Revelations Christ has made to the World.</hi> Now unless he can prove, that <hi>those Revelations</hi> which Christ has made to the World, are <hi>essentially distinct</hi> from those which <hi>God before made to the World;</hi> their being <hi>revealed by Christ,</hi> makes <hi>no essential</hi> difference: For Christ came <hi>in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name,</hi> under the <hi>New-Testament;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> came in <hi>Christs name,</hi> under the <hi>Old-Testament.</hi> All Christ's Revelations, in order to <hi>the governing our lives and actions,</hi> may be reduced either to Precepts, or Promises: Now though some have been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering at it, I cannot find that Christ revealed either <hi>a new Moral Law,</hi> or <hi>added any thing to the old: Self-denial, Taking up the Cross, Praying for our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>Old-Testament duties,</hi> though not met with <hi>in New-Testament phrase:</hi> As a <hi>Rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> Christ medled not with it; all he did, was <hi>to vindicate it</hi> from the corrupt Glosses the Scribes and Pharisees had put upon it. As to <hi>Promises,</hi> Christ has revealed <hi>no other Heaven,</hi> no other <hi>Glory,</hi> no other <hi>Salvation;</hi> only he has <hi>cleared up these,</hi> given us <hi>more light</hi> into them, poured out <hi>more Grace,</hi> that we might live <hi>more in fellowship</hi> with God, and hopes of Glory: But <hi>this, and much more,</hi> will make <hi>no essential difference</hi> in the Revelation. 2. <hi>It's such a Belief, as governs our lives and actions:</hi> But such a Belief was <hi>Enoch's, Abel's, Noah's, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s;</hi> their's govern'd <hi>their lives and actions too,</hi> and somewhat <hi>more;</hi> their <hi>Hearts and Consciences:</hi> This therefore will make <hi>no essential difference.</hi> 4. I
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:105027:260"/>
except against it, that it mentions not <hi>God as the proper Object of Faith:</hi> For though Christ, <hi>who is God,</hi> be in the Definition, yet not <hi>as God;</hi> there's nothing supposes him to be <hi>so,</hi> no employment that necessarily requires it <hi>should be so</hi> assigned to him; only he is allowed <hi>Revelation-work,</hi> which <hi>a meer man,</hi> instructed with <hi>God's Commission,</hi> might have done.</p>
               <p>And now once again he will reassume his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>If by the Righteousness of Faith, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Righteousness of Christ apprehended by Faith, and imputed to us, you utterly destroy the Apostle's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for our Iustification by Faith; for</hi> Abraham, <hi>and all the good men of old were not justified by such a Faith as this is: They never heard of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed to us,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>how does it follow, that because</hi> Abraham <hi>was justified by such noble and generous Acts of Faith, therefore we shall be justified by Christ's Righteousness imputed?</hi> But whoever overthrows the Apostle's Argument, I have some things that will overthrow, and utterly overthrow our Author's. 1. That <hi>he begs,</hi> and most <hi>shamefully</hi> begs the Question, which I think we must be forced to grant him at last to be rid of him, without any respect to his Argument: For thus we shut our hands sometimes of those <hi>importunate Mendicants,</hi> whose strongest Logick, and most prevailing Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, is Clamour and Obstinacy: He has hardned himself to say, that Abraham <hi>was justified without any respect to the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> that he was justified <hi>by noble and generous Acts of Faith;</hi> and then concludes, That <hi>therefore so are we:</hi> And all this, to save the credit of the Apostle's Argument. But I should rather go <hi>the other way;</hi> Believers under the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:105027:261"/>
Gospel are <hi>not justified without respect to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ,</hi> therefore neither was <hi>Abraham;</hi> and let that save the credit of the Apostle's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As he cannot prove that <hi>Abraham was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God,</hi> without any <hi>consideration of Satisfaction made to him</hi> by a Redeemer, and therefore ought not to infer, that <hi>we</hi> are accepted of God <hi>without such Consideration;</hi> so we can prove that <hi>Believers under the Gospel are accepted of God, upon Consideration</hi> had of the Satisfaction made to him by a Redeemer, and therefore may infer, that Abraham <hi>was accepted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Consideration.</hi> 2. His Argument will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil upon the Engineer: For if by <hi>the Righteousness of Faith,</hi> you understand <hi>a Righteousness of our own obedience,</hi> you utterly <hi>destroy the Apostle's Argument</hi> for our Justification by Faith: for how does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>justified by Faith without Works,</hi> that therefore Believers under the Gospel are <hi>justified by Works?</hi> Again, If there be no reasoning <hi>from Faith of one kind, to Faith of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;</hi> and that the <hi>Apostle understood himself better, than to argue at this weak rate</hi> (for which we have our Author's Broad-Seal, <hi>p.</hi> 257.) And if <hi>the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and our faith in Christ,</hi> be <hi>of different kinds,</hi> and do constitute <hi>two distinct sorts of Faith,</hi> for which also we have his Word and Warrant, (<hi>p.</hi> 252.) then let every Reader try the issue, whether our Author have not <hi>utterly destroyed the Apostle's Argument,</hi> for <hi>our Iustification by faith in Christ,</hi> from Abraham's <hi>being justified by Faith;</hi> seeing he supposes him to argue <hi>from one kind of Faith to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> For at this weak rate he makes him argue; If <hi>Abraham</hi> were justified <hi>by faith without Christ,</hi> then Believers under the Gospel are justified <hi>by faith in</hi>
                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:105027:261"/>
                  <hi>Christ.</hi> All that I can conclude from this Discourse of our Authors is, That he has <hi>owned</hi> the Apostle <hi>an old grudge,</hi> and has now found a convenient time <hi>to pay him home.</hi>

               <p>He promises us now he will bring his Discourse to <hi>a head:</hi> Which I am right sorry for, hoping he had been <hi>at the foot of it:</hi> And yet I am glad it shall be reduced to <hi>a head,</hi> for hitherto it has been like <hi>the Hydra,</hi> when <hi>one head</hi> was lopt off, <hi>another,</hi> or <hi>two more</hi> sprung up in the room of it. But I mistake him: He will bring it to <hi>a head;</hi> it has been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to like an obstinate, inveterate <hi>Oedema,</hi> that scorns ordinary Applications; but now we shall see his Chirurgick faculty, he will bring the undigested Matter <hi>to a Head,</hi> and then I doubt it will issue out in purulent, offensive stuff: But <hi>the head</hi> of it is this, <hi>The difference between the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Faith of Christians is this;</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness; and we believe in Christ, and that's counted to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi> which is a difference without a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so he has made <hi>neither head nor foot of it:</hi> For <hi>Abraham believed God,</hi> but it was <hi>by the preaching of the Gospel to him,</hi> Gal. 3. 8. The Gospel-<hi>Doctrine</hi> that was <hi>preach'd</hi> was this, <hi>In thy Seed shall all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be blessed: That Seed</hi> was <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>To thy Seed, which is Christ.</hi> So that it's as plain as we can desire it, and more plain than the Enemies of the Christian Religion would have it, That Abraham <hi>was justified through Faith in Christ;</hi> and if Abraham <hi>believed in God through Christ,</hi> it's certain, that Christians <hi>do so also,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 21. <hi>Who through him do believe in God.</hi> Abraham'<hi>s</hi> belief in God, was <hi>not exclusive of Christ;</hi> our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:105027:262"/>
                  <hi>in Christ,</hi> is <hi>not exclusive of our believing in God:</hi> The Objects <hi>mediate and ultimate</hi> are the same, and then the Faith is <hi>so,</hi> if we may take our Author's word for it (which for his own Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may venture to do;) and then where's the difference? And thus the Reader has all <hi>the head and foot</hi> I can make of this tedious long-winded Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Having thus happily dispatch'd the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Abraham's <hi>faith, and the faith of Christians,</hi> he promises to give us <hi>the difference</hi> between two or three other things, or between something and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for to acknowledg my ignorance, I cannot tell what. I turn'd to the <hi>Errata,</hi> and there we are bid to read—<hi>Nonsense.</hi> I was in good hopes that had been it; but <hi>the difference of the pages</hi> soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived me. I shall therefore give the Reader it, as cheap as I had it, in his own words, and that's good both for Buyer and Seller: <hi>And the same dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between the Righteousness of Faith in a general Notion, as it is applied to</hi> Noah, Abraham, <hi>and these Worthies of old, and the Righteousness of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>d by the Faith of Iesus Christ</hi> Rom. 3. 22. <hi>and that Righteousness which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9. Now I have guest, and guest and almost tired my self with guessing, what <hi>those things</hi> should be betwen which he pretends <hi>the difference:</hi> One while it seems to be, <hi>Between the Righteousness of Faith in a general Notion, as it is applied to</hi> Noah, Abraham, <hi>and those Worthies of old,</hi> on the one party; and, <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God by the Faith of Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. on the other party: Another while it seems to be, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteousness of Faith in the general Notion,</hi>
                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:105027:262"/>
on one side; and, <hi>the Righteousness of God by the Faith of Iesus Christ,</hi> on the second; and, <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness of God by Faith,</hi> on the third; and so the difference will be <hi>tripartite:</hi> Whatever the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is, I shall not trouble my self about it. Of <hi>two Righteousnesses</hi> I have heard; the <hi>one of Faith,</hi> the <hi>other of Works,</hi> according to the <hi>two Covenants</hi> from thence denominated; which do irreconcileably differ, and are as far asunder as the two Poles, which can never meet: Of <hi>two Righteousnesses of Faith</hi> I have not heard till of late; and a happy invention it was for them, whose faith or unbelief would not stoop to Gospel-Revelations. But that we may not let our time run waste, I shall a little consider <hi>one of his Scriptures,</hi> and wait with patience, till he shall consider <hi>the other:</hi> That which I fix upon, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for by the Law is the knowledg of sin: But now the Righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law, and the Prophets, even the Righteousness of God which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</hi> In which words; (1.) I take notice of the Apostles peremptory Conclusion, <hi>By the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in his</hi> [<hi>Gods</hi>] <hi>sight.</hi> Now as this Proposition smiles or frowns upon our Author, or his Opponent, so will the whole cause <hi>stand or fall on either side.</hi> It seems indeed to carry <hi>a smart sound of words</hi> against his Notions; but he is well enough provided against
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:105027:263"/>
all Arguments drawn <hi>from express words;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must enquire, <hi>What that Law is,</hi> by the <hi>deeds whereof</hi> no flesh can be <hi>justified:</hi> If it proves <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> our Author will not deny that he's at least <hi>half undone;</hi> and I find him feelingly aware of that all along. Now to dally no longer with him, nor to put him to a lingring death: The Apostle (who knew his own mind best) has assured me, that by [Law,] he understands <hi>the Moral Law.</hi> 1. It's <hi>that Law</hi> by which we have <hi>the knowledg of sin.</hi> His Argument runs thus: By the deeds of <hi>that Law</hi> by which comes <hi>the knowledg of sin,</hi> no flesh is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: But by <hi>the Moral Law</hi> comes the knowledg of sin; therefore by <hi>the deeds of the Moral Law</hi> no flesh is justified. The <hi>major</hi> is the Apostle's own, in this very place: The <hi>minor</hi> is his own too, <hi>Rom. 7. 13. I had not known sin, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</hi> From whence I argue: By that Law which says, <hi>Thou shalt not covet,</hi> comes <hi>the knowledg of sin:</hi> but that Law which says, <hi>Thou shalt not covet,</hi> is the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> therefore by <hi>the Moral Law comes the knowledg of sin.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is the Apostle's own in the place last quoted; the <hi>minor</hi> needs no other proof, but that a man be able to read <hi>the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> which is the sum of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> the Tenth whereof is, <hi>Thou shalt not covet.</hi> But now at what a weak rate must the Apostle argue to please our Author? By the deeds of <hi>the Ceremonial Law</hi> shall no flesh be justified. No: Why not? Why, because by <hi>the Moral Law</hi> is the knowledg of sin. 2. None can doubt of <hi>what Law</hi> the Apostle speaks, that considers how he <hi>draws this great Conclusion</hi> out of vers. 19. <hi>That every mouth may be stopped, and all the World become guilty before God, therefore</hi>
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:105027:263"/>
                  <hi>by the deeds of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. His Argument is this; By the deeds of <hi>that Law</hi> by which <hi>every mouth is stopped, and all the World become guilty before God,</hi> shall no flesh be justified: But <hi>by the Moral</hi> every <hi>mouth is stopped, and all the World become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God;</hi> therefore by <hi>the deeds of the Moral Law</hi> shall no flesh be justified. And this evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>the Ceremonial Law</hi> from any <hi>Concern in this Argument:</hi> For <hi>that Law</hi> never obliged <hi>all, or half the World,</hi> and therefore they could <hi>not violate it,</hi> and therefore not <hi>become guilty by it</hi> before God. Again, <hi>the instances</hi> which the Apostle gives of <hi>the violation of the Law,</hi> shews <hi>what Law</hi> he excludes from Justification, <hi>vers. 13. With their Tongues they have used deceit.</hi> Vers. 14. <hi>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</hi> Vers. 15. <hi>Their feet are swift to shed blood,</hi> &amp;c. which are all apparent violations <hi>of the Moral Law.</hi> But is there never a Creep-hole at which our Author may escape the Apostles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? Yes! yes! <hi>p.</hi> 245. <hi>The great dispute in the Epistle to the</hi> Romans <hi>is, Whether we must be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>or by the Faith of Christ? that is, Whether the Observation of the External Rites, and Ceremonies of the Law, and an External Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our Actions to the Moral Precepts of it will justifie a man before God?</hi> &amp;c. This sorry evasion has all its small pretence, from that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>from the deeds;</hi> which our Author would willingly perswade himself, signifie nothing but <hi>Observation of Ceremonies, and outward Conformity to the Moral Law.</hi> Now that the Apostle in this place directly excludes the Moral Law I have proved: All the Question is, Whether he disputes against Justification <hi>by external Conformity to its Precepts only;</hi> or against Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:105027:264"/>
by <hi>whatever Obedience</hi> is, or may be given to the Moral Law by man, under his present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances? And against our Author's conceit herein, I oppose these things: 1. It appears not that ever there was <hi>such a Question</hi> started amongst any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <hi>Whether Hypocrisie would justifie a man before God?</hi> much less was it ever laid down in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and <hi>Dogmatically</hi> maintained that it would <hi>do so.</hi> Many Hypocrites there were then, (there are so now) who may deceive themselves into a Fools <hi>Paradise,</hi> that Hypocrisie might <hi>not condemn and damn them;</hi> but none ever so forsaken of common sense, as to think that Hypocrisie would <hi>justifie, and save them:</hi> Many presume to be saved, <hi>notwithstanding their sins,</hi> but none to be saved <hi>for their sins:</hi> If any should so dote, they deserve to receive their Confutation <hi>from Bedlam,</hi> rather than the <hi>Divinity-Schools.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore once imagine, that the Apostle should <hi>so operosely</hi> handle a subject; that he should <hi>rowse up his zeal,</hi> and knit <hi>all the nerves of his spiritual Reason,</hi> to confute what was either <hi>no-where,</hi> or so <hi>thin, and transparent</hi> a falshood, that to <hi>recite it,</hi> was clearly <hi>to confute it.</hi> 2. <hi>The Deeds or Works</hi> of the Law, are the Deeds and Works which <hi>the Law commands,</hi> which it <hi>primarily commands;</hi> but the Law never commanded <hi>outward Conformity</hi> of actions, without <hi>inward Conformity</hi> of heart to its Precepts: These are not <hi>the Deeds of the Law,</hi> but such as God abhors; therefore the Deeds of <hi>the Law by which no flesh shall be justified,</hi> are not external works only. 3. The <hi>Deeds of the Law,</hi> by which <hi>no flesh shall be justified,</hi> are the Deeds of <hi>every one of God's Laws,</hi> the Deeds <hi>of every particular Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but the Deeds of <hi>one of God's Laws,</hi> of <hi>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>particular Commandment,</hi> are <hi>only internal Deeds;</hi> therefore the Apostle disputes <hi>not only</hi> against exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deeds. By <hi>the Law,</hi> is meant the <hi>whole Law;</hi> but one part of the Law (extensively taken) reaches <hi>internal deeds</hi> only: As is evident in the Tenth Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not covet;</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Author's way, the Apostle should have laid down his Doctrine thus, <hi>By the deeds of nine parts of the Law,</hi> shall no flesh living be justified. 4. The Apostle disputes against Justification <hi>by such deeds</hi> of the Moral Law, as wherein <hi>all the World is become guilty:</hi> But by <hi>the external deeds</hi> of the Law all the World is <hi>not become guilty;</hi> therefore he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes not against Justification <hi>by the external deeds of the Law only.</hi> That all the World is <hi>not become guilty</hi> by the external deeds of the Moral Law, and a failure therein, he proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. where he shews, <hi>That death reigned over some, who had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the similitude of</hi> Adam'<hi>s transgression.</hi> 5. Those deeds which David <hi>excluded from his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> the Apostle <hi>excludes from our Iustification;</hi> for he quotes his Proposition from <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 2. and therefore takes it <hi>in his sense,</hi> or else he could not <hi>make use of his Authority:</hi> But <hi>David</hi> excludes <hi>all his deeds whatsoever</hi> from Justification; <hi>Enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man be justified:</hi> He durst not once think of God's entering into judgment with him, upon the account of <hi>any thing</hi> he had attained: From all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Apostle excl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We may observe hence, That the Apostle opposes <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi>

well as external deeds] <hi>is manifested:</hi> But this is not to interpret the Apostle, but dictate <hi>a new Gospel to him.</hi> But further: Hence I have just occasion to complain of an unrighteous surmise, with which our Author loads <hi>some men,</hi> That because they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Law-deeds</hi> from <hi>Iustification in the sight of God,</hi> that therefore they exclude it <hi>from having any place in their Lives and Conversations.</hi> The Apostle, who is <hi>a zealous Vindicator</hi> of the interest of the Law, as <hi>a Rule of our Obedience;</hi> yet we see <hi>discharges it wholly</hi> from <hi>any,</hi> from <hi>all use,</hi> and <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> in the Justification of a sinner in the sight of God: Therefore he adds, <hi>Before God;</hi> and the Psalmist, <hi>In thy sight;</hi> to teach us, That though <hi>the Righteousness of God without Law, is manifested,</hi> as to <hi>the truth of the thing,</hi> yet <hi>the Righteousness of God</hi> is not, cannot be manifested to us, without <hi>a sincere obedience to the Law.</hi> There's <hi>a Iustification before God;</hi> to this <hi>the Law, a Law, any Law,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <hi>nothing;</hi> but there's a Justification <hi>before Conscience,</hi> before <hi>men,</hi> and to this a sincere, and <hi>evangelically universal</hi> obedience <hi>contributes much.</hi> (3.) The Apostle assures us, That this Doctrine of his is <hi>no new fancy,</hi> broached t'other day, and set on foot lately in Gospel-times, but the same way by which all <hi>the good men of old</hi> were justified, <hi>v.</hi> 21.

                  <hi>And in thy Seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed; unto you first, God having raised up his Son Iesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>God's raising up Christ in the World, to bless his people with spiritual blessings,</hi> was no more than what he had covenanted with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to him, even in that very Promise which our Author thinks was fulfilled <hi>in the numerous Posterity of</hi> Isaac: But now that this Righteousness of God <hi>without Law,</hi> should be <hi>witnessed by Law,</hi> this seems strange: Does <hi>the Law</hi> witness against <hi>it self?</hi> Is it false to <hi>it's own interest?</hi> But the Law, is <hi>God's Law;</hi> and when it witnesses to a sinner, it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses home; convinces him of <hi>the perfect holiness</hi> of that God who gave the Law; of the perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of God, in <hi>not abating one jot, or tittle of the Law;</hi> of the sinners utter inability to come up to the Demands <hi>of the Law,</hi> and therefore the utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of being justified <hi>by the Law;</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God's Justice in punishing the violater <hi>of his Law,</hi> and therefore unless he can find <hi>another Righteousness,</hi> he must <hi>utterly perish.</hi> 'Tis true, the Law speaks its old Language still, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> but then it speaks it <hi>only to those</hi> who are upon <hi>a bottom of Innocency;</hi> for to <hi>a Transgressor</hi> its language is, <hi>Cursed is very one that continues not in all things.</hi> (4.)

such is <hi>the Faith:</hi> as is <hi>the Faith,</hi> such is <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> which perfectly overthrows that <hi>Arbitrary distinction,</hi> which our Author had studied for more need; <hi>Of Faith in God,</hi> and <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to shut <hi>Abraham out of Christ,</hi> and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>out of Heaven,</hi> and to lock him up in the <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(5.) The Apostle concludes, <hi>That there's no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> (in point of Justification) all that are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>by the First,</hi> must be justified (if ever they be justified) by <hi>the Second</hi> Adam: v. 22. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God which is by Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all, and upon all that believe; for there's no difference, for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.</hi> As all men that <hi>ever were, are, or shall be, are sinners, under Condemnation;</hi> so all that <hi>ever were, are, or shall be righteous</hi> in the sight of God, are so by <hi>that righteousness which is by Faith of Iesus.</hi> So that every pardoned, accepted, justified sinner must own, that he is <hi>justified freely by the Grace of God, through the Redemption that is in Christ.</hi>

               <p>From these and such-like Scriptures, it is, that Christians ascribe <hi>their Iustification before God,</hi> not to <hi>their own good Works,</hi> but to <hi>the Free Grace of God through Iesus Christ:</hi> but our Author has a way of proving his Sentiments worth a thousand of these. <hi>Could men</hi> (says he) <hi>be reconciled to plain sence, it would need no other Confirmation, but the Natural evidence of naked and simple Truth.</hi> It has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served of the great <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (from whom our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has borrowed some things) that he never comes in with a [<hi>Procui dubio</hi>] but the next words are a <hi>Rapper:</hi> the same I observe in our Author, that when he has done <hi>just nothing,</hi> he always makes
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:105027:267"/>
                  <hi>the loudest cackle.</hi> It was a handsom Come-of if you did but mind it; that when he had pester'd us with <hi>his prejudices,</hi> surfeited us with <hi>Arbitrary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,</hi> filled our heads with <hi>empty Notions,</hi> and when we looked to have been attack'd with one of his <hi>old, plain, kill-cow demonstrations,</hi> he faces about, and pops us off with this: <hi>It needs no other proof than the Natural evidence of simple and naked Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now let the Reader take something warm next his heart, let him use his <hi>phial of Essences,</hi> for our Author is just now a-coming <hi>to examine those Texts of Scripture which are abused by these men, to set up the personal Righteousness of Christ, as the only formal Cause of our justification:</hi> And must not those Texts of Scripture be <hi>miserably abused</hi> indeed, that are thus prest in for such a service? What, <hi>the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness of Christ</hi> the formal Cause <hi>of our justification?</hi> I have heard some say it was <hi>the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Cause,</hi> some <hi>the Impulsive Cause,</hi> others <hi>the Material Cause,</hi> and some that it is <hi>no Cause;</hi> but our Author is the first that ever I heard this expression from. There was once a good Orthodox Bishop, (as Orthodoxy past in that Age) his Name <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he has Written many a long page upon this Subject, and he acquaints us with the sence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:105027:267"/>
better where to marshal it. In examining the Texts which <hi>they abuse,</hi> he will begin and end with <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>Yea doubtless, and I account all things loss for the excellency of the Knowledg of Iesus Christ my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things that I may win Christ, and be found in him not having my own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</hi> The main Question here will be, What was <hi>that Righteousness</hi> which the Apostle <hi>renounces,</hi> from having <hi>any place</hi> in his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>before God?</hi> Upon this <hi>one hinge</hi> turns all the Controversie betwixt our Author and his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists. They say it was, <hi>what-ever inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness he had attained or could attain, what-ever Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience he had performed, or could perform to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God.</hi> Ay but (says our Author) <hi>what proof have they for this?</hi> he <hi>can learn none, but that they take it for granted,</hi> that <hi>My Righteousness</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Inherent Righteousness.</hi> And really they are to be <hi>pittied</hi> if not <hi>pardoned,</hi> that by <hi>His own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, understand his own Righteousness;</hi> for if <hi>Inherent Righteousness,</hi> be not <hi>His own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> it's plain he could have <hi>none at all;</hi> for <hi>an External Conformity of Actions to the Law alone is not Righteousness at all,</hi> but <hi>Hypocrisie, and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness:</hi> but I shall inform him of some other proofs why they take <hi>His own Righteousness</hi> for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness.</hi> 1. That which he calls his own Righteousness <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he tells you in the next words, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that which is from <hi>Law,</hi> from <hi>a Law,</hi> from <hi>any Law</hi> indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: now a Righteousness which is from <hi>a Law</hi> is such a one as <hi>the Law urges, presses upon</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes</hi>
                  <pb n="548" facs="tcp:105027:268"/>
                  <hi>to the Conscience;</hi> but that without question is <hi>an Internal Conformity</hi> of soul to the holiness of the Law; but <hi>this</hi> the Apostle rejects, therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>Internal and Inherent Righteousness.</hi> 2. The true Notion of <hi>My Righteousness</hi> is not to be fetcht from <hi>some sorry Conjectures,</hi> from <hi>precarious Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which men (when they are in streights) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to avoid present ruine, but from the stable fixed constant use thereof in Scripture; but so is this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression [My own Righteousness] and [My own, or your own Works] used in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>real sineere Conformity of heart and life to a Law,</hi> therefore <hi>so</hi> ought we to take it <hi>here,</hi> till we see co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reason to the contrary. That this is <hi>the fixed use</hi> of the expression in Scripture we shall see, <hi>Gen. 30. 33. My Righteousness shall answer for me in time to come;</hi> which our Author would paraphrase thus, <hi>My Righteousness,</hi> that is, <hi>My Roguery, Iob</hi> 27. 6. <hi>My Righteousness I hold fast, my heart shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me as long as I live. My Righteousness,</hi> that is, (would he say) <hi>My Hypocrisie,</hi> Matth. 5. 16. <hi>That men may see your good works,</hi> that is, in the New Glossary, <hi>Your Complement.</hi> Dan. 9. 18. <hi>we present not our supplications before thee not for our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but for thy great Mercies.</hi> The Prophet in the Name of the Church must be supposed here not to renounce <hi>real Righteousness,</hi> but the <hi>Sceleton of Obedience:</hi> Now had the Apostle designed only to reject his <hi>own Hypocrisie,</hi> he was not <hi>so barren in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> but he could have fitted it with its <hi>Proper Name.</hi> 3. The Apostle expresly renounces both what-ever he had attained <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>These things that were gain to me,</hi> (whilst I was a Pharisee) <hi>those I accounted</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>loss</hi>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:105027:268"/>
                  <hi>for Christ:</hi> But is that all? No! <hi>Yea doubtless</hi> (v. 8.) <hi>and I do</hi> (now) <hi>account</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>all things but loss: I have accounted</hi> all things <hi>attained in my Iudaism</hi> loss, when I was <hi>first convinced:</hi> and I <hi>do now account all things</hi> even <hi>my own Righteousness</hi> loss, and dung for Christ: and therefore it is to be noted that the Apostle rises higher in his earnestness, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Yea doubtless;</hi> q. d. <hi>Did I say that I once looked upon all as loss for Christ. I will speak a bolder word than that, I count all but loss, dung, filth, that I may win Christ, and be found in him not having my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:</hi> and that he speaks of that esteem and value he had of <hi>his present Righteousness,</hi> is yet further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this, that it was in reference to <hi>a future day,</hi> the <hi>day of Iudgment,</hi> that he might be found in Christ, <hi>in that day,</hi> not sticking to his own Righteousness. Two things our Author returns to this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It's a sufficient Answer to say they need not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie so.</hi> I confess <hi>for want of a better</hi> the Answer may pass: A <hi>bad</hi> shift is better than <hi>None,</hi> and <hi>half a loaf is better than No-bread:</hi> but if a Man <hi>had a better,</hi> it was <hi>the sorriest</hi> Answer in the World. I see when men are prest with express Scripture, and yet are resolved (cost what will) to adhere <hi>to their own Conclusions,</hi> it's adviseable to cast about, to turn their thoughts into all shapes imaginable, to hunt for the extremest possibilities: If a Word, a Phrase, an Expression is but capable of another sence, let it be probable, or improbable, true or false, agreeable to the scope of the place or alien, all is a case, something must be said, that they may not seem to say Nothing; And if they can say <hi>it's possible it may be otherwise</hi> (as who cannot) though
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:105027:269"/>
they do not believe themselves, they hug them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their ready wit, and applaud themselves for grave Respondents. A little matter will blow away this dust: Let them show where ever, <hi>My Righteousness,</hi> is otherwise used, and then let them boast of a bare possibility. 2. <hi>My own Righteousness</hi> (says he) <hi>can signifie no more than that wherein he placed his Righteousness.</hi> I beg his pardon for that. It signifies <hi>more</hi> than that wherein he <hi>placed his Righteousness</hi> whil'st a Pharisee; and <hi>a great deal less</hi> than that, wherein he placed Righteousness <hi>after Conversion,</hi> in order to Justification. But if the Apostle renounced what-ever <hi>he placed his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in,</hi> then, either he placed it <hi>in Inherent Righteousness,</hi> or not; If not, then how dares our Author place his Righteousness there, where the Apostle durst not? If he did ever place his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in it; then here he openly declares before the World that he Renounces it: <hi>But</hi> (says our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>what necessity is there to understand this of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holiness?</hi> We have shewed you the Necessity before, and shall do hereafter. <hi>An External Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness serves most mens turns very well:</hi> not so well neither as he may Imagine. <hi>And this is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by which the Pharisees (and amongst the rest St.</hi> Paul <hi>whilst he was a Pharisee) expected to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> but stay a while. 1. We have proved that the Apostle not only renounced <hi>that Righteousness what-ever it was that he had whilst a Pharisee;</hi> but that which was <hi>his own</hi> at the time when he made that solemn Renunciation of it: what-ever he had attained, or might possibly attain, all went that he might be found in Christ in the great Day. 2. The Pharisees were generally bad enough in all Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:105027:269"/>
and he need not make them worse. It's a sin we say to bely the Devil; It doth not appear that the Pharisees expected to be Justified before God, by an external obedience only without sincerity: It was not their Principle, though Hypocrisie (as to many Individuals) might be their Practice. The Case is frequent before our Eyes, a Drunkard, a common Swearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will tell you they Hope to be saved, <hi>though they are wicked;</hi> but none durst ever assume the Impudence to expect Salvation <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was wicked:</hi> No, he will repent when he can intend it, and trust to the general grace of God, and some such reserves, which our Modern-Pulpit-Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery has furnisht him withal. 3. As to <hi>Paul</hi> whilst he was a Pharisee (if we take his own word for it when he was none) he was <hi>no Hypocrite,</hi> he every-where vindicates himself as to that: His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting was his great Crime, in which he protests his sincerity, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 9. <hi>I verily thought with my self that I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Iesus:</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. he avows he did it <hi>ignorantly:</hi> He durst appeal to his very Enemies how he had lived from a Child, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 4. <hi>My manner of life from my youth know all the Iews if they would testifie:</hi> and makes a solemn Protestation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sanhedrin, Act.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>That he had lived in all good Conscience to that very day:</hi> That others of the Pharisees, were Sober, Conscientious men, I do not at all question; and the discourse of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mr. <hi>Gamaliel, Act.</hi> 5. shows that he had a great deal more Religion in him than most of those who to carry on a design rail at them for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
               <p>Ay, but (says our Author) <hi>what his Righteousness</hi>
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:105027:270"/>
                  <hi>was he tells us,</hi> V. 6, 7. <hi>Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c. So that</hi> My own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is of the Law, <hi>is so far from signifying an inherent Righteousness, a vital principle of Holiness, that it only signifies an external Righteousness, which consisted in some external Rites, as Circumcision, and Sacrifices, or external Priviledges, as being of the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>or an external Civility and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness of Conversation.</hi> This proceeds upon a double false supposition; 1. That the Apostle <hi>renounces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he had attained whilst he was a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.</hi> 2. That whatsoever <hi>he had renounced,</hi> V. 6, 7. did constitute <hi>his Pharisaical Righteousness:</hi> For, 1. I must cut him off <hi>Circumcision;</hi> that was no part of his <hi>own Righteousness,</hi> a priviledge it was; but nothing performed <hi>by him,</hi> and therefore could not expect Justification by it: unless our Author will grant that he had <hi>a spice of the Doctrine of imputing the Obedience of Another to him for Iustification.</hi> 2. For <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the Apostle mentions them not, renounces them not; for he understood too well <hi>their use and proper End in the Iewish Church;</hi> that they were their visible Gospel, and did lead to Christ (whom now he owned) though then he was ignorant of him. The <hi>Conscientious and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving use of Sacrifices</hi> might put in for a place in Justifying the Sinner, with better right, than such Obedience to the Moral Law as man was able in his present state to perfom. 1. Consider them as <hi>mere acts of Obedience,</hi> wherein <hi>the thing done</hi> is not so <hi>considerable,</hi> as <hi>the subjection of the Conscience</hi> to the <hi>Authority of God the Soveraign Law-giver:</hi> which in this Case is most signal, for here is only <hi>the will and pleasure</hi> of God for the Reason of that <hi>costly,</hi> and
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:105027:270"/>
                  <hi>operose seruice;</hi> whereas <hi>Moral duties</hi> are vouched for, by the suffrage of <hi>the Light, and Reason of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 2. Consider them <hi>as instituted</hi> for their <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar end,</hi> the leading and conducting of <hi>Faith to Christ;</hi> and so they <hi>far exceed and outstrip</hi> any thing the Moral Law (being become weak through the flesh) could assist the sinner in; for so they are said, actually to procure <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> actually to <hi>make Atonement</hi> and <hi>reconciliation,</hi> Lev. 17. 11. <hi>I have given you it</hi> [the blood] <hi>upon the Altar to make an Atonement for your souls, for it is the Blood that maketh an Atonement for the soul,</hi> 2 Chron. 29. 24. <hi>The Priests killed them</hi> [the Sacrifices] <hi>and they made reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with their Blood upon the Altar, to make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for All</hi> Israel. Now let him shew me, where ever <hi>Atonement, Reconciliation,</hi> are annext to the <hi>Actual performance of the Moral Law.</hi> It is true that the <hi>Original design of the Moral Law</hi> was Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but not the Justification <hi>of a Sinner;</hi> but Man being now become <hi>such,</hi> the Law is utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reaching it's <hi>Primitive end:</hi> and it's as true also that Sacrifices upon <hi>their own Account</hi> could not supply that defect, but as <hi>directing the sinner</hi> to him who is the grand Propitiation, and from whose Death they received all their virtue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 3. As to his being of <hi>the Stock of</hi> Israel, <hi>of the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they might expect <hi>some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> thence, but that any was so far bewitched as to believe that <hi>all of the Stock of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>should be justified,</hi> cannot be proved. 4. For <hi>external Civility, and blamelessness of Conversation:</hi> It would have gone a great way in our Authors account at <hi>any other time;</hi> pag. 384. he asks the question with some heat and briskness,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:105027:271"/>
                  <hi>what? live a blameless, innocent, honest, smooth life, and yet live in some sin or other? Paul</hi> would have past for <hi>a Righteous person</hi> upon his producing the Ticket of <hi>a blameless Conversation</hi> in that <hi>Section,</hi> though <hi>in this</hi> he is rated at for <hi>a Hypocrite,</hi> and all <hi>that's naught:</hi> but what-ever <hi>Paul was,</hi> or <hi>was not whilst a Pharisee,</hi> it makes <hi>no great matter</hi> to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand, seeing he has so freely and openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, <hi>what-ever was his own Righteousness after Conversion,</hi> in the matter of Justification before God.</p>

                  <hi>the Faith of Christ</hi> (even) <hi>the Righteousness of God by Faith.</hi> Now if any man would <hi>needs have a double Antithesis</hi> to do him some special service, it should have been laid between <hi>my own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and that which is <hi>by the Faith of Christ;</hi> and then between, <hi>That of the Law,</hi> and <hi>the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God by Faith: but on the contrary our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor without <hi>any provocation,</hi> without <hi>any umbrage</hi> of a pretence from the Text (like old <hi>Iacob</hi> crossing his hands) has laid them <hi>in saltire; My own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> to <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> and the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law,</hi> to <hi>the Righteousness by the Faith of Christ.</hi> 2. Supposing all that he can desire, how does this double Antithesis confirm that which he contrived it to confirm, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>my own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> signifies <hi>an external Righteousness only?</hi> It has been an old saying, that <hi>one absurdity being granted many more will easily follow.</hi> And yet so hard is this Gentleman put to it, that granting him <hi>a many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,</hi> he cannot make <hi>one</hi> follow: but yet the Reader shall hear what he would serve out of <hi>this double Antithesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>The Righteousness of the Law (as you have already heard) is an external Righteousness, which consists in Washings, Purifications, Sacrifices, or an external conformity to the Moral Law:</hi> So we have <hi>beard</hi> indeed once and again <hi>affirmed,</hi> but never <hi>confirmed:</hi> The double Antithesis was brought to confirm <hi>it,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> must confirm the double Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis. I desire therefore once for all to hear where <hi>the Righteousness of Law,</hi> the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> is said to consist in <hi>Externals:</hi> The <hi>Righteousness of the Law</hi> is that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which <hi>the Law requireth;</hi> but <hi>the Law requires</hi> an internal Conformity of heart to
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:105027:272"/>
our outward Actions, and of both to the Law of God; therefore the Righteousness of the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists also in an internal Conformity. The Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns none that bring <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> but the Law condemns those that bring <hi>only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Conformity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> therefore <hi>external Conformity</hi> is not <hi>the Righteousness of the Law:</hi> and from hence we may be abundantly satisfied what was <hi>that Righteousness of his own,</hi> which the Apostle renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That which was <hi>his own Righteousness,</hi> that he <hi>renounces;</hi> but <hi>an internal inherent Righteousness</hi> was his <hi>own Righteousness,</hi> therefore <hi>that</hi> he renounces. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove, <hi>The Righteousness of the Law</hi> was <hi>his own Righteousness (Not having my own Righteousness that is of the Law)</hi> but <hi>the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law</hi> was <hi>an inherent internal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> therefore his <hi>own Righteousness</hi> was <hi>an inherent,</hi> and <hi>internal Righteousness.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove, That which the Law <hi>prescribes,</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> is <hi>the Righteousness of the Law;</hi> but that which the Law prescribes and commands, is <hi>an internal and inherent Righteousness,</hi> and therefore the Righteousness of the Law is such a Righteousness. That which God requires, his Law requires; but God requires <hi>Truth in the inward parts,</hi> whether in Ceremonials or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; therefore the Law requires the same: And is it not now an unparalleld piece of Non-sence to call that <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> which both <hi>the Law and the Author of it</hi> do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hor? External Conformity alone, is so far from being <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law,</hi> that it's <hi>the Unrighteousness of the Law:</hi> But hence the Reader will begin to get a glimmering into the true Reason that necessitated our Author to study this device of a double Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:105027:273"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Paul's Righteousness which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,</hi> might not seem to be <hi>the Righteousness of the Law</hi> which God required (though not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Justification;) for if <hi>his own</hi> Righteousness be the Righteousness <hi>of the Law,</hi> and he so peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily renounces <hi>his own,</hi> then he renounces <hi>the Righteousness of the Law also;</hi> and what that is, this one Consideration is enough to convince us of: That <hi>the Law requires an absolute, perfect, entire Conformity of the whole Man to it's demands, and claimes, without which no man can expect to be Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it.</hi> And seeing such is the Case with poor impotent Man, that he cannot answer it's demands and claims, he can never reasonably expect it should do him that service: but now see the frailty of our Authors memory, for just above he told us, <hi>the surest way to understand the meaning of this, was to consider how these Phrases are used in Scripture;</hi> and yet when he undertakes to give us <hi>the true meaning</hi> of this Phrase (<hi>The Righteousness of the Law</hi>) he cannot afford to give us <hi>one single</hi> Scripture to lead us into <hi>the true meaning of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>The Righteousness by the Faith of Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is an internal Righteousness:</hi> Oh but that should have been <hi>proved, soundly proved,</hi> not <hi>begg'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But still <hi>proof! proof</hi> is wanting! for we think that those expressions do not denote <hi>that Righteousness</hi> whereby we are <hi>constituted Iust,</hi> in the sight of God; but Holiness, and Sanctification of Nature,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:105027:273"/>
which the Gospel evidently <hi>distinguishes</hi> from <hi>that Righteousness whereby we are Iustified;</hi> but let him have line enough. Hence (says he) <hi>The Apostle tells us, that the Reason why God sent Christ into the World in our Nature, to die as a Sacrifice for our sins, and to confirm the Covenant; was, that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law might be fulfilled in us</hi> (N. B.) <hi>who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.</hi> Well! what is that Righteousness of the Law Christ came to fulfil? why (says he) Learnedly from <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi>

If <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> be <hi>inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and purity of mind;</hi> then St. <hi>Paul</hi> who rejects <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> in the matter of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God; <hi>rejects also</hi> inward purity and
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:105027:274"/>
holiness of mind for that purpose: but whether we are to believe, <hi>pag.</hi> 264. or <hi>pag.</hi> 265. <hi>as the honester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the two,</hi> I cannot tell, nor am much concern'd at present. 3. If it be true, that <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> be that <hi>inward purity of mind</hi> which the Law was design'd to work in us, then what is become of that <hi>Antithesis</hi> which he coyned between <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> and <hi>the Righteousness by the Faith of Christ?</hi> I am very serious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be resolved; for he tells us here, that <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>the inward holiness and purity of mind;</hi> and then tells us immediatly after, that <hi>the design of the Gospel is to work that inward holiness and purity:</hi> Now why St. <hi>Paul</hi> should renounce <hi>inward holiness</hi> (which was the Righteousness of the Law) to attain <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purity</hi> (which is the Righteousness of the Gospel) is to me a Mystery as deep as any of those I have met withal in your Systematical Divines.

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>u see</hi> (says he) <hi>how the Apostle opposes</hi> the Righteousness <hi>of the Law,</hi> and the Righteousness <hi>of Faith; not as an</hi> Inherent and Personal <hi>Righteousness</hi> to <hi>an Imputed</hi> Righteousness; but as <hi>an External and Ritual,</hi> to <hi>an Inherent and Substantial</hi> Righteousness: but we have seen <hi>no such matter</hi> as yet, and do believe we are <hi>not like to see it.</hi> And the rather because he has thrown in <hi>a very suspicious word</hi> that would make any one think, that though he sets <hi>a good Face upon the Matter,</hi> yet he has <hi>little confidence in the Truth of his own Notions. The Truth is</hi> (lays he) <hi>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of</hi> the Law, <hi>and of</hi> Works, in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament</hi> signifies only <hi>an External Righteousness,</hi> which cannot please God. Now I began to think thus with my self: Does <hi>the Righteousness of the Law</hi> signifie one thing in <hi>the New-Testament,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in <hi>the Old-Testament?</hi> Does it signifie <hi>a real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Substantial</hi> Righteousness in the Old, and <hi>a Ritual External</hi> Righteousness in the New? <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie and Ceremony</hi> in the <hi>other?</hi> this is very unaccountable! Surely (thought I) when the Apostle argues with Jews, or Judaizing Christians, he speaks in their Dialect, speaks to their Capacity, speaks that he may be understood, speaks <hi>ad idem.</hi> They that had read <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 144. <hi>The Righteousness of thy Testimonies</hi> [of thy Law] <hi>is everlasting,</hi> would wonder to hear the Apostle
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:105027:275"/>
speak against <hi>the Righteousness of the Law:</hi> but alas, he only <hi>equivocated,</hi> and had <hi>a mental Reservation</hi> in his Sleeve, and understood all the while <hi>Ceremony and hypocrisie:</hi> But this is a Riddle, which because our Author has made of <hi>his own Mother-wit,</hi> he is the fittest Man alive to interpret it.</p>
               <p>(3) His Second Antithesis is between <hi>my own Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>the Righteousness of God;</hi> and he is <hi>considering</hi> with himself <hi>in what sense</hi> they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But <hi>there's no great difficulty in this,</hi> (says he) <hi>for the Apostle himself tells us, that by</hi> his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness <hi>he means</hi> the Righteousness of the Law; <hi>and by</hi> the Righteousness <hi>of God,</hi> the Righteousness <hi>of Faith:</hi> and therefore he will give this the gentle wipe, and away: But now he has quite spoiled the Humour of <hi>the double Antithesis;</hi> for, if by <hi>his own Righteousness,</hi> he <hi>means the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> and by <hi>the Righteousness of God, the Righteousness of Faith;</hi> then there's but <hi>one single Antithesis:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>his own Righteousness which is of the Law,</hi> (on the one part) <hi>and the Righteousness by the Faith of Christ, even the Righteousness which is of God by Faith,</hi> (on the other part:) but at these rates he might have given us, <hi>a treble, quadruple, sextuple, Antithesis,</hi> and have rung as many changes, when his hand was once in, upon <hi>two Bells,</hi> as others can do <hi>upon six.</hi> The Apostles Words indeed were clear, very clear, till our Author found it necessary to obscure them, to deprave the Truth, &amp; conciliate some small reverence to errour, to which two Heads I foresaw from the first, his whole Discourse might be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus much we are secured of, That the Apostle has repudiated <hi>his own Righteousness</hi> from any concern <hi>in justification;</hi> and that we may not
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:105027:275"/>
doubt what that was, he tells us, 'tis <hi>that of the Law.</hi> What <hi>the Righteousness of the Law</hi> signifies is evident, that which <hi>always bore that Name;</hi> that which <hi>the Law commands,</hi> and <hi>prescribes,</hi> viz. <hi>An exact Conformity to the Law of God in Spirit, Soul, and Body,</hi> so far as 'tis attainable or not attainable. He assures us next what he <hi>owns and adheres to,</hi> viz. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ,</hi> which is also called, <hi>The Righteousness of God.</hi> He further acquaints us, how we come <hi>to be interessed</hi> in this Righteousness, and that is <hi>by Faith;</hi> and that we may not ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or wilfully mistake <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>the Doctrine of Faith;</hi> he assures us that it's <hi>by Believing,</hi> by which we obtain this Righteousness.

               <p>To shut up his learned Exercitation, or schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Dissertation, or Diatriba of Antitheses, our Author will favour us with <hi>a Reason,</hi> nay, with <hi>an obvious</hi> and <hi>the most obvious Reason, why this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law</hi> is called <hi>their own Righteousness; because</hi> (forsooth) <hi>this</hi> Legal Righteousness <hi>was a way of their own chusing, not of God's Appointment.</hi> Now here he most falsly supposes, that by <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law</hi> is only meant <hi>a Righteousness</hi> made up of the Works of <hi>the Ceremonial Law:</hi> but I think something has been offered to dash that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of countenance. I am in haste, and intreat our Author to accept of short answers: 1. God has not appointed a Righteousnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made up out of any observances of the Moral Law, to be that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness wherein Sinners shall stand justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: If any will <hi>demand Iustification</hi> thereby, God will <hi>demand exact and perfect Conformity.</hi> If
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:105027:276"/>
therefore Sinners will <hi>chase this way,</hi> 'tis <hi>their own Righteousness;</hi> and it's time to give it a bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, God has not appointed it. 2. External Washings, External Conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were no <hi>Righteousness at all,</hi> much less <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> that which it required to form a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and therefore chuse it, or not chuse it, this is nothing to the purpose: The Apostle renounces <hi>his own Righteousness,</hi> which is <hi>the Righteousness of the Law.</hi> And this is further evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. (which our Author quotes, but miserably perverts.) <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and going about to establish their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, have not submitted to the Righteousness of God.</hi> Here is then <hi>the same Antithesis</hi> again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>their own</hi> Righteousness, (that of the Law) and <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi> (which is by the Faith of Jesus Christ); and the opposition is so direct, and diametrical, that 'twas impossible to establish <hi>their own,</hi> but they must shake off all subjection to <hi>Gods Righteousness.</hi> The Question then will be, Whether we are to be justified by <hi>a Legal,</hi> or <hi>an Evangelical Righteousness?</hi> And to this our Author agrees <hi>in words;</hi> but his Words intend quite <hi>another thing</hi> from the Truth: For by <hi>the Law</hi> he understands <hi>the Law of Moses:</hi> and let that pass too for once. But then by <hi>the Law of</hi> Moses he understands <hi>only the Ceremonial Law,</hi> though sometimes he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take in <hi>External Acts of</hi> Conformity to the <hi>Moral Law:</hi> and thus by <hi>a Legal</hi> Righteousness, or the Righteousness of <hi>the Law,</hi> he understands one made up of <hi>External Observations only,</hi> wherein the Apostle has clearly determined against him; to whom therefore from his partial Judgment-Seat. I
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:105027:276"/>
shall appeal, v. 5, 6. <hi>For</hi> Moses <hi>describeth the Righteousness of the Law, that the Man that doth these things shall live in them;</hi> from whence I argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Author: That Law <hi>whose Righteousness</hi> Moses <hi>describes,</hi> the Apostle excludes from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any place in Justification, but it is <hi>the Moral Law</hi> whose Righteousness <hi>Moses</hi> describes; therefore it is <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> which the Apostle <hi>excludes from having any place in Iustification.</hi> The Major is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Connexion of the Apostle's Words, v. 3.—<hi>They have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of God.</hi> v. 4. <hi>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth; for</hi> Moses <hi>describeth the Righteousness which is of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. The Minor I prove thus: That Law which saith, <hi>He that doth these things shall live in them,</hi> is that Law whose Righteousness <hi>Moses</hi> prescribeth; but it is <hi>the Moral</hi> Law, which saith, <hi>He that doth these things shall live in them:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> whose Righteousness <hi>Moses</hi> describeth. The Major is the Apostles own, v. 5. the Minor I prove from Lev. 18. 5. <hi>You shall keep my Statutes and Iudgments, which if a Man do he shall live in them.</hi> v. 6. <hi>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him.</hi> 7. <hi>The nakedness of thy Father or of thy Mother thou shalt not uncover,</hi> &amp;c. from whence I argue thus: That <hi>Law which forbids incest,</hi> is the Moral Law; but that Law which saith, <hi>He that doth these things shall live in them,</hi> is the Law which forbids incest: therefore <hi>that Law,</hi> that saith, <hi>He that doth these things shall live in them, is the Moral Law.</hi> Again I argue thus from Gal. 3. 10, 11. That Law which hath <hi>the Curse annext to it for noncontinuance in all things commanded therein,</hi>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:105027:277"/>
is the Law which the Apostle excludes from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any place in the Justification of a Sinner; but it is <hi>the Moral Law</hi> which hath that Curse annext to it: therefore it is <hi>the Moral Law</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle excludes from having any place in the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Sinner. The Major is evident from the place, v. 10. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> v. 11. <hi>But that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God is evident.</hi> The Minor I prove from Deut. 27. 26. from whence the Apostle quotes it. <hi>Cursed be he that continueth not in all the Words of this Law to do them.</hi> That Law which forbids <hi>making Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which forbids <hi>setting light by Father or Mother,</hi> which forbids <hi>removing Land-marks,</hi> which forbids <hi>causing the Blind to go out of his way,</hi> which forbids perverting of judgment, incest, sodomy, is <hi>the Law</hi> which hath the Curse annext to it; but it is the Moral Law which forbids all these things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the Moral Law which hath this Curse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to it. I cannot foresee what our Author will return to all this, but his old tawdry Answer. That indeed the Apostle does exclude <hi>the Moral Law,</hi> but that is only with respect to <hi>External O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without Internal Conformity:</hi> But it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Apostle excludes <hi>the Law it self,</hi> and therefore it must be highly impertinent to enquire <hi>what Deeds</hi> of the Law are excluded, when <hi>the Law it self</hi> is excluded: But yet for his further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I shall bestow an Argument upon that also.</p>

                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:105027:277"/>Those <hi>Acts of Obedience</hi> to which <hi>the Promise of Life</hi> in the Covenant of Works originally was <hi>most directly made,</hi> are <hi>excluded from Iustification:</hi> but to <hi>inward acts of Obedience</hi> the Promise of Life was most directly made; and therefore <hi>inward acts of Obedience are excluded from Iustification.</hi> The Apostle has se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Major, Rom. 10. 3, 5, 6. <hi>They have not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to the Righteousness of God: For</hi> Moses <hi>describeth the Righteousness of the Law, that he that doth these things shall live in them.</hi> The Minor is evident, for God never made <hi>a Promise of Life to External Acts of Obedience, without inward Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Soul to them,</hi> and of both to the Law of God. Again, Those Acts, the want whereof main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>exposes the Sinner to the Curse,</hi> are excluded from Justification; but the want of Internal Acts of Obedience mainly exposes the Sinner to the Curse: therefore internal Acts are excluded from Justification. And the true Reason why these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts are excluded from Justification, is not because they are not well-pleasing to God; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the case is thus with impotent fallen men, that he cannot reach the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>After all that has or may be said in the Case, If any one will be so civil and ingenuous, as out of his pure good-nature to yield our Author a few small inconsiderable things: As, 1. That there is <hi>a double Antithesis,</hi> where there is <hi>but one.</hi> And 2. That a man's <hi>own Righteousness</hi> is another thing

than <hi>the Righteousness of the Law.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Righteousness which is by the Faith of Christ,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from <hi>the Righteousness of God.</hi> 4. That by <hi>the Righteousness of the Law,</hi> no more is intended, than Ceremony and Hypocrisie. 5. That a mans <hi>own Righteousness</hi> is so called, not because <hi>it is his own,</hi> but because he <hi>places his Righteousness in it.</hi> and 6thly, one poor sorry triffle more, That all he asserts is meer Gospel; grant him but this, and he will prove all the rest with ease: but though I would go a great way to save his longing, yet this is so large a boon, that it deserves mature advice and serious deliberation.</p>
               <p>There are yet a few odd things in arrear, some notice whereof I promised to take; and seeing we are a little at leisure, I shall do him justice. And first, let us consider what work he has made with that Text, Rom. 8. 3, 4. <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak-through the Flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful Flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the Flesh, that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Now our Authors Paraphrase (as well as we can scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it together from broken fragments, and odd shreds of his Discourse) is thus much. <hi>The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law being designed of God to work in the Iews inward holiness, and purity of Mind, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by Circumcision, Washings, Purifications, and Sacrifices; it was found too weak to effect this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and therefore God sent Christ into the World to die as a Sacrifice for our Sins, to confirm and seal the New-Covenant with his Blood; to work in us that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Holiness and Purity, which is the Perfection</hi>
                  <pb n="569" facs="tcp:105027:278"/>
                  <hi>and Accomplishment of the Figurative and Typical Righteousness of the Law:</hi> which he gives us in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, p. 267. <hi>What the Law could not do,</hi> i. e. <hi>govern our Minds and Passions; this God effected by sending Christ into the World to publish the Gospel to us, and to confirm all those great Promises and Threatnings contained in it, with his own Blood.</hi> This is indeed a parcel of excellent Divinity, but that it's wholly destitute of truth: For 1. he supposes, That <hi>that Law, whose weakness</hi> the Apostle assigns as the Reason of Gods sending his Son; was only <hi>the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law;</hi> the Falshood whereof I shall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate (if that be not too great a word for any mans Mouth besides his own) by and by. 2. He insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates that the whole of Christs being a Sacrifice for our Sins, lay in confirming the New-Covenant; the Falshood whereof, the next Section will give us direct occasion to evince. 3. He makes the whole business of the Ceremonial Law, to represent inward purity, and (perhaps) to effect it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as though some of the Ceremonies did represent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purity; yet the main of their design was to lead to Jesus Christ: and particularly Sacrifices which represented that Atonement and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Christ in due time should make with God on the behalf of Sinners. Col. 2. 17. <hi>The Law had a shadow of good things to come, but the Body is of Christ.</hi> 4. He scandalously charges it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, that he appointed a means to an end; which was found too weak to reach his End: As if God must try conclusions, and make experiments, before he could be certain whether his design would take, and his appointments reach their End. 5. He renders Christ's Coming into the World unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:105027:279"/>
for what though the Ceremonial Law could not effect that inward Purity, yet I hope God had <hi>means</hi> to <hi>effect it,</hi> unless he will say all the World till Christ's Coming were <hi>whited-Walls,</hi> and <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Sepulchres:</hi> For what was become of <hi>the Moral Law</hi> all this while? had it <hi>no power</hi> to effect <hi>that End?</hi> 6. He tells us p. 269. <hi>That the Reason why the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>was abrogated, was because it could not make men good:</hi> But then the Moral Law was either able to make men good, or it was not; If it was not, why was not <hi>that abrogated also?</hi> If it was able, and had its effect, then what need of Christ to come into the World to effect that which the Moral Law was able to effect without him? But the true Reason why the Ceremonial Law is expired, is because the Lord Jesus Christ has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and fulfilled all that is represented. When the Sun is risen, the Shadows fly away; there was no formal abrogation either made or necessary to be made; it expired of course when Christ had made good what-ever the Ceremonies had exhibited to their Faith. 7. He tells that <hi>Christ came to work in us that inward Purity,</hi> represented by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law: but for all his good-morrows, when he is throughly catechifed: <hi>Christ's working</hi> is no more than those sufficient arguments and motives, to excite their own wits, whereby they might work it themselves; and I cannot tell whether he will deny that the Jews had sufficient motives, and arguments for that end under their Law. 8. He contradicts himself (which is no news); for whereas he had said p. 265. <hi>That the Law was designed to work in them inward purity:</hi> He says p. 269. That <hi>the Law nursed them up in a ritual, and external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                  <pb n="571" facs="tcp:105027:279"/>
                  <hi>and taught them to serve God in the Letter, by Circumcision, and Sacrifices, or an external Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Letter of the Law.</hi> And then I hope God could not justly blame them, much less damn them for being Hypocrites, if they did <hi>as well as,</hi> and <hi>no better, than</hi> his own Law taught them: Nay he adds, <hi>That the Gospel of Christ alone teaches us to worship God with the Spirit, and to offer a reasonable Sacrifice to him.</hi> This is <hi>strange</hi> Doctrine! but it's less matter for that if it be but <hi>true.</hi> But was not God always a Spirit, and did he not always teach his People to worship him with their Spirits? How osten does God complain that they <hi>drew nigh him with their Lips, when their Hearts were far from him?</hi> which he could not well do, if he taught them <hi>no better:</hi> It's a Riddle to me that these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies should <hi>represent inward purity,</hi> and yet <hi>not teach it;</hi> when they had no way <hi>to teach that Purity,</hi> but by <hi>representing it.</hi> 'Tis true, the Gospel teaches us to worship God <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> but God always taught his People to worship him <hi>with their Spirits</hi> in opposition to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</hi> Psal. 51. 6. <hi>Thou desirest truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</hi> Did God institute <hi>a Law, a Law so chargeable</hi> and burdensome, and all to teach his People to worship like Parrots, to mumble over their Mattens, and like Puppets to make an outward noise, without a <hi>rational Principle</hi> to guide it? If they had <hi>no reasonable Service,</hi> why were they <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures?</hi> But a little more reverence of the Divine Majesty would confute a great deal of such blasphemy. Let us now seriously consider the Text: and 1. It will be necessary to enquire <hi>what that Law is,</hi> whose <hi>weakness</hi> the Apostle assigns as
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:105027:280"/>
the reason of <hi>God's sending his own Son?</hi> And for all the Authors presumptions, I am well satisfied it was not <hi>the Ceremonial Law:</hi> for what if the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial had proved <hi>weak?</hi> what if it had been resolved into its <hi>first nothing,</hi> the Moral stood still <hi>where it always did?</hi> and what need of Christ's Coming into the World upon that account? There was a time when <hi>the Ceremonial Law</hi> was <hi>not created,</hi> and what if it had been again <hi>repealed</hi> and <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi> things had been but <hi>in statu quo:</hi> But that the Law here mentioned is the Moral Law, the Connexion of the Apostle's Words, his Premises out of which he draws his Conclusion, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifest. In Chap. 7. v. 7, He tells us he <hi>had not known sin except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet:</hi> But <hi>sin taking occasion</hi> from <hi>that Law,</hi> wrought in him <hi>all manner of Concupiscence,</hi> v. 8. Nevertheless he clears the Law. v. 12. <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> was <hi>holy and just, and good;</hi> had <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick</hi> goodness, righteousness in it; and this he calls v. 25. <hi>The Law of God.</hi> Now the Apostle having said v. 10. <hi>That this Commandment</hi> (of the Moral Law) <hi>which was unto life</hi> in (God's Original Institution) <hi>he found to be unto death:</hi> Nevertheless, Chap. 8. v. 1. he assures us, <hi>That there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ Iesus;</hi> and he shews how Sinners are brought from under that Condemnation, v. 3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>That impossible thing of the Law:</hi> where the Apostle add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Article [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible thing of this Law?</hi> There are <hi>many things</hi> that this Law <hi>cannot do:</hi> It can lay a Command upon the Creature, but it <hi>cannot give strength to obey</hi> the Command; it can offer the Promises of Life to the obedient, and shake the Threatning over the Conscience of the Rebellious; but meeting <hi>with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature,</hi> it cannot redintegrate lapsed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it can <hi>wound,</hi> but it <hi>cannot heal;</hi> it <hi>can condemn</hi> but it <hi>cannot absolve</hi> a Sinner: But yet there seems to be <hi>some one thing</hi> which above <hi>all other impossibles,</hi> is <hi>absolutely impossible</hi> for this Law to do for man; and that is <hi>to justifie him before God:</hi> For so he had said, and proved Chap. 3. 20. <hi>By the Deeds of that Law shall no Flesh be justified in his Sight.</hi> But (3.) How comes the Law to be so weak? for certainly it had once such a Power in its <hi>primitive appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and was fitted <hi>to give life to the Obedient;</hi> for we must not dare to think, that the Wise God ever appointed a Law or the meanest thing in the World, but it was fitted to reach all those Ends which in his Holy and Secret Counsel he designed it to: How then comes <hi>this Law, the Moral</hi> Law, to be so <hi>weak?</hi> If any of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> can produce an Obedience every way such as the Law demands, it is able to give Life Eternal still: The Apostle ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers us, It's <hi>weak through the Flesh:</hi> it was not <hi>made weak,</hi> but <hi>became weak</hi> through <hi>our weakness.</hi> The Law is as <hi>strong to reward still,</hi> if we were but as <hi>strong to obey</hi> as ever. But (4.) How did Christ remedy, and help us in this desperate Case? for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:105027:281"/>
we cannot <hi>live by the Law,</hi> we must <hi>die by the Law.</hi> The Apostle resolves us; God sent his Son <hi>in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sinful Flesh,</hi> (and in the truth of humane Flesh) <hi>and for sin, condemned sin in the Flesh:</hi>

               <p>There is <hi>a Metaphorical expression</hi> still behind, which our Author cannot digest; whereupon when he has thrown away <hi>a little,</hi> and truly <hi>but a little wit,</hi> he will ease us of the tediousness of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.

this (and many others which he thinks it enough for their reproach to call so) be <hi>a Metaphorical Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or no; yet I have not leisure at present to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Service: for my part, I think that <hi>riches</hi> is more properly, and literally predicated of <hi>that Grace,</hi> that is treasured up in the Lord Jesus, than of all <hi>that paltry trash</hi> which has got the vogue in the Dialect of deluded Worldlings; but I am weary, and shall therefore only make a defensive War of it.

                  </gap>, this <hi>unsearchable Riches</hi> of Christ? Why, even here these Men cannot agree, for some are zealous for it, that (what-ever is meant by <hi>unsearchable Riches,</hi>) yet by <hi>Christ</hi> is meant <hi>Christ himself;</hi> others, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom our Author professes his Name) by <hi>the unsearchable Riches of Christ,</hi> understand <hi>the Gospel which St.</hi> Paul <hi>preached to the Gentiles:</hi> And is it not a small thing (that he should stand so stifly upon it) for us to entreat; 1. That the Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, his Offices, his Natures, his Obedience, his Life, his Death, with their proper Springs and Causes, their special ends and designs, might come in for a <hi>good share of the Gospel?</hi> But 2.

               <p>One small brush at Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> will conclude this Section, for 'tis impossible for our Author to conclude without reviling; and what evil has this good Man done?

Now Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> (you must know) had said, thinking no man no harm I dare say; That <hi>Christ is generally rich, rich in Houses, Lands, in Gold, Silver, in all Temporals as well as Spirituals;</hi> with many more friendly expressions of the Fulness and Preciousness of the Grace that is in Christ: To which our Author returns a solid
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:105027:282"/>
though short Confutation: That the Son of Man <hi>bad not a place whereon to lay his head:</hi> And is not Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> a rash and unadvised Man think you, to rant it so high in extolling his Riches, and to ascribe to him such vast revenues and possessions: But let us be Charitable, and put a favourable construction upon these dangerous words; perhaps, they are not so rank poyson as they seem to be: 1. What if Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> speaks not of what <hi>Christ was</hi> when he <hi>appeared in the form of a Servant;</hi> but what he <hi>now is</hi> since he has reassumed <hi>his original Glory,</hi> and as Mediator has <hi>all power in Heaven and Earth</hi> put into his hands; and methinks, it is no such fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious Crime to assert that Christ has the disposal of <hi>all outward things</hi> for the good of his Church: But I correct my self when I remember my Author has told us, <hi>p.</hi> 162. <hi>That Christ has left the visible and external Conduct and Government of the Church to Bishops and Pastors;</hi> and therefore it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed also he has left <hi>the visible Revenues,</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties</hi> to their disposal also; for it's equitable, that the <hi>Maintenance</hi> should go along with <hi>the work</hi> and therefore <hi>those Houses and Lands,</hi> the Palaces, the Tithes, the Glebe, <hi>the Gold, the Silver,</hi> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> fancies are in Christ's hands, are entrusted where they shall be converted to better uses. 2.

                  <hi>we will be thy Death!</hi> In <hi>Pag.</hi> 320. Our Author propounds this great Question: <hi>What Influence the Sacrifice of Christ's Death, and the Righteousness of his Life, have upon our acceptance with God?</hi> And he gives us both a <hi>Reason,</hi> why he moves the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>an Answer to it.</hi> 1. The Reason why he moves this Question upon it, <hi>Lest any should suspect that his Design is to lessen the Grace of God, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage the Merits, and Righteousness of Christ.</hi> Now I would make a question upon it; Whether his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Question will probably <hi>heal</hi> us of our <hi>suspicions,</hi> or rather <hi>beget Iealousies</hi> where there were <hi>none,</hi> and <hi>heighten</hi> those <hi>already conceived</hi> into <hi>violent presumptions,</hi> if not <hi>plain demonstrations,</hi> that <hi>such is his Design?</hi> 2. His Answer to the Question is this: <hi>All that I can find in Scripture about this, is: That to this we owe the Covenant of Grace: That God being well pleased with the Obedience of Christ's Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death, for his sake entred into a New-Covenant with Mankind, wherein he promises Pardon of sin, and Eternal Life to those who believe, and obey the Gospel.</hi> This Answer contains <hi>three things:</hi> 1. A Description of the Covenant of Grace. 2. An Assertion that this Covenant is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sacrifice of Christ's Death, and the Righteousness of his Life. 3. a Supposition, that the Righteousness and Sacrifice of Christ, has <hi>no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Influence</hi> upon our Acceptance with God, but that for his sake he entred into such a Covenant (as he has here described) with Man-kind.</p>
               <p>(1.) His Description of the Covenant is this: <hi>A promise of the Pardon of sin, and Eternal Life to those who believe and obey the Gospel.</hi> A Description so liable to exceptions, that it describes neither
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:105027:284"/>
                  <hi>the whole</hi> of the Covenant, nor <hi>a New-Covenant,</hi> nor (upon the matter) <hi>any Covenant at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 1. This Description gives us little, very little of the true Covenant of Grace: for (1.) though he thinks to put us off with <hi>a promise of Pardon and Life to those who believe and obey;</hi> the <hi>true Covenant of Grace</hi> has given us <hi>a Promise</hi> of <hi>that Faith,</hi> whereby we <hi>may believe,</hi> and of that <hi>New-heart</hi> whereby we are <hi>enabled to obey</hi> the Gospel. And first we have a Promise of <hi>the right Faith</hi> made to us in <hi>the true Covenant, Ioh. 6. 37. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no-wise cast out,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. <hi>By Grace ye are saved through Faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God.</hi> And lest it should be Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Faith</hi> is indeed <hi>God's gift</hi> as <hi>all other things are,</hi> wherein the Common Providence of God concurs with Humane industry: The Apostle, as if aware of such a petty Answer, has laid in a Reply ready, <hi>ch. 1. v. 19.</hi> That they <hi>who believe,</hi> do so by <hi>the exceeding greatness of God's power, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working</hi> of his <hi>Mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we have <hi>a direct, and express Promise</hi> too of <hi>that New-heart</hi> from which we give to God <hi>New-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;</hi> nay, of <hi>that New-obedience</hi> it self, which proceeds from <hi>the New-heart,</hi> or <hi>renewed Nature: Ezek. 36. A new heart also will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; and I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of Stone out of your Flesh, and will give you a heart of Flesh:</hi> (there's the new Heart.) and <hi>v. 27. I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Iudgments</hi> and
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:105027:285"/>
                  <hi>do them:</hi> (there is new obedience) thus also, <hi>Heb. 8. 10. This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of</hi> Israel <hi>after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts &amp;c.</hi> wherein it's easy to observe: 1. That this New-Covenant was <hi>founded</hi> upon God's <hi>free Grace, v.</hi> 9. They <hi>continued not in my Covenant</hi> (the old Covenant) <hi>and I regarded them not, saith the Lord:</hi> They were a Covenant-breaking people, deserved utter rejection, yet God will make another, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a New-Covenant with them. 2 That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of this Covenant were <hi>purely Spiritual;</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Laws in their minds and hearts.</hi> 3. The <hi>parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Covenanting, <hi>God and his</hi> Israel; not all and <hi>every individual Son of</hi> Adam: But (2.) This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription gives us very little of the true Covenant of Grace; here's a <hi>Promise of Pardon and Life to them who believe and obey;</hi> but <hi>perseverance</hi> in Faith and Obedience, is left to the desultory and lubricous power of <hi>free-will:</hi> whereas in <hi>the true Covenant of Grace,</hi> there's an undertaking that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant shall be <hi>immutable,</hi> both <hi>on God's part</hi> and the <hi>Believers,</hi> Jer. 32. 38, 40. <hi>They shall be my people and I will be their God; and I will make an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me.</hi> There are <hi>but two things</hi> that we can possibly Imagine should make the Covenant fall short of perpetuity, either <hi>God's</hi> turning away from his people, or (which is only to be suspected) <hi>their turning away</hi> from their God: Against <hi>both of these</hi> God has made sufficient Provision. 1. God has promised that he will not <hi>turn away from them to do them good.</hi>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:105027:285"/>
2. He has promised that <hi>they shall not depart from him,</hi> and to fix and determine their backsliding Natures, he has promised <hi>to put his fear into their hearts,</hi> which is the great preservative against Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</p>
               <p>§. 2. As it describes <hi>not the whole of the Covenant,</hi> so it describes not <hi>the Nature of a New-Covenant.</hi> The Gospel-Covenant may be called <hi>a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> either in opposition to the <hi>Old Covenant of Works;</hi> or the <hi>old Administration</hi> of the Covenant of Grace: Now, 1. This Covenant which he has here described is <hi>no new Covenant</hi> in opposition to <hi>the Old-Covenant of works.</hi> The Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam promised Life</hi> upon <hi>condition of Obedience;</hi> Now <hi>the Commands</hi> which God gave <hi>to Adam,</hi> were <hi>as easy</hi> as those which are <hi>now</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>to all Mankind:</hi> and <hi>much easier</hi> too, if we consider, first; That he had <hi>more natural strength to obey and keep them,</hi> and as for <hi>supernatural strength,</hi> our Author will allow us none, unless by a desperate Catachresis we will call <hi>Moral Arguments so;</hi> which to a Creature <hi>dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy just nothing, without <hi>special power from on high,</hi> to render them <hi>efficacious,</hi> which neither will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us. And Secondly, we are told that Christ has <hi>added to the Moral Law,</hi> which is to lay <hi>more Load</hi> on those who were <hi>before</hi> overcharged; so that (as he makes Covenants) <hi>Adam's</hi> was <hi>much the better</hi> Covenant of the two: But he has wisely shuffled <hi>in a Promise of the Pardon of Sin,</hi> which may seem to give <hi>his Covenant</hi> a preheminence above that of <hi>Adam:</hi> But that will not mend the matter; both because it's better to have <hi>no sin</hi> in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:105027:286"/>
than <hi>such a Remedy,</hi> better to have <hi>no Wound</hi> than such <hi>a Plaister,</hi> and also because the <hi>Promise of Pardon</hi> is <hi>suspended upon the condition</hi> of <hi>Faith and Obedience,</hi> which without <hi>supernaturally real</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of <hi>immediate</hi> Divine Power reduces the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>an impossibility</hi> of performance. 2. This Covenant which he has here described, is <hi>no New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant</hi> in opposition to <hi>the old Administration</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. There were the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <hi>then</hi> that we have <hi>now,</hi> the same <hi>moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to observe</hi> that we have <hi>now;</hi> and though the word [Gospel] comes in for a blind, yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle assures us, <hi>Gal. 3. 8. That Abraham had the Gospel Preached to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. Upon the matter, it's no Covenant of Grace at all. For, 1. <hi>A Promise of Pardon and Life,</hi> upon <hi>Condition of Believing and Obeying,</hi> is neither better nor worse, than <hi>a threatning of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Death,</hi> to them who <hi>Believe not, and Obey not.</hi> It may with equal right be called <hi>a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Death,</hi> as a <hi>Promise of Life:</hi> It's no more <hi>a Covenant of Grace</hi> than <hi>a Covenant of Wrath;</hi> and therefore, 2. (if it be lawful to consider Man as the Word of God describes him, <hi>as dead in Sins and Trespasses,</hi> as one that <hi>of himself cannot think a good thought,</hi> that <hi>can do nothing at all without Christ</hi>) It's no Covenant at all to him under his present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; for what is the <hi>nice difference</hi> between <hi>a Promise of Life,</hi> to him that <hi>obeys,</hi> when it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain before-hand <hi>he cannot obey,</hi> and <hi>no Promise</hi> at all? 3. This Covenant which he calls New, (and well he may, for it's of <hi>his own</hi> making, or howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his own <hi>new-vamping</hi>) assigns the <hi>same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="585" facs="tcp:105027:286"/>
of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life;</hi> but the Scripture requires <hi>other qualifications for Eternal Life,</hi> than for the <hi>Pardon of Sin.</hi> A Believer may be <hi>justified</hi> without <hi>a sinless perfection,</hi> but without <hi>such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less perfection</hi> none shall <hi>enter into Glory:</hi> He may be <hi>actually justified,</hi> that has not <hi>persevered in Holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Death;</hi> but without <hi>such perseverance</hi> he can never be made <hi>partaker of Eternal Life.</hi> 4. This Covenant of his is supposed to be made <hi>with all Mankind,</hi> and yet all Mankind <hi>never heard of it:</hi> Now is it not very admirable, and to be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the wonders of the New-Divinity, that God should enter into a Covenant <hi>with all the World</hi> to <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>save them upon condition of Faith &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> and yet not let many of them know a sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it? Nay, that he should <hi>expresly countermand</hi> the promulgating of the Gospel to them? And yet so has God done even by the preaching of <hi>the true</hi> Covenant of Grace: <hi>Acts 16. 6, 7. Now when they had gone throughout all</hi> Phrygia, <hi>and the Region of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, <hi>and were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to Preach the word in</hi> Asia; <hi>After they were come to</hi> Mylia, <hi>they assayed to go into</hi> Bithynia, <hi>but the Spirit suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) Let us now briefly consider his Assertion: That <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> (such a one as he has made for us) <hi>is owing to the Sacrifice of Christ's death, and the Righteousness of his Life:</hi> That <hi>God being pleased with these, for Christ's sake entred into a New Covenant with Mankind.</hi> I must tell the Reader that I have narrowly pryed into this Section, wherein I find <hi>frequent assertions</hi> of this Doctrine, That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is <hi>owing to, procured by, founded on the Obedience of Christ's Life, and the Sacrifice of his</hi>
                  <pb n="586" facs="tcp:105027:287"/>
                  <hi>Death;</hi> and yet so unhappy have I been in my <hi>search</hi> that I cannot find <hi>any Proof,</hi> or any attempt to prove it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore (till I see evidence to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) I shall take it for granted, that <hi>the Covenant of Grace is owing to, founded on,</hi> and <hi>given forth</hi> by that <hi>free Grace</hi> of God, from whence it is justly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>A Covenant of Grace;</hi> though the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>a Mediator, such a Mediator,</hi> was absolutely necessary to put us into <hi>the Actual possession</hi> of those rich mercies designed for us by God in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; which Mediator himself <hi>is owing to, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on</hi> that Covenant of Grace, and therefore <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> is not <hi>founded upon him:</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for <hi>that Covenant</hi> which he is pleased to call a <hi>New-Covenant, and a Covenant of Grace,</hi> it's no great matter where 'tis <hi>founded,</hi> and therefore let him dispose of <hi>his own Creature</hi> as he pleases.</p>
               <p>(3.) He supposes that <hi>Christ's Obedience and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had no other influence upon our acceptance with God,</hi> but that <hi>for his sake he entred into such a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Mankind.</hi> This is all, however that he can find; But this is <hi>a most miserable All,</hi> and either is <hi>just nothing,</hi> or <hi>very near it.</hi> For, §. 1. Let him of Courtesy Answer one Question more since he is so good at it, <hi>Whether God was ever at any time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to pardon sin, and give Eternal Life, to those who did believe his Promises, and obey his Precepts?</hi> If he was <hi>unwilling;</hi> Then let him shew <hi>how Christ's Obedience and Sacrifice,</hi> did operate upon God <hi>to alter his will,</hi> and of <hi>unwilling</hi> to make him <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> what could there be in <hi>the Sacrifice of Christ's Death,</hi> or the <hi>Righteousness of his Life,</hi> that should make God <hi>more</hi> in Love with <hi>Faith and Obedience,</hi> than he had been <hi>before?</hi> But if God was <hi>willing,</hi> and
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:105027:287"/>
that without respect to Christ: then how does he give <hi>the Pardon of sin and Eternal Life,</hi> to them who <hi>Believe and Obey</hi> for <hi>Christ's sake?</hi> I am sure of our Authors good-Nature in this point; he <hi>will say,</hi> he <hi>has said</hi> it; That <hi>some,</hi> that <hi>many</hi> were saved <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to Christ;</hi> The mercy and Grace of God (it seems) accepting their <hi>Belief of particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and their <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands; Repentance</hi> supplying the defects, and shortness of their Conformity to the Law: Now if God did all this <hi>without regard to Christ,</hi> how does he do it <hi>for the sake of Christ?</hi> But there's an Answer to this, that lies Dormant in the word [Promise] God did indeed <hi>Pardon sin, and give Eternal Life,</hi> to those who believed his Revelations, and obeyed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; but <hi>he never promised</hi> he would do it. But now he has drawn out <hi>his Grace and good-will</hi> into <hi>a Promise</hi> to pardon sin and give Eternal Life; upon the terms aforesaid, and this he has done <hi>for Christ's sake:</hi> And let us Audit the Account; and <hi>all the influence that Christ's Obedience and Sacrifice bath upon our acceptation with God,</hi> is, that we have <hi>got a promise</hi> from God to <hi>do that</hi> which he would have <hi>done before;</hi> to <hi>give us</hi> that he would have <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us before;</hi> only he would <hi>not promise to do it</hi> for us, to <hi>give it</hi> to us. Two things I shall briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. 1. That God under <hi>the Old-Testament</hi> made <hi>explicite promises of the pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life;</hi> and if under <hi>that Dispensation,</hi> I am sure our Author will say, <hi>without respect to Christ:</hi> that this was the Doctrine of the Old-Testament, the Apostle asserts, <hi>Act. 13. 40. To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his Name, whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him shall receive remission of sins.</hi> 2 Sam.
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:105027:288"/>
7. 14. <hi>I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son:</hi> and there's enough in that to secure <hi>a promise of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to a repenting Child.</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>They shall be mine, and I will spare them as a Father spares his own son that serves him:</hi> but it it is added; <hi>If he sin against me, I will chasten him with the Rod of Men, but my Mercy shall not depart from him.</hi> Ps. 99. 8. <hi>Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God, thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance on their inventions.</hi> And as <hi>the pardoning Grace</hi> that was <hi>in God's Nature</hi> was revealed to them, as <hi>the foundation of their Faith and obedience,</hi> Ps. 130. 4. <hi>There is forgiveness with thee that thou mayst be feared;</hi> So it is drawn out <hi>into a promise, v. 8. He shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> Israel <hi>from all his Iniquities,</hi> which without <hi>the pardon of them</hi> is <hi>simply impossible.</hi> As for the <hi>Promises</hi> of Eternal <hi>Lise,</hi> we find good old <hi>Iacob</hi> now giving up the Ghost, and having <hi>no hope in this Life;</hi> expressing his Faith thus, <hi>Gen. 49. 18. I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord!</hi> Which doubtless was <hi>Eternal Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> beyond the Verge of that short time of his Life, which he knew was expired; Ps. 73. 24. <hi>Thou shalt guide me with thy Counsel,</hi> (in my pilgrimage) <hi>and afterwards receive me to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> but a more convenient place will offer it self for the discussing of this matter. 2. If then this be all that <hi>the Obedience of Christ's Life and the Sacrifice of his Death</hi> do contribute to <hi>our acceptance with God,</hi> that <hi>for Christ's sake</hi> we have <hi>got a Promise,</hi> or <hi>a more explicite</hi> Promise of the <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life</hi> than <hi>before;</hi> then I must be of the same mind still, that it contributes <hi>just nothing</hi> to the acceptance of our Obedience with God. Let me have Liberty to put the Case of <hi>two Persons, v. g.</hi>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:105027:288"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> let us suppose these two, <hi>equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient</hi> to God's commands, the former <hi>without</hi> such an <hi>express and explicite promise</hi> of Reward the <hi>other,</hi> encouraged by <hi>stronger Arguments</hi> of clear and numerous Promises of Pardon, and Eternal Life: Which of <hi>these two</hi> is more accepted of God? He that performed <hi>equal Obedience,</hi> upon <hi>more feeble</hi> encouragements; or he that upon <hi>stronger Motives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet gave <hi>but equal</hi> Obedience? If Reason might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this Controversy, it would clearly carry it for him, that bore <hi>equal burden</hi> with <hi>less strength,</hi> performed <hi>equal duty</hi> upon <hi>less inducements:</hi> If then this be <hi>all the influence</hi> that the <hi>Obedience and death</hi> of Christ have upon <hi>our Acceptation with God;</hi> that thereby we have got <hi>a greater help</hi> to obedience, the best Answer to the Question had been, that it has <hi>no influence</hi> upon our Acceptance with God. §. 2. His Answer signifies nothing or very near it: For the Question was, <hi>What Influence Christ's Active and Passive Obedience have upon our Acceptance with God?</hi> And he has framed <hi>an Answer to another Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;</hi> What Influence <hi>Christ's Active and Passive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience have upon our Obedience?</hi> Which is quite another thing.

His Answer is so like nothing, as cannot be discerned from nothing: The Question was, <hi>What influence Christ's Righteousness and Sacrifice have upon our acceptance with God?</hi> The Answer is, <hi>God for Christ's sake entred into a New-Covenant with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> &amp;c. which is to leave the Question just as he found it (and if he leave it <hi>no worse</hi> it's pardonable) for it will be enquired still; <hi>What influence the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ's Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death</hi> had <hi>upon God</hi> to <hi>move him</hi> to <hi>enter, into such a Covenant?</hi> Under <hi>what Notion</hi> did his Life and Death operate upon God? Did Christ make <hi>a proper Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> with God?

               <p>[1.] <hi>What influence the Death of Christ</hi> has upon our Acceptation with God? But it is to be supposed that <hi>we have had our Answer,</hi> and must sit down by it. <hi>That God was so well pleased with the Sacrifice of Christ's Death, that for his sake he entred into a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant with Mankind:</hi> The Proof is all in all; Why, <hi>this is plain</hi> (says he) <hi>in reference to his Death; Hence the Blood of Christ is called the Blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Heb. 10. 29. It's plain, that God for Christ's sake <hi>entred into this Covenant,</hi> because his Blood is called <hi>the Blood of the new Covenant:</hi> but yet it's not so very plain neither; A man may possibly mistake it for all that he has said to satisfy him: well! But then Christ is called <hi>the great Shepherd, and Bishop of Souls through the blood of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. but I can find <hi>no such Scripture:</hi> well; However, <hi>The Blood of Christ is called the Blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than the Blood of</hi> Abel, Heb. 12. 24. <hi>which is an Allusion to</hi> Moses <hi>his sprinkling the Blood of the Sacrifice, wherewith he confirmed and ratified the Covenant, between God and the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I expected it would come to this at long run<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Justice of God and the Commination of the Law, which stood in the way of our Pardon, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But to obviate our Author's design, I shall a little divert the Reader with the consideration of these Propositions: 1. <hi>The Confirmation of such a Covenant as he has described</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> a Promise of the Pardon of sin and Eternal Life to those who believe and obey the Gospel) <hi>was not the main end of the Death of Christ:</hi> 1.

not <hi>a Sacrifice of Propitiation:</hi> And yet all this may be said of <hi>Paul's Death,</hi> if those expressions applyed to <hi>the Death of Christ,</hi> signify no more than <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Gospel.</hi> 2. The Scripture assigns greater ends to the Death of Christ, than confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Promises: 1. His Death <hi>as a Sacrifice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned God. 2. His Death <hi>as a Price paid to God</hi> redeemed us. 3. His Death <hi>as a Punishment</hi> exacted of God, <hi>satisfied his Iustice.</hi> For the first, Isa. 53. 10. <hi>his Soul was made an Offering for sin:</hi> and therefore as on <hi>a Sacrifice of Atonement,</hi> God <hi>laid on him the Iniquities of us all,</hi> V. 6. For the second, 1 Tim. 2. 6. <hi>He gave himself a Ransom, or Price of Redemption for all.</hi> For the third, Rom. 3. 25, 26. <hi>The Blood of Christ is said to be a Declaration of God's Righteousness, that he might be just in justifying the Believer;</hi> which Testimonies will call for clearing and vindication in due time. And these indeed are <hi>such ends of the Death of Christ,</hi> as will undeniably prove, that his Death had <hi>an Influence upon our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God.</hi> 3. The Scripture owns Christ as <hi>a proper Priest;</hi> and therefore his Work must be <hi>somewhat more,</hi> than <hi>confirming a Doctrine.</hi> A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet will abundantly answer <hi>that design:</hi> But our Author prudently having cut out Christ <hi>some work</hi> to do, has fitted him with <hi>an Office too,</hi> which is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable</hi> to it; for to what purpose should Christ be <hi>a Priest,</hi> that has nothing to do with <hi>his Sacrifice,</hi> but <hi>to confirm his Doctrine?</hi> The direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Object of Christ's Sacerdotal Office was God, Heb. 9. 14, 15. <hi>How much more shall the Blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself to God, purge your Consciences?</hi> I know these Men will say that Christ <hi>offered up himself to God in He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereas sin is only infinite, or of infinite demerit, <hi>objectivè,</hi> as committed against <hi>an infinite God:</hi> The Sufferings of Christ are infinite also <hi>subjectivè,</hi> being the Sufferings of <hi>that Person</hi> who <hi>is God,</hi> though not <hi>as God;</hi> and therefore Christ in <hi>a finite</hi> time was able to give <hi>infinite</hi> Satisfaction. 3. Christ was such an High-Priest, as being <hi>God and Man,</hi> was able to give <hi>an infinite Value</hi> to his Sacrifice of himself <hi>as Man:</hi> nor let any say that if Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in a way of Satisfaction to Divine Justice, and bore what the Sinner should have born, or that which was <hi>equivalent</hi> to it, that then the Sinner ought <hi>immediately</hi> to be <hi>delivered from the Curse</hi> due to his sin; for seeing that the Satisfaction was not made <hi>in the Person</hi> of the Offender, but his <hi>Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> it was necessary that the benefit of <hi>another's Satisfaction</hi> should be communicated in such a way as might best please that God, whose Grace was <hi>the only Motive</hi> to his Acceptation of <hi>a Substitute:</hi> It's the undoubted priviledg of the Giver to dispose of <hi>his own Gift</hi> in <hi>his own Way;</hi> and it was absolutely and indispensibly necessary that the Sinner should be <hi>duly qualified</hi> to receive so <hi>transcendent Favours,</hi> purchased at <hi>so dear rates,</hi> and fitted to return the Glory due to a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

Many have laid down their lives to <hi>Abett,</hi> and endured extremity of Tortures rather than renege the Doctrine they have openly preached; their Confidence (the mean while) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported either by <hi>a mistaken Conscience,</hi> or perhaps <hi>some sinister respects.</hi> All that it can prove in the largest judgment of Charity is, That they <hi>suppose</hi> their Doctrine to be <hi>true,</hi> or else would hardly lose <hi>their All,</hi> rather than <hi>lose a Principle;</hi> but not that <hi>therefore</hi> the Doctrine is true, because the Preacher dies for it. That which is <hi>false in it self,</hi> will not <hi>become true,</hi> by laying down <hi>our life for it.</hi> In the Memory of the last Age, there were some who sacrificed their lives to the Flames in defence of <hi>Contradictory Doctrines:</hi> So that to say that the Death of Christ has <hi>no other use,</hi> but <hi>To confirm the Truth of that Doctrine</hi> which he preacht, is but a more modest, civil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gentle way of saying it has <hi>no use at all.</hi> 2. To whom should the Death of Christ confirm the Truth of his Doctrine, to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies or his Friends? For <hi>his Enemies:</hi> Many of his Sufferings, the very greatest and sorest of his Sufferings were <hi>out of their notice;</hi> either <hi>privately</hi> in the Garden, or <hi>more privately</hi> in his Soul, such as whereof they could take <hi>no cognizance:</hi> and for these which were <hi>visible;</hi> they looked on them as <hi>the just rewards</hi> of his violation of the Law.

                  <hi>his Friends,</hi> his Death considered singly in it self, without respect to its proper Ends, was so far from confirming of their Faith, or Belief of his Doctrine, that it was that which <hi>shook their hopes,</hi> and <hi>dasht their expectations</hi> out of countenance: their Hearts died in his Death; and <hi>those two</hi> expressed the Sense of more than their own diffidence, Luk. 24. <hi>We trusted that it had been he that should have redeemed</hi> Israel.

               </p>
               <p>There are four things which I shall offer, any one of which cleared up, will shew the vanity of this Period.</p>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>The Blood of Christ,</hi> is not called <hi>the Blood of Sprinkling, which speaks better things than the Blood of</hi> Abel; only <hi>in allusion to the Sprinkling of that Blood which confirmed the Mosaical Covenant:</hi> There is a further, a higher design in the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>The Blood of</hi> Abel <hi>cried to God from the Earth, for vengeance</hi> upon the Head of <hi>Cain;</hi> and with the same importunity does the violation of every Law of God sollicite Divine Justice against the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour; and that with great justice: For the same
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:105027:295"/>
God, who hath establisht his Holy Law, <hi>in the Promise, Do this and live,</hi> hath bound, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it also with the threatning, <hi>If thou sinnest thou shalt die.</hi> Such dreadful things did the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> (shed in defiance of the Law) speak to God; But O what sweet, how much better things does the Blood of Christ speak! It speaks better things to the Justice of God, than if the Sinner himself should suffer his utmost Indignation: It speaks better things to the Law, than if the Sinner had felt the weight of its severest Curse: It speaks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to the Conscience, than if we had wrought out our inward Peace by our own Righteousness: It satisfies God's Justice, answers the Law, and quiets the Conscience: And in reference to this use of the Sprinkling of Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> the Atoning, and Reconciling of God, is the Blood of Christ, called <hi>the Blood of Sprinkling;</hi> and to this the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, Heb. 11. 28. <hi>By Faith</hi> Moses <hi>kept the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the Sprinkling of Blood, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed the first-Born might not touch them.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle evidently points to Exod. 12. 14. <hi>The Blood shall be to you a token upon your Houses, and when I see the Blood, I will passe over you, and the Plague shall not be upon you.</hi> v. 21, 22. <hi>Kill the Passeover, and you shall take a Bunch of Hyssop and dip in the Blood, and strike the Lintel, and the two side-Posts, and none of you shall go out of his House until the Morning.</hi> Now here are several things observeable: 1. That it was <hi>a respect to the Blood of the Paschal-Lamb duly used and applyed,</hi> in consideration whereof God would <hi>not destroy them</hi> with the rest. 2. That if they expected <hi>any benefit from that Blood,</hi> they must abide <hi>under the shelter and protection</hi> of it. 3. This
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:105027:295"/>
Blood must be sprinkled upon <hi>the Lintel,</hi> not upon the <hi>Threshold,</hi> to mind them, (as the Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) that they ought not to <hi>trample it under their Feet:</hi> And surely that Blood which turns away the deserved wrath of God from <hi>their head,</hi> might claim more reverence than to be trampled <hi>under their feet.</hi> 4. That this Blood thus sprinkled was considerable in God's eyes, as it was <hi>the Blood of such a Lamb, so chosen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> exprest by the Blood of Sprinkling.</hi> Sprinkling was <hi>one way,</hi> and <hi>but one</hi> way of employing <hi>the Blood of the Sacrifices:</hi> but it must be shed, before it could be sprinkled, and <hi>therefore sprinkled,</hi> because it had been <hi>shed as a Sacrifice.</hi> What-ever <hi>other use</hi> there was of the Blood of Sacrifices, yet <hi>the efficacy</hi> of all was derived from this, that that Blood had been <hi>once shed at the Altar, Lev.</hi> 17. 11. It was <hi>Blood upon the Altar</hi> (and that not merely as Blood,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:105027:296"/>
but as it was <hi>the Life-Blood of the Sacrifice substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the room of the offender</hi>) that made an <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Souls.</hi> And this is evident in that the Blood of many of the Sacrifices for sin, atoneing, expiating Sacrifices, were <hi>not sprinkled,</hi> but only shed at the Altar: What an unrighteous dealing is this then <hi>with the Blood of Christ,</hi> to <hi>allot</hi> it no service but only <hi>the Confirmation of a Covenant,</hi> because it's called <hi>the Blood of sprinkling?</hi> whereas <hi>the Blood of the Sacrifices of old as it was sprinkled, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press all the ends and uses of the Blood of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. That which comes home to our Author is this: <hi>The whole design of the Blood of sprinkling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Blood of the Sacrifice was sometimes sprinkled <hi>

<pb n="605" facs="tcp:105027:296"/>
would conclude, that it was <hi>not used to confirm a Covenant,</hi> because <hi>the other half was not imployed for that use.</hi> (2.) Another use of the Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice sprinkled, was <hi>to procure the favour of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 21, 22. where we read: 1. That all <hi>these Lambs, Bullocks, Rams, Goats, were offered to God at the Altar;</hi> Hezekiah <hi>commanded the Priests to offer them on the Altar.</hi> 2. That when the Blood <hi>had been shed at the Altar,</hi> it was <hi>afterwards sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Altar.</hi> 3. To shew that <hi>the great operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood</hi> (even as sprinkled) was by vertue of his having been <hi>once shed at the Altar.</hi> The <hi>two Goats of the Sin-Offering were only slain by the Priests,</hi> after they had <hi>laid their hands on them,</hi> and thereby <hi>laid the sins of the People upon them,</hi> in their <hi>Typical way;</hi> but their Blood was <hi>not at all sprinkled upon the Altar,</hi> and yet the <hi>greatest efficacy</hi> is ascribed to them <hi>as the Sin-Offering.</hi> 4. The design of all <hi>these Sacrifices,</hi> their <hi>Offering upon the Altar,</hi> the <hi>shedding and then sprinkling of the Blood;</hi> is said to be <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>to make Reconciliation with their Blood upon the Altar and to make Atonement for all</hi> Israel. 5. And that none might harp upon the old humour, that surely <hi>the People were fallen out among themselves,</hi> were all <hi>in Mutiny and Civil-Wars,</hi> and this Blood was <hi>to reconcile them,</hi> and make them friends; We are told, <hi>It was for all</hi> Israel, <hi>for the Kingdom, the Sanctuary, for Iudah,</hi> for Church and State, Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: All had offended God, and this was <hi>the Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way</hi> of recovering his favour, and regaining a Communion with him in his Temple. (3.) The Blood was sprinkled also <hi>for Purification and Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> Lev. 14. 5. Answerable hereto, God has promised in the Covenant of Grace, that he <hi>will</hi>
                  <pb n="606" facs="tcp:105027:297"/>

The Blood was sprinkled <hi>before the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat,</hi> Lev. 16. 15. When the Priest had shed the blood of the Sacrifice at the Altar, and offer'd it to God, he carries in some of the Blood into the most Holy place, and <hi>by that Blood intercedes with God</hi> for the People: Thus our Lord Jesus, when by the <hi>once offering of himself</hi> he had made an Atonement with God for sin, discharges <hi>the other great part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>confirming a Covenant;</hi> whereas considered <hi>as the Blood of sprinkling,</hi> it has <hi>far greater and higher ends,</hi> and yet <hi>the Blood as sprinkled,</hi> comprehends <hi>not the whole design</hi> of that Blood.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But yet supposing, That <hi>all the ends of the Death of Christ</hi> were wrap't up in that one expression [the Blood of sprinkling] and supposing also that the <hi>Blood of the Sacrifices as sprinkled,</hi> had no <hi>other end or use</hi> but the <hi>confirming of a Covenant;</hi> yet how
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:105027:297"/>
will this prove his main Assertion, That <hi>we owe the Covenant of Grace to the Death of Christ?</hi> All that will follow is, <hi>that we owe</hi> the <hi>Confirmation of the Covenant</hi> to it, <hi>and only the Confirmation</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and then <hi>another thing</hi> will follow too, that <hi>we do not owe the Covenant it self</hi> to it, unless he can prove that <hi>procuring</hi> and <hi>confirming</hi> are Terms of <hi>the same importance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The advantage our Author has got by this way of Reasoning is, that he has found out a way how <hi>to own all Scripture-Expressions,</hi> and yet accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them to <hi>his own preconceived Opinions.</hi> [1.] Hence (says he) <hi>we are said to be justified by the Blood of Christ, Rom. 5. 9. That is, by the Gospel-Covenant which was confirmed, and ratified by his Death:</hi> To which I Answer. 1. If we may be said to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by his Blood,</hi> because his Blood <hi>confirmed the Covenant,</hi> then we may be said <hi>more properly</hi> to be justified <hi>by his Miracles;</hi> for they indeed had <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, direct, immediate, and sufficient evidence</hi> in them to <hi>confirm the Doctrine</hi> which he Preacht; and it's <hi>a Miracle</hi> almost as great as any of them, that the Scripture should <hi>never once intimate</hi> that we are <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Miracles,</hi> which <hi>directly and properly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Doctrine;</hi> and yet constantly affirm it of his <hi>Death,</hi> which <hi>directly and properly confirmed it not.</hi> 2. Then also, <hi>with the same propriety of Speech,</hi> we may be said to be <hi>justified by the Blood of the Martyrs,</hi> which was a convincing Testimony that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Doctrine to be true; and then the old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Rhime will come in fashion again: <hi>Tu per Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae sanguinem quem pro te impendit, Da nos Christe scandere, quo Thomas ascendit.</hi> 3.

                  <hi>is called Grace;</hi> as being <hi>the product of mere Grace,</hi> and contains <hi>the Methods of God's Grace</hi> in the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and recovering of <hi>Sinners.</hi> The word <hi>Grace</hi> signifies either <hi>the free Love and Favour of God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, or <hi>the effects of that Grace</hi> for us, or upon us: and thus <hi>the Revelation of God's Mind and Will,</hi> being <hi>one of the Effects</hi> of Grace, may be called <hi>Grace.</hi> But now that <hi>the Grace of God</hi> is the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> that is, <hi>the Revelation of God's Mind and Will,</hi> is not true: <hi>Grace</hi> is larger than <hi>Gospel-Revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The <hi>Gospel</hi> reveals <hi>more Grace</hi> than what consists <hi>in Revelation.</hi> But he argues thus: <hi>The Gospel of Christ is called Grace,</hi> therefore <hi>the Grace of God is called the Gospel:</hi> as if he would conclude, that because <hi>every man is a living Creature,</hi> therefore <hi>every living Creature is a Man.</hi> But I wonder why any should pray so earnestly for <hi>true Repentance and the Holy Spirit,</hi> if Grace signifie <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>the Revelation of the Gospel?</hi> which a Man may purchase, filleted, and guilded for five Shillings: And all the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Christians <hi>for Grace,</hi> signifie no more but that we may have <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> which <hi>is Grace</hi> indeed but not <hi>all the Grace</hi> promised in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 2.

But here our Author has relieved himself from his old Artifice which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed him: the forceing Scripture over to him, when he is lazy, and will not stir a step to go to the Scripture. The Text speaks its own Language thus: <hi>These things are written that ye might believe that Iesus is the Son of God, and believing ye may have life through his Name;</hi> where the Evangelist says not, <hi>They are justified by believing that Iesus is the Son of God,</hi> but that having <hi>first satisfied their Faith</hi> from Scripture that Jesus is the Son of God, (which Truth being well studied, well digested, and improved, will give us a marvelous light into the Mystery of the Gospel, and without which, the whole of the Gospel is involved in eternal Night)
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:105027:302"/>
and <hi>then believing,</hi> they <hi>have eternal Life through his Name,</hi> by his satisfactory Blood and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the Authority which he has thereby with the Father. But believe it, here is harder work than all this behind; for our Author will propound se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Questions, and when he has done answer them. 1. <hi>Quest.</hi> What is it to believe that Christ is the Son of God? Ans. <hi>That is,</hi> (says he) <hi>That Messiah, and Prophet whom God sent into the World.</hi> Very good! Now as I remember <hi>p.</hi> 4. he told us, <hi>That Christ was anointed to be the Messiah at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> (let the Reader examine it): Now if to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> be to <hi>be the Messiah,</hi> and that he was <hi>not the Messiah till his Baptism,</hi> then he was <hi>not the Son of God</hi> till <hi>his Baptism;</hi> and then for about 30 years he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a mere Man;</hi> and yet this is a great favour I assure you, for <hi>his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> was about three or four years <hi>before his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and then they are to blame who will suspect this Principle to be Socinian: well! But yet <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Christ to be the Son of God, is to believe him to be the Messiah!</hi> Ay, But there's one odd misadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more in the thing; that is, that <hi>Hebrew</hi> is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier than <hi>Greek;</hi> for if <hi>Messiah</hi> explain <hi>Christ</hi> any better, I am very much out in my reckoning. Some from hence will pretend to give us a Scheme of our Author's Faith about <hi>the Deity of Christ;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps should they deal with him as he has dealt with others, or half so uncharitably, it would be found dissonant to what he professedly owns in subscribing the three Symbols of Faith: but I see no reason to fix an Opinion upon any Man that he will not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avow. 2. <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is the Messiah? Ans. Why, <hi>The Prophet whom God sent into the World to</hi>
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:105027:303"/>
                  <hi>reveal his Will to us:</hi> To believe him to be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> is to believe him to be <hi>the Messiah,</hi> and to believe him to be <hi>the Messiah</hi> is to believe him to be <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and that is (as near as I can measure it) <hi>just one third part</hi> of his Mediatory Employment. Surely he has mean thoughts of his Reader's Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, or great presumptions upon their good-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or a high esteem of the persuasiveness of his own Rhetorick, that can hope to proselyte them into a belief (without one Argument) That <hi>the Son of God</hi> signifies no other than <hi>Messiah,</hi> Messiah no more than <hi>Prophet,</hi> and that the Prophetical-Office of this Messiah, is the just, compleat Object of our Faith. 3. <hi>Quest.</hi> But what does this Belief of Christ to be <hi>the Messiah, the Prophet,</hi> include? Ans. <hi>A general Belief of the Gospel which he preacht:</hi> most rare Divinity! I suppose we may be saved upon very cheap terms by and by: For 1. <hi>A general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Gospel,</hi> will serve the turn to <hi>justify <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> well enough, that is as far as Faith has ought to do in Justification. If <hi>Faith</hi> believes Christ to be <hi>the Messiah,</hi> that is, <hi>a Prophet whom God sent to reveal his Will to us,</hi> it has got <hi>a general Belief of the Gospel,</hi> which may be without understanding in particular <hi>one syllable</hi> of what Christ has revealed <hi>of his Father's Will;</hi> and then I suppose, <hi>a general Obedience</hi> will serve well enough for <hi>a general Faith.</hi> 2. We may believe Christ to be <hi>the Messiah,</hi> yet if we believe not also what <hi>that Person is,</hi> in whom <hi>the Office of Mediator</hi> resides, we shall understand very little of its <hi>Nature, Dignity, and Efficacy.</hi> To believe Christ to be Anointed, signifies very little unless we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand also <hi>who it is</hi> that is so Anointed.

because <hi>he was raised from the Dead;</hi> and if <hi>the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> his <hi>Doctrine must needs be true,</hi> be it what it will, though we know nothing of it. 2. It may be enquired whether <hi>such a general Belief that God raised up Iesus from the Dead,</hi> be a true <hi>justifying Faith?</hi> If it be: An <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> will serve tum for all the Particulars of the Gospel; and this would save abundance of needless pains that men take in reading of, meditating upon the Scriptures: and now instead of <hi>the Colliers Faith,</hi> who believed <hi>as the Church believed,</hi> at all adventures, right or wrong, he has introduced another full as easie, <hi>The Belief of the Resurrection of Christ from the Dead:</hi> A Faith happily contrived for the <hi>Genius</hi> of this sparing Age, which saves us <hi>two parts in three</hi> of Christ's <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>eleven parts in twelve</hi> of our <hi>very Creed.</hi> 3. Let it be modestly examined also, whether <hi>To be justified through Faith in the Blood of Christ,</hi> and to be <hi>justified by believing that God raised up Christ from the Dead,</hi>

                  </gap>e expressions of the same importance? If they be: then we may be said to be <hi>reconciled to God by the Resurrection,</hi> and that Christ in being <hi>raised from the Dead,</hi> was <hi>made sin for us,</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice for sin;</hi> and it's something strange that none of the Apostles could hit upon such expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as might recommend them, and their writings to our Author's Charity. 4. Let it be considered also, whether Christ's Resurrection was <hi>the last Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he gave to confirm the Truth of the Gospel:</hi> I think his <hi>visible Appearance</hi> to his Disciples after his Resurrection, and <hi>those Miraculous Operations</hi> he then put forth; his <hi>Ascension into Heaven,</hi> whilst his Disciples looked on; his <hi>pouring out the Spirit</hi> upon the Apostles, enabling them <hi>to speak with Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi>

his empowering them <hi>to work Miracles</hi> many years after <hi>his Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> were all Confirmations of the Truth of his Gospel, and <hi>all subsequent</hi> to his Resurrection. 5. Let it have a place in our Thoughts too; seeing Christ's Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was <hi>the great Confirmation of his Doctrine,</hi> without which all the rest, and especially his Death, had been <hi>no Confirmation</hi> of it, and yet <hi>Atonement, Propitiation, Reconciliation, Redemption</hi> are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to <hi>it,</hi> whether the Death of Christ, <hi>to which all these are ascribed,</hi> have <hi>an Influence upon our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God,</hi> only as it <hi>confirms his Doctrine?</hi> It is strange that the Apostles should word matters <hi>so crosly,</hi> to attribute those things <hi>to the Death</hi> of Christ, which do most properly belong to <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> and those things to <hi>the Resurrection</hi> which do most properly belong to <hi>his Death.</hi> And all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as strange that our Author should make such a noise with <hi>Atonement, Reconciliation, Redemption,</hi> and ascribe all these to his Death, when-as <hi>upon the sole-Reason</hi> of his Ascribing them to <hi>that Death,</hi> they are <hi>much more rationally</hi> applicable to <hi>his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> There are some well-meaning Souls no doubt that have read our Author's Book, who finding such Glorious things ascribed to the Death of Christ; <hi>Iustification by his Blood, Redemption by his Blood, Reconciliation by his Blood,</hi> lift up their Eyes and cry out, What pitty it is that such a sweet young Gentleman that has written such a precious Piece, of <hi>Union, Communion, Sacrifice, Atonement, Redemption, and Reconciliation,</hi> stuft so full with Orthodox Propositions, should be taken upon sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion for a Socinian? and yet when we come to scan these fine words, they prove nothing but a

               <p>He goes on: <hi>Hence is it also that the Apostles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute such things to the Blood of Christ, as are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and immediate Effects of the Gospel-Covenant, and therefore all the Blessings of the Gospel are owing to the Blood of Christ, because the Gospel-Covenant it self was procured and confirmed by the Blood of Christ.</hi> I am now perfectly cured of my Ambition to be one of the Corporation of your Rational Divines: and if this be Reason, I do by these presents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it for ever. Here are two words, [Hence] and [Therefore] which always pretend to infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and conclusion: I shall examine how well they make good their Pretences. First [Hence] I pray whence? Out of what Premises is this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion deduced? That <hi>the Apostles attribute such things to the Blood of Christ, as are the Proper and Immediate Effects of the Gospel-Covenant?</hi> Let us look back as far as fairly we may. <hi>To be justified by Faith, by the Faith of Christ, by Christ, by his Blood, &amp;c.</hi> signifie <hi>one and the same thing:</hi> and <hi>Hence it is</hi> that <hi>the Apostles attribute such things to the Blood of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> And really turn it <hi>quite backwards</hi> and it will conclude as strongly. <hi>The</hi>

                  </hi> it is, that <hi>To be justified by Faith, by the Faith of Christ, by Christ, by his Blood, &amp;c. signify one and the same thing.</hi> Now when he can once bring matters into this Posture he is safe, and out of the Gun-shot of Reply, for which way soever you come to attaque him, you must deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. But let us leave out the [Hence,] and consider the words <hi>absolutely.</hi> The <hi>Apostles attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute such things to the Blood of Christ as are the proper and immediate Effects of the Gospel-Covenant:</hi> To which I answer: 1. It's just as easie for another (if he had but a Licence) to say, <hi>The Apostles attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute such things to the Gospel-Covenant, as are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and immediate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Effects of the Blood of Christ;</hi> and with better Reason, because <hi>whatever acceptation</hi> our Services and Duties, our Repentance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience find with God, is clearly assigned to <hi>the Blood of Christ.</hi> But 2. This is a foul scandalous slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he throws upon the Apostles; they give to the Blood of Christ its <hi>own proper and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Effects:</hi> they rob not <hi>Repentance and Obedience</hi> to adorn the Sacrifice of Christ with <hi>borrowed Plumes.</hi> They give to <hi>Christ</hi> the things that are <hi>Christ's;</hi> and to <hi>Faith, Repentance; and Obedience</hi> the things that are <hi>Theirs.</hi> They ascribe our <hi>Redemption</hi> to the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> as a <hi>proper Price paid to God;</hi> and they ascribe to Faith its own Efficiency to interest us in <hi>the Benefits</hi> of that <hi>Redemption.</hi> They ascribe <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to the Blood of Christ, as <hi>its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate &amp; proper Effect,</hi> without any <hi>intervening Act of the Creature</hi> for <hi>that End;</hi> and they ascribe to Faith, Repentance, and Obedience their proper and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

Concerns, to put us into the actual and full Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all <hi>the Fruits of that Reconciliation</hi> made with God: They attribute <hi>Pardon of Sin</hi> to the Blood of Christ, who <hi>was made sin for us, an expiatory Sacrifice</hi> to remove guilt, that is, the Obligation of the Sinner to punishment; and they attribute the Application of that Pardon unto Individuals, unto Faith, as that whereby we receive Christ and all his Benefits. 3. If these be <hi>the proper and immediate Effects</hi> of the Covenant, and not of the Blood of Christ; What should move the Apostles always to speak <hi>improperly,</hi> to affix <hi>Reconciliation, Atonement, Redemption,</hi> &amp;c. to the Blood of Christ, and never <hi>to our Obedience?</hi> when yet we are <hi>neither properly</hi> reconciled, <hi>properly</hi> redeemed, nor God <hi>properly</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned by Christ's Blood, but all these are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effects of <hi>our Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now one word to the [Therefore] And <hi>therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>All the Blessings of the Gospel are owing to the Blood of Christ, because the Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it self was procured, and confirmed by the Blood of Christ:</hi> A very learned Argument! that is to say; <hi>We owe the Blessings of the Gospel</hi> to that which is <hi>no true and proper cause of them. The Blood of Christ</hi> is <hi>not the proper Cause</hi> of our Justification, therefore we owe <hi>our Iustification</hi> to it: His Blood is <hi>not the proper Cause of our Reconciliation,</hi> and therefore we are <hi>indebted to his Blood</hi> for our Reconciliation. All <hi>Effects</hi> are <hi>owing</hi> to their <hi>proper Causes;</hi> whatsoever therefore is <hi>the proper Cause of our Iustification,</hi> to that we are <hi>indebted</hi> for it: But how naturally would this Conclusion follow from his Premise? The Blood of Christ is <hi>not the proper Cause of Iustification, Reconciliation, and Redemption;</hi> and therefore we
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:105027:306"/>
                  <hi>do not owe</hi> our Justification, Reconciliation, and Redemption to the Blood of Christ: Or thus; We <hi>owe all the Blessings</hi> of the Gospel to <hi>the Blood of Christ,</hi> and therefore the Blood of Christ is <hi>the proper Cause of those Blessings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now let the Reader observe, how his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son brought up <hi>in the Rear,</hi> has routed his Reason that marched <hi>in the Van.</hi> The Blood of Christ <hi>is not the proper Cause of the Blessings of the Gospel:</hi> there's your Reason <hi>in the Front,</hi> why we do <hi>not owe the Blessings of the Gospel to it.</hi> And again: <hi>The Gospel-Covenant was procured and confirmed by it;</hi> There's your Reason <hi>in the Rear,</hi> why <hi>we do owe the Blessings of the Gospel to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to do our Author justice, I shall look over these things more severely. <hi>The Gospel-Covenant it self</hi> (says he) <hi>was procured by the Blood of Christ.</hi> And does not this sound <hi>more honourably</hi> for the Blood of Christ, than to say it <hi>only confirm'd a Covenant?</hi> To <hi>procure</hi> (if we might measure the import of the Word by its sound) implies that the Blood of Christ had <hi>some Influence upon God,</hi> that moved him to enter into such a Covenant with Mankind, which <hi>without that Consideration</hi> he had never done; but to <hi>confirm a Covenant,</hi> that supposes there was such <hi>a Covenant in being,</hi> only the Blood of Christ <hi>gave security to Men</hi> that it should be made good: So that if we know when <hi>we are well,</hi> we had best <hi>keep our selves so,</hi> and sit down contented with this <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Honour and Efficiency</hi> ascribed to the Blood of Christ, that it <hi>procured</hi> as well as <hi>confirmed the Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> lest whilst we labour to engross <hi>more than is due,</hi> we lose what <hi>the Charity of our Author has given us:</hi> But they who think they have <hi>right to All,</hi> will hardly be perswaded <hi>to be put off with</hi>

                  <hi>half;</hi> and therefore I must a little further enquire into this new-start-up Notion of <hi>procuring the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> What this <hi>Gospel-Covenant is,</hi> which our Author so frankly attributes to <hi>the Procurement of Christ's Blood,</hi> he has told us <hi>p.</hi> 320. <hi>A Promise of the Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life to those who believe, and obey the Gospel:</hi> I confess a clear and distinct Notion of what <hi>he calls Gospel,</hi> would very much befriend us in our Enquiry: The best I can find, (and it's but a half-faced one neither) is <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>To preach Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>is to preach his Gospel,</hi> that is, <hi>to expound all those Rules of Life, and Articles of Faith, which are contained in it:</hi> Whether this be Gospel or no I shall not enquire, or whether this be <hi>the Covenant of the Gospel</hi> I shall not torment him with; but this is that which Christ has <hi>procured</hi> for us with his Blood, <hi>A Promise of Pardon, and Life to those who believe, and obey all that's revealed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> either in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or the <hi>Four Evangelists,</hi> or in <hi>one of Christ's Sermons,</hi> (I think that must be it) Now I must here entreat the Reader to open his Eyes and see how he has been cheated all this while. (1.) It's very well known he propounded a Question at first, <hi>What In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Righteousness of Christ's Life, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his Death have upon our Acceptance with God?</hi> To this he answers separately <hi>concerning the Death of Christ and its Influence;</hi> and will come all in good time to shew us, <hi>What Influence the Righteousness of his Life hath upon God for that End.</hi> Concerning <hi>the Influence of his Death,</hi> he has been perswading us that it <hi>confirms the Covenant;</hi> and now in the Close he has stollen-in a Word we never dreamt of, that i <hi>procures this Covenant:</hi> Now I suspect some fraud; for <hi>what Influence</hi> has the Death of Christ
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:105027:307"/>
upon God to <hi>procure us such a Govenant?</hi> Had he shew'd us <hi>that,</hi> he had deserved better of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than by all this Amusing Sophistry.</p>
               <p>(2.) He has told us, <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>That the Light of Nature, the Works of Creation and Providence do assure us, that God designs the Happiness of all his Creatures according to their Capacities;</hi> (and they are capable of being justified and saved): <hi>And that God is so Holy, that he has a Natural Love for all good Men, and is as ready to pardon them when they return to their Duty, as a kind Father is to receive a Humble, and Penitent Prodigal:</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>Had Christ never appeared in the World, yet we had reason to believe that God is thus good and merciful.</hi> Now having such good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> Reason being clear in the Point, and the thing <hi>so natural, and essential to God,</hi> that he <hi>will pardon,</hi> and is <hi>ready to it,</hi> upon <hi>Repentance and Obedience,</hi> though <hi>Christ had never</hi> appear'd; what has <hi>the Death of Christ done,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this Favour <hi>or more Favour</hi> from God? We will grant that the Death of Christ <hi>has confirmed the Truth of it more,</hi> but what has it added to <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of the thing?</hi> If it be said that Christ's Death did <hi>not procure a Willingness in</hi> God <hi>to Pardon,</hi> but only <hi>a Confirmation of his Willingness:</hi> I would ask what <hi>greater Confirmation</hi> a rational Creature could well desire, than an Assurance from <hi>the Light of Nature,</hi> that this was <hi>Natural and Essential</hi> to God? And I would further know, what the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing</hi> of a Confirmation amounts to more than <hi>a Confirmation?</hi> (3.) The Scripture has assured us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. That God gave an explicite Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would <hi>be his God,</hi> or <hi>a God to him:</hi> that is, that whatever Abraham <hi>should want,</hi> and yet <hi>could not want</hi> but he must be <hi>eternally miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
                  <pb n="628" facs="tcp:105027:308"/>
that thing <hi>God would be to him:</hi> For 'tis an uncouth Interpretation of the Promises: <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> that is, I will be <hi>nothing to thee,</hi> do <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for thee,</hi> of what thou <hi>mainly wantest;</hi> but for all <hi>my Promise,</hi> to <hi>be thy God,</hi> I will suffer thee <hi>to lye under the guilt of Sin at present,</hi> and to fall <hi>under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Condemnation here-after;</hi> though thou <hi>walkest before me, and art perfect.</hi> If then there was such <hi>an Implicite and Virtual Promise</hi> in <hi>God's Nature,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by <hi>the works of Creation and Providence to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> and <hi>an Explicite one too</hi> in the <hi>particular Revelation,</hi> that God would bestow <hi>Pardon of Sin and Eternal Life</hi> to those who <hi>walkt before God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uprightness:</hi> The Question is, How did Christ <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> such <hi>an Engagement</hi> from God, when it was <hi>procured before?</hi> But supposing that there was <hi>never any such Promise</hi> made by God till Christ <hi>by his Death procured it;</hi> then how did the <hi>Death of Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God</hi> to make such <hi>a Promise,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he had <hi>never made?</hi> (4.) But I suspect more than ever, that we are merely gulled: for he tells us, That <hi>the Blessings of the Gospel are the proper Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Covenant,</hi> but <hi>not of that Blood of Christ:</hi> so <hi>that we are justified by the Blood of Christ,</hi> is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly false,</hi> but <hi>improperly true;</hi> that <hi>we are Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Blood of Christ,</hi> in an <hi>improper Sense,</hi> may be <hi>said</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> but in a <hi>proper Sense</hi> is <hi>utterly false;</hi> and then if the Apostles had <hi>penn'd their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles clean backward,</hi> they would have been <hi>properly true,</hi> whereas <hi>now</hi> they are <hi>properly false:</hi> And now who can tell but when he says <hi>The Blood of Christ procured this Covenant,</hi> he may not mean in some <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper odd Sense</hi> that is not worth a Button?</p>
               <p>But yet our Author seems to go <hi>higher</hi> than all this, <hi>p.</hi> 330. <hi>Our Righteousness and acceptation with</hi>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:105027:308"/>
                  <hi>God it wholly owing to the Covenant, which he hath</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased <hi>&amp; sealed with his Blood.</hi> To <hi>Purchase</hi> is a very <hi>good word</hi> when applied to <hi>the Blood of Christ,</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore because we meet with <hi>so few</hi> I shall make <hi>as much of it</hi> as I can: It denotes <hi>procurement</hi> in a <hi>special way</hi> by <hi>a valuable price paid;</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> then Christ has <hi>purchased;</hi> that Covenant is <hi>a Promise of Pardon and Life to those who believe and obey the Gospel.</hi> In this Covenant there are <hi>three things.</hi> First, <hi>the Material part, the pardon of sin, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>conditional part,</hi> Faith and Obedience. Thirdly, <hi>The form</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>A Promise</hi> of the <hi>Material part</hi> upon <hi>performance</hi> of the <hi>Conditional part.</hi> Now when he owns <hi>the Blood</hi> of Christ to have <hi>purchased</hi> this Covenant; the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether <hi>the whole or some part</hi> of it only? <hi>If not the whole,</hi> then <hi>what part</hi> is the purchase of his Blood? 1. For <hi>the Conditional</hi> part, <hi>Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> I may secure my self, our Author will not put them into <hi>the particular of the purchase;</hi> for then it would be scarce worth the while to mingle Heaven and Earth with Tragedies, <hi>what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant</hi> should be if Christ <hi>had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the conditions themselves,</hi> and therefore as to these, let every <hi>man trust to himself.</hi> 2. As for the <hi>Material</hi> part, <hi>Pardon, and Life.</hi> I doubt our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not yield us neither that Christ has <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them,</hi> because he denies that <hi>the Blessings of the Gospel,</hi> are the <hi>proper effects</hi> of Christ's Blood; whereas had he <hi>purchased them with his Blood</hi> they would have been <hi>the proper</hi> effects of it. 3. Then it remains, that Christ has purchased a Promise of bestowing <hi>the Material part,</hi> upon <hi>our performance of the Conditional part;</hi> And thus we are just where we were two miles ago, and these great words of

                  <hi>purchasing and procuring</hi> are <hi>shrivel'd up</hi> to <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Promise;</hi> but if he will say that <hi>the Blood of Christ, his Death,</hi> and dreadful <hi>sufferings</hi> were <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per price paid to God,</hi> to <hi>procure</hi> or <hi>purchase</hi> a <hi>word from God</hi> that he would do that which was <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>essential to him,</hi> then we shall thank him, that he has <hi>such honourable thoughts</hi> of it, as to judg it <hi>worth a good word:</hi> The Scripture every-where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes <hi>the Blessings of the Gospel</hi> to the <hi>purchase and procurement</hi> of the Blood of Christ; but if this <hi>be all,</hi> that he has got a <hi>word from God,</hi> it supposes the the Scripture to swell with <hi>Scenical Language, and high Tragical Phrase;</hi> which seems to carry <hi>sublime matters in it,</hi> but when it comes to be stript of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor and Allegory is a mere Anatomy. From <hi>this precarious Hypothesis</hi> that the <hi>Apostles always write like himself,</hi> that is, <hi>improperly and impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and attribute <hi>such things to the Blood of Christ which are the proper and immediate effects of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant,</hi> he will <hi>unriddle</hi> to us many <hi>Mysteries which are vulgarly reputed</hi> matters of <hi>weight and worth;</hi> but if we can spare him a little Patience, he will so uncase them, that we shall confess, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing that may <hi>deserve or need the Blood of Christ,</hi> or <hi>any great matter</hi> to be made about them. [1.] Concerning <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> The Apostle had said, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Iesus Christ, and hath committed to us the Ministry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us the word of reconciliation,</hi> v. 21. <hi>For he hath made him to be sin for us:</hi> what the import of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>to reconcile,</hi> is, will not create us any great trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:105027:309"/>
our Author allowing <hi>a reconciliation</hi> to be made <hi>between Iew and Gentile,</hi> secretly confesses that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> implies the taking away of <hi>an enmity,</hi> and bringing the differing parties into <hi>a state of Peace</hi> and <hi>Friendship:</hi> But the Apostle in this place instructs us further. 1. That <hi>the proper effect</hi> of this <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> is [not-imputing Trespasses]. God is <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Holy God,</hi> as he is <hi>Governour of the World,</hi> he is a <hi>Righteous Iudg;</hi> sin is both <hi>Contrary to his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Law:</hi> And therefore <hi>as a Holy God,</hi> he cannot but <hi>hate sin;</hi> as a <hi>Righteous Iudg</hi> he cannot but <hi>punish sin:</hi> And because this sin is <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in,</hi> and committed <hi>by Man,</hi> God <hi>hates the sinner</hi> upon the Account of <hi>his sin; his Person</hi> and his <hi>best services, are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> From hence it follows, that sin being <hi>a transgression of the Law,</hi> in its <hi>preceptive part,</hi> renders the sinner <hi>Guilty,</hi> that is, <hi>obnoxious and lyable to the Law in its Sanction,</hi> to <hi>the punishment.</hi> Now this <hi>Righteous Iudg</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>charge the guilty sinner</hi> with the <hi>penalty due</hi> to his sin, but there is a way found out that he may <hi>be reconciled,</hi> and <hi>not impute to sinners their Trespasses:</hi> and this clearly shews that the Reconciliation here spoken of, is <hi>a reconciliation of God to the Sinner;</hi> such a one as makes provision that God shall <hi>not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute iniquity.</hi> 2. The Apostle instructs us further <hi>in the way whereby</hi> Christ made this Reconciliation of God, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>He was made sin for us;</hi> that is, he was constituted to be <hi>a sin-offering,</hi> upon whom <hi>the Guilt and Punishment of our sin being laid,</hi> the great obstructions to Reconciliation, God's Justice and Holy Law, being removed (by being satisfied), a way is cleared for <hi>a new Peace with God.</hi> And the Apostle as hath been observed, cites this from <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>When he shall make his Soul an offering for sin</hi>

That <hi>the Preaching of this Reconciliation made with God,</hi> to the World, was committed to the Ministers of the Gospel, that they as Ambassadors from God, might treat with them also about their being reconciled to God; which farther evinces a <hi>mutual Enmity,</hi> and <hi>a mutual Reconciliation;</hi> that God <hi>reconciled the World to himself by Iesus Christ,</hi> whom God <hi>made to be sin,</hi> for <hi>that great end,</hi> and then establisht a Ministry to Preach the Doctrine to the Sons of Men, and to deal with them in the Name of Christ, that they would also lay aside their Malignity, and accept of the Reconciliation procured by the Blood of Jesus: Now this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made with God respects <hi>the Gentiles and Iews equally;</hi> for some might plead that it was the <hi>peculiar priviledge of the Iews,</hi> as being the only Church of God, to enjoy the benefit of <hi>propitiating Sacrifices:</hi> others might think to do the Jews <hi>a kindness</hi> in pleading that <hi>Reconciliation only belonged to the Gentiles,</hi> for they alone <hi>were Enemies</hi> to God, and therefore <hi>they only</hi> needed it; but the Apostle assures us that <hi>Iews</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles</hi> had <hi>need</hi> of <hi>a Mediator of Reconciliation,</hi> and that Gentiles as well as Jews had <hi>a share</hi> in the Grace, and mercy of it: <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Thus the Apostle <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>But now in Christ Iesus ye who sometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Christ.</hi> v. 16. <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one Body by the Cross.</hi> Now here our Author meets us with a window open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Soul, that we may see the Pulse of his heart, and what he understands by Christ's <hi>reconciling the World to God.</hi> That is (says he) <hi>the Gentiles were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the fellowship of God's Church, and the</hi>

That he must <hi>be made sin,</hi> have <hi>Iniquities charged upon him,</hi> to make them friends? That there have been Wars, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwixt <hi>the Iews and their Neighbours,</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both sacred and prophane, abundantly testify; there are such amongst most Neighbouring Nations: But shall we think that God will send his Son into the World to compose all the bickerings that ever were in the World? But suppose there had been <hi>a Necessity</hi> of it, was the feud so inveterate that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Death of him that came to make Peace could take it away? must every Man dye a <hi>Cursed Death</hi> that comes to make up a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two wrangling <hi>Neighbours</hi> or <hi>Nations?</hi> few would be ambitious to be Plenipotentiaries upon such Terms.

seems strange that God should first <hi>Create a necessity</hi> of a quarrel; and then put his Son upon <hi>a necessity</hi> to remove it at so dear a price as his own Blood. 3. If our Author was once i'th' right, there was no <hi>great need</hi> of removing these Ceremonies, for (says he) <hi>p.</hi> 29. <hi>The rest of the World might when they pleased fetch the best Rules of Life, and the most certain noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Divine Will</hi> from the Jews; so long then as they might have a fairer Copy of <hi>their Moral-Law,</hi> they needed not be beholden to them for their <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> But the bottom of the business is this and no other: The Scripture is most express that Christ is said <hi>to reconcile us to God by his Blood, by his Death,</hi> &amp; it would be a burning shame to deny it: What is then to be done? First, it's resolved on, that it's not to be <hi>endured,</hi> that any of <hi>the Blessings of the Gospel</hi> be allowed the <hi>proper effects of his Death or Blood;</hi> why then, <hi>some wholsome expedient</hi> must be found out that <hi>the expression</hi> may be owned, and yet <hi>the thing it self rejected:</hi> And the best that can be thought on at present is this, To imagine <hi>a most terrible War</hi> between Jews and Gentiles, upon the Account of <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> such as set the whole World on a Flame, and involved <hi>all Mankind</hi> in the dreadful Combustion; not <hi>a single Person</hi> in all the World but sided in <hi>with one of the parties:</hi> And now if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we could but be Masters of so much Confidence as to say that Christ came, and dyed, and was made a Curse to make these <hi>two Parties friends,</hi> there would be something that might be <hi>called Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now upon a serious view of the premises, it was observed that the Jews had <hi>some marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> whereby they were <hi>priviledged above,</hi> and <hi>differenced from the rest of Mankind:</hi> Now <hi>a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> you know sometimes signifies a <hi>Quarrel,</hi>

which fell out as luckily as heart could wish; and therefore <hi>these tokens of difference</hi> shall be called <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> and <hi>Christ's taking away this difference,</hi> shall be called <hi>the removing of the Enmity,</hi> and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Reconciliation:</hi> yes, there it must go, if any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: for I see and am glad to see it, that our Author is willing to carry <hi>some fair Correspondency,</hi> and not to fall out flat with <hi>the Death of Christ.</hi> Now (says he) <hi>This Union of Iews and Gentiles is owing to the Gospel which takes away all marks of distinction; and gives them both equal right to the Blessings of the New-Covenant.</hi> But, 1. To what purpose was the <hi>Enmity removed</hi> between <hi>Iew and Gentile,</hi> if <hi>the Enmity of God against both</hi> had not been removed; all <hi>Union on Earth</hi> without <hi>Peace, without Heaven,</hi> is but <hi>a wicked confederacy.</hi> 2.

As the Redemption <hi>by Price</hi> is always Seconded with <hi>deliverance by Power;</hi> so deliverance <hi>by Power</hi> presupposes <hi>Antecedent Redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Price:</hi> But here it is commonly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That if the Blood of Christ be a proper Price, then <hi>it ought to be paid to the Devil, the world, or Sin, for these held the Sinner in Captivity.</hi> To which I Answer, true; if Satan detained the Sinner Prisoner <hi>in his own right,</hi> if Souls were <hi>his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per spoyls,</hi> acquired by right of War, or otherwise; but the Devil is onely <hi>an Officer of Divine Iustice,</hi> a Goaler, and <hi>Executioner of the Sentence of the Law:</hi> The World may pass for one of his <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Keepers.</hi> As for sin <hi>that's the bondage and slavery it self.</hi> If then <hi>God be satisfied,</hi> in <hi>whose right,</hi> as the <hi>great Law-giver,</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> these Sinners are held in bondage, though Satan repine, and gnash his Teeth, he must quit his Prey and Prisoners. It is said again, that <hi>then upon the payment of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the price to God, the sinner is immediately set free:</hi> But no Reason compels us to Argue so; for the Price of Redemption being not paid to God <hi>by Man himself,</hi> but <hi>a third Person, a Mediator between them both:</hi> It's not onely <hi>convenient,</hi> but <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> that he submit to <hi>such Terms</hi> as shall be agreed upon <hi>between God and the Mediator,</hi> that he may <hi>actually enter</hi> upon the benefits <hi>of that Price paid:</hi> Besides, it's necessary he should be so qualified as to Glorifie both <hi>the Redeemer, and the free-grace of that God</hi>

                  <hi>that accepted a Redeemer;</hi> and there are many of <hi>the greatest benefits</hi> of Redemption that would <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing</hi> to the sinner if it were possible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him invested with them, without a previous change in his Nature, enabling him to enjoy them: But yet it will be said, and is said by others of our Authors Judgment, who have managed these things with a greater appearance of cunning than himself: That however then, <hi>this Price should have been paid to God,</hi> which (say they) it was not; but we are confident that it was, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Iesus, who gave himself a price of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for all.</hi> Now, if Christ <hi>gave himself as a price of Redemption</hi> as <hi>Mediator between God and Man,</hi> he must either give it <hi>to God,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> (for <hi>as Mediator</hi> he stands onely between <hi>these two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>) How absurd it is that he should pay it <hi>to Man,</hi> needs not many words to evince; it remains therefore that he paid it <hi>to God himself:</hi> But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> puts that out of dispute in the place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consideration: For he tells us, that we were <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot;</hi> whence it appears, that <hi>Christ was the true Sacrifice chosen by God, immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> to be <hi>the real sin-offering;</hi> and that he was <hi>Offered to God as the Lamb was.</hi>

               <p>A particular consideration of the Text will set that strait which he had made crooked: And 1.

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle shews <hi>the true means</hi> whereby the Gentiles were brought nigh to God; <hi>Ye who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of Christ:</hi> It was <hi>Christs blood alone,</hi> by which the great impassable gulph was filled up that was between God and his Creature by sin; for <hi>Christ is our Peace.</hi> 3. That the Gentiles might not Object, that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ceremonial Hedges and Fences that kept them off from enjoying the Priviledges of those who were reputed the onely Children of God: He removes that small Objection, telling them Christ had <hi>already removed</hi> them in <hi>his Flesh,</hi> in <hi>his Person;</hi> he was <hi>the summe and substance of them:</hi>

                  <hi>Tree.</hi> 4. The Apostle shews <hi>the way, and means of promulgating this Peace</hi> which he had made with God; and that was by <hi>the publick Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>He Preached Peace;</hi> he <hi>made Peace with God,</hi> and then <hi>Preached it to the Gentile World:</hi> He that had <hi>procured good will towards men,</hi> Preaches <hi>Peace on Earth.</hi> How little ground now had our Author to say, <q>That we are said to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the Preaching of the Gospel, <hi>when</hi> the Preaching of the Gospel is nothing but a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Redemption which Christ has made of Jew and Gentile with God, and the way and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to be partakers of the benefit of it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now to draw to a close of this Matter, let us re-view our Authors Doctrine of Redemption: <hi>The Redemption of Iew and Gentile</hi> he makes to differ as much as <hi>the Faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and that of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ in <hi>the matter of Redemption,</hi> that which they were <hi>Redeemed from:</hi> The Jews they were Redeemed from <hi>the Ceremonial Law,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles they were Redemed <hi>from Idolatry, and impure practises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in <hi>the manner of procurement;</hi> for the Jews, <hi>Christ</hi> (says he) <hi>by his Death put an end to that Legal Dispensation;</hi> and so their turn is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that little Redemption that they needed, which is all our Author can afford them, was Actually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht by <hi>the Death of Christ,</hi> which was <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and immediate cause of their Redemption,</hi> (such a one as it was;) but then the Gentiles they were Redemed <hi>after another fashion,</hi> by <hi>the Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> whereby they were <hi>turned from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> and <hi>impure practises.</hi> And this shall be called
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:105027:318"/>
                  <hi>Redemption,</hi> because it were dangerous to ascribe it to <hi>the blood of Christ</hi> (for an Obvious Reason that he knows of;) but because the Scripture says <hi>we are Redeemed by the Blood of Christ,</hi> and gives that Blood a concernment therein; therefore to <hi>stop the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>uth of the Scripture,</hi> it shall be said, <hi>we owe the Preaching of the Gospel</hi> to the blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>[3.] There is one thing more, from whence our Author flatters himself with hopes of <hi>great success;</hi> and that is by <hi>mis-representing the Analogy</hi> between <hi>the Iewish Sacrifices,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Two things he attempts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To shew <hi>what it is under the Law, to which the Death of Christ, his Ascention into Heaven, and presenting his Blood to God,</hi> does Answer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What it is under the Law to which his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession Answers:</hi> Which project of our Authors has been contrived, and managed with a great deal <hi>more subtilty</hi> by those who would storm, or blush, to see their Arguments thus miserably abased.</p>
               <p>(1.) To the former of these, he expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus. <q>Now as the Death of Christ upon the Cross, and his Ascention into Heaven, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Blood to God in that most Holy place did answer to the first sprinkling of the Blood under the Law, which confirmed the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Covenant, as the Apostle Discourses, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. &amp;c.</q> In which <hi>few words</hi> he has heaped up <hi>more absurdities, and follies</hi> than another must hope to bring <hi>into twice as many.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is a supposition of Christs <hi>presenting his Blood to God in Heaven</hi> distinct <hi>from his Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which when he shall offer to prove, it may be time to consider it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="654" facs="tcp:105027:319"/>2. He supposes that <hi>Christs Ascention into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven answered the first sprinkling of blood under the Law:</hi> A most ridiculous supposition! For what is there <hi>in sprinkling</hi> that answers to <hi>Ascention,</hi> or bears <hi>the least Analogy</hi> to it? Surely these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that <hi>create such parallels,</hi> and fancy such <hi>uncouth resemblances,</hi> must have some <hi>mad design</hi> in their Heads, which nothing will <hi>subserve</hi> but such <hi>forced allusions:</hi> And I do not now wonder that he should so <hi>tediously rail</hi> at the use of <hi>Allusions</hi> in <hi>others,</hi> for they will deserve <hi>the most of scorn</hi> that can be thrown upon them, if they be all <hi>like his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>the Death of Christ upon the Cross did Answer the sprinkling of Blood under the Law which confirmed the Covenant,</hi> is very true: but then, 1. It must be remembred <hi>in what respect it confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenant,</hi> not <hi>meerly as a witnessing to the Truth of what he has preach'd,</hi> but as <hi>Answering the demands, and claims of the Governing Iustice of God,</hi> as we have before shewed. 2. It must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred also that it was <hi>not such a Covenant</hi> as he has imposed upon us, but <hi>the true Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein God promises <hi>to give that</hi> which our Author will <hi>not own;</hi> the <hi>New Heart, New Spirit,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience.</hi> 3. That <hi>to confirm a Covenant,</hi> was not <hi>all the design of it's sprinkling,</hi> but <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the wrath of God,</hi> procuring <hi>his favour,</hi> &amp;c. So the Blood of Christ has <hi>greater ends</hi> than <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth</hi> he taught, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>appeasing Gods just displeasure, procuring his Actual Love, pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conscience, cleansing the Soul.</hi> 4. He supposes also that <hi>the Apostle Discourses to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> Rom. 9. which is to make the Apostle <hi>acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory</hi> to his own groundless fopperies, who is indeed
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:105027:319"/>
                  <hi>perfectly innocent of these crimes.</hi> For, 1. <hi>The sprinkling of the blood,</hi> which the Apostle mentions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. in that mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 6. Now, there was <hi>another sprinkling of blood Antecedent to that,</hi> which we read of, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. to which <hi>the blood of Christ did Answer,</hi> and to which <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle refers,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. 2. <hi>The sprinkling of Blood,</hi> Heb. 9. 19. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with that <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 6. shews evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that as <hi>the whole concern of the blood sprinkled</hi> at that time, was not <hi>confirming a Covenant,</hi> but <hi>Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God:</hi> So <hi>the whole concern of the blood of Christ,</hi> is not taken up <hi>in confirming a Covenant,</hi> much less such <hi>a thing</hi> as he will <hi>mis-call a Covenant,</hi> but in <hi>Reconciling God to Man,</hi> paying <hi>a price of Redemption to God,</hi> &amp;c. 3. That the Apostle carries another Argument is evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, 1. The <hi>Typical Interest</hi> which those Sacrifices had in Redemption, were accomplish'd <hi>before the Blood was carried in to the Holiest place,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Neither by the blood of Bulls and Goats, but by his own Blood he entred into the most Holy place, having obtained eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> Thus Christ <hi>had obtained</hi> eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>perfected the whole</hi> work of it (as far as <hi>the paying of a price to God</hi> goes in the Matter) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ascention;</hi> and that which remained, was <hi>the application of the benefit</hi> of what he <hi>had procured with God,</hi> to us, by his <hi>prevailing Intercession:</hi> And as to the blood of the Sacrifices mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 6. which the Apostle refers to, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. which our Author thinks had <hi>no other use</hi> but <hi>the confirming of the</hi> Mosaical <hi>Covenant,</hi> it was <hi>never carried into the most Holy place at all,</hi> nor the blood of <hi>any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> but <hi>onely that upon the Feast of</hi>
                  <pb n="656" facs="tcp:105027:320"/>
                  <hi>Expiation</hi> once a year. 2. The Apostle in this Chapter, does not <hi>onely refer</hi> to the sprinkling of the Blood of the Sacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. but to <hi>the sprinkling of the blood of the Red Heifer,</hi> Numb. 19. 4. <hi>Eleazer shall take of her blood</hi> (the red Heifer <hi>without blemish, and without spot,</hi> ver. 2.) <hi>and shall sprinkle it directly before the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:</hi> To which the Apostle expresly refers, <hi>ibid. v. 12. If the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the ashes of a Heifer sprinkling the unclean Sanctifieth to the purifying of the Flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit Offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God, purge your Consciences from Dead works?</hi> And this blood was <hi>neither carried into the Holy place,</hi> nor <hi>the Ministration of the Service</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>the High-Priest,</hi> but by <hi>Eleazar:</hi> which proves, 1. That <hi>the blood of Christ</hi> had <hi>all its ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue</hi> on this side his entrance into Heaven; and 2. That Christ was <hi>Typified by the inferior Priests,</hi> and not by the High-Priest alone: For here <hi>not Aaron,</hi> but <hi>Eleazar</hi> performed the Service of the Day. 3. The Apostle clearly Disputes against this Figment of <hi>Christs presenting his blood to God in Heaven,</hi> (which the Men of this leaven, will needs have to be all the Sacrifice that Christ Offered to God) <hi>ver. 25, 26. Nor yet that he should Offer himself often, for then he must often have Suffered.</hi> No <hi>Offering</hi> without <hi>Suffering:</hi> But Christ <hi>Suffered but once,</hi> therefore he <hi>Offered but once.</hi> Nay, says the Apostle, <hi>Now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</hi> That which Christ <hi>did once</hi> he does <hi>not do always;</hi> but if Christs <hi>appearing before God in Heaven,</hi> be the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of himself in sacrifice,</hi> he does it <hi>always to the end of his Mediatory Kingdom.</hi>

               <p>Notwithstanding all this our Author will not be beaten out of it, but that <hi>he and his principles are better friends to the blood of Christ,</hi> than those men that pretend to magnifie it: for they attribute <hi>no more to it than the non-imputation of sin; that Christ by his death, bearing and undergoing the punishment that was due to us, paying the ransom that was due for</hi>

                  <hi>us, delivered us from this condition (the wrath, and curse of God and his whole displeasure,</hi> &amp;c.) But now our Author ascribes much more than all this comes to; For (says he) <hi>the Scripture gives us a different account of it, we are said to be justified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of Christ, nay we have boldness to enter into the Holiest by the Blood of Iesus; we have admission into Heaven it self, but the Doctor</hi> (Owen) <hi>says, that the Blood of Christ makes us innocent, but cannot give us a right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> And now what comparison is there between these two? The summe of the business is this: Our Author attributes <hi>perhaps more</hi> to the Blood of Christ in <hi>wordy complement,</hi> but what the Doctor ascribes to the Death of Christ, <hi>he does in reality:</hi> Our Author will confess, that <hi>we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the Blood of Christ;</hi> but when you come, (as all that are not Children will come) to examine what he means by it, then it shrinks into this: <hi>Christ by his Death confirmed the Promise of Pardon and Life to them that Believe and Obey,</hi> and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise he has appointed to be <hi>declared to the world,</hi> and when men <hi>believe it, and obey the Gospel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> they are <hi>then Redeemed;</hi> Christs death is <hi>no immediate, no proper Cause</hi> of Redemption, <hi>no price</hi> pay'd to God, accepted <hi>by him</hi> for poor Captive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Nay our Author will not stick to say, <hi>We are justified by the Blood of Christ too,</hi> but when you come to <hi>sift</hi> his Notion, it's <hi>all bran;</hi> he <hi>confirmed</hi> the Promise, which when <hi>we believe,</hi> and <hi>obey the Gospel Commands,</hi> we are justified; so that in my weak Judgement, it had beeen commendable in our Author, to have been very sure that he attributes <hi>any thing at all</hi> to the Death of Christ, as the <hi>proper</hi>

                  <hi>Cause</hi> of that Mercy, before he enter'd into <hi>Degrees of Comparison</hi> with others; something I do perceive indeed he would attribute to Christs Death, <hi>Viz. The confirming of a certain Covenant,</hi> but so feebly asserted, so weakly proved, that it needs the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Reader: But now what doe these other men attribute to the blood of Christ? Why Nothing but <hi>Non-Imputation of Sin, bearing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the Punishment that was due to us, paying the Price that was due for us; delivering us from this Condition, (The Wrath, Curse, and whole displeasure of God,) and that by the Death of Christ, all Cause of Quarrel and Rejection is taken away:</hi> And if this be <hi>Nothing</hi> in our Authors Arithmetick, we desire he will <hi>ascribe more</hi> to it, if he can <hi>justifie it</hi> when he has done: But the truth is, our Author is most grievously gulled in this business; He reads their Writings who are <hi>too crafty for him,</hi> and smile to see <hi>how little</hi> he understands of them: Though these men attribute <hi>no more</hi> to <hi>the blood of Christ as shed on the Cross,</hi> yet they are willing to let him know, that they attribute more to <hi>the Blood of Christ</hi> than <hi>as it was shed on the Cross:</hi> The <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> and <hi>the Death of Christ,</hi> are <hi>not Expressions</hi> of <hi>equal latitude:</hi> All the Concerns of Christs Blood are <hi>not comprehended</hi> in <hi>his Death;</hi> for they consider it as that <hi>in the virtue whereof</hi> he intercedes for them upon the Throne of Grace; as that which gives them <hi>a holy and humble boldness to draw nigh to God,</hi> the Quarrel being removed by his Death: And that our Author may see his own delusion herein, I shall give him <hi>a short Collation</hi> from that person whom he contends with: <hi>Exercit. on Heb. Vol. 2. p. 99.</hi> 
                  <q>There are Two general Ends of Christs
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:105027:323"/>
Interposition: 1. <hi>Averruncatio Mali,</hi> the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of all Evil, hurt, dammage, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the Account of our sins, and Apostacy from God: 2. <hi>Acquisitio Boni;</hi> or, the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obtaining for us, every thing that is good, with respect to our Reconciliation to him, Peace with him, and Enjoyment of him; and these are intended in the general parts of his Office. For, 1. His Oblation principally respects the making Atonement for sins, and the turning away Gods wrath, which is due to Sinners, wherein he was Jesus the Deliverer, who saves us from wrath to come. And this is all that is included in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Oblation, as absolutely considered; but it had a farther Prospect, for with respect to that Obedience which he yielded to God therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Terms of that Covenant, betwixt the Father and Christ, it was not onely Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but Meritorious; that is, by the Sacrifice of himself, he not onely turned away the wrath of God that was due to us, but also obtained for us Eternal Redemption, with all the Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto belonging.</q> And now if our Author will but ascribe <hi>any of all these things</hi> to <hi>the blood of Christ,</hi> as <hi>its proper and immediate Cause;</hi> he may hope to perswade the world, that he is willing to ascribe <hi>something</hi> to the Blood of Christ I know well he will say, That <hi>the Blood of Christ is said to Redeem us,</hi> is <hi>said to Iustifie us;</hi> these are <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Phrases</hi> indeed, the <hi>sound of words</hi> carries it thus; but when he comes to open <hi>the Meaning of things,</hi> the Blood of Christ does <hi>neither</hi> redeem, nor <hi>justifie us,</hi> but after <hi>multitudes of Deductions,</hi> and great <hi>windings of Inferences,</hi> and Conclusions,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:105027:323"/>
one upon the Neck of another; it does <hi>that,</hi> which does <hi>another thing,</hi> which procures <hi>a third,</hi> which leads to <hi>a fourth,</hi> which brings us <hi>to believe,</hi> that <hi>Belief</hi> may possibly bring us to <hi>Obedience,</hi> and when all is done, it's <hi>our Obedience that justifies us:</hi> And we <hi>owe our Acceptation with God</hi> to our <hi>own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and he is <hi>more inclined to think, that nothing can justifie us, rather than to own it due to the Righteousness of Christ imputed,</hi> as he expresses himself, <hi>p.</hi> 272. And now at length he once more casts up his Reckonings: <hi>Our Righteousness, and Acceptance with God, is wholly owing to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he has purchased, and sealed with his own blood.</hi> What a rare sound does that word <hi>purchase</hi> carry with it? But, 1. He has purchased no more, than that we shall be Pardoned and Saved, if we Believe and Obey, without <hi>any Ability</hi> purchased <hi>to Believe and Obey.</hi> 2. Christ did <hi>not purchase any one single, spiritual Benefit</hi> for us, as the Cause of it, <hi>immediate and proper.</hi> 3. He purchased No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that he <hi>may lose the whole Benefit</hi> of his Purchase. 4. Obedience will <hi>as soon</hi> save us <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Blood of Christ</hi> as with it: <hi>Lesser Obedience</hi> with that Blood, is <hi>not more acceptable</hi> to God than <hi>Greater</hi> without it: But this he will call <hi>an Influence</hi> upon our Acceptation with God. I confess, he is a Free-man, for ought I know, and may call, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Things,</hi> as he has done <hi>Persons</hi> at his pleasure, but surely no man whose understanding is his own, would ever call this <hi>an Influence upon our Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God; A contingent, uncertain Influence</hi> it may have upon <hi>our Obedience,</hi> but none at all upon <hi>the Acceptation of our Obedience.</hi> An act of Love to God, is <hi>as welcome and acceptable</hi> to God at this
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:105027:324"/>
rate, <hi>without Christ</hi> as <hi>with Him:</hi> But this is the Misery of it; when Men must say <hi>something,</hi> and yet cannot tell well what to say, but either <hi>on the one hand</hi> they must flie in the Face of the Scripture, which they <hi>hardly dare do;</hi> or else <hi>on the other hand</hi> renounce their beloved Errors, which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved <hi>never to do;</hi> then must the Scriptures be wrested to <hi>their crooked Sentiments,</hi> instead of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying their <hi>crooked Notions</hi> by the straight Rule of the written Word.</p>
               <p>[2] Having now Informed us <hi>what Influence the Death of Christ has upon our acceptance with God,</hi> it remains that he Instruct us <hi>with equal Ingenuity,</hi> what <hi>Influence the Righteousness of his Life has upon God, for the same end?</hi> But here he will be to seek, for having assigned <hi>in words</hi> so much to the <hi>Death of Christ,</hi> there is nothing left <hi>for his Life.</hi> No matter upon which it may work; but seeing all the former <hi>was in pretence,</hi> there is Employment enough for it left still.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though the pardon of sin, and our justification, be attributed</hi> (says he) <hi>to the blood of Christ, yet I could never persuade my self that this wholly excludes the perfect obedience, and righteousness of his life:</hi> He cannot <hi>persuade himself;</hi> very strange! what <hi>had he attempted</hi> to satisfie his judgement about <hi>the exclusion of Christs righteousness,</hi> and yet could he not be persuaded? yes, <hi>persuaded he was to exclude it,</hi> but <hi>not wholly</hi> to exclude it, there were <hi>some rubs,</hi> and <hi>little scruples</hi> in the way, that he could <hi>not get over:</hi> but had he <hi>improved</hi> his own principles, and built upon his own foundation, I could have shewn him <hi>a way</hi> how he might <hi>wholly</hi> have excluded it, for p. 243. he gives it us as a Note worth our observing
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:105027:324"/>
                  <hi>that in the whole New Testament there is no such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peession as the Righteousness of Christ;</hi> And p. 78. he lays it down as an infallible maxime; <hi>That we cannot draw any one conclusion from the person of Christ, which his Gospel hath not expresly taught;</hi> seeing then we cannot <hi>safely draw any such conclusion from Christs Person,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly taught it,</hi> what should hinder him from a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory in this point, <hi>wholly to exclude</hi> that from his Creed, which is <hi>not expresly taught</hi> in the Scripture, and therefore may <hi>not be drawn from the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Person by consequence.</hi> And if his scruples had been but <hi>as strong</hi> against <hi>the righteousness of Christ,</hi> (or he had been in the scrupling mood) as against <hi>the justification of Abraham by the righteousness of Christ,</hi> this matter had been put out of doubt with him <hi>wholly</hi> long before this. In the mean time, <hi>The righteousness of Christ</hi> is mightily beholden to his good Nature, that when <hi>by his principles</hi> he might, yet out of civility he <hi>would not,</hi> and therefore <hi>could not wholly</hi> exclude it: <hi>Some Place, some Room</hi> it shall have, some <hi>Remote and Improper</hi> causality, as the <hi>Death of Christ had</hi> in our Acceptation with God: But what may be the Reason why he could not <hi>altogether,</hi> as well as <hi>almost exclude it?</hi> O, he tells us, that the Apostle tells him, <hi>Ephes. 1. 6. That we are accepted in the Beloved.</hi> And is this <hi>the great difficulty?</hi> Alas, one of his Wedges would make this <hi>little Knot</hi> flie at the <hi>first stroke:</hi> May there not possibly be given <hi>another meaning of it?</hi> Must it <hi>needs</hi> be Interpreted of <hi>Acceptation</hi> through the <hi>active Obedience</hi> of Christ? This would have done the work. Or thus, Our acceptation is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>the Obedience of Christs Life,</hi> because that
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:105027:325"/>
has <hi>a great Influence</hi> upon us to make us <hi>Obedient,</hi> which is <hi>that Righteousness</hi> for which we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. The <hi>Example</hi> of Christ has given us <hi>a Pattern</hi> of Obedience, which when we <hi>Imitate,</hi> we are accepted of God; but what now if he had played one of <hi>his Omnipotent Machines</hi> against the Text, he might have Batter'd down the Conclusion with ease. By the <hi>Beloved,</hi> is meant <hi>Christ,</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> is meant the <hi>Gospel;</hi> by the <hi>Gospel</hi> is meant <hi>Obedience,</hi> and then the sence is no more but this; <hi>We are accepted in the Beloved,</hi> that is, <hi>We are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for our selves.</hi> And I must needs say, this had been a far more Rational Course, than that he has taken with the Death of Christ: Ay, but (says he) <hi>whatever rendred Christ beloved of God, did contribute</hi> something <hi>to our Obedience:</hi> Something? That's a huge Kindness indeed; There's a vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between <hi>something</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> and yet it may be <hi>such a something,</hi> as is next to <hi>nothing.</hi> Well, we are glad of <hi>a little</hi> till we can get <hi>more:</hi> For <hi>because he was beloved of God, we are accepted for his sake:</hi> That's high, and surprizing. But still, <hi>What kind of Cause was Christs Obedience of our acceptance?</hi> One of the Poorest, Lowest causes in the World, is one that they Nick-name a <hi>Causa sine quâ non;</hi> which yet is <hi>properly no cause</hi> at all; And yet our Author when time was, could tell us, <hi>pag. 43. That had Christ never appeared in the World, yet we have reason to believe God is thus Wise, Good, and Merciful, to forgive us our sins, when we return to our Duty:</hi> Such a Cause was the Death of Christ of our acceptance. Pag. 46. <hi>Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring such a Sacrifice as the Death of Christ for the Expiation of our sins, was not because he could</hi>
                  <pb n="667" facs="tcp:105027:325"/>
                  <hi>not do otherwise.</hi> If now we might have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted without his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> I presume we might have been so without <hi>his Obedience;</hi> and then it is not so much as <hi>that little nothing</hi> of a <hi>Causa sine quâ non:</hi> But this is pure Trifling; For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was, <hi>What Influence Christs Righteousness has upon our acceptance with God?</hi> He answers, That <hi>because Christ was beloved, we are beloved for his sake.</hi> That is, Christs Obedience <hi>has an Influence</hi> upon our acceptance; but what that Influence is, remains <hi>a Secret:</hi> Suppose the Question had been, <hi>Why are we accepted for Christs sake?</hi> The answer might have been, <hi>His Obedience has an Influence upon our acceptation.</hi> Those two words, [Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Sake,] are like <hi>two Rackets,</hi> that Toss the Ball <hi>from one to another,</hi> to the end of the Game: However, <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> under our present Circumstances; I would gladly know, <hi>What that Influence is?</hi> Why, He <hi>thinks no man will deny that God was very highly pleased with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience of our Saviours Life.</hi> Truly, I think so too, and perhaps it may be the last time that we shall be both of a mind: But yet to put it upon <hi>thinking,</hi> is a more cunning way of Tempting our unbelief to appear against it. Had it been a truth wherein our Authors affections had been <hi>bespoke,</hi> I doubt not but we should have had better Proof than <hi>his thinking,</hi> or standing to the <hi>Courtesie of mens denyal:</hi> But still, still the Difficulty presses us: Why God should be <hi>ever the more</hi> pleased with <hi>our Obedience,</hi> because He <hi>was pleased with Christs?</hi> For if <hi>no consideration</hi> be had of Christs Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Justification of a sinner, as that which God accepts for <hi>our Non-obedience,</hi> I do not
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:105027:326"/>
see, but God had been as <hi>well pleased</hi> with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>without Christs</hi> Obedience, as <hi>with it:</hi> The Obedience of Christ was a Transient thing, it's past and gone long since, and how it should <hi>come in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> before God, at this day, that for <hi>the sake of it,</hi> we should find savour in his Eyes; is (without the Doctrine of Imputation) very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.

                  <q>We know (<hi>says he</hi>) how many Blessings God bestowed upon the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> for the sake of their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who were great Examples of Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which made them very dear to God; and there is no doubt but God was more pleased with the Obedience of Christ, than with the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore we ought not to think that we receive no Benefit by the Righteousness of Christ, when <hi>Abrahams</hi> Posterity was so blessed for his sake.</q> I have several humble Propositions to make upon this Discourse. 1. <hi>We ought not to think that we have no benefit:</hi> But how shall we do to know what <hi>that Benefit is? Great or Small, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or Temporal?</hi> Must we content our selves with <hi>thinking?</hi> Surely, we have <hi>some benefit,</hi> if we could but tell <hi>what it was:</hi> It may be, we <hi>may want that benefit;</hi> and may have it for asking, for <hi>his sake,</hi> and yet still we must <hi>not know what it is;</hi> or it may be <hi>some small</hi> benefit that cannot be seen <hi>without a Microscope;</hi> such it <hi>may be,</hi> and yet <hi>answer</hi> all the <hi>necessary Import</hi> of his words. 2. <hi>We ought not to think that we have no benefit:</hi> But have we the <hi>benefit of acceptation with God?</hi> For that was the Question, if I have not forgotten,
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:105027:326"/>
as well as our Author: So that though we should be <hi>so charitably credulous</hi> as to take it upon one of our Authors <hi>Say-soes,</hi> and <hi>Thinkings,</hi> that we have <hi>some benefit</hi> by it, yet if it be not the <hi>very benefit</hi> under Dispute, it's monstrously Impertinent. 3. <hi>We ought not to think:</hi> But what if we <hi>do think so?</hi> With what argument will he compel us to alter our Judgments? For I see this is his Device, when he has no mind to a Truth, to lay the Proof of it upon <hi>thinking,</hi> and a <hi>well fortified fancy.</hi> 4. Let us now examine his Similitude: <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed many Blessings upon Israel, for the sake of their Fathers.</hi> But, 1. VVere they <hi>accepted of God, Pardoned, Iustified,</hi> for their <hi>Fathers sake?</hi> If not, How will it follow, that we <hi>are Accepted, Pardoned, Iustified, for the sake of Christs Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> because they received <hi>some common Favours</hi> for the sake of <hi>Abraham?</hi> 2. VVould God give them <hi>any blessings</hi> for their <hi>Fathers sake,</hi> unless they walked <hi>in their steps?</hi> If not, then they were <hi>not accepted</hi> for their <hi>Fathers obedience-sake,</hi> but for <hi>their own:</hi> For why should they need <hi>the sake</hi> of their Fathers Obedience, to procure them Blessings for their Obedience, more than <hi>their Fathers needed</hi> the sake of another to procure them Blessings for their Obedience? But if so, that <hi>God did give them many blessings for their Fathers sakes,</hi> though they walked <hi>not in the steps</hi> of their Faith, and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Obedience: That is indeed to the purpose, but then it will be in danger of proving that God may give us Gospel blessings <hi>for Christs sake,</hi> though we <hi>walk not in his steps.</hi> Indeed we read, that when <hi>Israel</hi> was <hi>most unworthy,</hi> and had provoked God most, that God did <hi>remember his Covenant made</hi>
                  <pb n="670" facs="tcp:105027:327"/>
                  <hi>with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob,</hi> and God may have <hi>special Favours</hi> too for sinners, who personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered <hi>are unworthy of the least Mercy,</hi> which some will call <hi>the Imputation of Christs Obedience.</hi> 3. The true account of those Favours which God bestowed upon <hi>Israel</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> saké, is this: God had made a Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> That is, That <hi>in the Messiah</hi> which should come of his Line <hi>by Isaac,</hi> there should be a <hi>Blessedness or Happiness,</hi>) provided for the miserable undone VVorld: This Promise was afterwards clear'd up to <hi>Iudah,</hi> that the Messiah should be conveyed to the VVorld by <hi>his Tribe;</hi> this being <hi>an absolute, irrevocable Promise,</hi> that God would out of <hi>that People, that Tribe,</hi> deliver a Saviour to the VVorld: It was necessary that God should <hi>preserve that Tribe, that People,</hi> out of which the Messiah was to come; and as it was necessary for <hi>the truth of the Promise,</hi> that that Tribe should be <hi>continued in being,</hi> so was it <hi>necessary</hi> for the <hi>evidencing of the fulfilling of the Promise,</hi> that that Tribe should be continued in <hi>some considerable state of Visibility</hi> in the VVorld; that so <hi>the Promise</hi> might not only be <hi>made good in it self,</hi> but that it might be <hi>made out</hi> that it <hi>was made good,</hi> to the Conviction of Gain-sayers. This was the Reason why, when <hi>Iudah</hi> had sinned, and God Corrected them, yet still <hi>He remembred this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> he left <hi>his People a Lamp for Davids sake,</hi> on this account that People escaped <hi>utter Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when they were upon the borders of Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To this <hi>Zachary</hi> imputes <hi>the giving of the Messiah,</hi> Luke 1. 72. <hi>To perform the Mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to our Fathers, and to remember His holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
                  <pb n="671" facs="tcp:105027:327"/>
                  <hi>The Oath which he Sware to our Father Abraham.</hi> 4. Perhaps this may be some account of it: The Covenant which God <hi>made with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he made with <hi>his Seed also,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed. Abraham</hi> therefore, and <hi>his Seed,</hi> were but <hi>one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to <hi>that Gracious Covenant;</hi> and therefore God in his Providential Dispensations dealing with them <hi>as one Body,</hi> the Obedience, Holiness of <hi>Abraham the Head,</hi> was considered as <hi>the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Holiness of the Body,</hi> so far at least as to <hi>turn away temporal Evils,</hi> and <hi>procure temporal Mercies:</hi> And if this be so, we may consider <hi>Christ and Believers</hi> as one <hi>Mystical Body,</hi> and God in Covenant with Christ <hi>their Head,</hi> and in him <hi>with them,</hi> and then our <hi>Authors Argument</hi> will <hi>hold,</hi> though his <hi>Cause break:</hi> If God <hi>for the sake of Abrahams imperfect Obedience, yet as he was the Head of the League,</hi> gave <hi>so many temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to Israel;</hi> surely then, God for the sake of Christ, <hi>the Head</hi> of all that the <hi>Father hath given him,</hi> will bestow <hi>Spiritual and Eternal Mercies;</hi> for, the <hi>Head and Members making but one Body,</hi> the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>the Head,</hi> is reputed the <hi>Obedience of the Members:</hi> And as the <hi>Blessings</hi> which God bestows <hi>for Christs sake,</hi> are Transcendently <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eater,</hi> than those bestowed on <hi>Israel</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake; so is the <hi>Obedience</hi> which Christ performed upon it's own <hi>account,</hi> and the <hi>Dignity of the Person,</hi> infinitely beyond <hi>the imperfect Obedience of Abraham;</hi> and the <hi>Union which</hi> Faith makes with Christ is <hi>a stricter Union,</hi> than any <hi>Natural, Civil, Political Union,</hi> that could possibly be, between <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity. Thus I have endeavoured <hi>to Vindicate</hi>
                  <pb n="672" facs="tcp:105027:328"/>
                  <hi>our Authors Argument;</hi> but I am sure he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it should <hi>perish,</hi> than be thus <hi>justified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is it not strange, our Author should tell us, That <hi>he knows how many Blessings God bestowed upon the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>for their Fathers sakes,</hi> and yet not acquaint us with <hi>one single Blessing</hi> that God bestows <hi>on us</hi> for <hi>Christs sake?</hi> For <hi>the sake of Christs Personal Obedience?</hi> I wish I had so much Interest in any Friend of his, that had that Interest in him to perswade him to acquaint us freely, and open-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, <hi>what those blessings are,</hi> and how procured? Why, just now he comes to it: <hi>The Righteousness of his Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death, both serve to the same end to establish, and confirm the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant: God was so well pleased with what Christ did and suffered, with the obedience of his Life, and Death, that for his sake he entred into a Covenant of Grace with Mankind.</hi> Very good, what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this Circumlocution, and Periphrase? To beat about, and about the Bush? Had it not been more Civil to have given us our doom in plain <hi>English,</hi> than to Tantalize us with sugared hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of some great matter from <hi>Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob?</hi> Some would say, 1. That this ascribes <hi>more Influence</hi> to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience than thus to Christs; for God <hi>for the sake of</hi> Abraham's <hi>Active Obedience entred into a Covenant with</hi> Israel, and chose them to be <hi>his peculiar People,</hi> without <hi>the Death of Abraham:</hi> but <hi>the Obedience of Christs Life, and Death,</hi> must <hi>both concur</hi> to procure <hi>this Covenant;</hi> and yet it is <hi>such a one,</hi> as I suppose God would not refuse upon <hi>as small an account</hi> as the sake of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. Some will say, this is <hi>not to Answer</hi> the Question, but <hi>perplex</hi> it: The
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:105027:328"/>
Question at first was, <hi>what influence the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christs Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death have upon our acceptation with God?</hi> He Answers, <hi>They serve to establish the Covenant;</hi> they <hi>confirm to us, that God will pardon, and save us if we believe and Obey:</hi> but what if I Obey <hi>without such confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> shall my Obedience be <hi>rejected</hi> without it <hi>be performed</hi> upon <hi>that Confirmation?</hi> Ay, but <hi>God entred into this Covenant of Grace for Christs sake:</hi> Still I say that's <hi>not an answer,</hi> but the bandying the Question upon us again a hundred times over: <hi>Why should his Life and Death</hi> have <hi>such an influence</hi> upon God to make that Covenant? Why should they Operate that way? What connexion is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christs <hi>active and passive Obedience,</hi> and such a Covenant? But sure we forget our selves, for we are enquiring into the influence of Christs Active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: And</p>
               <p>(1.) For <hi>Confirming a Covenant;</hi> let any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man satisfie me how <q>The Obedience of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son perfectly holy, pure, spotless, sinless, being accepted of God should prove this promise, <hi>That</hi> therefore God will accept them whose best Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is imperfect, and defective.</q> This is so far <hi>from confirming it,</hi> that God will accept <hi>me,</hi> who am <hi>a Sinner,</hi> that it leads to <hi>utter dispair of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with him; seeing I came <hi>so infinitely short</hi> of my pattern: What hope can <hi>a sinner</hi> have of <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> from a consideration that God has accepted Christ, who was <hi>no sinner:</hi> If Faith was <hi>ready to believe</hi> that God would accept him that <hi>believes and obeys;</hi> yet had it seen <hi>Christs Faith and Obedience, and his acceptance thereon,</hi> it might have stagger'd him that ever such pitiful things <hi>as his Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
                  <pb n="674" facs="tcp:105027:329"/>
                  <hi>should find favour with God.</hi> And if Faith was so strong, as to overcome <hi>that difficulty,</hi> as to believe the Promise notwithstanding <hi>this staggering Example;</hi> yet it's far enough from Truth, that a sinner should believe the promise <hi>ever the more,</hi> that his <hi>imperfect Service</hi> should be <hi>accepted and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> because <hi>Christs entire obedience</hi> was so. Nay, without question it had been <hi>a greater confirmation</hi> of that promise, to have had assurance that God had pardoned <hi>some hainous Offender, some flagitious wretch,</hi> who deserved Condemnation, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him accepting a Person <hi>not obnoxious to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:</hi> So says the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Iesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them who hereafter should believe on him to Life everlasting.</hi> The Pardon of <hi>a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, one injurious, a Persecutor,</hi> is <hi>a stronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> that God will <hi>pardon a sinner,</hi> than <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Him</hi> that had <hi>done no wrong, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) But now for Gods <hi>making such a promise</hi> for Christs sake, or <hi>entring into a Covenant</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, accept <hi>for Christs sake;</hi> this answers not the Question in the least: for, 1. It onely asserts, <hi>that God has declared</hi> openly, that he <hi>will do it.</hi> Now, <hi>a Declaration</hi> of Pardon, is <hi>not a Pardon;</hi> a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of acceptance,</hi> is <hi>not acceptance;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>a Reason</hi> of, <hi>or Motive</hi> to such <hi>a Promise,</hi> such <hi>a Declaration,</hi> is not <hi>a Reason</hi> of, or <hi>Motive to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and acceptance:</hi> Christs Obedience was <hi>so well pleasing to God, that for his sake he made such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi> Well; but if my Obedience <hi>be little,</hi> Christs Obedience will not make it accepted, <hi>as if it were</hi>
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:105027:329"/>
                  <hi>great;</hi> if <hi>imperfect</hi> it will not render it accepted, <hi>as if it were perfect.</hi> 2. That God has <hi>made such a promise for Christs sake,</hi> answers not the Question; for it s but <hi>turning the Question</hi> into <hi>an Assertion:</hi> As if we should enquire, <hi>what Reason is there that God should accept me for Christs obedience?</hi> And he should Answer, <hi>there is a Reason,</hi> why God should accept me for it, but <hi>never shew the Reason:</hi> Or thus, What <hi>Cause</hi> is Christs Obedience, of the Acceptance of our Obedience? And he should say, it is <hi>a Cause,</hi> but not shew <hi>the Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then further, <q>The Obedience and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christs Life was one thing which made his Sacrifice so Meritorious.</q> I confess, I question the Truth of the Proposition; had Christ Sacrificed himself as soon as he came into the World, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had been as Meritorious, being the Sacrifice of him that <hi>as Priest</hi> was <hi>God and Man;</hi> and as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> was the Sacrifice of him that was <hi>Personally United</hi> with God; but I am not concerned to insist upon that at present: All I say, is, that it's <hi>no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to the Question; for to the best of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, (and it's not a full Twelve-moneth since the Question came before us) the Question was, <q>What influence the Righteousness of Christs Life hath upon our Acceptance?</q> and now we have got an Answer to another Question: <q>What influence the Righteousness of Christs Life has upon his own Acceptance with God?</q> As if we were at the Old Childish Game of cross Questions: It was asked me, <hi>How many Miles it is to</hi> London? and it was answered me, <hi>Thirteen shillings and a groat make a Noble.</hi> For what is this Meritoriousness of Christs Obedience? did he Merit for <hi>himself,</hi> or <hi>for us?</hi> If
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:105027:330"/>
for <hi>himself onely,</hi> then it's out of the Olives; If for us, then that which he has Merited <hi>is ours.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit denotes <hi>a proportion between the Work done, and the Reward received;</hi> and it's strict Justice in God to bestow <hi>upon us,</hi> that which another has Merited <hi>for us:</hi> if then Christ has Merited <hi>our Acceptance,</hi> we cannot <hi>but be accepted;</hi> it's <hi>Iustice</hi> we should be so. Again, <hi>what is it,</hi> that Christ has Merited? Is it <hi>acceptauce?</hi> Our Author will not say it; what then? Why, <hi>a promise of acceptance;</hi> that is, that <hi>we shall be pardoned and saved upon Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> And this is the bottom of the bag; when he has turned his discourse into <hi>a thousand shapes and forms,</hi> and varied his expressions infinitely, yet all amounts to no more than this, Christ has <hi>confirmed a promise, procured a promise, merited a promise,</hi> that <hi>if we believe and obey, we shall be pardoned, and saved;</hi> and yet the answer to the Question is to come: For, 1. There must be a better Reason assigned than <hi>the Righteousness of Christs Life,</hi> why <hi>the Sacrifice of his Death should merit any thing;</hi> for if <hi>his active obedience was due to Gods Law upon his own Personal account,</hi> it could <hi>merit nothing</hi> for another: The <hi>payment of a Debt,</hi> will not <hi>merit a reward;</hi> and if <hi>the Righteousness of Christs</hi> Life did not merit <hi>any thing it self,</hi> it can never <hi>make his Death meritorious.</hi> 2. To Merit for us <hi>a reward,</hi> upon <hi>a condition,</hi> and never to <hi>merit for us that condition,</hi> is next to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the Case stands with us: For both <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>we</hi> shall lose that which he has Merited, if our Obedience be left to <hi>the desultoriness of our own will,</hi> and the <hi>imbecillity of corrupt Nature:</hi> Upon the whole Matter I conclude, that according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples our Author canot shew <hi>any one thing</hi> in all <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="677" facs="tcp:105027:330"/>
                  <hi>Life and Death of Christ,</hi> that may render <hi>our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Services more acceptable to God,</hi> than they would <hi>otherwise</hi> have been, upon <hi>equal Holiness and Obedience;</hi> and therefore we must make our Application to Persons of <hi>other apprehensions</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if we would have an honest satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Question: <q>What influence the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christs Life, and the Sacrifice of his Death, have upon our Acceptance with God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is a Text, which some think will shew us more of that <q>True influence that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ hath upon our Acceptance with God,</q> than all this tedious rambling Discourse of our Authors; It is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even so, by the Righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all Men to Iustification of Life: For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made Righteous:</hi> From whence I have heard some Argue; In <hi>the same sense</hi> that <hi>all are made sinners</hi> in <hi>the first Adam,</hi> all that <hi>are righteous</hi> are <hi>made righteous</hi> in <hi>the second Adam;</hi> but <hi>in the first Adam,</hi> all are <hi>made sinners by the imputation of his Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> therefore <hi>all that are righteous, are made so,</hi> in <hi>the second Adam,</hi> by <hi>the imputation of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Again, If it was <hi>the Active Disobedience of the first Adam,</hi> whereby <hi>many</hi> (even all that were in him,) <hi>were made sinners;</hi> then it is <hi>the active obedience of the second Adam,</hi> whereby <hi>Many</hi> (even all that are in him,) <hi>are made righteous;</hi> but the <hi>former is true,</hi> therefore <hi>so is the latter.</hi> But (says our Author) <hi>This is the most that can be made of that place:</hi> This? What? Why this <hi>something,</hi>
                  <pb n="678" facs="tcp:105027:331"/>
                  <hi>or this nothing,</hi> which he had said before; <q>That God was so well pleased with the Obedience of Christs Life, that for his sake he entred into a Covenant of Grace with Mankind:</q> And if this be all that can be made of that Text, the Opposition must run thus; <hi>As God was</hi> so ill pleased <hi>with the Disobedience of Adams Life,</hi> that for <hi>the sake of it</hi> he entred into <hi>a Covenant of Works with Mankind;</hi> So he was <hi>so well pleased</hi> with the Obedience <hi>of Christs Life,</hi> that for <hi>the sake of it,</hi> he entred into <hi>a Covenant of Grace with Mankind.</hi> Really it must be so, Reader; take it, or leave it; for look <hi>what influence Adams Disobedience</hi> had upon God to provoke him <hi>to condemn the World, the same influence had Christs obedience upon God</hi> to please him to save the World. And will not this be a rare contrivance, to fancy <hi>a Covenant of Works,</hi> instituted after <hi>the Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> when we are certain it was established before <hi>his Disobedience?</hi> And so was <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> before <hi>the Active, and Actual obedience of Christ:</hi> However let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the most he can make of it.

                  <hi>of the Righteousness of Christs Life, or his active obedience.</hi> This Answer of our Authors is like <hi>the Ariere banne,</hi> it's never raised but in a case of <hi>extreme urgency:</hi> an Answer that will serve the turn of <hi>all the Atheists, Hereticks, and Miscreants upon Earth:</hi> If you tell them that <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> is promised in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they have it at their fingers ends, that there is <hi>no necessity</hi> that <hi>Eternal</hi> should signifie <hi>a duration beyond the Horizon of time:</hi> it's used in other places for the lengthning out <hi>the existence of a thing</hi> to it's <hi>own allotted period.</hi> Thus <hi>the Aaronical Priesthood</hi>

<pb n="680" facs="tcp:105027:332"/>
dispute it with the Apostle:</q> But I do not perceive the Doctor has <hi>any contraversie with,</hi> though he has maintained many <hi>for the Apostle:</hi> They are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well agreed, for ought I perceive, nor shall they Quarrel if I can help it: The Doctor will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>that Christs assuming a body in order to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Sacrifice to God,</hi> was <hi>not doing his will;</hi> no, he pleads for it, to the cost of somebody: But this is that which he disputes, that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. <hi>The Opposition</hi> between <hi>Adams Disobedience, and Christs Obedience,</hi> will prove them <hi>both</hi> of <hi>the same kind;</hi> It's acknowledged that Christ did <hi>actively obey</hi> in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; his sufferings were <hi>Activo passiva:</hi> But yet the <hi>Obedience</hi> mentioned in the place before us, was an <hi>Active Obedience,</hi> because <hi>Adams Disobedience</hi> was so. One blow more, and then our Author will yield us the Cause: <q>There is no express mention (<hi>says he</hi>) made in this Chapter of any other Act of Obedience whereby we are reconciled to God, but onely his dying for us, which makes it more than probable, that by his Righteousness and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the Apostle understands his Death and Sufferings.</q> I assure you, I like it well when Men argue <hi>from the Context,</hi> provided they do <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Text;</hi> and had our Author Religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served this Rule, he had not turned his Readers sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks so often with nauseous Interpretations, but yet I have a few things to offer to him: 1. That though there be <hi>no other act of Obedience</hi> mentioned whereby we are <hi>reconciled,</hi> yet there may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>act of Obedience</hi> mentioned whereby we may be <hi>compleatly justified.</hi> 2.

                  <hi>Cohaerence or Contexture,</hi> ever obliged an Author that he might <hi>not pass to new matter;</hi> and so has the Apostle done in this place, and Case, <hi>as the Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion most undeniably proves.</hi> 3.

But then 4.—Nay, hold; Our Author yields: Good Nature begins to work; <q>But yet (<hi>says he</hi>) these Expressions, his Righteousness, and Obedience, seem to take in the whole compass of his Obedience in doing and Suffering the will of God.</q> All is well then, and Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is a very honest Man again. And we will not vex our selves how to reconcile, <hi>more than probable</hi> Con: with <hi>seeming</hi> Pro. I have made some attempts formerly, and once more whilst our Author is in the tractable vein, I le try whether the Doctor and he may not be made good Friends; for since our Author is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards a willingness to <hi>take in Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> it's but attempting however to prevail with the Doctor <hi>not to exclude the Passive.</hi> Well, look once more: <hi>Com. p.</hi> 185. <hi>That the Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ is here Onely intended, is false;</hi> so that all that the Doctor contends for, is, that <hi>the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience</hi> is not <hi>solely</hi> intended to <hi>the exclusion of the Active.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="682" facs="tcp:105027:333"/>We are all agreed then in the meaning of <hi>the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Terms,</hi> and it's well if we do not fall out again about the <hi>Propositions</hi> that result from them: Let us now hear his Comment upon the words. <q>The meaning of the words (<hi>says he</hi>) is this: That as God was so highly displeased with <hi>Adams</hi> sin, that he entail'd a great many evils, and miseries, and death it self, upon his Posterity, for his sake: So God was so well pleased with the Righteousness and Obedience of Christs Life and Death, that he bestows the Rewards of Righteousness on those who according to the strictness and rigour of the Law are not Righteous; that for Christs sake he he hath made a New Covenant of Grace, which pardons our past sins and follies, and rewards a sincere, though imperfect Obedience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are two Questions which he here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to Answer. First, <hi>What Influence</hi> Adams <hi>sin hath upon his Posterity?</hi> and Secondly, it is to be hoped that from thence we may at last know, <hi>What Influence Christs Righteousness and Obedience have upon our acceptance with God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Quest. <hi>What Influence hath</hi> Adams <hi>sin upon his Posterity?</hi> To this he returns. <q>God was so highly displeased with <hi>Adams</hi> sin, that he entailed a great many evils, and miseries, and death it self, upon his Posterity, for his sake:</q>  Now, all this is <hi>true, very true;</hi> but whether it be <hi>the whole Truth,</hi> that which will <hi>satisfie the design of the Text</hi> I shall examine by and by. At present I shall onely make some short Notes upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>God (says he) was so highly displeased with <hi>Adams</hi> sin, that for his sake he entailed a great many evils.</q> Now, had it not been fair to have
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:105027:333"/>
shewn <hi>the Iustice, as well as the Highness of Gods Displeasure</hi> in such a proceeding with his Posterity? That God was <hi>justly,</hi> as well as <hi>highly displeased</hi> with <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, never created a Doubt to any man; but that he should be <hi>so highly displeased</hi> with the Sin of <hi>one single Man,</hi> to <hi>entail Evils</hi> upon Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, upon all his Posterity, this would invite us to examine <hi>the Righteousness of the Entail.</hi> The Posterity of <hi>Adam knew nothing</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin, were not conscious nor consenting to it, and yet God involves them in the Consequences of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>entail'd those Evils upon his Posterity for Adams sake:</hi> Now here's the old Blind again: For to say, that <hi>God did it for Adams sake,</hi> implies, that <hi>Adams</hi> sin had <hi>an influence,</hi> and it had <hi>this influence,</hi> but <hi>how it could righteously or indeed possibly</hi> have <hi>that influence,</hi> is <hi>still a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and till that be resolved, we shall never have the advantage from hence to know, <hi>How the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ could have an Influence upon God, to shew us any kindness</hi> for Christs sake.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>entail'd a great many Evils and miseries upon his Posterity, for his sake.</hi> Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are but <hi>a Many</hi> (though a great many) <hi>evils</hi> entailed upon them, and <hi>not all</hi> Evils, it's very <hi>much our Interest</hi> to understand which are <hi>the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed evils,</hi> and which our <hi>own Personal evils;</hi> which are <hi>hereditary,</hi> and which of <hi>our own procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> that so having found out <hi>which are entailed</hi> upon us, we may search if there be not a way found <hi>to cut off the Entail,</hi> by the <hi>Recovery</hi> wrought out by Christ. And the rather, because the Text men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>not only Evils, many Evils,</hi> but seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:105027:334"/>
                  <hi>all Evils;</hi> As <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Absolution,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>all spiritual Mercies;</hi> so <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> comprehend <hi>all spiritual Curses:</hi> And by <hi>these comprehensive words,</hi> the Apostle expresses <hi>those Evils</hi> which God upon <hi>the Account of Adam's Sin,</hi> has <hi>entailed</hi> upon Posterity. I know how easily our Author presumes <hi>to dock the Entail,</hi> by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Death signifies <hi>onely Temporal Death;</hi> but the Apostle has obviated <hi>that Cavil,</hi> v. 11. <hi>As by one Man Sin entred into the world, and Death by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n, and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned.</hi> By <hi>one man,</hi> by <hi>Adam,</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> whose <hi>wages is Death,</hi> and <hi>that Death</hi> which is <hi>the wages of Sin,</hi> enter'd into the world, even upon <hi>all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,</hi> for that <hi>all have sinned.</hi> And what <hi>that Death</hi> is, which is <hi>the Wages of Sin,</hi> he assures, by opposing it to <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> v. 21. <hi>As Sin reigned unto Death, so might Grace reign through Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness unto Eternal Life, by Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> So again Chap. 6. v. 23. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death, but the Gift of God is Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Qu. <hi>What Influence has Christs Righteousness and Obedience upon our Acceptation with God?</hi> And had our Author answered <hi>the former question to purpose,</hi> he had answered <hi>this in it,</hi> and saved himself a great deal of needless pains in <hi>a New pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of it.</hi> But he answers: <q>God was so well pleased with the Righteousness of Christ Life and Death, that he bestowes the Rewards of Righteousness on those, who according to the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and rigour of the Law are not righteous: That for Christs sake, he hath made a New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which pardons our past sins and follies, and rewards a sincere though imperfect
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:105027:334"/>
Obedience.</q> A few notes also I shall make upon this, and so dismiss it at present.</p>
               <p>And, First, here is certainly <hi>a great Iuggle</hi> in these words: <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>was so well pleased with the Righteousness and Obedience of Christs Life and Death, that he bestows the rewards of Righteousness upon us.</hi> Now <hi>these rewards of Righteousness</hi> (be they what they will or can) are either the <hi>proper and immediate effects</hi> of the Life and Death of Christ, or not: If they be, then I am sure he was tardy <hi>p.</hi> 323. <hi>The Apostles attribute such things to the Blood of Christ, as are the proper and immediate Effects of the Gospel Covenant:</hi> And what that is in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I hope we are not to seek at this time of day. But if they be <hi>not the proper and immediate Effects of the Life and Death of Christ,</hi> then, 1. He has juggled here with his Reader, placing <hi>the rewards of Righteousness</hi> as bestow'd <hi>for Christs sake,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>any Consideration of the Covenant.</hi> 2. If not, then he has not drawn <hi>a fair Parallel</hi> between <hi>the Influence of Adams Sin,</hi> and that of <hi>Christs Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi> For he tells us, that <hi>God for Adams sake entailed a great many Evils, Miseries, nay Death it self, upon his Posterity;</hi> there are <hi>particular evils</hi> entailed upon <hi>Individuals</hi> for <hi>the sake of Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without <hi>any intervention</hi> of their <hi>own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Transgressions: Ay, but there our Author will perhaps tell me, That the truth is, he means all this while, (by a secret reserve,) that <hi>Adams Posterity,</hi> when they <hi>commit Adams sin,</hi> or <hi>and other,</hi> they then render themselves <hi>obnoxious to those miseries, evils, and death it self:</hi> But then this is not to the purpose; for then 'tis not <hi>for Adams sake,</hi> but for <hi>their own:</hi> Not for that <hi>One Mans Offence,</hi> but for
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:105027:335"/>
                  <hi>every mans own Offence,</hi> that <hi>judgement came upon them to condemnation:</hi> Which is <hi>not to interpret</hi> the Apostle, but <hi>dictate to him,</hi> and indite his Epistles for him. <hi>Miseries</hi> then, and <hi>a great many miseries,</hi> none knows <hi>how many,</hi> are entail'd upon <hi>Adams</hi> Posterity for his sake, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of their own sin: But now here's <hi>no Blessing,</hi> not <hi>one single Blessing,</hi> entailed upon <hi>such spiritual Posterity of Christ,</hi> that they shall receive <hi>any one the least Favour,</hi> without <hi>the Intervention of their own Obedience:</hi> And so things are where they were at first.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I must note also, That he says, <hi>God bestows the rewards of Righteousness on those who according to the strictness and rigour of the Law are not righteous:</hi> That is, as he explains himself, <hi>they shall be justified or treated like righteous Persons:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">Now, 1. If God can treat them <hi>like Righteous Persons,</hi> who are <hi>not really so;</hi> because he is <hi>so well pleased</hi> with <hi>Christs Obedience,</hi> why may not God <hi>conceive</hi> me <hi>to have done</hi> that which <hi>I have not done,</hi> as well as <hi>to be</hi> what I <hi>am not?</hi> Why not to <hi>have obeyed in Christ,</hi> to have <hi>suffer'd in Christs sufferings,</hi> as to be <hi>a righteous Person in my self,</hi> when there is <hi>no such matter?</hi> Andthus our Author has laid a block in our way, at which a well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, (though against our Authors meaning) may stumble upon the Notion of <hi>the Imputation of Christs Righteousness:</hi> It's altogether unintelligible, how God should punish me <hi>for Adams fault</hi> with Justice, if <hi>Adams</hi> fault were not <hi>some wayes or other my own;</hi> and fully as unaccouutable, How God should deal with me <hi>as righteous</hi> who am <hi>not so,</hi> for <hi>the sake of Christs Obedience,</hi> if Christs Obedience <hi>some way</hi>
                  <pb n="687" facs="tcp:105027:335"/>
                  <hi>or other become not mine:</hi> I can easier satisfie my Reason how <hi>the Righteousness of the second Adam</hi> may make <hi>me righteous,</hi> and <hi>accepted of God;</hi> than how <hi>the unrighteousness of the first</hi> should make <hi>me a sinner;</hi> and yet Faith <hi>believes both,</hi> though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>stronglier for Christ,</hi> Rom. 5. 17. <hi>For if by one mans Offence Death reigned by one, much more</hi> they, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God</hi> (he says) <hi>bestows the rewards of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness on those who in strictness are not righteous,</hi> Let some enquire at his house, as they go by, What he means by <hi>the Rewards of righteousness:</hi> Is it <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness?</hi> Then it's Non sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or worse: God gives them <hi>inherent righteousness</hi> who have <hi>not inherent Righteousness,</hi> which <hi>in sensu composito</hi> is Non-sence, and <hi>in sensu diviso</hi> not agreeable to our Authors Principles: But if he mean, <hi>the rewards of Acceptation as righteous</hi> when they are <hi>not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and this <hi>for Christs sake;</hi> then either there will be <hi>some immediate proper effect found ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> for the Obedience of Christs Life and Death,</hi> or else all comes to no more than this, That God will Accept us <hi>righteous or unrighteous,</hi> that is, <hi>right or wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I would observe also, That he supposes God <hi>to have dispensed with the Moral Law:</hi> Which is News to me, and I confess I doe not believe it, nor shall I, till I hear it confirmed: Some Errors though <hi>speculative</hi> are <hi>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ble,</hi> and such may this prove: For if we like Fools goggled in with the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity of this Age, should Trust to Gods <hi>Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Law;</hi> and at last it should prove, that God <hi>loved Righteousness, and hated Iniquity as such,</hi> we were in a most wretched, miserable, and undone Condition, merely by Trusting <hi>to Indulgence.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:105027:336"/>
therefore good Counter security of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, That God will <hi>deal with me as righteous, though I be not so in the Account of his Law;</hi> unless I be considered, <hi>as found in Christ, not having my own righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is by the Faith of Christ, the righteousness of God by Faith.</hi> The Moral Law is the Image of Gods Mind, his Nature transcribed into his Law; and <hi>one jot nor tittle of this Law</hi> shall ever pass away: <hi>How much</hi> of this Law God will dispense with, <hi>what part of it,</hi> or <hi>what degrees</hi> of the violation of it, is to me unknown; and if with <hi>any,</hi> whether he may not possibly dispense <hi>with the whole</hi> by the same Reason, is more than our Authors Principles can inform me; he that may dispense <hi>with one</hi> part of it, may <hi>with another,</hi> and so of the rest: For where to stop, or put bounds to such a Dispensation as comes from <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> is very impossible to determine, unless we knew the true bounds of Gods Grace. And whereas our Author talks of <hi>the rigour</hi> of the Law, there's nothing of it <hi>rigorous in its own Nature,</hi> and the least particle of it would be <hi>impossible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> according to its exact demands, if it were made <hi>the Law of our Iustification:</hi> He that breaks the Law <hi>in one point, is guilty of all;</hi> and the Curse is denounced against him that <hi>confirms not all that is written therein to doe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Difficulty remains to this day, Why God should be so <hi>pleased with the Righteousness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ,</hi> that he should allow <hi>the Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Another.</hi> And it will remain for ever a Difficulty, both why God should inflict Evils upon the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> for <hi>his sake,</hi> or deal with them <hi>as righteous,</hi> who in the Account of his Holy

               <p>The same liberty that he has taken, I question not but he will give, and I shall be very modest in a few Enquiries.</p>
               <p>(1.) May we enquire, Whether what he allows <hi>of Influence to Adams Sin upon his Posterity,</hi> will satisfie the Apostles Intendment? The Apostle asserts v. 18. <hi>That by the offence of one, judgement came upon all to Condemnation:</hi> v. 19. <hi>That by one mans Offence, many were made Sinners.</hi> And there are these things considerable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adams</hi> Sin had <hi>this Influence</hi> upon Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, that <hi>they were made Sinners also,</hi>

by <hi>Adams first sin,</hi> any other way than by charging it upon them, according to the Terms of that Law under which he and they stood; nor are the Seed of Christ capable of being made Righteous <hi>in Gods sight,</hi> by the Obedience of Christ, otherwise than <hi>by Imputing it</hi> to them, according to that <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-constitution,</hi> called <hi>the Law of Faith and Righteousness,</hi> under which Christ and Believers do now stand. But if the word <hi>Imputation</hi> do Disgust our Authors <hi>delicate Ears,</hi> let him call it what he pleases, provided the Apostles Argument be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and his main Design secured; let us now see how our Author comes up to the Apostle. <q>God (<hi>says he</hi>) was so well pleased with the Obedience and Righteousness of Christs Life, and Death, that for his sake he bestows the rewards of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness on those, who according to the Rigour of the Law are not Righteous:</q> Wherein our <hi>Author</hi> and our <hi>Apostle</hi> come not near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by many Leagues. 1. Our Author says, <hi>God bestows the reward of Righteousness on them that are not Righteous.</hi> But our Apostle says, we <hi>are made Righteous</hi> by the Obedience of Christ, <hi>before we can be accounted Righteous</hi> by God: The Holy God will not account <hi>half Righteousness</hi> for <hi>a whole one;</hi> sinners may mock themselves, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mock God: That which the Law requires, <hi>must be had;</hi> the Apostle tells us, 'tis to be had in <hi>Christ:</hi> By his Obedience, through the Intervention of the <hi>Law-constitution of Faith and Righteousness,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are <hi>made Righteous.</hi> 2. Whatever is Lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the darkness of these Expressions, <hi>The Rewards of Righteousness; the Rigour of the Law;</hi> yet this we may be sure of, that all come to this in
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:105027:339"/>
the Up shot: <q>That God for Christs sake has made a New Covenant of Grace, which Pardons our past Sins and Follies, and rewards a Sincere, though Imperfect Obedience.</q> I can compare our Authors <hi>Copia Verborum,</hi> his Variegated Equipollent Phrases and Expressions, to nothing so well as that of the Chymists, when they endeavour to <hi>bind Hermes,</hi> or in plain English, their fixing of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver; they can Model it into <hi>many accidental Forms and Shapes,</hi> and yet the Cunning versute Creature will be <hi>Mercury</hi> again, do what they can; unless some will compare it to the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Mistress in the Fable, that Brided it for a day, or so, but yet upon the sight of her old Game, put off her Personated self, and reassumed her real self again. Such Feats of Activity have we shown us, ever and anon by our Author, he can turn his words into more Shapes than <hi>Proteus;</hi> tell us of this and that, but when he comes to himself, <hi>All the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that Christs Obedience has upon our acceptance with God,</hi> is, that we <hi>owe such a Covenant to it</hi> as he has described to us, and Contrived for us: Tells us, That <hi>God for Christs sake</hi> has <hi>entered</hi> into a Covenant, <hi>made</hi> a Covenant; his Righteousness and Obedience <hi>have procured</hi> a Covenant; are the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause</hi> of a Covenant; when the total Summe of all is no more than this, That <hi>God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to Pardon and Save us if we Believe, and Obey the Gospel,</hi> though we Obey <hi>not perfectly.</hi> So that at last, it's our <hi>own Obedience that Recommends us to God,</hi> our own Righteousness <hi>for which we are Iustified:</hi> Whereas the Apostle is Peremptory, That <hi>by the Obedience of Christ we are constituted Righteous.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="696" facs="tcp:105027:340"/>His Conclusion is therefore this: <hi>That the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, is not the formal Cause of our Iustification; but the Meritorious cause of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant whereby we are declared Righteous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as Righteous.</hi> I perceive <hi>the Righteousness of Christs Life, and the Obedience of his Death,</hi> are like to prove <hi>something</hi> ere long: One while they <hi>Confirm and Seal,</hi> another while they <hi>Procure,</hi> and at last they <hi>Merit</hi> a Covenant: I cannot but Examine particulars, though I have often done it. 1. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ, is not the Formal cause of our Iustification.</hi> Indeed, I think it is not: Never any Man in his Wits affirmed it so: Give but us leave to call it <hi>the Material cause,</hi> or <hi>the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause immediately and properly</hi> of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he shall take <hi>Formal cause,</hi> and deal with it at his pleasure. I think I have a Commission from all the Systematical Divines of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Voluminous <hi>Tigurines,</hi> and Bulky <hi>Low-Dutch,</hi> with those few that are left in <hi>England,</hi> to make a Bargain with him, Hard and Fast; That the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ is not <hi>the Formal cause of our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 2. Says he, <hi>It is the Meritorious cause of that Covenant whereby we are declared Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> A Meritorious cause sounds <hi>very high,</hi> if it had <hi>an honest Meaning:</hi> But what has it Merited? <hi>Iustification?</hi> By no means: What then? <hi>Any particular Mercy,</hi> or <hi>Priviledge,</hi> or <hi>Blessing?</hi> By no means, for then it would be <hi>a proper cause</hi> of it; there's an Exact and Severe proportion betwixt the <hi>Reward and the Work,</hi> in all <hi>Merit:</hi> What is it then the Meritorious cause of? Why of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> But are we made Righteous by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Not at all; only we are <hi>declared</hi> Righteous:
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:105027:340"/>
But how does the Righteousness of Christs Life, and the Obedience of his Death, <hi>Merit such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> at Gods Hands? Nay, That he will not tell us. God was <hi>well pleased with them,</hi> but <hi>why he should be so,</hi> is a Secret which must be reserved for the coming of <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) The last thing I shall Exmine, is his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against our Interpretation of the Apostle. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Shall be Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Well, I agree to him: But then I say, the former Expression explains <hi>the way of our being Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;</hi> that it is by Vertue of <hi>a Gospel-Law-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> or Appointment of God; who consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Believers <hi>as one</hi> with their Redeemer, does Constitute them Just, and Righteous, (there's the Formal Cause) in the Righteousness of Christ, (there's the Material Cause of Justification) as all the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are <hi>constituted Sinners,</hi> and <hi>liable to Condemnation</hi> by the Constitution of the old Law, as Represented by him their Common Head. 2. He excepts: <hi>That the Apostle tells us,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Who they are that are Iustified by Christ, and shall Reign with him in Life; not those who are Righteous by the Imputation of Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them.</hi> But I do not hear the Apostle telling me one such word, whatever he has told our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor privately by way of <hi>Cabala:</hi> I hear him saying plainly, That <hi>as by one Mans offence many were made sinners, so by one Mans Obedience many were made Righteous:</hi> And because I cannot devise how possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly one Man should be made a sinner, dealt with as a sinner, Condemned and Judged as, and for a sinner, by another mans sin, unless he be <hi>some ways or other</hi>
                  <pb n="698" facs="tcp:105027:341"/>
                  <hi>guilty of sin;</hi> and because it is not the making of that one mans sin their own <hi>by Immitation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> that the Apostle speaks of, but by <hi>a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Covenant or Law:</hi> Therefore till I can find a better Term to express the Doctrine by, I shall call, <hi>Gods charging Adams sin upon his Posterity to their Condemnation,</hi> his <hi>Imputing</hi> it to them: And then because I cannot neither devise with my self, how <hi>one man</hi> should possibly be made <hi>Righteous</hi> by the Obedience <hi>of another,</hi> but that <hi>others Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> must <hi>some way or other</hi> become his own; and because to say Christs Obedience is ours <hi>by Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Example,</hi> is to cross <hi>the Apostles para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,</hi> and to cross the Truth, for we Imitate it but <hi>in part</hi> and very <hi>Imperfectly;</hi> therefore I shall take the Freedom also to call Gods <hi>constituting Believers righteous by the Obedience of Christ,</hi> his <hi>Imputing</hi> that Obedience to them for their Justification: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always, that when more convenient and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Terms shall be found out, to satisfie the Apostle, this of <hi>Imputation</hi> be left indifferent: Well, but if not these, who are then? Why <hi>those who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the abundance of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteousness;</hi> these are <hi>justified by Christ,</hi> these <hi>shall Reign with him in Life:</hi> It's very true, the Apostle does tell us no less: And I cannot imagine how he should more fitly describe <hi>a justified person,</hi> that others may know him, and he should know himself, than by <hi>the Fruits and Effects</hi> of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as <hi>abundance of Grace</hi> are: For whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Author thinks of the Apostle, he does not use to describe a thing <hi>by it self,</hi> or something <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obscure,</hi> but by that which is <hi>more known</hi> and <hi>Obvious</hi> than the thing described: and therefore
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:105027:341"/>
the Apostle seems not to describe Justification, but a justified Person by Sanctification: <hi>They that have received abundance of Grace, and the Gift of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> these are <hi>justified Persons;</hi> not that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is from <hi>any Inherent work,</hi> but that <hi>the justified Person</hi> is only known to himself to be such, by an <hi>Inherent work,</hi> and to others by <hi>the fruits</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>This answer, I will deal truly with my Reader, came next to hand, I had it from our Author, and I presumed he would accept a bad one of his own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a better of another mans: <hi>The Apostle</hi> (says he) <hi>tells who those are that are thus justified by Christ;</hi> Nay then, thought I, that will kill no body; for <hi>a justified Person</hi> may be described by <hi>his Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and yet <hi>his Righteousness,</hi> wherein he stands accepted before God, <hi>not consist</hi> in those Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But to deal plainly with him, I do humbly conceive, that the Apostle describes <hi>an Imputed Righteousness</hi> by that expression; <hi>They which receive the abundance of Grace, and the Gift of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> It was <hi>the over-flowing and Redundancy</hi> of Divine Love, to accept a Surety to fulfill all Righteousness, and Suffer for us; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace too, to <hi>let us in by Faith</hi> into the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ's Life, and the Sacrifice of Christs Death: God might have held us close, and tyed us up to the Terms of the Old Covenant, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously have exacted of us a Personal compleat Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to every jot and tittle of the Law, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Justification; but though he has <hi>not abated of his Law,</hi> yet he has admitted a Surety, called therefore the Surety of the Covenant; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:105027:342"/>
he has undertaken <hi>for God,</hi> but for <hi>us also; for a Mediator is not of one,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. And <hi>our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> this <hi>abundance of Grace, is</hi> not the Receiving of inherent Grace <hi>into us,</hi> but <hi>our accepting by Faith this New Gospel-Law or Constitution of God,</hi> with the whole Man, closing with this gracious way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying a Believer by Christ.</p>
               <p>But here our Author unhappily crosses me the way with one of his <hi>id est's.</hi> 
                  <q>That is (<hi>says he</hi>) Those who by the Gospel of Christ, which is called Grace, the abundant Grace of God, are made Holy and Righteous.</q> To which I say as I have sometimes said, That <hi>the Gospel</hi> (as he describes it) <hi>is not the Grace of God,</hi> but a real Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Works blanch'd a little to make it ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. 2. The Gospel as it is <hi>a Revelation of Grace,</hi> is not <hi>the whole</hi> of the Grace of God; the Gospel reveals <hi>more Grace</hi> to be in God, in Christ, in the Holy Spirit <hi>for us,</hi> than the Revelation of it: There is <hi>an Operation</hi> of Grace <hi>upon us, a Constitution</hi> of Grace <hi>with us,</hi> as well as <hi>a Revelation</hi> of Grace <hi>to us;</hi> but this he will grant us, That <hi>Righteousness is called a Gift:</hi> so far good. But is it <hi>really a gift,</hi> or onely <hi>called</hi> so; as Christs is <hi>called</hi> a Redeemer, <hi>called</hi> a High-Priest, <hi>called</hi> a Sacrifice? I doubt this will prove nothing but <hi>Phraseology</hi> at last: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, 1.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Affirmatively: <hi>Because we are made righteous both in a proper, and a Forensick sence, by the Gospel Covenant, which is wholly owing to the Grace of God, and to the Merits and Righteousness of Christ.</hi> I see now how hard it is to get our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Mind out of him: <hi>P.</hi> 320. The Covenant of Grace was then <q>Owing to the Sacrifice of Christs Death, and the Righteousness of his Life: </q> And <hi>p.</hi> 334. <q>God for Christs sake made a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace:</q> But now it's <q>Wholly owing to the Grace of God, and the Merits and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ:</q> So that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> and <hi>the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> be Con-causes of the Covenant, and yet <hi>their proper concerns</hi> are not distinctly <hi>meted and bounded out;</hi> he may allow as <hi>small a share</hi> to <hi>the Righteousness of Chhrist</hi> in <hi>procuring</hi> the Covenant, as he allows <hi>the Power</hi> of God <hi>in Conversion: Righteousness is not owing solely to Humane Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;</hi> well, it may not be <hi>wholly and solely</hi> owing, and yet within <hi>a very small trifle</hi> it may be <hi>wholly and solely owing</hi> to them; so here: This <hi>Covenant is wholly owing to Gods Grace, and the Merits and Righteousness of Christ,</hi> but how small a little singer
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:105027:344"/>
Christ may have in it, is a Secret, and till an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurement be made, will be so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This <hi>Covenant is wholly owing to the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now what he understands by <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> he has often told us: <hi>Pag.</hi> 322. <hi>The Grace of God is the Gospel:</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 334. <hi>The Gospel is the Grace, and abundant Grace of God:</hi> And the summe of <hi>this Gospel</hi> in words at length, and not in Figures, is, <hi>A Promise of Pardon and Life to them that believe, and obey the Gospel;</hi> and then the short and long of this Business is, That <hi>the Covenant</hi> is owing to <hi>the Covenant,</hi> or <hi>the Gospel</hi> is owing to <hi>the Gospel,</hi> or <hi>the Grace of God</hi> is owing to <hi>the Grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Grace of God, and the Merits of Christ</hi> are here assigned as Con-causes of this Covenant; Now if it be of <hi>Merit,</hi> how is it of <hi>Grace?</hi> if of <hi>Grace,</hi> how is it of <hi>Merit?</hi> I can easily understand how Christ should <hi>merit Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> for me, and yet that this should be <hi>of mere Grace</hi> from God, to <hi>admit anothers Merits</hi> to procure those Blessings for me, which I cannot procure to my self: But I acknowledge my own weakness, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, How <hi>this Covenant</hi> of his should be <hi>owing</hi> both <hi>to Merit, and Free-grace;</hi> that is, How God should make <hi>a Promise to pardon freely,</hi> without <hi>any Consideration</hi> of making the Promise, and yet Christ should <hi>merit it</hi> at Gods hands, which implies <hi>a valuable consideration.</hi> But thus it must be, when men to save the Lives of <hi>two or three sorry Crotchets,</hi> will forsake the Conduct of the Scriptures, and lean to their own Understandings; for the Scripture assures us, that <hi>Free-grace is the only Foundation of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that <hi>Christ himself</hi>
                  <pb n="706" facs="tcp:105027:345"/>
                  <hi>is the Gift of God,</hi> Joh. 4. 10. who <hi>by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his Life, the Sacrifice of his Death, the Power and Prevalency of his Intercession,</hi> admits us into all the Grace, and Mercy, and Benefits of that Covenant, with Security to Gods Honour, and the Repute of all his Attributes. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This is <hi>no fair or tolerable Account,</hi> How we may be <hi>said to be made righteous by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ,</hi> because the Covenant is <hi>owing to his Righteousness,</hi> (if it had been owing to it;) for, <hi>as fair an Account may be given,</hi> How we <hi>may be said</hi> to be <hi>made righteous by the Virgin Mary.</hi> If we may be <hi>said to be made</hi> righteous by any thing, to which <hi>that thing</hi> is owing <hi>by which</hi> we are really made righteous, then we may be <hi>said to be made righteous</hi> by the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> We are properly made righteous (according to our Author) <hi>by our own Obedience;</hi> that this Obedience <hi>makes us so,</hi> is <hi>owing to the Covenant;</hi> that Covenant is <hi>owing</hi> to the <hi>Obedience of Christ;</hi> his Obedience is <hi>owing to his Nativity;</hi> his Nativity to <hi>his Mother;</hi> and that may be run up in the Genealogical Scale as high <hi>as Adam;</hi> and thus at this rate, we may be said to be justified <hi>by Adam.</hi> And for this he has wisely made a reserve: <hi>A fair Account how we may be said;</hi> that's All. Not that we <hi>are so,</hi> but that we <hi>may be said to be so;</hi> and the Mystery of it lyes here. The Scripture has said, that we are <hi>made righteous by Christs Obedience;</hi> and we take it for granted, that the Scripture had <hi>not said</hi> it, unless it had <hi>been really true:</hi> but there are some, who doe <hi>not believe</hi> it to be <hi>really true;</hi> and therefore they must set their wits awork, to find out <hi>how it may possibly be said to be true,</hi> and yet <hi>not really</hi> be so; that so they

may neither throw the Lye directly in the face of the Apostles, nor yet be compelled to wave their own Unbelief.</p>
               <p>But it seems there is <hi>a two-fold sence</hi> in which we may be <hi>said to be made righteous by the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Sect. <hi>A Proper Sence;</hi> which is this. <hi>The great Arguments, and Motives, and powerfull As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances of the Gospel, form our Minds to the love and practice of Holiness, and so make us inherently righteous.</hi> What needed all this pother and stir to no purpose? The Righteousness of Christ <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes something,</hi> (though he cannot tell what) <hi>to the Gospel-Covenant;</hi> this <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> contains, <hi>Promises and Duties, or Motives, Arguments, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to Obedience;</hi> now when <hi>these Promises</hi> prevail with us to love and practise <hi>those Duties,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>that Obedience,</hi> then we become <hi>inherently righteous</hi> in <hi>a proper sence;</hi> and so that none may take it ill, they shall have liberty to <hi>say,</hi> that <hi>we are made righteous by the righteousness of Christ:</hi> His Righteousness or Obedience was <hi>an excellent Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of,</hi> a strong Motive to our being <hi>righteous.</hi> Two things I shall oppose to this.</p>
               <p>(1.) That to be <hi>made inherently righteous,</hi> is not <hi>the proper sence of being made righteous:</hi> This was indeed <hi>the proper sence of being Righteous</hi> under <hi>the Covenant of Works;</hi> when a perfect, exact, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat inherent Holiness, was <hi>the Matter</hi> of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God; and when it was <hi>attainable;</hi> and it shall be <hi>once more</hi> the <hi>proper sence</hi> of being <hi>made righteous</hi> in Heaven, where <hi>the spirits of just men are made perfectly perfect;</hi> but to us, <hi>in the way,</hi> it's not <hi>the proper sence</hi> of being made righteous, but
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:105027:346"/>
a Figurative sence, as we may call an Aethiopian <hi>white,</hi> because <hi>his teeth</hi> are so; and it must be a stretching Synechdoche that will denominate a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Righteous by inherent Righteousness, if he shall compare the Attainments of <hi>a Pilgrim</hi> with <hi>the perfect Law of God;</hi> but <hi>the proper sence</hi> of being <hi>made righteous,</hi> is that of the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 5. 20. By the Obedience of one Man many shall be made righteous;</hi> made so perfectly and compleatly by <hi>the Constitution of the Law of Righteousness and Faith:</hi> for thus we are <hi>compleat in Christ,</hi> Coloss. 2. 10. through whom we are <hi>presented to God,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>unblameable, and unreproveable in Gods sight:</hi> so pure, that there is <hi>not a spot or blemish</hi> to be found in a Believer <hi>in the sight of God himself;</hi> which upon the Account of <hi>inherent Righteousness,</hi> is impossible. <hi>Inherent Righteousness</hi> is <hi>properly Righteousness</hi> (for so much as there is of it,) but it is <hi>so imperfect,</hi> that it will not denominate any man <hi>properly righteous</hi> in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>(2) There is another thing which mightily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composes this kind of Argumentation: <q>We may be said to be made righteous by the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ in a proper sence. <hi>Why so? Oh!</hi> Because the Righteousness of Christ is one of those great Arguments of the Gospel that forms our Minds to the Love and practice of Holiness, and so makes us inherently righteous.</q> Which is this; The Righteousness of Christ, and <hi>our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> hang so loosely and contingently together, that it seems very absurd, to ascribe the Effect of <hi>the latter</hi> to <hi>the former:</hi> If indeed the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ did <hi>properly, necessarily,</hi> and <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly</hi> produce an <hi>inherent Righteousness</hi> in us, it
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:105027:346"/>
were warrantable to say, we were made righteous by it; but when the Connexion is so accidental, so uncertain, that the Effect depends upon <hi>our own Free-will</hi> (as in the New Theology it does) we <hi>cannot properly</hi> be said to be made righteous in <hi>this sence by his Righteousness:</hi> For when all these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Motives have done their best, That which does the work, is, <hi>Free-will and Humane Endeavour;</hi> and therefore <hi>properly are we said</hi> to be made Righteous by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sect. <hi>A Forensick sence;</hi> which is this. <hi>The Grace of the Gospel accepts and rewards that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Evangelical Obedience, which according to the Rigour and Severity of the Law, could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no reward.</hi> This Forensick, is a hard word; and if I might presume to soften it a little with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, it should be thus: A Forensick sence of Justification, is a sence borrowed from Courts of Judicature, where the Judge absolving or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting a Prisoner of those Crimes wherewith he stood charged, does not doe it by <hi>making him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent or honest,</hi> by <hi>infusing</hi> into him the Habits of Vertue; but onely <hi>declares,</hi> That according to the Evidence he is found Innocent, Righteous, Just, and therefore, <hi>as the Law acquits him,</hi> so the Judge as the Minister of the Law <hi>declares him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</hi> Now the Question is, Whether our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given us <hi>a true Forensick sence of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or no? His Sence is this: <hi>The Grace of the Gospel accepts, and rewards that sincere and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, which according to the Severity and Rigour of the Law, deserves no reward:</hi> which seems to me so far from <hi>a Forensick sence,</hi> that it's <hi>the Forensick Non-sence</hi> of Justification; for does a
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:105027:347"/>
Judge pronounce and declare <hi>him righteous,</hi> whom the Law says, <hi>is unrighteous?</hi> Can he <hi>justifie</hi> him whom the Law <hi>condemns?</hi> The Judge sits not there <hi>as a good Natur'd Man,</hi> with a Chancery of Charity in his own breast, but <hi>as a Righteous Governour,</hi> to render to every man according to his works, weighed in the Ballance of that Law by which he is to judge: And shall we dare to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that <hi>the Grace of the Gospel</hi> will pronounce that Man <hi>righteous,</hi> reward that Man <hi>as righteous,</hi> who is <hi>not righteous</hi> by the Law of God, if that be the Law by which he must be Condemned or Acquitted? I will grant, that in <hi>a Criminal Cause,</hi> which by the Law deserves <hi>Bodily Punishment,</hi> if <hi>the Constitution of the Law</hi> will Allow it, the Judge may <hi>lay the Punishment</hi> of the Guilty Person <hi>upon another</hi> who will <hi>freely undergoe</hi> it, or that which is <hi>equivalent in the eye of the Law</hi> to it; and acquit him, that in <hi>the first Consideration</hi> of the Law was <hi>not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:</hi> Let us apply it. God is <hi>the righteous Iudge</hi> of all the World, and by his <hi>Eternal Holy Law</hi> he will Judge the Sons of Men; so true is God to his own Law, that he will <hi>not acquit and justifie</hi> him whom <hi>the Law condemns,</hi> nor Condemn him whom his Law Acquits, nor is it possible he should: To say the Sinner <hi>is righteous</hi> by the Verdict of his Law, when by the <hi>Verdict of the Law</hi> he is not righteous, is <hi>not consistent</hi> with the <hi>Veracity</hi> of that God who <hi>cannot lye:</hi> But there is <hi>another Law, the Law of Righteousnesse and Faith,</hi> which Sovereign Grace has set up, and this admits <hi>the satisfaction of Another,</hi> admits a Sacrifice, a Surety, even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the righteous, <hi>whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to</hi>

in the Law; now what that should be, is not easily conceivable: Is it <hi>any</hi> of the Ten Commandements which is so rigorous above the rest? <hi>which</hi> is it? or <hi>how many</hi> are there of them? and <hi>where</hi> has God <hi>dispensed</hi> with <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>it?</hi> or <hi>what part</hi> of the Law is it, the <hi>external</hi> or the <hi>internal part,</hi> wherein the <hi>Rigour of the Law</hi> lies? or is it <hi>no certain thing,</hi> but left to Discretion? such as hath <hi>a latitude,</hi> in some greater, in some less? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not <hi>this Rigour of the Law</hi> (as 'tis here applyed) a great Name of Blasphemy, and reproach against the Law, and therein the Law-giver, all whose Commands, and every part and parcel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>are holy, just, and good?</hi> And in a word, if God can dispence with his Law, and indulge the Violation of it, what Reason can be given, why he may not dispense <hi>with all the rest?</hi> Why so he may, if our Author say true, <hi>p.</hi> 45. <q>That part of Justice which consists in Punishing Offenders, was alwayes look'd on as an Instrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore the exacting, or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Punishment, was referred to the Wisdom of Governours, who might Spare or Punish as they saw Reason, without being unjust in either.</q> And therefore he concludes, There was no Necessity <hi>for such a Sacrifice as the Death of Christ, for the Expiation of Sin.</hi>

               <p>He is now drawing his Conclusion, and I hope will draw to a Conclusion. <hi>So that our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is wholly owing to the Righteousness of Christ.</hi> I am in hope it will be owing to something before he has done. A little before, it was <hi>owing</hi> (not solely indeed, but almost) <hi>to humane Endeavours,</hi> and now the Debt is transferred, <hi>wholly to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>

                  <hi>of Christ.</hi> And yet he flies higher in his Complements, to the Righteousness of Christ: <hi>Which</hi> (says he) <hi>in this sence may be said to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, because without this Covenant which is founded on the Righteousness of Christ, the best man Living could lay no claim to Righteousness or future Glory.</hi> And is it come to this? Is there <hi>a sence,</hi> wherein the Righteousness of Christ <hi>may be said</hi> to be Imputed to us? And must all men be Reviled and Persecuted with Scurrility, because they cannot Jump just into his Sence? And yet <hi>the sence</hi> of this way of Imputation is Invisible: VVas it <hi>not possible</hi> for God <hi>to pardon</hi> without respect to Christ? O yes! Could he not <hi>reward sincere Obedience</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Christ? O yes! Could he not <hi>accept him that walkt uprightly before him,</hi> without any consideration had of Christs Righteousness? Oh yes! Could not God have <hi>promised</hi> to do all this, as well as <hi>do it</hi> without a promise? No doubt of that: VVhy then might not <hi>the best man Living lay claim to that which God promised,</hi> upon performance of <hi>the condition of which he promised it?</hi> Yes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he might, had God promised it; but before <hi>the appearance of Christ in the Flesh,</hi> he made <hi>no such promise:</hi> VVell then, all we have got by the Bargain is <hi>a promise</hi> that God will <hi>do that now,</hi> which he always <hi>would have done,</hi> and <hi>did do</hi> (though <hi>not promise</hi> that he would do) before <hi>the appearance of Christ,</hi> and if he <hi>never had appeared.</hi> If then this be <hi>the only sence</hi> in which Christs Righteousness <hi>may be said</hi> to be imputed to us; it may be said to be imputed in <hi>no sence at all;</hi> for it gives us <hi>no right</hi> upon which we may <hi>make a claim,</hi> only <hi>an evidence of right,</hi> whereby we may <hi>lay claim to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

                  <hi>and future Glory:</hi> But why might not <hi>the best man living lay claim to Righteousness and future Glory?</hi> Why, he supposes there was <hi>no such Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> in the World <hi>before the appearance of Christ;</hi> and he supposes that this Covenant was <hi>founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Obedience, and Sacrifice of Christ.</hi> Here must needs be a great mistake.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon his own Principles. For <hi>pag.</hi> 252. he asserts, That <hi>Natural Religion is founded upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Demonstrations, that God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> And that upon this Foundation, <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> proceeded in their <hi>serving of God,</hi> pag. 253. And that <hi>they pleased God</hi> by their Obedience, the Apostle assures us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4, 5. And that <hi>Abel obtained witness that he was Righteous:</hi> And that <hi>Enoch before his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation had this Testimony, that he pleased God.</hi> Now that which God Spoke <hi>by Natural Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to that, upon their <hi>diligent seeking</hi> of Him, they might lay claim; but God Spoke by Natural Demonstration, that he was a <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him,</hi> therefore to that Reward they might lay claim: Yes, no doubt, a claim to <hi>that Reward,</hi> But what was that? A meer <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral transitory Reward.</hi> And was that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that righteous <hi>Abel</hi> was to have for his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for his serving of God? Doubtless, for he was <hi>presently Murder'd</hi> for it. And was that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that holy <hi>Enoch</hi> might claim? Doubtless, for <hi>Good took him, Ttranslated him</hi> to a better Life, for <hi>before his Translation, he received this Testimony that he pleased God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There's a mistake upon <hi>better Principles:</hi> That which God Spoke by Revelation, to that they
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:105027:349"/>
might lay claim; but God Spoke to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Revelation, that upon his <hi>walking uprightly</hi> before him, He would <hi>be his God;</hi> therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his walking uprightly before God, might lay claim to it, that <hi>God should be his God.</hi> Ay, (says our Author) <hi>Be his God:</hi> No doubt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: But what does that signifie? This was one of the great difficulties that lay in his way, to believe that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was justified by Christ.</hi> For then, <hi>We must be well assured, that the Blessings promised to Abraham were Spiritual Blessings, pardon of Sin, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life:</hi> And therefore this is <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi:</hi> But I profess my Name on the other side. And that the Promise that <hi>God would be Abrahams God,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all that ever God <hi>Promised,</hi> or <hi>could promise</hi> to any of the Sons of Men: When God could Swear by <hi>no greater,</hi> he Swore by <hi>Himself;</hi> and when he could promise <hi>no thing greater,</hi> he promised <hi>Himself: I will be thy God,</hi> is the Abstract and Epitome of the whole Covenant of Grace: 'Tis that Gold in the Lump, which was afterwards beaten out into <hi>greater breadth,</hi> but still of the <hi>same weight.</hi> Summe up all the particular Promises in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the <hi>total Summe</hi> is no more than this, <hi>I will be thy God.</hi> And therefore when the Apostle gives us the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12. He describes it thus, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my People:</hi> That he will <hi>Write his Laws in their Hearts,</hi> that he will <hi>pardon their Iniquities,</hi> are some of <hi>the particulars</hi> included in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Promise, <hi>I will be their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That which the Saints guided by the Infallible Spirit laid claim to, that they might justly lay claim to; but the Saints guided by the Infallible Spirit,
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:105027:350"/>
laid claim to an <hi>Eternal Reward,</hi> therefore to that Reward they might justly <hi>lay claim,</hi> Psal. 73. 24. <hi>Thou shalt guide me with thy Counsel,</hi> (here below in my Passage and Pilgrimage) <hi>and afterwards</hi> (when I have run my Race, and finisht my Course) <hi>receive me to Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Epilogue to the whole is this: <q>The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ is our Righteousness, when we speak of the Foundation of the Covenant, by which we are accepted; but if we speak of the Termes of the Covenant, then we must have a Righteousness of our own: The Righteousness of Christ will not serve the turn; Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and our own are both necessary to Salvation: The first as the Foundation of the Covenant, the other as the Condition of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are here asserted: First, that <hi>Christs Righteousness is the Foundation of the Covenant:</hi> Secondly, that <hi>our Righteousness is the Condition of the Covenant.</hi> A brief Examination of which things, shall ease the Reader of any further attendance upon these Discourses.</p>
               <p>[1.] <hi>The Righteousness of Christ is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace:</hi> Let us hear his Proofs; not a word: <hi>Peracta est haec Fabula Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatores valete &amp; plaudite.</hi> We have heard of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, Meriting, Founding a Covenant,</hi> but not a syllable of <hi>Evidence:</hi> Methinks I see the Reader filled with <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>wonder; wonder,</hi> that he who could so pleasantly scoff at the Scripture Expressions of <hi>building upon Christ as on a Foundation,</hi> p. 105. and so merrily inveigh against Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> for asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Christ to be <hi>the only Foundation of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God,</hi> should now so zealously talk for
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:105027:350"/>
                  <hi>Christs being the Foundation of the Covenant;</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> that after such expectations of Proof, he should find himself <hi>bilk'd in the stock.</hi> That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not wholly therefore lose his pains, I shall entertain him with my own apprehensions in this matter.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Grace may be considered either in <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That <hi>the Execution</hi> of this Decree is <hi>in and by Iesus Christ;</hi> and the manner of it follows. <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they which be endued with so excellent a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, be called according to the purpose of God; working in due season by his Spirit. They through Grace obey the calling, they be justified freely, they be made the Sons of God by Adoption, they be made like the Image of his onely begotten Son, they walk Religiously in good works, and at length by Gods mercy, they attain everlasting felicity.</q> Whence we are Instructed,<list>
                           <item>1. That <hi>the calling</hi> of the Elect to <hi>a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> is <hi>from Grace</hi> as the reason, and <hi>by Grace</hi> as it's efficient.</item>
                           <item>2. Their <hi>obeying that call</hi> of God is by Grace.</item>
                           <item>3. Good works necessarily follow effectual calling: See also <hi>Art.</hi> 10. 12, 13.</item>
                           <item>4. Religious walking with God in good works is <hi>a necessary condition</hi> of eternal Felicity.</item>
                           <item>5. That there is such <hi>a firm connexion</hi> in this <hi>golden chain</hi> of Salvation, that <hi>no one linck</hi> can possibly be broken: They are <hi>Elected freely,</hi> called effectually, justified freely, Adopted graciously, Sanctified gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, walk Religiously, and at length by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God are saved eternally, which the Apostle gives us more concisely, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Moreover whom he did Predestinate, them he a so called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also Glorified:</hi> I conclude then that <hi>our own righteousness</hi> is not the condition of the Covenant of Grace, neither of the <hi>designment</hi> of the Father, nor <hi>the procurement</hi> of the Son, nor of <hi>the effectual Operation</hi> of the Holy Spirit, nor of <hi>our Covenant-state,</hi> nor of <hi>our Covenant-right,</hi> nor of

When therefore our Author says, <hi>That Christs righteousness and our own are both necessary to Salvation:</hi> He says true, and (which is necessary to all Truth) that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws <hi>his main design.</hi> For if Christs righteousness be necessary <hi>to our Salvation,</hi> (not onely to <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>

And whereas he says, <hi>That Christs Righteousness is the Foundation, but not the Condition of the Covenant;</hi> what policy there may be in using the Metaphor of a Foundation I cannot tell; but this I know: A Foundation is <hi>a necessary Condition</hi> to the superstructure raised upon it.</p>
               <p>I have now attended him through all the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of this tedious Discourse, whence the Reader will learn at least how impossible it is for <hi>Error to be Consonant to it self:</hi> As the two Milstones grind <hi>one another,</hi> as well as <hi>the grain;</hi> and as the extreme Vices oppose <hi>each other</hi> as well as the <hi>intermediate vertue</hi> that lies between them: So have <hi>all Errors</hi> this fate (and 'tis the best quality they are guilty of) that they Duel <hi>one another</hi> with the same heat that they oppose <hi>the Truth.</hi> The Remainder of his Book is so full of falshoods <hi>in matter of fact,</hi> reproaches of the Truth, and immerited bitterness against the Living, and the Dead, that I could not perswade my self to give the Reader any further trouble with them at present; but a small invitation will draw out the second Part: In the mean time I do solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that as I have no Personal Quarrel with this Gentleman, so I have not willingly wronged his Discourse in the smallest instance: The worst I wish

him is, that he may seasonably repent of his injurious dealing with the Scriptures, and his unworthy treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those Persons who have deserved well of Religion, and the Common-wealth of Learning, and not ill of himself: I cannot deny but that <hi>his provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way of writing,</hi> his unjust censures of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and above all, <hi>his Drolling faculty,</hi> exercised upon sacred things, have sometimes tempted me to a return, not so agreeable to my Natural inclinations. I hope the Reader will consider not onely <hi>how,</hi> but <hi>what</hi> I have written; nor onely <hi>what,</hi> but <hi>upon what provocations</hi> it has been written: Let <hi>Cause</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>with Cause,</hi> the moments of <hi>Reasons</hi> with <hi>Reasons;</hi> let the little Vagaries, and impertinces be brusht off; and then let the indifferent, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader moderate between us: And if he shall meet with any Truth of the Gospel cleared or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, let him give God the more praise, who by such improbable means, as Clay and Spittle, can open his Eyes to the acknowledgment of the Truth; and secure him against the Impostures and Apostacy of these latter times: and what ever of Vanity and Folly he meets with in these Papers, let him be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that's <hi>my own;</hi> and that it may not <hi>prejudice the concerns of Christ,</hi> let him <hi>freely</hi> trample it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet.</p>
