         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many <hi>Moecena's</hi> of
<hi>Hermetick Philosophy,</hi> I
conceive none more fitting to
protect the <hi>Medicinal Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
here set down, then Your <hi>Grace;</hi> who
hath been pleased to express very much
kindeness and love for this Noble Art,
to the no small encouragement of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
thereof. And all things duly
pondered, where can <hi>Chymical Physick</hi>
better shelter it self against Maligners
<pb facs="tcp:100452:3"/>
and Opposers of it, then under the wings
of <hi>Divinity,</hi> on which it ought to attend
as an Hand-maid? yea, there should be a
Synergie, and conspiration of all Arts and
Sciences to advance <hi>Theology,</hi> which
makes the better Part of us happy.</p>
            <p>How can the Soul act aright when
there is an <hi>Atonie, Ametrie,</hi> and <hi>Dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasie</hi>
in the Body? Sith as the <hi>Chyle</hi>
is, such is the <hi>Chyme,</hi> or rubified juyce;
as is the <hi>Chyme,</hi> so is the <hi>Sanguis,</hi> or
purest part of the Blood; and as this is,
so are the Vital Spirits (the immediate
instrument of the Soul) either luminous
and clear, or dark and muddy; and so
capable to act well or ill: How sollicitous
then should we be to search out those
great <hi>Arcana's</hi> in Nature, which the good
Creator hath ordained for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and redintegration of these Bodies,
(which upon slight occasions from within
and without, are obnoxious to be valetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb facs="tcp:100452:3"/>
and put out of frame) that the
Diviner part may operate the more
freely, vigorously, and orderly.</p>
            <p>Certainly there is no better way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this then by <hi>Spagyrick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
which separates <hi>Tribulos &amp; Spinas,</hi>
what is Hurtful and Superfluous in every
<hi>Concrete,</hi> from the profitable, pure, and
sincere; bringing it to such an Entelechie
and Excellency, that it is able to display
that radiant Virtue which God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
in it for the good both of Body
and Soul. And were this course closely
followed, and generally countenanced,
those rebellious and enormous Vices of
the Minde, too grassant at this day among
us, which in great part arise from the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Anomalous, unheard of Prodigious,
and untractable Diseases of the Body,
might in some measure be reformed; and
certainly if there be not some timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<hi>mox daturi progeniem vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siorem,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100452:4"/>
most of our Posterity is like to be
born diseased.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore no Medicine is able
to mortifie these Seminal Principles of
Diseases, or wash off those Radical
Tinctures which have been traduced to
us from our Parents, but the best sort of
<hi>Chymical Preparations</hi> exalted to the
highest degree of perfection; some of
which have been of late years brought to
light by the indefatigable industry of
some Ingenious men, whom the <hi>Galenists</hi>
have endeavoured to eclipse, and despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to suppress by Calumnies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
we humbly beg Your <hi>Graces</hi>
favour to stand up for the defence of our
Art, so far as truth, sound reason and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Experiments shall permit; and that
Your Grace would be pleased to joyn with

to stop the mouthes of these <hi>Anti-Chymists,</hi>
or to constrain them to make

time you can well spare
in perusual of this short
Treatise, which (how
contemptible soever it may seem to
thee) may perhaps be a means to save
thee from the jawes of untimely death,
and prolong thy dayes. The main
Scope of the Author is, to do thee, his
Countrey, and the whole World ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in reference to that which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the innate law of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation)
every Creature desires (that
is) Life: which if not accompanied
with Health, cannot but be very
tedious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100452:5"/>
That therefore thou mayest enjoy a
sound Body and Soul, next Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in all things, embrace an Honest
and Able Physician; not one whom
thou fancies, but who is really so, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these infallible signs here
described.</p>
            <p>The sum of this Discourse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Touchstone depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
matter of Fact, to try whether a
Physician be as he professes himself,
and ought to be, one that having a
Commission from the Angel <hi>Raphael,</hi>
is endued with the gift of Healing, not
palliating, dawbing and plaistering
upon an unstable foundation.</p>
            <p>Here thou mayest learn to keep thy
Blood wherein is the Life, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally
to spend it, upon every trifling
occasion, which may do thee more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
sometimes then the best Doctor
<pb facs="tcp:100452:6"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> and help those Diseases
he cannot.</p>
            <p>Here thou mayest be instructed to
beware of uncorrected Purgatives,
which do but colliquate and putrefie
the wholesome <hi>Chyme,</hi> or juyce of the
Body, enervating it without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
ease, unless accidental; and
to value that Physick which carries off
the occasional Morbifick matter to
thy benefit, without any notable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
succeding.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Enchiridium</hi> thou wilt finde
the difference between a sincere and
corrupt Physician; one that dares act
<hi>subdio,</hi> in the face of the Sun, that men
may behold him whether he doth right
or wrong, and so justifie him or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
him; and between him that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to be in the dark, and cast a mist
before the Spectators eyes, that he may
<pb facs="tcp:100452:6"/>
play legerdemaine with them.</p>
            <p>Lastly thou wilt see whose Actions
are able to bear the test of the Fire
best, (by which every Work is to be
tryed) the <hi>Galenical</hi> or <hi>Helmontian,</hi>
whose facts like Gold or Silver, leave
the least <hi>Scoria</hi> or <hi>Dross</hi> behinde; and
whose like Lead or other base mettals,
leave most.</p>
            <p>We hope no man that desires the
preservation of himself, King, and
Countrey, but will allow these Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Propositions to be just, equal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and laudable, to put an end to
that which garrulity and multiloquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will never determine.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Candid Reader,</hi> all that
we shall request of thee, is to stand still
and see, that we may have right done
us, forbearing to be prejudicate and
partial; and if ever thou shouldest
need us, we shall endeavour to gratifie
<pb facs="tcp:100452:7"/>
thee with that Physick which we are
confident no <hi>Galenist</hi> in <hi>England</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses.
Now if it fall out that our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and wholesom counsel herein
should (through the subtil wiles and
and crafty devices of our enemies) be
rejected, we shall rest our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that we have done our duty,
and shall shake off the dust of our feet
upon them, <hi>qui valdè volunt perire,</hi>
being satisfied that their perdition is
from themselves.</p>

OR,
A Chymical Trial of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists,
that their Dross in
Physick may be discovered.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I. A short Description of Galen, from whom they
are denominated Galenists.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great Patron, to whose Decrees
and Dictates (right or wrong) the
Dogmatists have obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to subscribe, is <hi>Galen</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi>
in <hi>Asia;</hi> who lived about fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years past, in the time of <hi>Adrian.</hi> He
was a man doubtless of excellent parts, and
very laborious, but took a very indirect course
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100452:10"/>
to make a discovery of the Truth of things,
as they are in themselves, by bringing them
to the touchstone of sound <hi>Experience;</hi> by
making an Analysis or Resolution of Bodies,
that their Principles might be laid open, and
their Heterogeneities manifested; without
which it is impossible for any man to be a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
as he ought.</p>
            <p>He had a great ambition of writing much,
as it plainly appears by those voluminous
Tracts that are now extant, besides what are
lost; for 'tis reported that he wrote four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Books in Physick: to what good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
any <hi>discreet impartial</hi> man may easily
judge. His loquacity hath much affected some
men, who count Learning principally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in variety of Languages, Polylogie, and
plausible Argumentations, though deduced
from false Axioms. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his concise
Aphoristical Doctrine, written according to
the sincerity and candor of that age, was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
and vainly enlarged by his fruitless and
frivolous Comments, to a huge bulk, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on purpose to get a fame in the World, by
those that are ready to subscribe to any Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Antiquity, for their ease, rather then
to <hi>Anatomize</hi> things as they ought by the <hi>Fire,</hi>
that thereby they may be reduced into the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100452:10"/>
visible parts. So ignorant herein was their
great Master <hi>Galen,</hi> that he never saw either
<hi>Rose-water</hi> or <hi>Quicksilver.</hi> How much to
seek he was in Anatomy, <hi>Vesalius</hi> hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
who makes it to appear in many places,
that he never dissected the Body of man. In
the Botanicks, or knowledge of Plants, he
hath instructed the World no more then <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi>
his predecessour, whom he hath plainly
transcribed in many places word for word,
concealing the Author, sticking in the mire of
the four Elements, their Mixture, Qualities,
and Temperaments, neglecting the <hi>Virtus Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionia,</hi>
Crafts, and specifick properties of
Simples. His followers have, and do even
obstinately to this day, to the destruction of
millions, cry up his method; a tedious way
to cure Diseases, but a short one to get money.
The two principal Pillars that support this
rare Method, are <hi>Phlehotomy</hi> and <hi>Purgation,</hi>
both of which we can demonstrate to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to Humane Nature, destroying more
then ever the Sword.</p>
            <p>In the knowledge of the Causes, Quiddity,
or Essence, immediate Subject, and radical
Cure of Diseases, (an incurable Catalogue
whereof he hath delivered to posterity) that
he was extream blinde, we shall undertake
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100452:11"/>
to evince and prove <hi>è facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this duly considered, would make a
man stand amazed to see how refractorily his
Disciples do maintain (to this day) those rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
principles in Physick derived from him;
and how wilfully they hood-wink themselves,
delighting in the darkness of their own erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Tenents, lest they should behold the
bright beams of Chymical Philosophy, to the
diminution of their own sinister respects.</p>

         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. An account of that true Chymical Philosopher,
and learned Physican, Helmont, whom we
Own for our Patron.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HElmont</hi> a German, was without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
ordained in these last times by
especial providence of God, for the comfort
and relief of distressed Man; to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to discover those gross Errours and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
abuses in Physick, that have relation
to the Life and Soul of Man, committed by
those that rested themselves contented to be
ignorant with Antiquity, and enjoy profit,
honour, and ease, rather then question any
thing delivered to them (how false soever) by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100452:11"/>
making a severe scrutiny into the bottom of
Nature, by difficult labours with their own
hands, and great expence of their purses.
This <hi>Worthy</hi> Man who (we confess) hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
us in the Principles of Philosophy,
was <hi>omnifariam doctus;</hi> one that was very
knowing in the Doctrine of the Ancients, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a wonderful speedy progress in
the Learning of the Schools, as well versed in
the Languages as the best <hi>Galenist;</hi> who, after
that he had rolled every stone in the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and ran through that Cyclopeodie,
or universal Learning, yet could finde no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
satisfaction in the natural Causes of things,
till he came to Pyrotechnie, wherein he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
fifty years compleat, leaving those
lying Sophisms that he had imbibed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
things as they were in themselves.
Hereby he learnt the genuine beginnings of
all Concretes, making separation of them into
their fundamental parts; dissolving and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating,
fixing and volatilizing Bodies;
looking narrowly into the defects, alteration,
life, and death of things; extracting, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
conjoyning several bodies, bringing
what was crude to maturation; and promoting
natural Causes, by removing those impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that they could not arrive at their just
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100452:12"/>
ends. Hence he dived into the Seminal
virtues and properties of things, and was able
to give an account of their true, efficient, and
natural Causes; bringing to light the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Fermentation, the Original and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Spirits, with the rare Effects of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures;
and this by Mechanical demonstration
of the Fire. This is he that hath plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
the most absurd perilous Doctrine of
the <hi>Galenists,</hi> proving their palpable ignorance
of the Causes of Diseases, and their proper
Cures; setting down infallible Arguments
to evince how destructive their Bleeding and
Purgations are to mankinde; challenging
them to make good what he had delivered by
visible instances and examples of fact; which
they would never come to, nor ever dared to
answer him by way of confutation, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
all that he had proposed, giving him
scurrilous and opprobrious language, (as it is
their common custom when they have nothing
to say for themselves) calling him <hi>Fanatick,
Innovator, Dreamer,</hi> carping at any lapse or
Peccadillo in his Writings with aggravations
to the height: hating and abhorring to the
death all those that stood up in his behalf, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them <hi>Hereticks</hi> in Physick; and all this
<hi>gratis dictum,</hi> without the least tittle of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100452:12"/>
Thus hath this worthy man been sleighted,
villified, and reproached, for not still conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at those capital Errours in Physick,
which they have greedily swallowed down
without any scruple, to the ruine of millions.
However, let these pittiful Physicians rail at,
and calumniate this Heroe, 'tis our duty, who
have received so much benefit from him, to
acknowledge him our Master, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his true Positions, to the utmost of our
power against all gain-sayers.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of the Abuses and disrepute the Galenists have
brought upon Physick, and the Reformation they
have of late pretended.</head>
            <p>YE have of late made a great stir, though
to little purpose and credit, to procure a
Power from the Supreme Authority of the
Nation, that ye might make a Reformation
in this Noble Profession of Physick, there
being (as ye say) no visible means left but your
selves to compass it. But what was your drift
in this? Truly, we believe the first thing,
next the enslaving the poor Apothecaries,
would have been a total <hi>Suppression</hi> of those
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100452:13"/>
that had opposed your fictitious Principles,
false Axioms, and indirect practices in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
that then ye might have domineered as
ye pleased. But stay a while, we hope the
Sage Magistrate will take it into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ye are the chiefest persons that need
reformation; and that your Purgations need
purgation, they being (as we can prove by
matter of fact) not fitting, so uncorrected, to
be taken into the Body. We hope moreover
they will take notice, that your Bloody course
ought to be voted cruel and unchristian, the
Life or Soul being seated in the Blood: God
having created the Medicines of the Earth,
not Bleeding, cutting holes in the Skin, Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterings,
and such like butchering Tortures, to
cure miserable man. 'Tis true, there are sad
exorbitancies, irregularities, and abuses in
Physick, but who we pray have been the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
occasions of them but your selves? who
have conjured up such <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Quacks</hi> in
every place, (who like Locusts eat the bread
out of honest Physicians mouths) by your
<hi>Profane Prescripts?</hi> and now you would fain
lay them down, but ye cannot; for they are
become too potent for you, some of them
having so well improv'd their time, that they
are like for ought we can see to cast you out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100452:13"/>
of the saddle, and to ride with Foot-cloaths
themselves, dealing but deservedly with you.
If ye had better practised the <hi>Pythagorical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
these things had never been; or had
ye delivered your selves, as ye finde fault <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,
Helmont,</hi> and other sons of Art did,
more obscurely, and Aenigmatically, who
foresaw these mischiefs, and endeavoured to
prevent them, Physick had flourished to this
day in its splendor and beauty: But as ye
have handled the matter, every Good-wife,
any silly fellow may read your <hi>Dispensatory,</hi>
use some of those Medicines without your
method, and sometimes no less success; yea,
and may laugh at some of those ridiculous
Compositions discovered to them by your
trusty servant <hi>Culpepper.</hi> But all this is no
hinderance but a furtherance to encrease your
Practice, (as we have heard some of you say)
sith these illiterate Ideots do but make work
for you. Is it so, but we much doubt it;
surely if ye aimed at this at first, to multiply
these men to augment Mortalities for your
advantage, it was a very wicked Design, not
to be endured by a Nation: but if this be
fallen out through your incogitance acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,
that these men have brought in the
more gain to you, to the detriment and ruine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100452:14"/>
of the people, and simply for this reason, ye
desire to be Arnautists, or self-deniers, why
do ye (pretending to the Higher Powers a
Publick Good) not likewise instruct them in
some way, how the indigent Commonalty
may be cured better and cheaper; giving us
infallible testimonies of some rare Cures
above others, and your zealous charity for
your Neighbours, by abating your excessive
Fees, and by curing him <hi>gratis</hi> that hath faln
into Thieves, like the good Samaritan.
And we think it were but just, that they who
have gotten such Riches in Physick, as some
of you undoubtedly, by the destruction of
those that might have been preserved, should
<hi>Zaccheus</hi>-like, impart a portion to those that
are distressed. And certainly there is now
great need of this retribution, and as the state
of things stands, another course must be taken
(without this costly Physick) to cure the Poor
of the Nation; which if our prudent Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
shall please to listen to, we shall in all
humility propose to their wise considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
beseeching them to consider what sad
consequences must of necessity have come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Concession to the presumptuous Desires
of these men: How thousands of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must have neglected the means, and so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100452:14"/>
have run the hazard of perishing, having not
wherewithal to seek to these chargeable
Doctors for recovery, the Apothecary not
daring to sell them a little <hi>London Treacle
Mithridate,</hi> &amp;c. unless authorized by them;
as if their Prescripts were able to infuse new
Virtues into Medicines. Neither should any
have stretched forth his hand to have pulled
his languishing Brother out of the ditch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
licensed by them.</p>
            <p>What we pray should our City have done,
if some Epidemical contageous Disease, as
the Plague, had reigned amongst us, sith they
(according to their Masters Dictates) would
all have run out of it: We plainly see the
greatest Clarks are not alwayes the best Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
for we stand amazed to see such learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Physicians, men so highly reputed for
their parts, to carry on such an unreasonable
Project, meerly for their own sinister interest,
(the Publick good therein being altogether
neglected) as to sollicite the highest Court of
<hi>Iudicature,</hi> to confirm such a <hi>Patent</hi> to them,
that they might be sole Masters of their Lives,
Souls, and Fortunes, without controulment:
That they might <hi>Brow-beat, Insult,</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi>
over those that are no whit inferiour to
them in worth. Did <hi>Ambition, Covetousness,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100452:15"/>
and <hi>Revenge</hi> so blinde them, that they should
think that such wise <hi>Senators</hi> would ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to make themselves and People <hi>Slaves</hi>
and <hi>Vassals</hi> to the insolent lusts of those, who
never gave us any proof, pledge, or earnest of
their Cures in Physick above many Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries;
who have protested to us, that there
were some of these stately Doctors so extream
ignorant in <hi>materia medica,</hi> that they did not
know the Ingredients of certain trivial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
presented to their eyes: yea, and
that some of their Prescripts have been so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
extravagant and pernicious, that the
Apothecary hath been forced to correct them,
unless he would have suffered the Patient to
run the hazard of perishing.</p>
            <p>We confess, the Apothecary in many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and obliquities is not to be excused,
however (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> struck the Father when
the Son offended) so we think the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the lash for not rightly educating and
instructing his poor obsequious servant; for
we are verily perswaded had they been more
discreetly tutor'd, they would have proved
better. But <hi>hinc illae lacrhymae,</hi> this is that
which wrings the Doctor, and galls him to
the heart, that he should bring up birds to
pick out his own eyes; that after so many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100452:15"/>
years sweet congress, and mutual correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
his <hi>Labourer, Drudge,</hi> or <hi>Excrement</hi>
(as a Doctor was heard to call him) should
now stand in defiance against him, and take
upon him to cure Diseases equally with him.
And to say truth, a man cannot tell which of
the two exceeds; for we are of that opinion,
one may pick and chuse, but find never a barrel
better Herring. The Servant is now become
a Doctor, the Dispencer a Prescriber: Both
use the same Method, the same Indications,
the like Medicines, and with equal success
for ought we can see. Of the two we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
the Apothecary hath for the most part
the start of his Doctor, for as much as he not
onely knoweth the Composition exactly, and
at his pleasure can frustrate both Physicians
and Patients expectation; but also being
more conversant with the Sick man, can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
himself more then the other by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
observations, which opportunity the
Doctor, partly through pride, and partly
through covetousness and idleness, loses.
Now good Master Doctor <hi>Galen,</hi> let us reason
a little soberly; have ye not brought your
Hogs to a fair market; whether of us (we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you) have been most prudent and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?
ye that have made this noble Science
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100452:16"/>
(the Professours whereof Divine Writ hath
charged to be honoured) to become a meer
mercenary or a meretricious business; a very
Trade to get money, an Imposture to serve
your own ends, setting up an Apothecary
your Emissary and Decoy, to fetch in gainful
Practice; or we that have alwayes been tender
of the reputation of Physick, and the Lives of
the infirm; and for that end have not onely
studied hard for many years, beating our
brains to do that which is fitting according to
Art; but also laboured with our own hands
night and day, not without hazard of our
lives, and great expences, that we might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what we do, and do what we ought
for the Lives of our poor miserable <hi>Patients;</hi>
that we might alwayes have in readiness those
<hi>Arcana's,</hi> of which the <hi>vulgus hominum</hi> is, and
ever will be ignorant. Had we prostituted
our selves and the Art, or taken those indirect
courses which ye have done, we are certain we
might have been possessours of Riches and
Honours equal with you.</p>

prize a man that shall offer, promise, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
a Cure for you, above another that tires
you out either with none, or false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>Great Patriots, be pleased to take notice
how they have villified and slandered true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
perswading the World falsly, that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Medicines (which we frequently use
without strict weighing them) were danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
received an Empyreuma, or hurtful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
from the Fire; that they did either
Kill or Cure in a short time: yea, some of
them have been so impudently audacious to
assert, That whosoever took Chymical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
although he were cured for the present,
yet in the revolution of a year it would cost
him his life. So that in their <hi>fury</hi> they have
cast into the Kennel out of a very honest and
able Apothecary's Shop, a most safe, innocent,
and effectual Chymical Medicine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
have endeavoured the ruine of the
poor man.</p>
            <p>A <hi>quondam</hi> noted <hi>Galenist,</hi> in greatest part
reclaimed from their fopperies, and almost
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100452:18"/>
got out of that durty practice, protested that
he knew a most eminent Doctor of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that passes for one of the most learned
amongst them, that did not dare to venture
to give five or six grains of <hi>Antimonium Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum,</hi>
which we can give with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
security, and good effect, often to thirty
or forty grains.</p>
            <p>They formerly cried down Oyl of Vitriol
by no means fitting to be taken into the body,
because it did corrode a Glove, supposing it
would act the same in the Stomack. As for
<hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> and other Preparations of
Mercury, they concluded them all to be little
better then poyson; which now they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make use of, not scrupling to give it to
Children, but we fear to their destruction
sometimes, as they order the matter by their
method, and a careless preparation of it, which
they alwayes referre to another.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not long since that a <hi>Galenist</hi> of
great fame did upon some Discourse of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
confidently affirm, that he knew he
could do as much with crude Mercury, as any
with it never so well prepared: which he
dares not (we are sure) maintain to be true by
any visible instance, but spake it meerly out
of a Vatinian hatred to Chymical Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100452:18"/>
which nothwithstanding he and his
Fraternity are forced to make use of closely,
labouring to pump and fish them out of
others.</p>
            <p>Now at length finding that they have stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in vain against truth, by their obloquies
and false suggestions still kicking against a
prick; and finding they cannot obscure the
bright beames of Pyrotechnical Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
they take now another supplanting
course, and of a sudden will all become Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;
but <hi>Galeno-Chymists,</hi> as monstrous and
Anomalous as a Centaure or Syren: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they think to blear the eyes of the world,
to make them believe, that their Method
sweetens all our sharp Vitriolate Medicines,
allayes all our Corrosives, fixes all our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
Preparations; and in short, makes all
safe and sound, which otherwise would be
destructive in our fingers. Thus they still
juggle with, and delude the world, still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
and spinning out the time, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to part with ease, gain, and honour,
notwithstanding thousands suffer by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
practice, e're they will come in quietly,
and sincerely submit to the truth, for the good
of the Nation; although they know at last
they must be forced to yield, time bringing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100452:19"/>
that to light which is their principal study to
involve in obscurity. For we make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but that posterity will admire their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
herein, and abhorre them for it.</p>
            <p>Well, come what will come, for ought we
can see they are still resolved to maintain their
State and Grandure as long as they can, for
their present life, and then let the world
hereafter censure them, what care they: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Greek Poet

greatest Donns, being questioned by a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicacious</hi>
Gentleman, what the reason was,
that he ordered something very incongruous
in reference to his Patient; and being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
home by him, whom he knew would not
be baffled, made this express answer; <hi>Hang it</hi>
(quoth he) <hi>we are but a Company of Cheats.</hi>
This was reported to us by a person of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>

            <head>CHAP. V. In what space of time a good Physician may
resolve his Patient of the Event
of his Disease.</head>
            <p>HE is unworthy the name of a Physician,
that in Acute Diseases doth not on the
fifth or sixth day after his admission, either
make Nature master of the Disease, or else on
the sixth or seventh give a positive prediction
what will be the conclusion thereof; and that
with so much certainty, that he should seldom
be mistaken but as a man: For it is a grand
ignominy, and an intollerable disgrace, to see
a Mechanick to engage himself to bring to
pass what he undertakes, and a learned Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
either not to dare to promise you any
thing of a Cure, or wholly to frustrate your
expectation. It is no wonder if some men
taking advantage of your weakness in this
particular, have cast it in our teeth, that our
Art is altogether conjectural; and that we
do all things therein by hab nab, happy be
lucky; hitting the mark with as much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
as those people called <hi>Andabatae,</hi> that
fought with one another winking; we wish
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100452:20"/>
these Scoffs and Taunts might lie at the doors
of <hi>those</hi> that have justly deserved them.</p>
            <p>In Chronick Infirmities a longer time must
needs be required to give satisfaction to the
Patient concerning his Recovery, the matter
of the Disease being many times fixt in the
Body, and as it were settled on the lees, the
ferment of the parts being either vitiated, or
in great part abolished; and the Archeus or
vital Spirit being much diminished, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
instrument of the Soul, by which it
acts for our health or sickness, in which every
Disease nestles, and is primarily seated and
characterized, without the power of which
none can be cured; (of which the <hi>Galenists</hi>
have been too ignorant, until such time most
<hi>Acute Helmont</hi> (like a bright star of truth) made
it appear) As the matter stands thus, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
may very well assume a fortnight or
three weeks at most, finally to conclude what
he is able to do for his Patient; whether he be
capable (as he conceives) to be restored to
health, if not, then to resign him up to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
that may be able to do more: for this
wier-drawing course in Physick, to keep a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
long in suspence, without any relief,
(peradventure for some private ends) is to be
abominated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100452:20"/>
'Tis a strong Argument of great <hi>Weakness</hi>
or <hi>Deceit</hi> in a Physician, when in some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
time he cannot or will not give an
account what is like to be the <hi>Issue</hi> of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
such an one is to be avoided as the
Plague, that is blinde and cannot discover the
Mark he is to shoot at; or aims at the <hi>Purse</hi>
of his Patient, rather then the <hi>Recovery</hi> of his
Health. Be advised whosoever thou art, not
to suffer him that waits for a <hi>Crisis,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give thee in a short time a sufficient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of an effectual Cure, to proceed any
further; for be assured that a good Physician
never looks after a <hi>Crisis,</hi> (standing still as a
meer spectatour while Nature is oftentimes
worsted upon unequal terms by its enemy)
but with all <hi>expedition</hi> unroosteth that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
<hi>Guest,</hi> that hath taken up its lodging
in the vital Spirits, wherein the longer it lurks,
the more difficult it is to eject; for <hi>cunctando
crescit,</hi> and so at length confounds the <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
of the whole Body: wherefore an Honest
and Prudent Chymist, <hi>Principiis obstat,</hi> falls
forthwith upon the extirpation of any malady,
whereas the <hi>Galenist</hi> labours to circumcise and
lop off here and there the <hi>Branches</hi> or <hi>Symptoms,</hi>
lulling his Patient asleep with some incorrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Opiate,</hi> mitigating sleight pains by <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100452:21"/>
quenching his Thirst by <hi>cooling Iuleps,</hi>
bedaubing his Feet, Wrists, and Front, with
Cataplasms, and the like, to the wearisomness
and vexation of the sick Man, without any
real casement of his Grief. Hence it falls out
that some of our learned <hi>Galenists</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
an Acute Feaver, to the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day, and that in hope of a <hi>Crisis,</hi> which
we are confident might have been taken down
before the seventh. Hereby they hatch up
some Chronick tedious languor, which usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows at the heels of most <hi>Malignant</hi>
Feavers they take in hand, because they never
searched the Soar to the <hi>bottom,</hi> but onely
<hi>skinn'd</hi> it over. Oftentimes do these <hi>Botching
Galenists</hi> bring to light a viperous Generation
of Long <hi>Infirmities,</hi> that might easily have
been destroyed at first in <hi>Ovo</hi> the <hi>Embryon,</hi>
which afterward growing too headstrong
for them, elude and slight all their trivial
<hi>Applications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this they can still do under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of safe Medicines; when indeed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
man had better have dyed <hi>Caesars</hi> death,
and nimbly to have been sent into the other

those torturing and racking Carnifications,
by their <hi>Blisterings, Cuppings, Scarifications,

<hi>Consuming Purgatives,</hi> their severe <hi>Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and rigid <hi>Diet-drinks,</hi> and at length to

            <head>CHAP. VI. How much precious time the Galenists spend in
Anatomical Curiosities to little purpose.</head>
            <p>OUr Antagonists raise no small dust, and
make no little noise with their Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Bodies, which were much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
if they did not spend more time then
needeth, rather for ostentation, and to get a
fame abroad, then for any notable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Cure of poor miserable Man. For
if it savoured not too much of vain-glory, they
would rather exercise these operations more
privately amongst themselves, and instruct
any ingenious Gentleman, that desires to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100452:22"/>
informed therein, so far as might conduce for
his particular satisfaction; and not make a
publique Theatrical business of it, for the
entertainment of any rude fellows: but enough
of that. As exact Anatomists as these men
are, we know this for a truth, that the lodging
place of Diseases is seldom to be discovered
by the Knife; which indeed was boldly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
(though in vain) by an industrious
<hi>Galenist</hi> of late years, who cut up a Pestilent
Body, to finde out in what part the Plague
did principally reside, to the loss of his own
life, perhaps for want of some <hi>Arcanum</hi> which
an <hi>Helmontist</hi> could have given him.</p>
            <p>Anatomy we stand up for, as much as any,
without which we are certain a Physician must
necessarily be much defective in Physick; in
which (we dare say) some of us have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as much pains as most of our Opponents:
and something we can say without vain-glory,
that we were the first that in these parts of
<hi>Europe</hi> have made the Experiment effectually
of taking out the Spleen of a Dog, without
which he lived perfectly well two years and
a quarter; the same being often repeated by
others who stiffly opposed it at first. But
what is all this to the grand matter in hand,
which crowns and gives life to all the rest,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100452:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is, to be master of those Remedies which
(proportionable to Diseases) are able to tame
and subjugate them to the law of Nature?
What would it profit to tell our Patients that
we had taken the Spleen out of a Dog, if they
(afflicted in that part) could receive no benefit
from us? what pittiful comforters should we
be in such a case?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Invention of the Circulation
of the Blood by industrious Doctor <hi>Harvey,</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VII. A just reproof of the Ignorance of most of them
in Surgery.</head>
            <p>CErtainly it was an evil Design at first, and
a plain demonstration of idleness and
pride in Physicians, when they brake into
parts those Faculties, which did formerly, and
should alwayes indivisibly reside in one man.
We confess Fractures and Dislocations require
the hand of a professed Artist, that is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
versed in Anatomy and accurate Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in this kinde; but when Medicines taken
inwardly are principally to perform the Cure,
outward as well as inward Diseases belong to
the Physician, so it may be done to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Professours of Surgery; sith
<hi>honos alit artes:</hi> as the matter stands now, it
is not amiss for the Surgeon to have a share in
the profit, although the Physician hath the
greatest hand in the Cure.</p>
            <p>We have oftentimes admired the Ignorance
of some <hi>Galenists,</hi> that have not been able to
undertake a Whitlow, a Scald, a green wound,
a trivial Soar, but have been forced to send
them to a Surgeon living remote, as if it no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100452:24"/>
whit concerned them; and as if any one could
be a true Physician, and be destitute of that
which essentially belongs to his Art. Needs
must that Physician be extreamly mutilated in
his knowledge, that is to seek to cure a <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmon,</hi>
an <hi>Erysipelas, Fistula,</hi> or malignant Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer:
For we can confidently averre, and make
it evident, that 'tis the inward Medicament
that must principally cure most outward Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases,
if they be ever radically and to a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
healed, outward Applications being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
of no effect. Yet we will not deny
some virulent Ulcers may to a wonder receive
sanation by vertue of Chymical Preparations
outwardly applied; as, <hi>Balsamum Fuliginis,
Balsamum Sameck,</hi> the pure Sulphur of <hi>Venus,</hi>
Antimony, and other Minerals, of which none
but a true Son of Art can be possessour. But
above all is to be extolled, that admirable
Magnetical way of curing, which doubtless
if rightly improved would work stupendious
things; so that some <hi>Galenist</hi> would presently
conclude that there is Witchery, or some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
means made use of: So blinde and
stupid they are in the most needful Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
that what their Brains cannot conceive,
they presently reject as Diabolical or impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
Tell them of the <hi>Alkahest,</hi> or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

               <hi>Menstruum,</hi> of <hi>Lapis Chrysopeius, Lapis But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri,</hi>
of a <hi>Panacaea,</hi> they will but deride and
flout at it, boldly and presumptuously deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any such thing to be in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their shallow wits being altogether sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and steeped in <hi>durty</hi> Humours, Qualities,
Temperaments, Mixtures, and Contrarieties,
never had the happiness to have the least
glimpse of the admirable perfections of such
things. This we can set down positively as
a truth, that that Physician that knows not
something of the Cure of Diseases both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and outward this way, is but a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>alwayes learning, and never like to come to
any perfection</hi> in his Art: Let him be never
so much applauded for his excellent parts, and
great Learning, he shall alwayes be esteemed
by the wisest, an Ideot in Phylosophy, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant of the radical and intrinsecal
causes of things.</p>
            <p>We doubt not but there is excellent use
of Manual operation, where the Knife is to
perform the Cure, as in Amputations of parts,
Lithotomie, and the like. But we know this
experimentally, that both Physician and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
are too forward to lop off parts, and
butcherly to cut holes in the skin; whereas
many times this bloody course might be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100452:25"/>
omitted, and the sick person restored in great
part, if not altogether, to his pristine health,
without mutilation or sauciation; as we could
instance of late in a Gentleman, belonging to a
Noble man, whose Leg after all their tedious
torturing, and frivolous attempts, as, Blood-letting,
Purgation, Salivation, Sudorificks,
Diet-drinks, Mercurial Applications, and
Cauteries, they at length despairing of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
advised to be cut off: which God
(by means of his poor servant a Chymical
Physician) prevented, the Gentleman being
restored to his perfect health, and his Limb
saved.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished, that ye would study
to dissolve and reduce into their first matter,
those Coagulations frequently hapning; as,
Scrofulous Tumors, Nodes, Scirrosities,
Ganglions, Wens, &amp;c. without Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Incisions: but especially to bend your
whole strength, to finde out some potent
<hi>Arcanum</hi> (which God no doubt hath created)
for the untying and colliquating that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Product, in mans Body, the Stone,
without cruel Lithotomie by a frightfull
Knife. Did you not despond to finde, and
supinely slight the pursuit of something in
this kinde, yea, if ye did not maliciously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100452:26"/>
others, without controversie such an
<hi>Arcanum</hi> might have probably been brought
to light, able to dissolve the Stone even in
the Bladder. But it is enough for you to rest
your selves contented with the old profitable
way of Perforating and broaching the Body,
which if it fail, ye presently protest ye have
done as much as Art can; which narrowly
examined by a judicious Physician, would
perhaps prove very impotent.</p>
            <p>How often have ye received credit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
from the world, when in the Dissection
of dead Bodies, ye have found any of the
<hi>Viscera</hi> corrupted, or hard congealed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
as, stones in the Kidney, Gall, or
other parts, justifying and magnifying your

were first admitted, the Corruption might
have been hindred, and Coagulations dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
            <p>Some few years since a Chymical Physician
expelled three large Stones nestling about the
region of the Spleen, the least as big as a large
Turky's egg, out of a Maid-servants Body, by
virtue of some <hi>Paracelsian</hi> Medicines, perfectly
restoring her to health, which she enjoyes to
this day; whom we are confident if a <hi>Galenist</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100452:26"/>
had undertaken, he would by his Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
pernicious Purgation, Blisterings, &amp;c.
have destroyed, and the cause of her Disease
should never have been discovered, unless by
accident the Knife had made it appear; which
would have sufficiently excused the <hi>Galenist,</hi>
and cleared him as one that did what possibly
could be done by Art.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. What a noise our Adversaries make with their
Laboratory, and how they vaunt that they
use Chymical Medicines according to their
Method.</head>
            <p>YE make your boast that ye possess (as
well as we) your Laboratory, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Furnaces: That ye use Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
according to your Method, not as
we do, at random. That ye knowing the ill
qualities and properties of them, and how
hazardous they are, do upon a pinch flye to
them, having made use of first other safe
Medicines.</p>
            <p>These are fair pretences of truth we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
but if we search narrowly to the bottom,
we shall easily discover them to be meer delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100452:27"/>
As to the first which ye glory in, your
Laboratory, we answer, 'Tis not the Labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or specious Furnaces that simply makes
the Spagyrical Physician, no more then a vast
Library of it self will make a learned Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Is there any more in this then a meer
pomp and vanity, to have multiplicity of
Instruments, and not be able to make use of
them according to the true principles of Art.
For we dare averre it, that that man that is an
enemy to the Doctrine of <hi>Helmont,</hi> cannot
possibly arrive to be a true Chymical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.
He may indeed be like one, as the
Ape is said to be like a man, and therefore
most deformed; <hi>Simia quòd similis turpissima
bestia nobis,</hi> &amp;c. Do ye think ever to attain to
this difficult Knowledge by virtue of your
Master <hi>Galens</hi> Rules, who never saw <hi>Quick-silver</hi>
or <hi>Rose water?</hi> whom incomparable
<hi>Helmont</hi> hath made appear altogether blinde
in the true Fundamentals of Nature, not
knowing aright the Quiddity or Essence of
a Disease, the Cause, the immediate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or place thereof, nor the direct and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Cure of it.</p>
            <p>Be not deceived, for it is no such easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as ye would make the world believe, to
become a Philosopher by the Fire: lay aside
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100452:27"/>
therefore your dearly beloved <hi>Galen,</hi> who hath
made you so rich by the ruine of others, and
study <hi>Helmont</hi> night and day; and when ye
have attained some of his Theory, then buy
(as he advises) Coals and Glasses. By this
means we doubt not but ye will become sound
Physicians, if otherwise never.</p>
            <p>To what you alledge concerning your use
of Chymical Medicines, we may safely, say,
it had been happy for the credit of this Art,
if none had ever come into your fingers, or
been prescribed by you; having so perverted
the use of them, partly through adulterate and
sophisticate Preparations, proceeding from
ignorance, supine negligence, or covetousness;
partly through your dogmatical Method, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
them unseasonably, when ye have
suffered Nature to be worried by a Disease,
and thrown flat on its back; and exhausted
it by cruel Phlebotomy, poisonous Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Blisterings, Scarifications, &amp;c. upon this
ye take occasion to maligne, slight, and villifie
those Chymical Medicines, which ye either
never had good, or never knew how to use.
Yet thus much we have observed, when a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
findes any benefit, 'tis for the most part
by virtue of some Chymical Medicine which
ye mix (as ye usually do) with your trumpery,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100452:28"/>
meerly to disguise the matter, lest too much
respect should be attributed to a Medicament
which ye have borrowed from your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let any indifferent man judge,
whether it be not a part of the most odious
Ingratitude that can possible be devised, for
these men to scoff at, to rail against, to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
and backbite them, from whom they
have received the best means they enjoy to
cure their Patients; without which they had
been before now exploded and thrust off the
stage of the World with disgrace.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. An Answer to some Objections laid to our charge

            <p>OUr Adversaries object to us, that many
ignorant Empiricks make use of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Preparations, to the destruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
credulous persons: posting themselves up
in every corner of the Street, proclaiming
themselves to be possessours of great <hi>Arcana's,</hi>
even to <hi>Panacaea's,</hi> whereby they profess they
can work wonders, and cure a Catalogue of
Diseases which the <hi>Galenists</hi> count incurable;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100452:28"/>
but being brought to the touchstone of sound
experience, they are found to be meer Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
empty of all sound knowledge, no whit
able to perform any thing proportionable to
their promises.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they urge that our Chymical
Authors are Hyperbolical, or excessive in the
praises of their Medicamens, extolling them
beyond the activity of the things themselves;
and that they frequently set down false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
which when a young beginner first puts
to a trial, according to his Authors descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he is disappointed and discouraged <hi>in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
even in the first essay or onset, which is
enough to make us censure you Stentors and
vain boasters. This we confess ingeniously
is not to be denied in part, and we could wish
it otherwise; but 'tis the fate of the best
things to be corrupted, and 'tis an ill Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
to conclude any thing to be evil,
because some have abused it. For our parts,
we utterly disown and renounce these mens
actions, condemning their ignorance as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
as ye can, desiring they might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and chastized according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits.
Yet thus much we can say for some of
them, that having got some trivial Chymical
Medicines perchance from your Apothecary,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100452:29"/>
neglecting your Method, (which many times
ties you up so fast, that ye want liberty to use
some laudable Medicines for your Patients
recovery) they have performed some eminent
cures to your disgrace and their own applause;
which hath made some admire your great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity
herein, to the dishonour of Learning.
We know a Chymist that desires no more
Practice in Physick to get a competent living
by, then those Patients to whom ye cannot
make a promise of a Cure after two or three
moneths time, whom he would undertake to
resolve in less then a moneth. And assuredly
to any discreet man this is proof enough, how
erroneous ye are in that which chiefly concerns
the life of man. For our parts we should think it
very strange, and be infinitely ashamed, if any
Patient should be cured by the <hi>Galenists,</hi> whom
we have given over, which (we are sure) ye on
the contrary part cannot make good.</p>
            <p>As touching Chymical Authors, that set
you not in express terms the right way to
make some Medicines, and likewise prize some
more then they deserve, for these we Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
not: But by your favour, we conceive
that many times the errour lieth in you, who
want true Chymical Rudiments, and not in
them who think it not wisdom (seeing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100452:29"/>
success thereof) to set down all things
so plain, that an Apothecaries boy may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them. For believe it, if ye had those
Philosophical Principles which <hi>Helmont</hi> hath
delivered to the world, these trivial Authors
could not so easily deceive you: In him we
are sure ye will finde sound Doctrine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable,
by which we doubt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
your false Theorems and Axioms in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
We plead not for any that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any Preparations beyond what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
it is enough if we engage our selves no
further with you, then wherein the things
themselves shall justifie us.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. How much to seek the Galenists are in that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Philosophy which directs us to the Cure
of Diseases.</head>
            <p>NEeds must the <hi>Galenist</hi> erre in the cure of
Diseases, when they are very ignorant
of their Causes. Their very Fundamentals
and Principles in natural Philosophy being
<hi>false,</hi> as <hi>Helmont</hi> hath plainly made it appear.
What an absurdity is it to take in Fire, which
is neither a Substance nor an Accident, to
make up the four Elements, and to fetch it
from the highest Region, next the Moon, that
it might enter into all Concretes: and from
these Quaternary Elements to deduce their
four <hi>Humours, Complexions,</hi> and <hi>Temperaments,</hi>
and accordingly to proceed in the Cure of
man; bending all their forces to remove <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Products</hi> of Diseases, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Disease it self behinde?</p>
            <p>What an erroneous <hi>Definition</hi> have they
made of a Feaver, and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if they go unsuccessfully about the Cure;
as if there were no more to be done but to
take an <hi>Indication</hi> from preternatural <hi>Heat,</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100452:31"/>
so to cool in the same degree, for the restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Patient to his former sanity; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that essential to a Feaver which is but a
meer product, depending upon the exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Archeus, or vital Spirits?</p>
            <p>What errour can be more gross then to
maintain, that the natural Heat of the <hi>Stomack,</hi>
by means of the parts adjacent, is able to alter
what is taken into it so powerfully, that in a
short time even such hard Bodies, as Bones,
Iron, and Glass, are dissolved in it, which the
<hi>Culinary</hi> Fire cannot easily conquer; taking no
notice that the <hi>Stomack</hi> of Fishes are actually
<hi>cold,</hi> and yet digest most vigorously. Surely
'tis very improbable that these men should
rectifie the indigestion and defects of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
that know not how it performs its office
aright. Hence it comes to pass, that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
destroy by their faeculent Medicines the
Eucrasie or Tone of that part which ought to
be taken into care above any in the whole
Body.</p>
            <p>Analogous to Fire, they have brought in an
Humour called <hi>Choller,</hi> part whereof they say
is gathered into a Receptacle of a Bladder,
which overflowing and exceeding (they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm)
causes the Jaundies, and many other
Diseases depending upon that Humour; rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100452:32"/>
that an Excrement (to be purged out
with Rhubarb) that is of most noble use,
which no perfect Creature can want, neither
Beasts, Fowl, or Fish; ordained by God as a
special Balsom, to preserve the Body from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction;
by virtue of which the second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
is performed, the Acide juyce of the
Stomack being converted into a Saline. Their
ignorance herein hath produced many capital
Errours in Physick, which would be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to insist upon.</p>
            <p>From the Element of Earth they have dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
another Humour called <hi>Melancholly,</hi> which
they have placed in the Spleen, reputing it a
part destinated for that purpose; never dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till <hi>Helmont</hi> divulged it, that in it and the
continuate Arteries, is resident a ferment of
most admirable use for the Digestion of the
the Stomack, which being interrupted through
multiplicity of occasional Causes, engender
various Diseases; as, Scurvy, Plurisie, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,
&amp;c. which they neither know how
to cure, nor by their good wills would suffer
others.</p>
            <p>What a miserable Errour is it in Philosophy
to assert, that the Stone in the Kidneys and
Bladder is engendred from Phlegme, (which
they say symbolizes with the Element of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100452:32"/>
which Humour by power of a graduated
Heat (but where to be found in the Body we
know not) is brought to that stony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence;
which how to break they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unwitting, unless by the knife.</p>
            <p>It hath been a common practice to keep
their Patients some moneths to Diet-drinks of
Guaiacum, Sarzaparilla, Sassafras, out of an
intent of drying up superfluous moisture, and
imaginary Catarrhs in the Body; as if one of
their strong Purges would not more effectually
answer that Indication in one day, better then
their former course in a moneth. These
things <hi>Helmont</hi> hath plainly shewed to be
ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Who in his right wits will take these men
to be found Philosophers, that attribute the
cause of extream thirst in a Feaver simply to
Heat and Drought; whereas at the same time
a great quantity of cool liquor floats in the
Stomack, to some pints perhaps.</p>
            <p>They see Hydropick persons abound with
great quantity of moisture all over the body,
and yet cannot be provoked to sweat; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they never gave us any clear Reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
till <hi>Helmont</hi> appeared.</p>
            <p>Infinite have been their mistakes in Nature,
and false Hypotheses, to the detriment of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100452:33"/>
mans life, which are sufficiently laid open by
that great Philosopher <hi>Helmont.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

we shall referre you to know more of that

            <p>DId the World rightly understand what
destruction of mankinde hath been
made by this Sanguinary way of curing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
in all Ages, since this prodigal emission
of Blood came first in use, (suggested with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt by that sworn Enemy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
the Devil) it would (being enraged) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
abominate any such Physician, or such
a pretended remedy.</p>
            <p>How happy may those Nations be reputed
in this particular, (witness their Longaevity
and Sanity above ours) whom Nature hath so
well instructed, as not to part with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100452:33"/>
treasure of Life, unless against their
wills through some violent separation of the
connexed parts. And certainly were we but
governed by Nature, which intends all things
for its own preservation, and never erres
therein, unless interrupted or put by its scope
through some transverse contingent, we
would by no means admit of this Bloody
course for a Cure; being sufficiently convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that this Solar Balsom the pure Blood,
called by the Latines (to distinguish it from
<hi>Cruor) Sanguis,</hi> the very <hi>Stamen</hi> and <hi>Subtegmen,</hi>
the subject and material foundation of Life, is
never exterminated or cast out of the Body by
Nature, unless extimulated through some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperating
and hostile matter that is gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. And indeed to let out promiscuously
<hi>Sanguis</hi> and <hi>Cruor,</hi> good and bad together,
which is unavoidable, for <hi>qua data porta ruunt,</hi> is
equally absurd, as to cut off part of the fleshie
substance of the Finger, that the Splinter or
Thorn therein fastened may be removed; or
to suffer generous Wine to run out, that some
distasteful and fracedinous odour contracted
from the Vessel may be taken off; or that
the Ebullition or Effervescence thereof, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the impetuous Spirits, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
a segregation of impurities in it, may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100452:34"/>
be asswaged: whereas it is more consonant to
reason, to pick the <hi>Thorn</hi> out of the finger, to
impregnate the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Vessel</hi> with some odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous
fume or liquor, that it may become
fragrant and pleasing in smell; likewise to take
down the fermentation of the fretting acide
Atomes thereof by some artificial means, that
is able to lenifie and appease the Spirits, and
settle all quiet.</p>
            <p>Doubtless the same may be accomplished
in mans Blood, (when at any time through
some preternatural occasion it becomes tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
exorbitant, and degenerate from its
genuine goodness) by ridding it of that pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
acidity and cadaverous foulness, which
makes it disturbed and restless as long as it
remains in it; for <hi>omne vivens mortui impatiens
esse solet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we are certain an able Physician
can effect, being admitted while there is a
competent strength, which we are alwayes
most careful to preserve and augment, contrary
to the tenour of your Practice. For so soon
as we have discharged the first and second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
of what did burthen and clog them,
we either exhibit some potent <hi>Arcanum,</hi> which
upon its first entertainment into the Stomack,
doth either pacifie the fury of the vital Spirit,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100452:34"/>
or by its illuminating beams doth disperse the
black Atomes that obnubilate the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that it cannot act for the good of the
whole: Or we give some <hi>Volatile Alkali,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with the specifick Virtues of fit <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,</hi>
capable to be circulated with the Blood
into all parts of the Body, being allied to the
foresaid Spirit, and symbolizing with it.</p>
            <p>These are powerful in Opening, Cleansing,
Expectorating, Volatilizing any congealed
Blood, invigorating the natural, and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preternatural Ferment; extinguishing
the acidity of the <hi>Latex</hi> in the Blood, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Scirrous and Tartareous-like matter,
with which sometimes the Veins, Arteries,
and other parts of Body are as it were pariet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
These are <hi>Diuretick, Diaphoretick,</hi> and
<hi>Antimalignant</hi> mortifying <hi>Erysipela's,</hi> breaking
and profligating <hi>Vomica's,</hi> or any <hi>Abscesses</hi> in
the Body; and this we can engage our selves to
perform, without any notable diminution of
the strength, or fear of recidivation, or any
dangerous lapse into some Chronick Disease,
which the Phlebotomists dares not promise
with any security: for it often happens that
the Patient is sent Piece-meal to his grave,
being (as it were) grated into his first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100452:35"/>
because his Disease was never rightly
mannaged in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Now the greatest Plea the <hi>Galenists</hi> have for
Blood-letting, is taken from <hi>Plethora sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
an extraordinary fulness of Blood <hi>quoad
vasa,</hi> or <hi>quoad vires,</hi> as they call it; that is,
when the Vessels are over-filled, or the
strength oppressed with too great redundance
of Blood; and here they speak equivocally,
leaving us to seek what <hi>Blood</hi> they mean, either
that which is properly named <hi>Sanguis,</hi> the
most pure sincere, and sublimest juyce in our
Body, in which the <hi>Soul</hi> is chiefly seated, or
that crude (lately rubefied liquor called) <hi>Cruor,</hi>
oftentimes abounding with superfluities and
recrements: If they take their <hi>Indication</hi> of
Bleeding from the <hi>first,</hi> we can confidently
upon sound Arguments deduced from some
experimental Demonstrations (which we
would set down at large, if succinctness which
we aim at did permit) assert, that there is no
such thing really existent in the Body of man;
for never had any man too much of that most
vital Balsom called <hi>Sanguis,</hi> the encrease or
diminution of which, shortens or prolongs

plenary, absolute, and continuate reparation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100452:35"/>
of the same, our Lives would be protracted
to an exceeding great length beyond what
they are. This therefore is by no means to
be exhausted or squandered away upon trivial
occasions, at the unreasonable and arbitrary
commands of a desperate <hi>Galenist,</hi> but to be
precisely preserved and hoarded up, as the
onely Treasure and Stock of Life.</p>
            <p>Well, if they take their Indication to Bleed
from fulness of the last called <hi>Cruor,</hi> then sith
this consists of partly excrementitious matter,
and partly wholesom juyce, disposed, and in
a fair way to be made <hi>Sanguis</hi> by long Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
they must necessarily by opening a
Vein, let out without any election, the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as well as the depraved parts in the <hi>Cruor,</hi>
and its inseparable companion the <hi>Sanguis,</hi> and
all to satisfie one supposed palliating Scope
(of little moment in comparison of the rest)
an inanition of that which erres in <hi>quanto,</hi>
which being attained, produces more <hi>hurt</hi> then
<hi>profit</hi> any way; and might easily have been
corrected by Diaphoreticks, and those proper
Medicines that respect a <hi>Quale</hi> in the Blood,
and cause a free <hi>Diapnoe</hi> thereof; consuming
insensibly (according to <hi>Sanctorius</hi> his <hi>Statica)</hi>
no small quantity of our Substance in four
and twenty hours, sufficient in a very short
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100452:36"/>
space with <hi>Abstinence</hi> joyned thereto, to take
down any Athletick habit of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
that the principal Indication in this case ought
to be taken from <hi>Cacochymie,</hi> which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infests us to our destruction, and that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
and insignificant plenitude to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>There is we confess something to be said
for the defence of immediate derivation of
some degenerate Blood, impacted any where,
as when in a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> the Vein contiguous
to the part affected is opened, that the faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
Blood contained therein, oppressing it,
may be directly and moderately discharged,
that thereby the residue may be more difflable
and easie to be discussed: Likewise, when
there is some muddy foul <hi>Cruor</hi> restagnant
about the <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Womb,</hi> threatning an
Abscess or some other malady, &amp;c. in this
condition the Opening the inward <hi>Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoides</hi>
or <hi>Uterine</hi> Veins may sometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
without dammage to the whole; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Physician be destitute of those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Arcana's,</hi> that are able without any solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of continuity, to reach the part affected,
and to conquer the Disease radically, by mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying
the Blood, and by ridding it of that
<hi>Thorny, Vexatious,</hi> and <hi>Virulent</hi> acidity
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100452:36"/>
of the <hi>Latex</hi> that oftentimes gets into it.</p>
            <p>All this seriously weighed, who would not
avoid this Blood-sucking course, and rather
commit himself to such a Physician, who, not
as a meer illiterate <hi>Empyrick</hi> or <hi>Quacksalver,</hi>
ventures his Medicine at random, without any
sound reason or intellectual notion of <hi>what,
wherefore, when,</hi> and <hi>how much</hi> of it he gives;
but being throughly acquainted with the
<hi>Diagnôsis</hi> of the Disease, is able upon very
firm grounds to make a <hi>Prognôsis</hi> of it, and so
to proceed to a <hi>Therapeia,</hi> according to just,
necessary, and direct <hi>Indications,</hi> accurately
designing an <hi>Adaptation, Appropriation,</hi> and
<hi>Adaequation</hi> of the Remedy to the Disease.</p>
            <p>Away then with this detestable lavish Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy,
that hath destroyed more then To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
or the Sword together, may it be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

man findes himself the better for it, and his
spirits more chearful, and better able to bear
his Disease; as if he had foreseen the great
mischief that was like to come upon indiscreet
Evacuation, with deletery <hi>Catharticks,</hi> which
putrefie and colliquate the lately tinged <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

that they are in a fair way of recovery,
(though they finde it otherwise) sith so many
ill Humours, as Choller, Phlegme, &amp;c. are
purged out of their Bodies, whereas in very
truth not a jot of the morbifick Cause hath
been so much as touched.</p>
            <p>We have a History to confirm this out of
<hi>Helmont, &amp; experto credamus,</hi> for the worthy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100452:37"/>
Author tells us, that taking his leave of a
young Lady, holding her by the hand he
caught the <hi>Itch;</hi> whereupon he sent for two
of the most eminent <hi>Galenical</hi> Physicians in
that City, to consult with for the cure of it:
who, upon the sight of a Purulent Scab pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
delivered their opinions, That there
was abundance of Adust Choller and Salt
Phlegme in his Body, which occasioned a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
<hi>Sanguification</hi> in his Liver. Upon this
account, after they had largely bled him, and
prepared the Humour (forsooth) with their
fulsom and nauseous Apozemes, containing
about fifty Ingredients, with addition of Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Rhubarb, every fourth or fifth morning,
to the end that this supposed retorrid Choller
and Salt Phlegme might be drawn forth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that innate similitude of <hi>Substance,</hi>
that they would fain make us believe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Purgative and the Humour; and at
length they gave him those virulent Pills <hi>de
Fumaria</hi> every third day three times, which
wrought so liberally, that they almost filled
two buckets with the foresaid Humours: But
hear with what event in his own words, <hi>Iam
venae mihi exhaustae erant: Genae conciderant,
vox rauca, totus corporis habitus concidens tabue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:
descensus quoque è cubiculo atque gressus
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100452:38"/>
erant difficiles, quia genua me vix sustinebant.</hi>
That is, Thus at length were my Veins emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
my Cheeks fallen away, and I could
hardly speak for hoarsness; my whole Body
was wasted, so that I could hardly get down
out of my Chamber, it being most tedious to
me to stir, for my Legs were scarce able to
bear me up; yea, my Stomack failed, that I
had neither Appetite nor Digestion: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
my <hi>Itch</hi> was as bad as ever.</p>
            <p>Thus was this great <hi>Philosopher</hi> (who at first,
setting aside this Cutaneous infection, was
found Winde and Limb as we say) brought
almost to the gates of Death by this enormous
Purgation, who without doubt might have
been cured very suddenly, if that true <hi>peccant
matter,</hi> which is the principal occasional cause
of Diseases, and is but little in quantity, had
been carried off by some appropriate Solutive,
and the <hi>Miasma</hi> which stole in through the
pores of the Skin, and there settled in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Archeus, had been mortified; which
course <hi>Helmont</hi> at last took for his recovery,
after he had been macerated, and excarnified
by a <hi>Hypercatharsis,</hi> alwayes accompanied with
a <hi>Dysphoria</hi> and ill effect.</p>
            <p>This remarkable Story of <hi>Helmont</hi> (the
same being re-acted many thousand times
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100452:38"/>
since) may give men a strict Caveat how they
put their Lives into the hands of such despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
persidious Evacuators, who cast men into
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> and yet never expiate the Disease,
Assuredly those Physicians that exterminate
out of the Body good and bad at random, the
<hi>Cruor</hi> or good Juyce, and the <hi>Scoria</hi> or Dross,
with such uncorrected Catharticks, that are no
better then absolute poison, leaving some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an impression behinde hardly deleble;
seldom giving any alleviation, unless (as <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
clavum expellit) per accidens,</hi> may be very
well compared to a mad person, that in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a foul house, casteth out with the filth
some of the most useful Furniture belonging
to it. And yet what is more commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
amongst the <hi>Galenists,</hi> who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted,
do upon the bare inspection of the
<hi>Urine,</hi> frequently and rashly prescribe <hi>Bleeding</hi>
and <hi>Purging;</hi> the last whereof being best of
the two, though bad enough as they order the
matter, doth generally more mischief then
good.</p>
            <p>We speak not this utterly to condemn some
moderate <hi>Evacuations,</hi> both by Vomit and
Stool, sith we our selves oftentimes intend the
same and make it our Scope; but we never give
them so uncorrected as they, to the injury
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100452:39"/>
and impairing of Nature: but they are such
that are alwayes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

leaving behinde an <hi>Euphoria,</hi> an alacrity
of the Patient, and an abatement of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
according to his capacity.</p>
            <p>Neither do we depend upon Solutives sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as sufficient to cure any difficult Disease,
but having often that most excellent Rule of
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> in our thoughts, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, to carry the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that way Nature is most enclined to send
it our, supposed the passage be commodious.
We never give any Purgative Medicine, but
the same is <hi>Diaphoretick, Diuretick,</hi> and <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorative:</hi>
For whereas your Catharticks are
often pernicious in malignant Feavers, as the
<hi>Pest, Small Pox, Spotted Feaver,</hi> and the like,
so that the Archeus being distracted upon the
admission of such an unwelcome guest, leaves
the propulsion of the malignant matter, and
bends all her forces to conflict with the late
received poison, whereby it comes to pass that
the venom of the Disease, which before tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Peripheriae,</hi> or outwards parts of the
Body, hastens forthwith to the Centre, and
there fixes upon some of the noble <hi>Viscera,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:100452:39"/>
We on the contrary can safely exhibit, in any
of the foresaid Diseases, some Medicament
that may rid the first Region either upward
or downward of trash and trumpery, which
encumbers it there; and at the same time
both kill and drive out the Venom to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
parts, and grand Emunctory of the
whole Body the Skin: questionless he that
omits this last principal intention, shall sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
cure any <hi>Feaver,</hi> or any other <hi>Malady</hi> as
he ought. And indeed it is most happy for
us that what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> faith is most true;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That is, our whole
Body is porous and transmeable, especially our
Skin: for did we not freely breathe out those
hurtful Atomes, that are engendred within,
and likewise insinuate into us from without,
we should perpetually be obnoxious to <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and other horrid Diseases, that would
quickly destroy the World; for never did
any one recover of a Feaver, but by <hi>Transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
either <hi>sensible</hi> or <hi>insensible;</hi> which ought
especially to be regarded by all legitimate
Physicians, that they may labour vigorously
with their own hands to have in readiness such
noble <hi>Arcana's,</hi> that may reach the sixth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
and there joyn with the Archeus, to
extinguish any malignity, to difflate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100452:40"/>
the gross <hi>Peritomata,</hi> and virulent Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
therein contained. He that is ignorant
herein, may as well presume to cure the sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> the biting of a <hi>Viper,</hi> or
<hi>Tarantula,</hi> by Purgatives, as with any assurance
to heal most Infirmities that are predominant
among us at this day. For very many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
have in them that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
something of a more spiritual and invisible
Nature, then to be carried off by gross Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives.</p>
            <p>Hath not the <hi>Apoplexie</hi> (that destroyes a
man in the twinckling of an eye) something
in it like the poison of a <hi>Basilisk?</hi> Is there
not in the <hi>Palsie</hi> something of the stupefying
Nature of the Fish <hi>Torpedo?</hi> Have not some
Plagues destroyed men suddenly like some
<hi>Mephitical</hi> or pernicious Damps, arising in
the subterranean and deep caverns of the Earth,
which happens to those that dig in mines?
Questionless the <hi>Letharigie</hi> arises from a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
analogous to <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Hyoscyamus.</hi> The
<hi>Itch</hi> may be compared to the venom of <hi>Cowich,</hi>
The Spots in Feaver and the Scurvy, to the
biting of <hi>Fleas.</hi> The small Pox to some viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Epispastick;</hi> and the Measles to <hi>Nettles</hi>
or <hi>Gnats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is sometimes engendred in our Bodies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100452:40"/>
an <hi>nitrosulphurous</hi> matter, that may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> which puts us as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a flame, and would quickly shatter us in
pieces like a <hi>Granado,</hi> were there not free vent
for its expiration through the pores of the
skin. In a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> the part is mortified as
if some potential <hi>Cautery</hi> were applied to it.
What a strange poison is there in the Rickets,
that often makes an <hi>Exostosis,</hi> and bends the
Bones of Children like a bowe? But most
prodigious is that poison in <hi>Plica Polonica,</hi>
that in one night doth so complicate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the Hair, that all the art of man cannot
untangle and unsnatle it; which if you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to cut off with a pair of Sciffers, a
large Haemorrhagie or flux of Blood present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows, to the hazard or ruine of life.</p>
            <p>Many more Diseases in this Microcosme
might be instanced, that do manifestly express
a poisonous Nature of affinity with those in
the Macrocosme; but this may suffice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
those men of most palpable ignorance,
that think the common course of Scouring the
Body with ordinary and deletery Laxatives,
is sufficient to cure most Diseases that consist
of so subtil and almost immaterial substance.
It is as possible to hinder the Magnetick Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

be an appropriate and adequate <hi>Remedy,</hi>
that is not in some degree proportionable to
the <hi>Disease,</hi> as it is more or less graduated and
sublimed in its activity: For let us take into
our contemplation, what an inconsiderable

and disorder the whole frame of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
turning them as it were topsie turvie in a

            <p>In what a minute subject matter doth the

of what little moment is it in bulk to
our eye, and yet how admirable are their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
to our speculations? Sith then Venoms
no whit inferiour to the forementioned, are
oftentimes produced in our Bodies, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to that degree of malignity, that they
sometimes destroy us <hi>solo intuitu et radio,</hi>
how sollicitous and sedulous should we be to
enquire after such Antidotes, which the great
Creator hath ordained, equivalent to their
poisons; that may be able with as much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

the other to pessundate and destroy us.</p>
            <p>This undoubtedly might be compassed by

there is in it, may easily be obvious to any

directly cured. What destruction hath been
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100452:42"/>
made of mankinde by this one Position, to
which they have adhered most superstitiously,
(though altogether false, having, as <hi>Helmont</hi>

unspeakable. How many <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
have reason to brand with a Curse this
one Sentence, whose <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Husbands</hi>
might have survived many years, had not their
Physicians taken a contrary course to cure
them, and thereby sent them packing to the
Grave? Some of us could relate notable stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
not long ago acted by them in this kinde,
which for brevity sake we shall now omit.
For the first thing they usually declaim against
in a Feaver (when they have got a Patient in a
hopeful way of recovery out of our hands, by
their insinuating close wayes) is, that our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
(if they finde that they be <hi>spirituous,
active,</hi> and strike upon the Nostrils any whit
strongly, or affect the Tongue by their <hi>Lepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merie</hi>
and <hi>subtil penetrative Atomes)</hi> are too
<hi>hot</hi> (forsooth) for the Disease, and endanger
the <hi>inflammation</hi> of the Blood, causing thirst,
&amp;c. whereupon, having by their smooth elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
possessed the Patient with a <hi>dislike</hi> of
such Remedies, they presently fall upon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the foresaid Maxime) the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of cooling Juleps, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>isans, Emulsions,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100452:42"/>
Decoctions saturated with crude Herbs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrected
juyce of Poppy, and the like, hardly
allowing them a draught of small Beer, but
by no means any Wine; whereby it comes to
pass that the Tone and Ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
is subverted, Transpiration hindered,
the Malignity detained, the Blood made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagnant,
the Vital Spirits depauperated, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their activity and force, becomming tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and careless to preserve themselves, and
the Morbifick matter more tenaceous; and at
length perhaps the sick Man rid of his Disease,
and laid cooling in the Church-yard.</p>
            <p>Were it not far better to trust in a Feaver to
a <hi>Pepper</hi> or <hi>Mustard</hi> Posset, a Decoction of
<hi>Carduus Benedictus, Aron,</hi> and <hi>Horse-raddish-roots,</hi>
that quicken the Archeus, strengthen
the Stomack, rarifying and cleansing away
the febrile, gross, viscous matter by Urine
and Sweat, then to such <hi>dull, destructive,</hi> and
<hi>mortifying Iuleps</hi> of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pernicious Rule of <hi>Contraries?</hi>
How do these men neglect the saying of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,
Naturae</hi> (that is the vital Spirits prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally)
<hi>sunt morborum medicatrices,</hi> when
they will not support and invigorate them
with a little Spirit of Wine, (with which they
symbolize above any thing) because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100452:43"/>
with the Feaver, and so too hot; not
considering those qualities of Heat and Cold
are but Products and Consequents of the
Disease, which being removed, there present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows a cessation of them in an instant:
so that it matters not whether the Medicine be
<hi>Hot</hi> or <hi>Cold,</hi> so it eradicate the Malady, which
irritates and exasperates the Archeus, that it is
impatient till it have shut out such an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
guest; and according as it makes several
<hi>Assaults</hi> and <hi>Onsets</hi> upon the occasional Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so it varies in those momentary and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
qualities of Heat and Cold in the extream
parts; which are but insignificant in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that which is primarily to be looked
after, the enabling and advancing the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montick
power of the vital Spirits, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
the Disease; which can be done no
better way then by spirituous Liquors, which
whosoever denieth moderately and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
for fear of some small inconvenience,
which the violation of the Maxime of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
may induce, may very well be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a pittiful ignorant Physician. For we are
able to make it appear optically, that Wine (as
it may be ordered in the hands of an Artist) is
able to conquer many very acute Feavers, even
that they call a <hi>Causus.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100452:43"/>
The same reason they observe for the curing
of <hi>Diarrhaea's, Lienteria's, Gonorrhaea's, Vomitings</hi>
and <hi>Haemorrhagies,</hi> making use of Astringents
and Corroboratives, that may diametrically
answer the Laxity and weakness of the parts,
whereby they many times constipate in the
Body, and as it were wedge in that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
went about to extricate; whereas any
but a daubing and palliating Physician, would
aim at the extirpation of the original Cause of
these Effects; which being once expedited,
all the <hi>Products, Symptoms, Phoenomena,</hi> and
<hi>Epigenomena</hi> cease immediately. But to be
short, for I must but touch upon these things,
'tis no wonder and these men take a contrary
way to heal Infirmities, sith they have alwayes
been and still continue so contrary and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the most sound Pyrotechnical Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
stiffly holding fast their opinions (we
fear) with one of their great ones, who swore
in another case, <hi>se nolle persuaderi etiamsi ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
persuaserit:</hi> That he was resolved not to
be convinced that he was in an Errour.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. A brief Examination of their Pharmacopoea.</head>
            <p>WHat invalidity and impotence to heal
Infirmities there is in their <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in general, set down in the <hi>Pharmacopoea
Londinensis,</hi> as a pattern and rule for all their
Servants to follow, is obvious to any one that
hath made a considerable progress in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
and Practice of Physick, so that he be not
prejudicated and carried away by sinister re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
It would require a long time to scan
and set down at large those <hi>Nonsensical, Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
Improper,</hi> and <hi>Languid</hi> Medicaments
they have ordained for the help of man: We
shall onely compendiously give you a Glance
of some of them. We finde throughout their
whole <hi>Dispensatory</hi> these remarkable Errours
inseparable and common to all their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</p>
            <p>First, we observe a great Defect in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis,
or opening the body of any Concrete,
that its <hi>Crasis</hi> or purer part may be obtained;
so that what they give is very little of its <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
separated by halves, or drowned and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up with the <hi>Scoria, Faeces,</hi> and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100452:44"/>
of the whole; so that it is impossible it
should explicate its activity as it ought.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we observe what a <hi>Congeries,
Cento, Linsey Wolsey</hi> of Simples they <hi>jumble</hi>
and <hi>clutter</hi> together, to some scores, without
any reasonable symbolizing contexture or
congruity, looking more wayes at once, then
ever <hi>Argus</hi> his eyes, but still from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>mark;</hi> clashing, conflicting, and at greater
hostility with each other, then ever their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
contrary Elements; whereby they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and rob many a single Ingredient (by
this confused Hotch-potch) of its eminent
Properties, which being duly prepared and
applied, would do a Physicians business.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we cannot but especially take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and condole the <hi>ineffectual, frivolous,</hi> and
<hi>vain</hi> Corrections of those virulent and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
Concretes, which they take into many
of their Compositions, thinking it enough to
adde to them a little Anniseed, Ginger, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or some Gum, with the like, onely to
disguise and palliate, no whit to mitigate the
violent <hi>Powers</hi> of those things that are of
themselves destructive to our Nature.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange they should be so wilfully igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
in making no scruple of prescribing ten
or twelve grains of <hi>Scammony,</hi> and little less
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100452:45"/>
of <hi>Colocynthis,</hi> manifest poisons so uncorrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet startle at, and are very nice to give
four or five grains of <hi>Antimonium Diaphoret.</hi>
whose supereminent Purgative operation is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off by virtue of a Spirituous Salt that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
and fixes it in the Fire. But 'tis the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of these <hi>Polypragmones</hi> to busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about impertinencies, and to neglect
matters of greatest weight, stumbling at a
straw and leaping over a block, straining at a
gnat and swallowing a camel, superstitiously
precise in the <hi>regulation</hi> of the Patients <hi>Diet,</hi>
over punctual in the contrivances of Slibber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauces,
and withal to offer him pestilent and
lethiferous Medicaments, which they are not
at all sollicitous to correct. If such be not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in their Art, we would willingly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
who are? that neither know how to
make a good Medicine, nor how to order it in
every respect when they have it, as we can
make evident.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but that the best of the
Remedies in the Dispensatory are Chymical,
for which they are beholden to us, and these
(we assure you) are of the lowest <hi>Tribe</hi> and
meanest trivial sort in comparison; neither are
these free from being sophisticated through
inadvertency of some, and covetousness of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100452:45"/>
others, nor are they at the best such as they
might be exalted to in the hands of an Artist.
We shall instance in some few that are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used: Who, but such as are supine, and
indifferent whether they kill or cure, would
suffer the flowers of Brimstone to be so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared, that we can see little difference
between it and the vulgar finely powdered?
whereas if it be Pyrotechnical handled, four
or five grains sublimed shall effect more good
then a dram of the ordinary.</p>
            <p>The most usual, safe, and best Vomit (in
their account) is borrowed from <hi>Antimony,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Infusio Croci Metallorum,</hi> and yet this acts
but uncertainly in the carrying off the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
matter; for wanting its due alteration and
correction, it causes sometimes no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity
in <hi>malignant</hi> Feavers; moreover,
their Method will not suffer them to use it
aright; not knowing when, how often, nor
to whom it may be given with any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that an <hi>Euphoria</hi> or alleviation may
follow: and the reason of their hesitation
therein, is their often being frustrated in their
intention, and some sad consequences that have
come upon it.</p>
            <p>They have taken into their Shops another
Vomit called <hi>Mercurius vitae,</hi> which we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100452:46"/>
they would ever venture to admit into a
Catalogue of their safe Medicines, with a
—&amp;c. sith they alwayes heretofore railed
at it, and are not yet absolutely reconciled,
calling it <hi>Mercurius mortis:</hi> Some of them
having had ill fortune with it, because their
shallow wits understand not the right process,
the just <hi>dose, management,</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of it, which
a Mountebank or Quacksalver is better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with (to their disgrace) then they;
for by vertue of this common Vomiting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
many an illiterate <hi>Empirick</hi> hath gained
no small reputation in conquering those stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Effects which baffled them, and were
believed incurable. Now (setting aside the
abuse of the thing) if <hi>Mercurius vitae</hi> meanly
prepared, and extravagantly given by Ideots,
be able to do such rare feats in Physick, what
think ye might be done by it if <hi>graduated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,</hi>
and <hi>perfected</hi> in the hand of a learned
well experienced Chymist, that utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
the <hi>Galenical</hi> Method?</p>
            <p>In Feavers and Agues they cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that they are much obliged to us for the
discovery of <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> which doth them
the best service therein of any one thing they
possess, for the extinction of the thirst, and
allaying the Ebullition and Effervescence of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100452:46"/>
the Blood; not by cooling, as they grosly
imagine, but by comforting the natural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Stomack, and by correcting that
Alkalizate, Exotick, and putredinous matter
therein. How difficult it is to procure this
Medicine legitimate (and without exceptions)
from the Shops, let any Euchymist that hath
laboured with his own fingers herein be judge?
For as those directions they have set down
for the drawing it over are very ordinary, and
much inferiour to the more sublime way, so
likewise their use and application thereof is
very suitable; for the Prescription of it is
many times as absurd, and to be derided, as
their ordering of four drops of the <hi>Spirit of
Vitriol</hi> in the composition of <hi>Electuar. Sassaphr.</hi>
consisting of two pound of Sugar and other
Ingredients.</p>
            <p>How poor, jejune, and barren is the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Pearles and Coral with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> that
doth but onely superficially divide them, and
as it were pulverize them into small parts or
atoms, not at all penetrating them <hi>Centrally</hi>
and <hi>Essentially?</hi> What dull Preparations of
<hi>Mars</hi> have they set down, more becoming
some Feminine Practioners then such learned
Doctors?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercurius sublimatus dulcis,</hi> and <hi>Praecipitatus,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100452:47"/>
are now exhibited by some of them, for the
Cure of knotty and stubborn Diseases, as,
<hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> and the like, but after a deal add,
niceness, and scrupulosity, they were loth to
venture upon them, till some confident Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
lead them the way, and taught them a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Method then their own, to destroy these
<hi>Hydra</hi>-like monstrous Diseases, that have of
late sprung up among us.</p>
            <p>How strangely blinde most of them have
been in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or manual tractation of
<hi>Mercury,</hi> may appear by a <hi>Galenist,</hi> who bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
enveighing against Chymical Remedies
in the presence of a Spagyrist, by whom when
he was questioned, why he did then prescribe
<hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> as appeared in one of his
Prescripts upon the File, and being convinced
of the truth thereof, and how it was a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
protested he verily thought it had been a
Vegetable, and had its original from the Herb
<hi>Mercury.</hi> Hence we may learn how perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and drowsie many of these Prescribers have
been, and what little inspection and scrutiny
they have made into that which is deservedly
reputed by all Hermetical Philosophers, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
in Nature.</p>
            <p>Thus they credulously rest themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
trusting to other mens Eyes and Hands
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100452:47"/>
in things concerning Mans <hi>Life,</hi> thinking it
sufficient if they can get by roat the bare
Names of some <hi>Paracelsian</hi> Medicines, though
they neither know the facture of them, what
they give to their Patiens, nor how much, nor
when, as they ought. For did they take pains
themselves, they would quickly discover that
these Mercurial <hi>Sublimates</hi> and <hi>Praecipates</hi> in
the Shops are very imperfect, compared with
those that an <hi>Adeptus</hi> is able to produce.</p>

better means and more forcible <hi>Helps</hi>

the <hi>Galenist,</hi> he had been at a very sad pass.
How many by virtue of these <hi>Mineral Wells</hi>
have been restored, that have been brought to
a very low ebb by <hi>Ill Physicians,</hi> having run
through a long and irksome course of Physick,
even to desperation?</p>
            <p>We are apt to believe, that those that lately
endeavoured to Engross all Physical Practice
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100452:48"/>
into their own hands, would by their good
wills likewise have prohibitted the admirable
use of the <hi>Waters,</hi> unless to whom they should
have prescribed them, that their Method might
have gain'd the more credit: For we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that they looked upon the <hi>Waters</hi> with
as Envious an Eye, as ever they did upon our
Chymical Preparations; (although they have
been forced to make use of both upon a
pinch) and why? Because when all their costly
Compositions could do no good, some few
Draughts of a Cheap Mineral Water hath
done the business. Which thing may very
much plead for the rare Effect of Minerals
(which they have so declaimed against former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
were not the Dogmatists perverse beyond
expression. One would think they should
not so long with such Heat have contended
against them as dangerous, scarce allowing
them a place in the Apothecary's Shop, after
so many visible Experiments of their Sanative
Property, to which they have been beholden
at a dead lift.</p>
            <p>Had they not minded their own, more then

lightly touching a Vein of <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> and

such powerful Efficacy in Healing within and

to observe the beginning and progress of her
Motions and clandestine Working in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost

            <p>It was not without Reason that a famous

few of us depend upon these Mineral Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
having wherewithal to supply the wants
of our Patients, and to procure Sanity at
home: and we conceive that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is,

as we have known, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by a most Exquisite <hi>Galenical</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
            <p>But the Offence in these Esurine Waters
is far more Venial then the frequent Oblation
of Aqueous and <hi>maukish Iuleps</hi> in Feavers,
<hi>sine Sale, aut Sole,</hi> without either Spirit or Life;
as Unsavoury and Torpid as the Authors that
Dictate them, who with as much Judgement
and Reason prohibit those the use of Salt, that
are inclined to the Duelech, Stone, and other
Troubles, which we are certain is most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to prevent them. Doubtless it is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if opportunity be offered, to take a journey
to the Wells, and to drink moderately of those
Esurine Waters, abounding with Saline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscles,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100452:50"/>
then to be obliged to take the dull
Drench-like Potions of the Dogmatists, more
fitting for a Horse then a Man; for those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them, leaving many Faeculencies and

            <p>Now our faithful Advice in general to such
as drink these Mineral Waters, is, that they
first take some proper <hi>Emeto-Cathartick,</hi> that
may cleanse away any filth lurking in the
Stomack, Guts, and Mesentery. Secondly,
That they begin with a small quantity at first,
and so rise higher by degrees, according to
the <hi>capacity</hi> of the person; alwayes taking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Water that which may rectifie its <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi>
corroborate the Ventricle, and other parts,
stir up and encrease the Vital Spirits, further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Water in its operation. Thirdly, that
the Diet be very moderate, alwayes gratifying
the Appetite, offending rather in <hi>Liquid</hi> then
<hi>Solid</hi> nourishment; and here generous <hi>Wine</hi>
taken soberly with discretion, cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and produce many good effects.</p>

            <p>IT is a hard thing to strive against the stream
of a <hi>vulgar Opinion</hi> at any time, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when countenanced and backt by men
of eminent Knowledge and Fame. Nought

Belief of whatsoever their <hi>admired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours</hi>
shall deliver, conceiving what proceeds
from their mouths must needs be Oracular.
Such reverence doth some mens Authority
carry with it, that they need not take pains to
invent <hi>Arguments,</hi> where an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> puts the
matter out of doubt. Indeed we much approve
of this in Religious Matters, but can by no
means allow it in <hi>Humane Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi>
which ought to have something of <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to confirm the <hi>Truth</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>What Difficulties some of us have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
to perswade some prepossessed against us,
(that have imbibed the Exitious Precepts of
the <hi>Galenists)</hi> to admit of those <hi>Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100452:51"/>
(which we knew would save their
Lives) is well known to those that have been
made sensible of their Errour herein. For the
very name <hi>Chymical</hi> did sound so <hi>Deadly</hi> in
their ears, that many in those places (where
we practised) did apprehend, that he that dealt
in such Medicines had a design to destroy
them; and that he was to be avoided as a
<hi>Necromancer,</hi> or one that busied himself in some
<hi>unlawful Art:</hi> So that if prevalent necessity
had at any time forced them to take these
Preparations into their Bodies, they were even
sick with conceit; and we had more ado to
cure their <hi>Misapprehensions</hi> and <hi>Crazie Fancies,</hi>
then their Diseases. Yea, now and then all
our Eloquence and best Reasons could not
prevail to perswade them, that what we had
given them was <hi>innocent,</hi> leaving no ill effect
behinde; and that they were perfectly resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without Relapse. Now their scrupulosity
principally arose from this ground, (besides
what the Dogmatists had infused into them)
because we performed our business with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and dexterity, without those large Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
which they had been formerly used
to. To satisfie all these foolish and frivolous
Doubts, which their great Doctors had buz'd
into their ears, took up no little time and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100452:51"/>
Now, these things considered, have not the
true Chymists been put to a very hard task,
to conflict with a sworn Enemy the <hi>Galenist,</hi>
a peevish, prejudicated, unruly weak Patient,
and a predominating Disease. What, but
Omnipotent Truth, could ever have brought
this Despised and Exploded Art into any Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that the Professors thereof should dare
to look any Opposer in the face, and defie
what he can openly object against it.</p>

<hi>malicious Zoili,</hi> or proud Emulatours, that
contrived how they might strangle it in the
birth, by defamation and false suggestions.</p>
            <p>This course the <hi>Galenists</hi> took in the Infancy
of this noble Science, crying it down with all
might and main, conjuring the world that they
should avoid all Chymical Medicines as most
dangerous; damning them all without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And when they saw they could not
maintain this falsity long, e're some Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Patients that had found the contrary by
experience, made it appear otherwise: Then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100452:52"/>
missing their aim here, they inserted this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
<hi>If they be not well Prepared;</hi> as if any
Artificial thing could be innoxious if not well
prepared; for even our common Food not
well ordered may be dangerous to us; and a
nasty Slut may poison a man, and verifie the
Proverb, <hi>God sends meat, and the Devil sends
Cooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who that argues for Spagyrical Medicines
doth not take it for granted, that they ought to
be made by an Artist? Will ye never desist
from diminishing the worth of a good thing,
because some have abused it? Is Chymical
Physick in express terms (without equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
any whit dangerous, unless depraved by
you and some illiterate Pseudochymists? How
is it likely that ye should ever make an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Chymical, that never made a Good <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical</hi>
Remedy? Whose are most saving, and
consequently safe, yours, that are either like
Chip in Potrage, or else hazard the producing
some mischief; or ours, that according to
the capacity of the Patient (due circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
observed) acts as infallibly for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
and preservation, as Fire burns and Water
moistens, from a Power of its innate gift, that
the great Creator hath bestowed upon it.</p>
            <p>You would do very well to reflect upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100452:52"/>
your Dispensatory, wherein (except some few
Chymical lent you) all your Preparations ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
omit to do what they should, or commit
what they should not: And certainly these are
dangerous <hi>per se,</hi> supposing they be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to your best Art. If ours offend it
is but <hi>per accidens,</hi> because those Requisites
set down are neglected to make them such as
we intend them.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> which is the
true Touchstone that must discover us: Let
any of you in perfect Health pick out of your
formal Apothecary's Book, stuffed full of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary
Preparations, the most Safe and
Active of them, that do you the greatest
service, to the number of ten; weigh out the
known Dose of any one singly, with the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
curiosity you please; take each of you the
same into your own Stomacks, and repeat the
Dose as often as ye dare; and so proceed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with another, and so on to the residue of
the ten: When ye have acted your parts, we
likewise (every way sound) selecting ten of our
<hi>Arcana's,</hi> will swallow down (without trusting
to the Scales) a sufficient quantity of any one
(that may be most suspected) which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
exhibit to the Sick for their recovery;
look how often ye have taken of each of your
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100452:53"/>
ten, so often will we iterate or duplicate the
sumption of any one of ours. And then let
any indifferent person judge who bears their
Medicines best, having the fewest bad Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
following, and so conclude according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whose are most dangerous.</p>
            <p>Such hath been our zeal for the good of our
Neighbour, that we have for some years sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
given any thing to our Patients which
we have not first taken into our own Bodies
perhaps many times: And <hi>consideratis consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derandis,</hi>
an <hi>Acute Medical Observer</hi> shall learn
more feelingly from himself, that which tends
to the right use of any <hi>Arcanum,</hi> then he shall
from another. Assuredly for our parts, we
had rather run the hazard of an ambiguous
Remedy our selves, who know, and can best
correct any supervenient inconvenience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
then to proffer it upon uncertain grounds
to another, who perchance through his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and morosity will neither suffer us to
amend what is fallen out amiss, nor listen to
any reasonable Apology how it came to pass.
If the <hi>Galenist</hi> did take this course, he would
not give Chymical Preparations with such a
Tremulous hand as he doth, being doubtful
whether they be made as they ought, and
what certain effect they may have. For all
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100452:53"/>
this proceeds from a want of that true experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
knowledge which he may (setting aside
this timorous childish apprehension of danger
and hurting himself) acquire, by frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
of ingesting that into his own ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
which may instruct him far better then
anothers.</p>
            <p>We deny not but the Ambient Air, and
the differing Constitution of several indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Bodies do somewhat alter the Operation
of that which works by sensible vacuation,
which is to be considered, but not to be insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon too superstitiously; but we see no
reason why some transcendent <hi>Arcana's</hi> which
act <hi>tono unisono</hi> invisibly, should not cure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
persons alike indifferently, in the East
Indies, and this part of the World, with some
small variation of the quantity. So that an
<hi>Adeptus</hi> may presume to induce, that if the best
sort of Medicines have a constant happy effect
upon himself at all times of the year, the same
cannot but express the like energie upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
presented by an expert hand that hath
an eye in it.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished that Physicians would
animate some nice scrupulous <hi>Patients,</hi> and
convince them of those harsh conceits they
oftentimes harbour, (not without just cause)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100452:54"/>
that they shall make an Apothecary's Shop of
their Bellies; (and if what they take do not
work it will poison them) by swallowing
down the same before their faces, that they
may recant of their folly, and be further incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to submit to those Rules which are easie
to observe, without any rigour or danger in
them. And we admonish any that desires to
be approved in the Iatrical Art, to make it his
principal pains and study to be throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Practical use of those Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
he possesses so exactly and accurately, as
a Shoo-maker with his <hi>Last,</hi> or an Artificer
with his <hi>Tools;</hi> that knowing what he can trust
to, he may after a judicious examination of the
Sickness, begin and proceed in the Sanation
of the same with confidence, and no less real
performance.</p>

            <p>OUr Adversaries do much glory and vaunt
in their Method of Curing, asserting,
that if a man have never so excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
if he be ignorant therein, he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his duty as he ought. We desire first
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100452:54"/>
to know of these learned <hi>Grecians,</hi> what (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Etimon)</hi> this word <hi>Methodus</hi>
signifies. Is it, we pray, any more then a
short way of healing Maladies? How short
ye come of this, the world may easily judge,
who keep your Patients in a course of Physick
so long, till ye run them quite out of breath,
and all under a pretence of Method. Is it
worthy of a Physicians Method to dally with
his Patient some moneths, even years, and
not absolutely satisfie him, whether he be
curable or no: or perhaps after he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
his strength and purse, to send him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Countrey, to the <hi>Wells,</hi> or <hi>Bath;</hi> yea,
sometimes into <hi>France,</hi> that the less notice
may be taken of it if he chance to dye (as we
have known) by the way? Is not this a rare
Method to see a Physician keep a pudder, and
make a great noise about a sick mans Diet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
to enjoyn him, upon loss of his Life, not
to violate the least punctilio; strictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those things which (given by the <hi>Nurse</hi>
or standers by, and concealed from the <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)</hi>
have cured him? To see a sick wretch in a
vehement Feaver, almost parched up for want
of <hi>moisture,</hi> and not a draught of small <hi>Beer</hi>
allowed him to quench his unsatiable <hi>thirst,</hi>
or a little <hi>Wine</hi> to refresh his drooping spirit,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100452:55"/>
is enough to make a man afraid of such a
Method.</p>
            <p>To hear them when a man is in a peracute
Feaver, Logically discourse of their Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>General, Subalternate,</hi> and <hi>Specifick, Profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>

and be extreamly ignorant of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata,</hi>

to cure the Feaver; suffering the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
either to perish, or to fall into some despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Chronick Disease, and so to twindle and
moulder away at length; whereas if things
had been rightly ordered, all this might have
been prevented, is sufficient to make a man
<hi>explode</hi> and <hi>nauseate</hi> their <hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we hear how curiously they examine,
which of the four Humours, arising from the
mixture of the four Elements, (which never
had an existence in Nature, as <hi>Helmont</hi> hath
sufficiently proved) abounds in the Body, that
thereby they may finde out a convenient
Purge; as, Rhubarb for Choller, Agarick for
Phlegme, &amp;c. loosening the Body by stool
sometimes fifty or sixty times; to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the strength of the Sick par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without any ease, the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100452:55"/>
still remaining behinde untouched.</p>
            <p>When they learnedly babble concerning
<hi>Complexions, Temperaments, Constitutions,</hi> being
grosly ignorant of the <hi>Seminal, Formal,</hi> and
<hi>Vital</hi> Properties of things; not able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the least without relation, or to give any
plausible reason thereof from their <hi>durty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Humours,</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> that this man
naturally <hi>abhors Posset-drink,</hi> a second <hi>Honey,</hi>
a third an <hi>Egg,</hi> which if they should take into
their Bodies, in some Diseases, were enough to
cost them their lives. When they stand so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously
upon the <hi>Season</hi> of the Year, the
<hi>Climate</hi> of the Countrey, the <hi>Qualities</hi> of the
Air, the <hi>Time</hi> of the Day, that before they can
take an opportunity, the Patient is ten times
more hard to cure, or perhaps past relief: All
this (rightly understood) would justly provoke
a man to condemn, abhorre, renounce, and
defie their <hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who that hath any spark of charity in him,
but must needs pitty that distressed wretch,
who hath a Physician attending him, that
gapes for a <hi>Crisis</hi> even to the one and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day, doubtful what is like to be the issue
then; and in the mean time exhausts the <hi>purple
Soul</hi> of his Patient by frequent Phlebotomy,
spending his Spirits by some torturing course,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100452:56"/>
marring the ferment of the Stomack; and is
so far from assisting and furthering Nature,
that he becomes a <hi>remora,</hi> or <hi>hinderance</hi> to her;
so that if strength of Body be not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
'tis impossible such an one should escape

Satans device and plot to destroy mankinde.
Or we may justly censure this <hi>Galenical</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
as the word <hi>Methodus</hi> signifies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to another interpretation, <hi>Fictio,</hi> or <hi>Ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio;</hi>

or, if he can be procured, make use of some
<hi>honest, plain</hi> Physician, who without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
or pompous Preludium, shall fall to his
work of curing you.</p>
            <p>'Tis a sad thing to behold a young man in
the flower of his years, in full strength of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
abounding with Vital Spirits, sending for
a Physician in the beginning of his Disease, to
be thus <hi>Methodized</hi> into his Grave, by them
that pretend to be such grave learned Doctors;
who, if he had dyed in the Field bravely,
ought little in comparison to be lamented.
Can any <hi>sober, wise</hi> man blame any one that

that 'tis not malice to any mans particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
nor a principal Design to be known in the
World to our advantage, that hath excited us
to declare our selves thus, to the detriment of
any mans individual credit and reputation:
Far be it from us, for these things (if it could
have consisted with Charity and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science)
should never have been published;
and we hope our future actions will sufficiently
demonstrate our sincerity herein; though we
expect from our Adversaries nothing but harsh
censures, underminings, quick eyes to discover
our lapses, calumnies, and reproaches. But
'tis sufficient that we have done our duty, to

that there is such a cause of his Disease, and

if he be observant, we shall in some little time

            <p>NEver was there a more <hi>just, honest, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
and <hi>useful</hi> Enterprise set upon in
this Nation, then an endeavour of some Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
to purchase an Influence and favourable
Countenance from our <hi>Sovereign Lord the
King,</hi> that thereby we might be authorized
and encouraged to meet together, and consult
(without interruption) about some expedite
and effectual way, for the regulating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
those present enormous Abuses in
this excellent <hi>Spagyrick Science;</hi> and for the
prevention of the same for the future; and
that we might joyn our forces for the melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating

and advancing of that Art, which in
despite of all Adversaries, will in some short
time manifest it self to be Queen Regent in
Physick. Moreover, seldom hath there been
any Design more generally countenanced and
animated by the learned Nobility, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> then this.</p>
            <p>But such hath been our fate, that some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent

and ignorantly cast such rubs in our way, that
we have been disappointed from attaining that

            <p>That therefore every <hi>Inquisitive</hi> man may in

falstly suggesting that we went about
to tread under foot all Learning, and to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

            <p>That these Aspersions therefore may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

prejudice, who profess our selves Philosophers
by the Fire; we freely declare, that we are
<hi>Philomathêis,</hi> hearty lovers and promoters of
Learning, and shall never go about to derrogate
from <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Academies,</hi> but shall vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

and shall be ready to censure him that pleads

delivered to him, by those that have been
most expert; which how any one can attain

that such a Great <hi>Mistress</hi> of Knowledge

DE LITHO-COLO:
OR,
A History of three large Stones excluded
the Colon by Chymical Medicines.</head>
            <p>THe importunity of some friends have
moved me to expose (on a sudden) to
publick view these prodigious and
monstrous Stones, generated in the <hi>Colon,</hi> that
the World may be informed what strange <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations</hi>
sometimes happen in this <hi>Microcosme;</hi>
and what need we have to look after Remedies
of the <hi>Superlative Degree,</hi> to dissolve and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
them of their lodging place. The
Narrative is thus:</p>
            <p>In the Year, 1655. I was sent for in the
midst of <hi>February</hi> to <hi>Anne Taylor</hi> (servant to
Mr. <hi>Sikes</hi> a Brewer, living at <hi>Rumford</hi> in <hi>Essex)</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:100452:64"/>
about twenty years old, of a florid ruddy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
having a <hi>square</hi> Body, <hi>Vivacious</hi> and
<hi>Active,</hi> but low in stature; who was suddenly
taken with a violent Pungitive pain on the
left side, an inflation and distention of the
<hi>Epigastrium,</hi> a Feaver, an Aking in her Loins,
Inquietude, a nauseous Disposition, frequent
Belchings, and great constriction of the Belly.
Having examined the Symptoms, I apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that her Disease arose principally from the
<hi>Spleen,</hi> stuffed with <hi>feculent degenerate Blood,</hi>
which having contracted <hi>Malignity,</hi> darted
its venom at the <hi>Pleura, Stomack, Intestines,</hi>
and <hi>Reins;</hi> hence the <hi>Vital Spirits</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
an <hi>Estuation</hi> and <hi>Effervescence</hi> arose
in the Blood, which caused a Feaver. This
considered, I presently offered upon my first
access in the Afternoon, an <hi>Emeto-Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
which making some small evacuation,
gave her ease, but of short duration, for a few
hours after there was a recrudescence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acerbation
of all the foresaid Symptoms.</p>
            <p>The next morning I offered her an <hi>Emeto-Cathartick,</hi>
intending to carry the morbisick
matter most downward, but in vain, for it still
regurgitated, and came away by Vomiting:
however, she found an abatement of the rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pain of her Side, and other parts, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100452:64"/>
yet still returned by fits. Then I plied her
hard with those things that were Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Resolving, Abstersive, for the space of
three or four dayes, making use of requisite
<hi>Topicks;</hi> not omitting whatsoever might pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
and invigorate the Vital Spirits against
future paroxisms.</p>
            <p>Upon the sixth day after my first admission,
coming to see her, I found her chearful, (the
Pain of her Side and Feaver abated) with many
hopeful signs of speedy recovery, onely she
complained of a Weight of her left Side, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
downward toward the Kidneys, and a
straitness of her Belly, but yet she thought
a small matter more would perfectly cure her;
so giving her precaution, I bad her go on
to take what remained, charging her to give
me notice if any thing fell out amiss.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath day following, being the
tenth from the first onset of her Sickness, a
messenger came in all haste to me to <hi>Horn-Church,</hi>
relating the anguish and cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that this wretched Maid suffered about
the Region of her Loins, with straining to
vomit, sharpness of her Urine, and difficulty
to make it, and continual watching. Upon
this I began to think that the Kidneys had a
great share in the production of those Iragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100452:65"/>
               <hi>Accidents,</hi> which formerly appeared:
wherefore I presently dispatched away to her
another <hi>Emeto-Cathartick,</hi> and some other
<hi>Chymical</hi> Preparations, that were of force to
cleanse and sweep away any sabulous matter,
or gross impurities from those parts. Having
taken the first she was put into great straits,
and had many pangs, yet upon my strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
they urged her to take whatsoever I
sent: which, upon every sumption and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
caused a Crispation and Convulsive
motion of the <hi>Genus Membranosum,</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus
endeavouring to make an extrusion of
that which as long as it harboured in its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
could never be at rest; so that by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exciting the Expulsive faculty, and by
corroborating the Spirits at the same time,
<hi>Nature</hi> by an <hi>Alternate vicissitude</hi> of rest and
motion producing <hi>Throwes,</hi> was delivered at
length by the help of some dextrous hands
of three strange stony <hi>Concretions,</hi> conceived
in the upper part of the <hi>Colon</hi> nigh the
<hi>Spleen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the first appearance of these was after
a great Agony on Munday night, being the
eleventh day; for the Sphincter of the <hi>Anus</hi>
being notably dilated, a hard rough Body was
discovered in the Fundament by a Midwife,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100452:65"/>
or some of the officious Women there present,
who by frequently assaying, and tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectation
thereof, made shift to get out one of
these deformed Stones (more friable then the
other two) by fracture and piece-meal, and
then forthwith sent to me to hasten to be a
spectator of this <hi>monstrous Birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner had I entred the House, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the exclamation of the Neighbours,
but I was presented with some fragments of
an Exotick matter, which I beheld not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
just admiration. This (quoth some of
them) is nothing in comparison of what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
wherefore we desire you to meet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Doctor and Surgeon tomorrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about nine of the clock; which I easily
assented to in such a difficult case, both for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and also the evasion of slanderous
tongues, which I knew had much partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for this safe <hi>Galenist</hi> they sent for, that
could (if she miscarried) maintain it <hi>Cum Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning I precisely observed the
time appointed, waiting three hours for his
<hi>Worship,</hi> but neither he nor the Surgeon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I thought good to take my leave, and to
resign her up to whom they pleased; but by
perswasion of the Master of the House, who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100452:66"/>
told me (let the issue be better or worse) he
would undertake to defend me against the
<hi>Galenical</hi> Gang; I fell to my work, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken a strict view of the outward site of
the bigger of these Stones, whose Basis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
every way about an inch to my eye;
the Sphincter being much expanded through
great stress, I concluded that these lapideous
Concretions were either to be broken by a fit
Instrument, and so to be drawn out by parcels,
or to be extracted whole, if it could be done
without danger of lacerating the Sphincter:
To this end I presently sent for a plain Barber
Surgeon of the Town, <hi>Thomas Flemmin,</hi> since
dead, whom I enjoyned to fetch me the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pair of Curling-Irons he had, which forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
done, I directed him to insinuate and
worm them in between the Sphincter and the
Stone, to lay fast hold, and to try whether he
could turn it about; which he did artificially,
and setting a strong hand, pulled it out confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in a trice. The other quickly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Patient was immediately freed
from her dolorous condition, a large quantity
of Urine issuing forth which had been stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
nigh forty eight hours. After this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
an involuntary flux of Excrements,
through a weakness of the Fibres of the Guts
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100452:66"/>
and Sphincter violently distended, which were
at length restored to their former <hi>Tone</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a <hi>Fumigation</hi> which she received, sitting
over a pan of quick coals.</p>
            <p>Thus was this miserable Virgin recovered
at length from an untimely death, by force
(under God) of some Chymical Medicines,
which may adde a little to the lustre of this
useful Art: For none but Remedies more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
then ordinary could have forced three
such petrified Bodies of that bulk, lurking
under the left short Ribs, through the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>Cells</hi> of the <hi>Colon</hi> down to the strait Gut,
and so to be voided.</p>
            <p>Ever since she hath enjoyed her health, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taking two or three years (Spring and Fall)
what was requisite; and since married an Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
<hi>Francis Chatterton,</hi> living now at <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
at the Sign of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> by whom she
hath had two Children.</p>
            <p>For present satisfaction take this short De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the three Stones thus: Touching
the first which the Midwife and some others
brake out by their <hi>subtil working</hi> into it with
their fingers, in my absence, I cannot give that
exact observation as of these two I have in
my own custody; for they having shared it
amongst themselves, desiring to keep it for a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100452:67"/>
Rarety, had so dispersed it, that I am not able
to set down any certain Dimensions of it: but
so far as my conjecture can reach, according
to their relation, it might very well be equal
in quantity to the greatest of these two, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to a Cylindrical shape, of a friable and
fragile substance toward the Superficies, but
more tenacious toward the Centre; consisting
of Dissimilar parts, wherein appeared many
white Filaments like <hi>Alumen Plumosum.</hi> The
<hi>Cortex</hi> or outside was of a <hi>Pitchy</hi> colour, but
the innermost part brownish.</p>
            <p>The second of the three, and the first of the
two which I extracted, and now reserve by
me, is of a Cone-like Figure, broad beneath
and sharper above, nigh three inches in length,
two and a quarter in bredth abouut the <hi>Basts,</hi>
one and three quarters in the <hi>midst,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above half an inch on the <hi>top.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The outward coat covering the inward like
a bark, is more compact, and of a tartareous
substance, partly blackish and partly mouse
coloured. It hath four great <hi>Dokes</hi> in it, two
nigh the <hi>Basis,</hi> and two nigh the <hi>cone,</hi> beside
many small ones, and <hi>Tortuous Incisures.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this <hi>Cortex</hi> lieth a <hi>Calcarious matter,</hi> which
hath a small quantity of a Thready or Lanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous
substance mixt with it, tending to a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100452:67"/>
gravel-like colour. It weigheth now not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two ounces seven drams, being diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and circumcised by those that handling it
have out of curiosity picked off something
considerable; and withall the ambient Air
hath made it somewhat lighter, but at first its
weight was much more.</p>
            <p>The second to this is Triangular, almost
Equilateral, each side being about two inches
three quarters in length, and near two in
bredth. Its substance much resembles the
other, onely its outside here and there is softer
to the touch, feeling <hi>Plushie</hi> like some part of
a Stags horn, to which it is like in colour. In
the middle appears a harder Body dissimilar
from the <hi>Angles,</hi> which seem to be <hi>Appendices</hi>
to it. In it are some small <hi>Cavities,</hi> but one
very large, like the hollow part of that the
Latines call <hi>Astragalus,</hi> an <hi>Huckle-bone.</hi> It is
lighter then the other considering its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
weighing one ounce five drams and a
half.</p>
            <p>We observed when these <hi>Colick-Stones</hi> first
came to light, that many <hi>Plum-stones</hi> and <hi>Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones</hi>
lay couched in several hollow places
in them, which had continued in her Body
about half a year undissolved, appearing fresh
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100452:68"/>
as if they had been newly swallowed. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the bulk of these Coagulations was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
that they became more hard to be
precipitated, their unequal asperities impeding
their passage, exasperating and galling the
tender and most sensible Tunicles of the <hi>Colon:</hi>
Hence arose most exquisite Dolours, which
this poor wretch underwent for several dayes,
which would undoubtedly have destroyed
her, had not her Vital Spirits been lenified,
appeased, and supported by some <hi>Spagyrical
Cordials</hi> that were most amicable to them.</p>
            <p>Throughout the whole course of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
I avoided <hi>Cooling Iuleps, Barley Liquors,</hi>
ordinary <hi>Opiates,</hi> or any common papaverous
Preparation of the <hi>Galenists,</hi> which would have
brought Nature into a <hi>nummed</hi> and <hi>drowsie</hi>
condition, and so have made it supine in the
<hi>Expulsion</hi> of these <hi>Hostile Guests,</hi> that had
taken such firm possession in the <hi>Colon</hi> to its
utter ruine.</p>
            <p>I make no question but a Dogmatist would
presently without any scruple (being confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those Indications there present to which
they severely adhere) have first Bled her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
two or three times, under the notion of
a Pleurisie, then Expectorated her with their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100452:68"/>
nasty slaps; but failing here would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her <hi>Laudanum</hi> for the mitigation of her
intollerable pains; and so bringing her into an
everlasting sleep, have sent these <hi>remarkable
Coagulations</hi> into the Grave with her unseen.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Tragical History</hi> ending <hi>Comically,</hi> I
have here communicated to the World, that
it may be allured to become a <hi>Phylo-Chymist,</hi>
and understand the insufficiency of <hi>Galenical</hi>
Preparations to help in extremity; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
all <hi>Ingenious</hi> and <hi>Industrious</hi> Artists in
their labours; that such a <hi>Litho-tribon,</hi> or
<hi>Break-stone Arcanum</hi> may be attained, that hath
power to dissolve the Stone even in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
without <hi>direful Cystotomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, I shall hereafter (if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
give you a fuller and larger account of this
<hi>Colick Duelech,</hi> with some other unusual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
collected in eighteen years diligent
study and Practice; and shall likewise give
you my thoughts of <hi>Splenotomy,</hi> or exection
of the <hi>Spleen</hi> out of a living Dog, his life

to be the first that made any sound
and notable trial thereof in <hi>Europe</hi> known
publickly, although some of our <hi>Galenical</hi>
