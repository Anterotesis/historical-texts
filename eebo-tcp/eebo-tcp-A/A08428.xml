            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And what beames can be more cleere or of more force, then these so palpable arguments &amp; euident demonstrations of the pure &amp; sincere veritie.

            <p>After an other sorte this may in like manner be proffitable to Catholikes. for somuch as there are some amongst them who seeme to doubt of these miracles, for diuersmen by a certaine kynd of incredulitte, and others vpon a spirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction either deny that these are miracles, or they will not beleeue, that they haue vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bene wrought. Vnto these wee must say that which our Sauiour sayd vnto <hi>Sainct Thomas. Come and feele &amp;c.</hi> Yf they will not yeeld credit to that which wee set downe, let them goe and see, and feele with their fingers, or else enquire the veritie of those who haue bene cured, for I am assured they shall fynd good store of them. And if after this they will not yet beleeue, assure your selues (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayd of those that denyed the principles of sciences) that they
<pb facs="tcp:13741:42"/>
do it for want of witte and iudgement, or els it must be beaten into their braynes with beetles or bastinadoes.</p>
            <p>There are also others who take occasion to doubt hereof, because many hauing bene miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously cured, did not for all that obtaine their health at an instant, or at the verie place, but by litle and litle with some alteration of their bodies: vnto whome wee may by good reason answere, that to prooue a miracle it suffiseth that the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and effect be aboue the course of nature, and not by any naturall meanes or remedies: and such are all those miracles which here in this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie wee haue sette downe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer amongst these miracles some are more perfit and notable then some others are: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the more notable are esteemed those, when the diseases are cured at the verie same instant, whereof wee haue verie many, and yet the others are not without miracle, although they haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in successe of tyme, because they were wrought aboue the course of nature.</p>
            <p>For who is he that will or can deny that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord cured the blynd man it was a true and perfit miracle? who at the beginning saw men walke like trees, yet no man doubteth that he afterward receiued his perfit sight.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any wayes repugnant to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:13741:43"/>
of a miracle that at the tyme of their healing they feel a change or alteration either in their soules or in their bodies: for (not alleaging the other reasons which wee will set downe in the ensuing historie) who is he that knoweth of those whome our Lord &amp; his saints miraculously cured did not feel the like also in them selues?

Our Lord recounted his miracles to the disciples of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> (who doubted whether he were the true Messias or no) without making any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or other qualities, saying: <hi>Go, tell vnto Iohn.

And in this plight he remained for a long tyme, beeing not able to go somuch as one or two steps without his crutches. Whereby being at last brought to that pouertie that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to procure his liuing by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messe of good folk, he was counseled by some to goe vnto the great Hospital of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> there to be healed and assisted. Where beeing admitted, he continued for some fower moneths and an half, and albeit that he was daylie visited by M. <hi>Iohn Bierens</hi> sworn Surgeon of the Citie, and by the Religious women of the sayd hospital, yet they could neuer cure him. Whereupon leauing <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> he went to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he was again in the Hospital for fourteen weekes, and he was assisted and dressed by two Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, whereof the one was called M. <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the other <hi>M. Iohn,</hi> &amp; although
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13741:195"/>
both they and the Physitions which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited and frequented him, had vsed all their diligence to heale him, yet they profited nothing, so that all that they did was in vaine. In somuch as beeing out of all hope to be cured, he departed out of the Hospital, and went vp and down a beggig going alwayes with his crutches. Afterwards coming to the Citie of <hi>Maclin</hi> he put himself into the Hospital to try yf there he could be holpen: where for the space of six weekes he was in the hands of the surgeon of that Hospital, dwelling neere to our Ladies Church, who also spared no paynes to cure him: but all was frutelesse, and procured him no ease, the poor patient continuing stil in the sayd state, hauing his left leg drawn backward, and very crooked, and so stiff, that he thought none was able by any force to make it right again. And so seeing all the remedies that he applyed there vnto did no good, he remained stil lame, not medling any more with phisick or surgerie, saue onely that he took some plaisters now from one, and then from an other to preserue his leg from rotting. It happened that in the beginning of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13741:196"/>
yeare 1603. he hard folk tel of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were wrought at <hi>Montaigu</hi> through inuocation of our Ladie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with his crutches thether from the aforesayd village of <hi>Vaels,</hi> where he was at that present, and he continued for a certain tyme in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayne, there daylie praying, and yet at that tyme he felt no ease at all. But wheras afterwards he perseuered in going often tymes in pilgrimage to the sayd <hi>Montaigu,</hi> and in visiting our Ladies Chappel: at the last betwixt Easter and Whit suntyde in the yeare 1604. seiourning for some tyme on the sayd mountayn, and dooing his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed deuotions at the Chappel, he also took of the water that is in the sayd place, and daylie washed his leg therewith: wherein he found incontinently amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perceiued that the two soares of his leg (which were now turned into one and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13741:196"/>
the sayd sore was made perfectly whole, and the swelling of his leg went away. And in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd yeare 1604. he came again to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigu</hi> with his crutches (although he had alredy felt so great ease that he vsed them not) and stayed there vntil the twentith of the sayd moneth, daylie washing his leg in the order as before we haue sayd: &amp; at that tyme it became very right, stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and free from the former euil, insomuch that he left his crutches at our Ladies Chappel, going and walking as perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly as any other: and from thence he went on foot without any paine or grief to the Citie of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> vpon the xxij<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the same moneth: where before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of the sayd Citie he affirmed and vnder his othe solemnly auouched the thinges that here haue been declared, as it apeareth by the attestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they dispatched heerof, dated the same day, and subsigned, P. <hi>Numan</hi> Secretarie of the sayd Citie.</p>
