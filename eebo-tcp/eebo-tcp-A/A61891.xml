            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but the fame of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi> GREATERICK</hi>
may have raised in you a Curiosity
to be better informed about the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
thereof. I have given <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Boyle</hi> an hasty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thereof in a Letter, which I send now to you,
that you may not be ignorant of it. It may seem
improper to Dedicate that to one which is sent to
another: but whether it be that I am too busy,
or too lazy to Write more: or that I mannage my
friendships with lesse of ceremony and formality
then usuall; I have resolved upon this course: and
I am confident that if I am in an errour you have
<pb facs="tcp:45057:3"/>
goodness enough to passe it by: The suppositions
I go upon depend so much upon the Doctrine of
Fermentation, that I could not but think of you
when I writ it: and who is a more competent judg
of the Subject here debated, then the <hi>best</hi> of
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Physicians?</hi> It may seeme
equitable that I tell you why I call the Gentleman
the <hi>Miraculous Conformist:</hi> many strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
have and do runne of him; but he is reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from all that is <hi>fanatique;</hi> and this gift of
Healing was bestowed on him, since the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Sacred Majesty, and the restitution
of the Doctrine and Discipline of the <hi>English
Church: God dealing with him, as the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
in the Parable, who expressed more
kindnesse to the lost sheep, being found; then
to the ninety-nine that had not strayed.</hi> I
have admired much in him, that Diseases carrying
so great a resemblance in their Nature, as to be
thought the same, and to reside in the same part,
are stroaked out divers wayes! That he should
be able to tell, that upon his first stroaking the
Patient should be worse, and cured by a second:
as he did in the Lameness of <hi>M<hi rend="sub">r</hi> Thomas Porter,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45057:3"/>
my very worthy and good Friend: He told him,
he could not <hi>set</hi> his Legge <hi>anew;</hi> but that he
would Cure his paine therein; yet at first it would
seem worse then before his <hi>touch:</hi> which proved
true; and yesterday I was with him in <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and found him able to walk three miles
without pain. You see how here his <hi>touch</hi> strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a part, that was incurably weakned by being
broken, and ill set: so that the painfulnesse see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
inseparable from the misfortune occasioning
it. I submit all my explication of the accident
to you: if you read it over twice, you do more
then ever I had the patience to do: I know many
imperfections will occurre in it, some whereof
were voluntary, knowing that the Learning of the
Person I writ to, needed not to be troubled with
petty Illustrations: Some defects have happened
thorough haste and inadvertency; it being all
written with one <hi>impetus</hi> of thoughts and penne,
just as I came from <hi>Ragly.</hi> It is nothing to say,
some have allready approved the Discourse, if
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Boyle,</hi> and you dissent. I have onely time to
tell you, that, without the noyse of much talk, and
<pb facs="tcp:45057:4"/>
frequent addresses and applications, I shall never

of those performances, the report whereof as it
gives just causes of astonishment to you that are more
remote, so the effects fill with admiration, the most
learned or suspicious beholders. In truth they are
such, that he is not at all obliged to the ignorant
for the esteem he hath acquired, nor is it possible
for the most tender or superstitious and censorious
Zealots to destroy his repute. He is a man of a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

and meene a vivacitie and spritelinesse that is nothing
common. As farre as I could informe my selfe by a
long and private discourse, he is a man of a very good
life, of tender and charitable Principles, as extensive as
the effects of his goodnesse are. He professeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
unto the Doctrine and Discipline of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> yet without that censoriousnesse
whereby some signalise themselves; his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himself are <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and he presumes
so well of <hi>others,</hi> that even in some <hi>colourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
he regulates his apprehensions by the <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
mercies of God,</hi> and not the <hi>severity of men.</hi> In fine,
without prejudice to <hi>this Age</hi> be it said, he seemed to
me by his <hi>faith,</hi> and by his <hi>charitablenesse,</hi> to include in
his <hi>soule</hi> some graines of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> and to be a
<hi>relique</hi> of those times when <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> were
<hi>sincere.</hi> I am more full in this <hi>Character</hi> of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some will be very inquisitive herein: though
otherwise the <hi>gift of healing</hi> be a <hi>gratia gratì; data,</hi>
not <hi>gratum faciens;</hi> and such as may be conferred,
on <hi>Iudas,</hi> (going to <hi>Samaria</hi>) and others, who at the
day of <hi>judgment</hi> shall say, <hi>Lord, have we not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syed in
thy Name? and in thy Name have cast-out Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels:
and in thy Name done many wonderfull works.</hi>
I enquired of him, how he came by this <hi>miraculous</hi> gift
of <hi>healing;</hi> And he replyed, that it was the <hi>grace of
God in him;</hi> which he understood at first by a <hi>strong</hi> and
<hi>powerfull impulse</hi> in him to <hi>essay</hi> it: and this motion
was so prevalent upon him, that it incessently runne
in his minde, nor could any businesse, how <hi>serious</hi> or
<hi>religious</hi> soever, divert him from those cogitations:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45057:7"/>
insomuch that even <hi>his life</hi> seemed <hi>burthensome</hi> to him
thorough the violence of the supposed <hi>temptation.</hi> He
imparted this trouble to his <hi>Wife,</hi> who condemned
those <hi>resveries,</hi> and desired him to abandon them: in
this perplexity, he heard <hi>frequently</hi> a voyce within him
<hi>(audible to none else)</hi> encouraging to the tryals: and
afterwards to correct his unbelief, the voice aforesaid
added this Signe, that <hi>his right Hand should be dead,
and that the stroaking of his left Arme should recover
it again:</hi> the events whereof were fully verified to him
three Nights together by a successive infirmity and
Cure of his Arme. Hereupon he set himself to the
<hi>charitable improvement</hi> of that <hi>talent</hi> which <hi>God had
given</hi> him; cureing at first onely <hi>Cancers in Womens
breasts,</hi> and the <hi>Kings-evil:</hi> after which, by the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of his <hi>accustomed impulse,</hi> he attempted the
Cure of other Diseases, according as he found himself
prompted thereunto <hi>from within.</hi> He was, and is still
a stranger to all <hi>Physique</hi> and <hi>Chirurgery:</hi> In the Cure
of <hi>some Tumours,</hi> he useth <hi>incision,</hi> though that processe
be but lately taken up, after that he observed that the
power of his <hi>touch</hi> did not <hi>discusse</hi> all, but <hi>ripen some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi>
The fame of his performances spread all over
<hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and multitudes went from <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll</hi>
unto him. Hereupon the Right Honourable the
<hi>Lord Conway</hi> employes <hi>Deane Rust</hi> to enquire into the
truth of these Accidents, and finding <hi>matter of fact</hi> to
justify the <hi>relations</hi> from <hi>excessive verity,</hi> he procures
him to come out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to trye if he might give
any ease to that <hi>excellent Lady</hi> of his, the pains of
whose <hi>head,</hi> as great and as unparalleld as they are,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45057:8"/>
have not made her more known or admired at home
and abroad, then have her other endowments. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his <hi>hand</hi> proved not so fortunate to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Lady, as was wished (he not being able to
<hi>alleviate</hi> or <hi>remove</hi> that <hi>head-ach,</hi> which had eluded the
greatest skill, and most effectual remedies, that <hi>England</hi>
or <hi>France</hi> yielded) yet did, he during his stay at <hi>Ragly,</hi>
atchieve those things which caused him to be followed
and admired by many thousands, who if they can say
he <hi>sometimes failed,</hi> yet ought not represent him as an
<hi>Impostor.</hi> I do not relate unto you the <hi>reports</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested

Although I had not the opportunity of seeing
him till I came to my <hi>Lord Conwayes,</hi> yet I found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
to visit many that had been <hi>touched</hi> by him;
some I observed to have received no help by him at
all; some I observed to have found a momentany be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from his <hi>touch:</hi> and some as yet continue so well,
that I think I may say they are Cured. This <hi>variety
of successe</hi> amused me something: yet I recollected with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45057:8"/>
my self, how there were some <hi>diseases,</hi> as well as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,</hi>
which even the <hi>Apostles</hi> could not cast out: and
I could not perswade my self that <hi>Trophimus</hi> was the
<hi>onely man,</hi> or <hi>Miletum</hi> the <hi>onely place,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> left
<hi>any sick.</hi> I considered <hi>this man</hi> to be <hi>no Apostle,</hi> and
therefore thought it injurious to expect that <hi>from him,</hi>
who propagates no <hi>new Gospell,</hi> which was not to be
found in those <hi>extraordinary Envoyes of Heaven.</hi> I
saw no <hi>incongruity</hi> in admitting, that <hi>God,</hi> who distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>various</hi> gifts amongst the Sonnes of Men, might
issue out the <hi>same gift</hi> to severall persons in a <hi>different
measure</hi> or proport<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on. <hi>There are differences of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
but the same Lord: there are diversities
of operations, but it is the same God, which worketh all
in all, 1 Cor: 12. V.</hi> 4, 5. Besides, I thought that how
<hi>powerfull</hi> soever the <hi>gift</hi> were in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greatarick,</hi> yet the
<hi>sinnes</hi> of the <hi>patient</hi> might sometimes <hi>frustrate</hi> the effect
of <hi>his hands,</hi> as well as the <hi>prayers</hi> of the most preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Saints, <hi>Moses, Noah,</hi> or <hi>Daniel.</hi> I was apt to
believe, that at <hi>Corinth,</hi> there wanted not the <hi>gift of
healing,</hi> nor an <hi>effectuall anointing with Oyle,</hi> (James 5:
14.) yet did the <hi>misdemeanors</hi> of some draw upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
there <hi>irrecoverable Sicknesse and Death,</hi> 1 Cor: 11.
v. 30. However, I did not understand that God <hi>parted</hi>
so away with <hi>his gifts,</hi> as not to <hi>reserve</hi> a paramount
command over them still; and I though the might as
well <hi>glorify</hi> himself in the <hi>continuance of some blind,</hi>
as in causing some <hi>to be borne so,</hi> without regard to
their particular sinne, or that of their Parents. These
faylours in our <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> ought rather to make
men look upon, and take notice of the <hi>omnipotency of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45057:9"/>
God,</hi> then censure the <hi>deficiencies</hi> of a <hi>limited Creature.</hi>
From these reflections I posted on, to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>undeniable performances of his
hand.</hi> I saw him put his Finger into the Eares of a
man who was very thick of Hearing; and immediatly
he heard me when I asked him very softly severall
questions. I saw another whom he had touched three
Weeks agoe for a Deafnesse in one Eare, whom I had
known to be so many years: I stopped the other Eare
very close, and I found him to hear very well, as we
spoke in a tone no way raysed beyond our ordinary
conversation. I saw him launce a Wenne that covered
the Eye of an old man; there issued out abundance of
matter in smell, and consistence, and colour, resembling
a rotten-Egge; after which he crushed out the lesse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
matter, which resembled the Braines of any
Creature: which being done, he stroked the place
gently, and the flux of blood, and pain (which was
great by reason of his crushing it hard) presently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.)
I saw yesterday another Woman, in whose
Throat, just by the Wind-pipe he launced a Wenne,
and haveing crushed out the digested and indigested
matter, and stopped the paine and effusion of blood
by some strokes of his hand, he bad her put nothing
to it but a linnen Cloth: when I saw it, the Wenne
was perfectly gone, and the baggs or skinne encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
it so shrunk up by nature, that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nothing but the skarre after incision. I asked him
concerning Wennes, whither upon his crushing and
launcing them so, they would not fill again: he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, <hi>No: but that Nature, as she doth in other Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45057:9"/>
would so shrink and contract the skinne encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the VVenne, that there should remaine no signe of
it, no not a wrinkle,</hi> which I was apt to believe, from
what I had seen. I saw a Child brought to him, whom
he had stroked before, and it was much amended; but
one Tumour upon the right Arme (near the Elbow)
was extreamly painfull and inflamed: he Stroked it,
and launced it, and crushed out all the matter, even the
indigested cores; and Stroking it, the paine and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
ceased immediatly, not one drop of blood issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out after that. I saw another Legge, that upon his
Stroking, had very much abated the swelling: the
whole Foot to the Ankle was swell'd and inflamed,
many holes there were in it, but there issued little or
nothing from them: he took it and crushed it extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bringing out much blood, and indigested matter in
cores as big as nutmegs: and then stroaking it, all the
paine and flux of blood ceased: but the weaknesse being
habituall to the part, was not removed at that instant.
I saw a Woman taken with a violent fit of the Falling-sicknesse;
he came to her, and causing her breast to be
opened, and chafed her Stomack with his Hand a while,
presently her paroxysme abated; and he asked her whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the paine was gone; she pointed to her Throat;
and indeed she seemed as if she were in danger of being
strangled there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he Stroked her Throat lightly, and
asked where her paine was? she poynted to her Breast;
he stroked that; and then she made signes that it was
returned to her Throat: whereupon he Stroked with
his hand upwards her Breast and Neck, and she began to
belch winde with such a vehemency, that is scarce to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45057:10"/>
imagined; and withall st<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eyning as it were to vomit,
she brought up some crude phlegme, with an infinity of
winde, and then rose up well to her thoughts. These
were the principall things I saw him do, he being then
upon his departure for <hi>London:</hi> but I received from
himself, and others sufficient accounts, that he had Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
almost all manner of distempers, even Quartane-Agues,
and Feavours: and whosoever shall seriously
consider the things he doth performe, will not finde
in reason any thing to stop his Credulity.</p>
            <p>I might now end this Letter, and leave You, &amp; those
other worthy members of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> to determine
concerning these Effects, which I apprehend miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
but since the Freedome, You allow me with you,
permits me to speak any thing, I shall, without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
from the power of God, and with all due Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to so extraordinary Characters of his Goodness,
propose unto You some Thoughts, which occurred to
me hereupon: as confused as they are, they may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to others some occasion of greater Enquiries.</p>
            <p>I considered, that there was no manner of Fraud in
the performances, that his Hands had no manner of
Medicaments upon them, (for I smell'd to them, and
handled them, and saw them wash'd more then once
after some Cures, and before others,) nor was his Stroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so violent, as that much could be attributed to
the Friction.</p>
            <p>I observed, that he used no manner of Charmes, or
unlawful words; sometimes he Ejaculated a short Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
before he cured any, and alwayes, after he had done,
he bad them give God the Praise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45057:10"/>I did not remember, that ever the Devil did cure any
Diseases; no not when his Glory was concerned in it, as
in the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> upon whom the Boyl was,
<hi>Exod</hi> 9 11. wherein you cannot object any particular
interposition of God, any more then in the other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
whereby the Magicians were suffered to try their
skill against <hi>Moses.</hi> I knew, the Devil went about
seeking whom he might destroy; that he plagued <hi>Iob</hi>
with Botches: but where are the Examples of his Cures,
or when did he ever do any Good, and ascribe the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto God?</p>
            <p>I reflected upon the Performances of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
who cured Diseases with his Finger: so did <hi>Vespasian</hi>
cure two by touching them, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi>
avow: so the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and, some years after
them, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have not been doubted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to cure the Kings-Evill. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did,
for some time, discontinue the Touching for the Kings
Evil, doubting either the Success, or Lawfulnesse of
that way of Curing. But She soon quitted that Fitt of
Puritanisme, when the Papists defamed her, as if God
had withdrawn from her the gift of Healing in that
manner, because she had withdrawn her self from the
Roman Church. There are some who think, that God
hath bestowed upon all Kings some such Character or
Gift, to shew, how particularly he is concerned for them,
and differenceth them from other men; but they know
it not.</p>
            <p>From these cogitations I descended to the <hi>Alexicaci,
Salutatores,</hi> or <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sedevios,</hi> of which the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists
and Physicians speak much: I must referre you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45057:11"/>
to <hi>Delrius</hi> for your farther information; for my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
fayles me so, as I cannot give you an account of
them so full as I would. They cure by Anointing
with their Spittle, by breathing and stroking of the
patient. <hi>Rodericus à Castro medic: polit: l. 4. c. 3.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of the verity of their Cures, by replying nothing
to this objection in favour of them: <hi>In confirmatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
adducunt experientiam &amp; varia curationum gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
mirè frequentia, &amp; praxin quotidianam militum qui
solo afflatu, osculo, aut nudi lintei applicatione sanant
etiam atrocissima vulnera, qui omnes dono sanitatis in
variis morbis se praeditos gloriantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Turky</hi> also, and <hi>Afrique,</hi> they have persons of the
like qualifications, which they boast to have received
from the favour of their Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
God hath permitted all Religions (though
not the Protestants, till now) to have their reall Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that men may learne to trye Miracles by the
Truth, and not the Truth by Miracles.</p>
            <p>I considered likewise the Nephritick and Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
and several other Amulets and <hi>Periapta,</hi> whose
operation is certain and undeniable: yet could not all
these Considerations instruct me further in the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of these Miraculous Accidents, then to conclude,</p>
            <p>That God had bestowed upon Mr. <hi>Greatarick</hi> a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Temperament, or composed his Body of some
particular Ferments, the <hi>Effluvia</hi> whereof, being intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
sometimes by a light, sometimes by a violent
Friction, should restore the Temperament of the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated
parts, re-invigorate the Bloud, and dissipate all
heterogeneous Ferments out of the Bodies of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45057:11"/>
by the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, Hand, and Feet.</p>
            <p>I place the gift of healing in the temperament or
composure of his body; because I see it necessary that
he Touch them, or otherwise rubbe their Eyes with
his Spittle. Besides, the right Honourable the Lord
<hi>Conway</hi> observed one Morning as he came into his
Lordships Chamber, a smell strangely pleasant, as if it
had been of sundry Flowers: and demanding of his man
what sweet water he had brought into the Roome, he
answered, <hi>None:</hi> whereupon his Lordship smelled on
the hand of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Greatarick,</hi> and found the fragrancy to
issue thence; and examining his Bosome, he found the
like scent there also. But this is observable, but at
some times, for I could observe no such scent in his
Hands. <hi>Deane Rust</hi> observed his Urine to smell like
Violets, though he had eat nothing that might give it
that scent. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Amos Meredith</hi> who had been his
Bedfellow, said, that in the Night he had observed the
like agreeablenesse of smell in M<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> Body, at
some houres.</p>
            <p>I place it in the temperament of his Body, because
I have the precedent of Ancient Miracles, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
ones, wrought by the efficacy of a Corporal
Touch. Besides it is evident how several Diseases
are contracted that way: and why may not some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
and wholesome <hi>effluvia</hi> be communicated in the
same manner? As there are some, who are said to fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinate
by their Aspect, so <hi>Rodericus à Castro Med: polit:
l. 4. c. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>è converso quosdam esse quorum Oculi cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur
habere vim beneficam ad res inspectas: vulgo
Benzedeiros.</hi> I remember the Presbyterian Assembly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45057:12"/>
of Divines say that nothing more kindly restores de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
Nature, then the Embraces of an <hi>Abishag,</hi> of a
young, spritely and Beautifull Damsell, as you may see
in their large Notes upon the first Chapter of the first
Book of Kings.</p>
            <p>To explaine the nature and manner of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
working upon the patients for their Cure, I shall
premise some things.</p>
            <p>First, That all the Diseases and distempers M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atarick</hi>
meddles with, have their essence either in the
masse of Blood and Spirits (or nervous Liquour) or
in the particular Temperament of the parts of the
Body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That of the Diseases and Infirmities which
he meddles with, he Cures none wherein there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in Nature, but onely such as wherein she seems only
oppressed by some Heterogeneous Ferment, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
an Ebullition and paine, or Coagulating and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blood and spirits. This is a confessed truth by
him, he refusing still to touch the Eyes of such as their
sight is quite perished: so for Eares that are Deaf upon
any such accident that hath extinguished the Naturall
faculty of the part. And there being the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for inward distempers as to their causes, his fayling
as to many, and the relapse of many after a momentany
amendment is to be ascribed to this cause: as I shall
shew further by and by.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It seems to me very imaginable that there
may be given by God such a Natural Crasis and Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via
consequentiall thereunto, that the stroaking with
his Hand for some space so as to communicate the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45057:12"/>
Vertue may restore the Blood and Spirits to that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and strength which is naturall to them, and resus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate
the contracted imbecillity of any part. That
which makes me to conceive this, is, that I observe that
there are things outwardly applyed which by their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to particular Ferments do destroy severall
Distempers, not onely inwardly taken, but outwardly
applyed: as the Cramp rings and small <hi>Manati-stone</hi>
the Crampe: the <hi>Nephritic-stone</hi> drives out gravel,
and the Stone: <hi>Peony-roots</hi> gathered in due time, the
Epilepsy: There are severall things which outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applyed revive oppressed Nature, not onely as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
but by friction, and outward application: this
needs no Illustration. Having these grounds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
me in the manner Medicaments may operate,
methinks I can as easily comprehend that there may
be a Medicament (and whether that be a Man, or a
Stone, or a Plant, it is all one) which may invigorate
the blood and spirits so as to continue that work of
Circulating, Depurating, and Sanguifying, as before
the oppression they did: provided there be no essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
distemper contracted, but that Nature be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
onely, not destroyed wholly, or in part: for so
farre as Nature is mutilated and destroyed, the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that essentiall damage is possible onely to
God, or such as he hath obliged in a more eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greatarick</hi> pretends unto. This last ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of mine cannot seem more irrationall to any
man, then the Learned'st men of the last Age both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
and Casuists, thought all sorts of Amulets: and
I am sure I can bring for Mr <hi>Greataricks</hi> more Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45057:13"/>
then all this Age can shew to justify the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Amulets, and Cataplasmes: for if I argue from
visible effects, no Amulet or Periapt ever produced
more evident Testimonies of its force, then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taricks</hi>
hath rendered of his Efficacy. And if they go
to explicate the wayes and means whereby those Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
work; the notion I have concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi>
is the most facile, for I imagine no more to be in him,
then a particular Temperament, or implanted Ferment,
which upon his touching and stroking shall so farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate
the blood, spirits, and innate temperament of
the part (Nature being onely oppressed) that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their usuall duties: This being done, it is Nature
Cures the Diseases and distempers and infirmities, it
is Nature makes them fly up and down the Body so as
they do: they avoyd not his Hand, but his Touch and
stroke so Invigorateth the parts that they reject the
Heterogeneous Ferment, 'till it be outed the Body at
some of those parts he is thought to stroke it out at.</p>
            <p>Considering that our life is but a Fermentation of
the Blood, nervous Liquor, and innate constitution of
the parts of our Body, I conceive I have represented
those hints and proofs which may render it imaginable
that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> by his stroking may introduce an
oppressed Fermentation into the Blood and Nerves,
and resuscitate the oppressed Nature of the parts. I
now proceed to shew that those effects which are so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
upon the stroaking of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> Hand, <hi>viz:</hi>
that the paines flye before his Hand, untill he drive
them out at the Fingers, Mouth, Eyes, Toes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
the effects of Nature in vigorated, and not immediatly
of his Touching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45057:13"/>I saw him Stroke a man for a great and setled paine
in his left Shoulder, which rendered his Arme uselesse:
upon his stroking it the paine removed instantly into
the end of the musculus Deltodes: being Stroked
there, it returned to the Shoulder again: thence (upon
a second Stroking) it flew to the Elbow, thence to his
Wrist, thence to his Shoulder again; and thence to his
Fingers; whence it went out upon his last stroking, so
as that he moved his Arme vigorously every way. I
asked M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greaterick</hi> about the Courses, pains, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
took, to go out of the Body: he told me, he
could not tell what course any pain or Disease would
take to go out: that the wayes of God were unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
that, it was not in his power to force them any
way, but that he followed them onely, and if the party
could not tell where the paine was (for such are onely
stroked out) he could not cure them, nor were they
cured, but eased if it came not out. Of this I saw an
instance in a Woman, whom the Falling-sicknesse by
its long continuance (joyn'd with Melancholly) had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated
so as that being out of all Fits, she could not
tell what ayled her: she falling into her Fit there, he
opened her Breast and with a few strokes reduced her
to her self, but she not being able to tell what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the paine she had felt, he could proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to remove that Paroxysme.</p>
            <p>How Nature may cause those irregular motions
of pains backward and forward shall be my next enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Where bold and commanding Medicines are not
made use of, it is Nature, not Physique that cures Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease:
we are but Servants to Nature, to remove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45057:14"/>
or strengthen her that she may effect the
work: upon this account it was that the Ancient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
were so cautious to distinguish the times of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
and to instruct Practitioners what they were to
do at the severall times, when to moderate the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
symptomes, when to Purge by Stoole or Urine:
they were to attend unto Concoction, and not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
much before, except in case of Turgency. When
they proceeded thus warily, there were severall Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or removals of Diseases and paines (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
which are now scarce observable
by reason of the Minoratives, the Purges, the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and other Physique which is given, not because it
is best, but because in fashion. In those times when
Nature was so left to her self, I observe severall Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
or removeals of Diseases which came into my
mind when I saw the effects of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his <hi>Epidem: l. 6. part.</hi> 3. §. 34:
tells us that the Gout ceaseth if a man fall into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
and that fit of the Colique abates as his Gout
encreaseth. Thus Nature removeth the paine. So
in his Aphorismes he tells us that long Feavers Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in swellings and pains of the Joynts. And
elsewhere, <hi>That a Dysentery suppressed creates an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemation
in the Side, Bowels, or Ioynts. That swellings
of the Spleen and Bowels, or inflamations thereof, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
terminate in Ioynt-aches. So Quartane-agues
often Terminate in the Gout.</hi> It were infinite to relate
out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Translations and removals of
paine which he relates, <hi>viz.</hi> of Coughs, and Asthmas,
falling into the Joynts, and Testicles: of Ulcers and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45057:14"/>
outward distempers which have removed into the Head
and Bowels. All the Prognosticks illustrate this: nor
can any man be ignorant of the translations of Humours
and paines from noble to ignoble parts, and from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
to noble ones, nor of the alteration of distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
upon such translation of the Morbifique Matter,
as of Asthmas and Coughs turning to the Gout, or
Tumour of the Testicles: of Agues turning into pains
in the Joynts; of Feavours ending in a Parotis, or
other abscessus. Not to mention the vagrant nature
of Humours in the beginning of Diseases, when they
are Turgent, and continually vary their station.</p>
            <p>These Considerations made me think that God had
been pleased to bestow upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> such a
Complexion and Temperament, that his Touch or
Stroking should instantly maturate Diseases, or render
them Turgent, whereupon the part touched being
strengthned, and the blood and spirits Invigorated,
the Heterogeneous Ferment or paine (which if not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by some evident and externall cause, is caus'd
by an Heterogeneous Ferment) is expelled from the
corroborated place to some other more weake: that
being corroborated, it is driven upon another, and so
on, till it be quite ejected. If the Disease be such as
lies in nothing but a Dyscrasy of the part, it is cured
without any such removeall of paine: and so for such
Coagulations of the Nervous liquor (as in Palsyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
there is no such removeall of paine and pursuing it:
either because they are not Dolorifique, or that they
Transpire in the part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45057:15"/>There remaine yet two things to be debated, <hi>viz:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. How comes it to passe that these Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ferments removing thus by the force of Resus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated
Nature, do not terminate in Apostemes,
or issue out in some grosse Body; but go out in a
vapour and invisibly?</p>
            <p>2. How comes all this to happen in so short a
time?</p>
            <p>To the first I answer; That it is not unusuall for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to discharge her self of Heterogeneous Ferments
by insensible Transpiration, as well as Apostemes,
Sweat, Diarrhaea, and Urine: so the Mesels are cured:
so many Crude and hard Tumours: and in this Plague
few swellings broke, yet were they cured. Nor is it to
be said, that the matter occasioning those Tumours was
discussed so as to be reimbibed in the blood againe: for
in the Plague the recurses of the Pestilentiall Ferment
are Mortall: and such as took Powders and Antidotes
gently promoting a Diaphoresis, (not sweat) escaped:
they who did not, dyed with those Bubones. It is
an affect of prejudice occasioned by the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the usuall effects of Nature, and not of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to imagine that the Morbifique cause consists in a
grosse Body, because it is often evacuated so: It is
usuall for those subtile Ferments so to commix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to occasion that transposition of Parts and
Texture, that Nature cannot eject the one without the
expense of the other. Thus we see that Beer or Ale in
its Fermentation or Working casts out aboundance of
Barme, yet is not that Body the Ferment, but it is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and incorporated therewith, for with it there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45057:15"/>
issues out aboundance of Beare, so that the Brewers
either pover the same, or new in again to fill up the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
If the same Ferment be precipitated by Vineger, or
Allome, there is not the like diminution. So <hi>Kergerus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kerger. de ferment. sect. 2. c. 8. p. 139.</note> saith, that in <hi>Germany</hi> they put common Salt, or cold
Water into their Bear, and precipitating the Ferment
make it potable presently. Many such instances are
to be found in Dr <hi>VVillis</hi> and <hi>Kerger;</hi> which sufficiently
evince that the Ferment is distinct from the grosse
Body it comes out in. So in Diseases, however some
have vainly imagined to themselves a maturation of
them, and that the Morbifique matter being concocted
issued out in that white Hypostasis at the end of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
yet is it no such thing, nor is there any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
in Nature as they phansy: but the Morbifique
matter or Ferment, being intimately commixed with
some good and profitable parts of the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
is ejected together with them, according to the
nature of the Eumuctory, by which the Crisis or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastasis
is made, or the nature of the Bodies constituting
that humour. Nature dealing therein just as she does
in the Fermentation of Beer and Wine, in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Kerger,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>VVillis:</hi> whence proceed their
wayes of curing Agues by Precipitation of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
Ferment, without any such Evacuations of grosse
Bodies. This Paradox appeares further by the several
Crises of Diseases, sometimes by Vomit, sometimes
by Stoole, sometimes by bleeding at the Nose, and
Sweat. In all which circumstances the Urine shew one
sort of Concoction, whilst the Morbifique Ferment
issues out severall wayes in severall Bodies. Nor is it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45057:16"/>
to be doubted I think that all grosse bodyed Ferments
have their Virtue and efficacy from a subtile Body
which is no more in that grosse Body, then the Spirit
of Sugar is in Sugar: of which See <hi>Angelus Sala's
Saccharologia:</hi> many other instances might be given,
as that, if the grand Ferment were a grosse Body, how
comes it to evaporate (as I have seen in the Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sugar, Sugar-cance-juyce, and other Liquors
Fermented for Spirits) without any diminution of the
Liquors? From all which it appears that one may
conceive how upon the efficacious Touch of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taricks,</hi>
he refuscitating the Blood and innate Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Morbifique Ferment may be ejected; and
the remaining grosse Body, by a Transposition of its
Texture and a new impregnation of Vitality be reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
into the Blood, and become nutritious. Thus
he cures Asthmas, all the obstructions from impacted
phlegme in the Lungs being discharged, and the
phlegme Naturalised. But if the grosse body of the
Morbifique matter be Incorrigible and Preternaturall,
then the efficacy of his Touch doth not discusse them,
but the strengthning the part and Nature, the whole
collection is separated and ripened, as I observed:
which appears in Wenns, and scrophulous Tumours,
some whereof he maturates, and others are discussed.</p>
            <p>To the second Question, how all this happens in
so short a time? I answer, that it is the efficacy of
the Ferment implanted in Mr <hi>Greataricks</hi> Body. We
are not to deny powerfull causes proportionate effects.
We are all Indians and Salvages in what we have not
accustomed our senses: what was Conjuring in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45057:16"/>
last Age, is Mathematiques in this. And if we do but
consider the sole effects of Gun-powder, as it is seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be used, and revolve with our selves what we
would have thought if we had been told those Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
and not seen of them; will we think it strange
if men think the actions of extraordinary Ferments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible?
Here I might instance in the effects of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
from Macastar, and Brasil: but the acts of sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of paine, sufficiently shew the effects of suddain
causes: that Lipothymies and shivering should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
upon a fright, a touch of cold Water, or a pinch:
that Tumours should in an instant imbody to a great
bulke: that in such as are Planet-struck (or said to be
so) all or any of their Limbs should be taken away:
these are such events (that if we could not alleadge A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets
and outward applications to produce a suddain
alteration for the better) would make it seem credible
that there may be as powerfull means for mans Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as his Sicknesse. I forbear to mention the suddain
effects of Sleep and Waking, Freezing and Thawing: or
of Heat and Cold; all which would illustrate the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and powerfull motions of Nature.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I shall now draw to a Conclusion, having given you
by these impertinencies a greater trouble, then my self
in Writing them: I knew not how to entertain my
self better, nor you worse: But I am sure that the
suppositions I have made agree exactly with the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks</hi> Cures. And from hence it
is easy to judge why some are not Cured; others finde
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45057:17"/>
but a momentany alleviation, and some are perfectly
recovered. All which are undenianbly true: let any
man salve these accidents more agreeably then I have
done,
<q>—Et Phyllida solus habeto.</q>
It is worth consideration, Whether such as come unto
him ought not first to advise with a discreet Physician,
what their Distempers are, and where Originally seated;
the better to direct him in his Stroking. For it is not
unusual for the Disease to be seated in one place, and
to discover it self in another by the Symptomes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to which they have recourse to him only: for in
such cases, if they have no better successe then such
have who meet with ignorant Physicians, that go
about to cure Symptomes without regard to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
cause, it is no marvaile if they are not Cured.
Thus I have observed some, who upon a giddinesse, and
qualmes of the Stomack, occasioned by Hystericall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
have been stroked by him severall times (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any, or inconsiderable benefit) in the parts sensibly
affected. So in the Kings-evil, I have observed some
that have received onely a momentany advantage;
onely because that such Diseases affect the Mesentery
with glandulous Tumours, as well as the outward parts:
and if the whole Morbifique Ferment be not expelled,
the Disease recurres: <hi>paululum fermenti totam massam
fermentat.</hi> Another thing to be considered by the
Patient to be stroked,<note place="margin">Valles: Method. Med. l. 3. c. 3.</note> is, that there may be a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Diseases, in which the Cure of one may be
impeded by another: as in the Spleen and Scurvey,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45057:17"/>
               <hi>Eugalenus</hi> and others observe: so in Sore-eyes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by the Evill; or a suffusion proceeding from an
Acid or Nidorous quality in the Stomack: and many
Diseases whereto Malignancy is joyned. In these
cases the Heterogeneous Ferments may be united in a
looser way, and upon his Touch separate, and whilst
the one is driven out, the other may remaine in the
Body, and by unloosing the Texture of the Body of
the blood, and other Humours, give opportunity for
more <hi>formae subjugatae</hi> (of the same kind with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
to discover themselves. In like manner, it is
possible that where the Morbifique Ferment is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
united and imbodyed, so as that one part
ejected by way of Similar Attraction (I confesse I must
favour that Phylosophy, from the Phenomena of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique
and Nature too) his Touch may disunite those
incoherent Corpuscles, and the patient not regarding
the smaller and scarce sensible paines (the which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the parts and Humours the Ferment incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates
with) may direct him to pursue the most afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paine (which may not be the greatest) whilest the
other remaines in the Body, and afterwards occasions
the same distemper: or perhaps another whose paines
may so resemble the former, that we may take it for
the same: as our senses discerne not betwixt the Salt of
one Plant and another, or betwixt the cauteriseing with
Iron, or Gold; but there is a difference herein, which by
effects a diligent and curious observer may discover.
Concerning these intimations I discoursed with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ataricks,</hi>
who seemed well satisfyed with them; and
did thereunto willingly ascribe severall miscarriages and
Faylours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45057:18"/>Another thing I proposed unto him, was, whether
after that he had touched severall persons, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Preternaturall Ferment, or diverted it, (and
put the Humours into a Turgency) whether it might
not be convenient to Vomit, Purge, and take those
courses Physique directs us unto. And from this he
was so little averse, that in my hearing he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to a Gentlewoman the taking some <hi>Cochiae</hi> Pills,
after he had touch'd her Eyes. I asked also if after he
had dissipated and repelled a setled Humour, it might
not be convenient to corroborate the Part with <hi>Topicks;</hi>
which he approved of, and though but to few, I saw
him give Eye-salve to some Patients. You know
what pains wee Physicians take in Revulsions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivations
of the Humours Morbifique from severall
Parts: and do not you think a great part of our work
were done, could M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greaterick</hi>'s miraculous Touch
remove (or put into motion) those Humours we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repel, or stirre? Let us, Sir, be just and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious;
and confesse that this Antichrist of Physicians
may be of the greatest service to them in the World,
if they preferre the recovery of their Patients before
their Credit, or Rules of Art. <hi>Rarà non sunt artis.</hi>
You have observed how great things Nature does,
when alleviated; and the effects of that principle of
Restitution, when the prohibiting causes are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>As to the allaying of paines after crushing of sores,
or bruises: and the miraculous stanching of Blood:
I think both them depend upon the restauration of the
Temperament of the part and Blood: As to pains
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45057:18"/>
it is easy to grant this. And as to the effusion of
Blood, you know there is a Balsame in it which heales
it self: to illustrate which, I recommend to you a
Note of <hi>Plateru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> in his Observations (I want my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary)
how an Hangman of <hi>Basil</hi> cut off mens Hands,
and stopped the Bleeding of the Veines and Arteries
by slitting the Arse of an Hen, and thrusting the Hand
into it. If this do not convince you, the Discourses
of Sympathetique Cures may do it: especially an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Panarolus,</hi> may convince you that such
steemes (as vapours) may effect it; which is the reason
why I assigne not one Ferment to him, but think there
may be more: which yet may not produce their effects
in every case, nor exert their influences in all cases no
more then the Menstruum upon a disagreable occasion
produce all its effects. This needs not to be illustrated
to you.</p>
            <p>I think I have now rendered you a tolerable account
of this Miraculous man, of whom I dare make that
Proclamation which a Roman Emperour did upon the
occasion of the <hi>Ludi seculares,</hi> or sports celebrated once
in an hundred years. Come, and behold, what no man
living hath seen, or shall see again. I would not be
understood to derogate from this miraculous Gift;
not yet ascribe more unto it, then I ought, lest I should
hear the reprehension in <hi>Iob; Will you tell a lye
for God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are a sort of men (if they were onely Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
it were tolerable!) that think it not lawfull to
have recourse unto his Cures. Though I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
too much cause not to entermeddle with Divinity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45057:19"/>
or cases of Conscience any more, yet I cannot but take
notice of their Principall Objection: for to say that
Miracles are ceased is a groundlesse folly, if not a difin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous

            <p>They say, <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith is Sinne:</hi> that it
being impossible for them to be convinced, that this
man works by the immediate gift of God; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repaire to him lest they be found to repaire to a

invalidated by M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Church-Policy:</hi> and
it is a Principle hath occasioned so much of Troubles in
our State, that I wonder it is not layd aside. In <hi>Moral
Philosophy</hi> (which is not established on <hi>demonstrations)</hi>
and Physique I am sure it will put us all to confusion;
for who knowes the efficacy of things Naturall? how
Purges and Vomits <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do worke? Nay, who

God doth operate <hi>ad praesentiam causarum secundarum?</hi>
as the admirable <hi>Durandus</hi> held. And may not the
<hi>Divel</hi> do so? How shall this be reduced to <hi>Faith?</hi>
I am sure, and have seen things ascribed to the Divel,
that it is now confessed have another Originall. Did
all that came to <hi>Christ,</hi> believe in him? you know the
story of the tenne Lepers: if to come to Christ, were
not to believe in him further then that they thought
he could Cure, since they saw him Cure, how is it in
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Greataricks?</hi> The thing they come for, is <hi>good;</hi>
such as may be begged of God: there is nothing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

that think a <hi>good and perfect work</hi> should come <hi>else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi>
then from Heaven? If the case be not to be
tolerated, because not ordinary: as there is but one
Mr <hi>Greataricks,</hi> so there is but one Sunne. To be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
hinders it not from being consistent with
Faith; but to be unlawfull, or absolutely impossible:
as to impossibilities, we know not what is impossible
with God, or Nature. And for the unlawfulnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

she found them considerably strengthned at the

put them behind her Back, combe her Head, and
use her Needle, and thus she continues to this

                  <hi>Greatericks</hi> to the Citty
of <hi>VVorcester,</hi> and lodged with him in the House
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>VVithie</hi> an Attorney; We had not been
there full an houre, when (beside a multitude of
infirme people) there came to him one M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi> 
                  <hi>Bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keridge</hi>
(dwelling within half a mile of <hi>Tewxbury)</hi>
bringing with her four of her Children, two Sons,
and as many Daughters; The elder of the youths
is now two and twenty years of Age, and about
two years since was strucken with the dead Palsy,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45057:22"/>
which in continuance of time hath so disabled
him, that he can neither stand or feed himself,
I saw little or no effect upon M<hi rend="sub">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greataricks</hi> stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him, either that night, or the next day.</p>
               <p>The other three, the remaining Son, and two
Daughters (by the report of their Mother) fell
all down in the street, as they were coming along
with her to M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>

               </p>
               <p>These had all been troubled with Convulsions,
or fits of the Falling-sicknesse for about four
years. The Youth upon the application, and
short chafing of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greataricks</hi> Hand was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
I saw him well the next day in the Citty-Hall,
and the next after heard that he continued
so, and was seen playing in the Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Susan,</hi> one of the Girles, (as her Mother told
me) was so thickly pursued with her Fits, that
of a Twelve month before, she had not spoken
above once in a Month: And <hi>Margaret</hi> the other
Girle had lay'n utterly Speechlesse for three
Weeks last past.</p>
               <p>Both these after somewhat a longer chafing,
were soon freed, and restored to Speech, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of walking up and down the Room; but they
both relaps't into their Fits, and became again
Speechlesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret</hi> lay in that condition (for twelve
hours) that she could neither speak or stand.
On Wednesday morning <hi>(Feb. 14.)</hi> her Mother
brought her into the City-Hall, and within ten
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45057:23"/>
Minutes She was restored to Speech, but her
Pain held Mr. <hi>Greataricks</hi> Hand in play neer an
Hour after. Being thus returned to her speech,
she was willed by Mr. <hi>Greatarick</hi> to move her
Hand upon the place, and point wheresoever her
pain removed, he being presently ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his Hand to the part affected: she did so,
and forthwith it avoided his Touch, skipping
exceeding swiftly from one part of the Head to
the other; as from the Forehead to the Crown,
from thence to the Pole, then to the Right
Side, now to the Left, into the Neck, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Arm, Hand, th' opposite Hand; to the
Thigh, calf of the Leg, Anckle, Foot, and
from thence (as quick as thought) to the head
again, where shifting according to the former or
like Order, he was sometimes fain to apply
both his Hands, but then many times the Pain
got between the <hi>interstices</hi> of his Fingers, from
whence, upon a fresh Application, it flew to
other parts, as before, and alwaies with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
speed, that it much amazed the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers,
and Mr. <hi>Greataricks</hi> would often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that, in his Opinion, it was some Evill
Spirit gotten into the Body of the Child. At
length having vexed it from part to part, for (as
I guess) the best part of an Hour, it passed out at
her Toes.</p>

                  <hi>VValling,</hi> a School-Mistress, dwelling
upon <hi>Mavern</hi> Hill, fell into a most horrid Fit
of the Falling-Sickness; her Motions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
vehement, and Convulsive, with so
much violence and impetuosity, as if her Limbs
had then been rending in sunder: I never saw any
Hysterical Paroxysm half so dreadful; all her
Joynts seemed to be crampt, and sometimes so
distorted, as if She had been upon the Wrack.
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greataricks,</hi> by stroaking her Brest, (for
that purpose first bared,) soon restored her to
such Sensibility, as that she was able to speak,
and direct him to the place whither her Pain shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which it often did with inexpressible Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
from one extreme part of her Body to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
And it was very observable, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soever
her Pain retired, that part was (as
it were) crampt, and seem'd by her Motions,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45057:24"/>
Cryings out, and Shrieks, to be affected with
intolerable Dolour; sometimes it was in her
Throat, and then it nigh choaked her, and there
ensued excessive Belchings, (as I have also often
observed in sundry Asthmatical, and Pthisical
Persons stroaked by him.) And in this case
was he fain to leave her for that time, Night
growing on, and an infinity of diseased people
pressing upon him for help.</p>

affected her in the Eyes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in her Nose, and that with such anguish,
as she seem'd oftimes ready to tear it off: Upon
the removal of her Pains, she often gave such
Shrieks, as if her Heart had been bursting in
sunder. Mr. <hi>Greataricks</hi> was also perswaded,
that this Woman was possessed with a Devil;

God might permit her to be afflicted with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

confidence, that he neither had, or would give up
her Body to be inhabited by the Devil. Her
Acquaintance testified, that she had been of an
unblameable life, and conversation: and that her
Education hath been more Liberal, then is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

in <hi>VVarwick-shire;</hi> where, amongst many others,
we met with a Gentleman of Kin to the Lady of

utterly to disbelieve the efficacy of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
hand; but within a while he was convinced
by very painfull experience; For having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to a Lady then present, that he of
long time had had a dimnesse in his left Eye
(though indeed it looked as faire as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therefore he was forced to make seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
protestations, ere he could gain any belief,
but) being once credited, he was soon advised
by the Lady to essay M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greataricks</hi> hand. He
made very dainty of it at first, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45057:25"/>
also, affirming that he would Touch none
who was not desirous he should. In fine both
(at length) overcame by the importunity of the
Ladies, submitted, the one to touch, the other
to be touched: His Eye accordingly being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
the Gentleman streight protested, that he
saw much more clearly with it then before, and
so stood by: soon after, he complained of a paine,
and heavinesse in his Head (he had before been
much troubled with a Paralyticall Humour, and
for that cause had severall successive years repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Bathe) upon a new application of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ataricks</hi>
Hand; he said his pain was now gone:
and so went aside again: soon after he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he was sick at Stomach, and seemed to
be in a very vomiturient condition; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taricks</hi>
caused him to unbutton, and slip off his
Shooes, and Stockings, and with his hand cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that illnesse of Stomach down into his Legge,
and after out at his Toes; so that he said, he
<hi>now felt nothing:</hi> Not long after he again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of a pain in his Head. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greatericks</hi>
strok't it down into his Eyes, which watered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
and the Lids were in continuall Trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and by his complaints, and gestures, they
appeared to be very full of paine: After a while
they began to mend: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Greatarick</hi> strokes
his Head again, and by so doing, brings a fresh
