            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HE who enters the Lists with the Famous Mr <hi>Iohnson</hi> (tho he hath no Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to Patronize his Book) may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect a Clear Stage and Fair Play, and cannot be deny'd to Arm himself, and fight with the same Weapons his Enemy makes use of, tho they should be Impudence and Vanity. I have been long convinc'd, that lofty, promising <hi>Titles,</hi> or prefixing the Names of Great Patrons, add nothing to the intrinsick Value of any book. Nay, I have seen the King's Arms flourish'd on a <hi>Quack</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97455:4"/>
Doctors Bill, which hath been scarcely read through before apply'd to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use. Nor am I fond of presenting these following Reflections to Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Patrons, because it looks so like Mrs. <hi>Iames,</hi> whose crasie Example my was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Adversary hath so often imitated. I am sure, had he left out his own often repeated Merits, scurrilous Reflections, and impertinent Stories, they would have been oblig'd to him; and might have read the empty, swell'd Book, with as little trouble as her Half-Sheet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Who hath not seen, or heard, A Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, noisy <hi>Bombastus,</hi> make a great figure in <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inn-Fields, speak mighty things of himself, but at the same time to amuse his gaping Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, he always provides a Zany, who is to be plaguy satyrical and witty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>is no matter on whom, or what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:97455:4"/>
so it pleases, and by that means the Powder of Post goes off the better. Be it known unto all men, that I am an English Freeman as well as Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and will assume the liberty of being as dogmatically proud and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical in my following Reflections, as he in his Notes.</p>
            <p>The different conceptions of other mens reasonings, are as moulds to Metal, the self same Ore run into the mould of an Angel, shapes an Angel, or into the mould of a Devil, represents a Devil. As for my own part, I can see nothing in the <hi>Pastoral Letter,</hi> with my Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spectacles, but what is rational, and tends to promote the publick good, by perswading an Universal comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to tbe present Government. Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> in his own, distorted, and forc'd Sense, represents it as a Vial of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif
<pb facs="tcp:97455:5"/>
pour'd forth on the Nation. Upon which account I'le examine how far his rambling Notes make good the Charge. But by the way, when our waggish Noter had luckily thought on the word, <hi>Bewitch'd,</hi> I wonder he did not think himself so, because, whilst only fighting with the Windmils of his own brain, he wildly fancies that at the same time he mauls the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Perhaps I have mix'd some sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections with my private thoughts, for which I have only this to say, <hi>Is there not Iust Cause?</hi>

            <head>REFLECTIONS UPON Mr. Johnsons NOTES ON THE Pastoral Letter.</head>
            <p>'TIS the Usual, but plausible way of some men, when they have express'd their utmost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, dipp'd their pens in the blackest Ink, just to wipe their mouths, and then write and miscall themselves Civil, and <hi>good natur'd to a fault.</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> of all men in the world might have spar'd himself that Hypocritical pains Because His Notes plainly speak his own true Character. Our Noter in his first line seems to insinuate, as if his bare touch were as fatal as the Devills, nothing follows it, but Leprosie or Death: But the Doctrine in the Pastoral Letter will live, because his Impotent efforts and weak
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97455:6"/>
Notes, have not power sufficient to destroy it. His sulphurou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> stinking Ammunition, is but like the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical <hi>Pulvis fulminans,</hi> which makes a roaring noise, but without doing the least execution But I advise you as your Friend Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> I would by no means have you take a Wyth into your hands, least, when I have reflected your Mountanous Rhodomontadoes into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but meer noisy boasting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you should employ it to A particular use not at first design'd: Besides 'tis A dangerous weapon in any mans hands, who is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppos'd to be, <hi>Non Compos Mentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who could have Imagin'd that the topping Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> the All destroying Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> should condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend so low as to have <hi>A controversy with,</hi> or to rake in the Ashes of <hi>A senseless Book, without Station, or Cardinals Horse top knots</hi> But by your favour amongst all your law, let us have no <hi>Abindon Law,</hi> don't hang the book first, and then Judge it afterward.</p>
            <p>He proceeds now to tell us, and without blushing, too, that <hi>The design of it was to make men swear to the Government at any rate, and because only the Iacobites stood out against the Oath of Allegiance, and were dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it, the Government is made Iacobite, or what they will, that these men may swear upon their own terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin to perceive our Noters cloven foot already, I mean, <hi>Ex pede Herculem,</hi> The Bishops de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ign (if we, may beleive his own words in the Pastoral Letter, page the 2d) was, to offer such motives and reasons to his Clergy, as might Answer and satisfy all scruples and objections that might arise concerning your Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which was due to the King and Queen, lest
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97455:6"/>
by their Example of <hi>Nonswearing,</hi> the minds of the people should be distracted, and so consequently alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Government. So that Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> hath either ignorantly but I rather beleive willfully mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented the plain design of the Bishop, which was to make the Government all <hi>Williamite,</hi> and that it was the duty both of Clergy and Laity to comply with it. What is nothing to the purpose, needs no answer; Neither am I at leisure, having so many pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before me to follow Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> in his <hi>wild goose chace.</hi> I don't know Dr. <hi>Sandcrofts</hi> Heirs, and the Late Bishop of <hi>Ely's</hi> Letter, is not the <hi>Pastoral Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Oracle. <hi>To bring men into this Government with their Iacobite Principles along with them, is to let so many Vipers into its bosome.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> was Expelling these Poysonous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; he was perswading their Compliance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But how could they comply without <hi>Conviction</hi>? Unless Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> would have them, though <hi>unconvinced,</hi> swear at any rate, and so be perjur'd. When Men swear, 'tis presum'd they are <hi>convinc'd</hi>; If so, then their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles are quitted, they are no longer <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> would have all Men swear to the Government; and if Men will act contrary to its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest after they have taken the Oaths, they are to be censur'd as guilty both of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Treachery.</hi> 'Tis my Opinion, that the <hi>Iews,</hi> who <hi>Crucify'd our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> were not so highly guilty as <hi>Iudas,</hi> who kiss'd, and at the same time betray'd him.</p>
            <p>I'le assure you Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> only designs to catch <hi>the good Fish in his Drag-Net,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you modestly tell us, he is resolv'd to catch them

all, good and bad, and to make them swear at any rate; to effect which, he endeavours to fright <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop,</hi> in his <hi>Pastoral Letter,</hi> page the 3<hi>d</hi> and 4<hi>th,</hi> informs his Clergy,
<q>;That by ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k which in the whole Progress of it has had so many signal Characters of a Favourable Providence: and then he adds the Advantages we have reap'd by it, and the mischievous Consequences that might ensue in case they did not take the Oaths; which were, <hi>Popish Tyranny, An</hi> Irish <hi>Conquest and Massacre, and</hi> French <hi>Barbarity and Cruelty.</hi> To which he subjoyns, A Man that adventures on so dangerous a Thing as refusing the Oaths, had need be very sure that he is in all this matter in the Right, Otherwise he runs a Risque of sighting against God, if he should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be in the wrong.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter the <hi>Bishop</hi> makes use of the Topick of Divine Providence to perswade their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; and the great Miseries we might bring on our own Heads, after so great a Deliverance, if there were not an Unanimous agreement amongst us. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel,</hi> I presume, must be acknowledg'd as Wise a

You may at your leisure read the whole Transaction in the 5<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi>; but because 'tis pertinent to my present purpose, I will recite <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s Advice in the great Council, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the 38<hi>th</hi> and 39<hi>th</hi> Verses; <hi>And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this Counsel, or this Work, be of Men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</hi> So that as that great Revolution in Religion, and the New Face of Affairs in the World, was brought to pass by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Hand of God, and could not be resisted: So also there are many Instances to be given of the Visible Providences which attended and procur'd our happy Settlement, and preserv'd that Faith of Christ which we profess in its P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to the following part of the Paragraph:
<q>The ;bringing the State of the Question so low, may seem at first View not to be of so much Advantage to Their Majesties Title; but since I intend to carry the matter further before I leave it, I hope it may be no incongruous method to begin at that which will take in the greatest Numbers, since there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in this, that they are actually in possession of the Throne; that they protect us; and that we by living under their Protection, and enjoying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, are therefore bound to make some returns for it.</q>

The Bishop hath prov'd their Legal Right, as I have already observ'd: But though they will not own them to have any Right, yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop urges them to pay their Allegiance to the King in Possession, because they are protected by him; and in that they have virtually given their Consent by their Representatives, that he should be King: Besides, their Allegiance is due, and must be paid to the King in Possession, because the Late King not being here, it is impossible to be paid to him. Protection supposes, and implies a Right to Allegiance; for which Reason the Bishop argues in his next Paragraph:
<q>A Man may ;Lawfully promise to do every thing that he may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do: So that if it is Lawful to Obey the King, it is also Lawful to promise to do it. And therefore since it does not appear that any persons do doubt of the Lawfulness of Obeying, it cannot without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colour of Reason be said to be Unlawful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it: And if it is Lawful to promise it, it is also Lawful to Swear it; for an Oath being only the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Confirmation of a Promise, we may Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Swear Every Thing that we may Lawfully Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</q>

               <hi>For I will demonstrate on the contrary, that it does appear. That all that ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se the Oath, and Ten Thousand Men more, do doubt of the Lawfulness of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying.</hi> But by the way, Mr <hi>Iohnson,</hi> to call Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men Knaves at once, is something too reflecting; for as sharp sighted as you are, I am sure you cannot see their Hearts. Now follows our Demonstration: <hi>If the Non Swearers could give thiir Assent and Consent to Obey, they would certainly give their Oath likewise, and all that is within them. But by their doubting the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of an Oath of Obedience, they plainly doubt the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of simple Obedience, and not the Lawfulness of an Oath; for unless they be</hi> Quakers <hi>they cannot do that.</hi> To which I answer; 'Tis Matter of Fact, That the Non-Swearers do actually <hi>obey,</hi> and only doubt the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of taking the Oaths. They do Visibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce, and do not openly oppose the Government. They pay their Taxes according as the Law directs; nor do they think it a sin so to do. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Bishop argues, they may promise to do so; and tharefore if promise, then swear; and so let their Hearts be where they will, the Law is against them; their Persons and Estates are protected by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they are wiser than to go and starve at St. <hi>Germans.</hi> I am of Opinion, if Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> is over and above Officious on this Point; and (with Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Submission) I presume, if they, or any others, pay their Taxes Honestly, the King will not be concern'd on what <hi>Principles</hi> they pay their Obedience; and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Taxes are as a Mark on those who disown him as King, that both He and We may be the better aware of them.</p>
            <p>Because Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> hath such <hi>ill Fortune</hi> in Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, I'le try mine; and endeavour from the two Pages following, <hi>Sillogistically</hi> to demonstrate him, neither better nor worse than a Beast. He hath Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to undemonstrate it in his <hi>Second Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> did not voluntarily submit to his hard Usage, then his Submission was an involuntary Act. But Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> did not voluntarily submit to his hard Usage, <hi>Ergo</hi>; this is evident from his 16<hi>th</hi> Page, where he tells us, that <hi>he sent the Marshal word, that he had rather be shot than so used.</hi> Now, <hi>Secundum te,</hi> page the 15<hi>th.</hi> All the World knows, that an involuntary Act is not an Humane Act; and so consequently must be the Act of a Beast. I know no way he hath to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this Argument, unless he owns himself a Fish or a Fowl. If he says he is Fish, I'le call him <hi>the great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi>; if a Fowl, an <hi>Owl</hi>; because being all Face and Feathers, he nearly resembles the Bird of <hi>Pallas.</hi> But I verily believe, by its description, he is that very Ass he mentions in his 34<hi>th page,</hi> who <hi>looks like Wisdom and Gravity, and is not.</hi> I always thought <hi>Vnvoluntary Acts,</hi> as well as <hi>Voluntary,</hi> were <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>the Acts of Men</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> tells us in his 48<hi>th page; If it were not lawful to advance Paradoxes and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to common Sense, how could Men shew their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

            <p>If the Lord <hi>Southampton</hi> was satisfied with Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy at that time, he might have taken an Oath to it, especially if it had been Enacted into a Law so to do, A Law would have concluded his Opinion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd his Compliance, till it had been repeal'd; and had he liv'd till now Episcopacy would have been the same thing as then: The Virtual Consent of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Person is given when a Law is made; and therefore I must obey when what is commanded is not undeniably a sin; and my Disobedience is a sin, when the matter is <hi>lawful.</hi> So that <hi>rebus sic stantibus,</hi> a man may <hi>lawfully</hi> promise to do what he may <hi>lawfully</hi> do; and if there be an evident and publick Alteration in the Subject Matter, the Obligation ceases: Neither do I apprehend any Reason from the Law of God or Men, but that every Man may swear <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et under our present Government (though they would have had things otherwise setled) because a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97455:13"/>
is not to be oppos'd against the general Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Body of the Nation; And to me it appears Imprudence and Mockery, that after the <hi>Non-Iuring, Passive Men</hi> have beat King <hi>Iames</hi> out of the Kingdom (as far as their Principles allow'd) with their Primitive Weapons, Prayers and Tears; That is, that now we are deliver'd by Providence, and Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, from Popery and Slavery, that the very same men (some of which put their Helping Hand too) are pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it back again; for the <hi>French</hi> Court is the worst in the World to instruct Princes to govern according to Laws; and I don't hear Father <hi>Peters</hi> is turn'd Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
            <p>Now to the part of the Bishops Paragraph, which follows in these words.
<q>;And as it appears that there lies no just Objection to the swearing Obedience, so there arises none from the word <hi>Allegiance</hi>; for that being in its Original Signification, nothing but the Service that a Vassal owed to the Chief Lord of the Fee. If the King, is owned in Fact to be our King, then he is the Lord of the Fee, and by Consequence <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to him; Allegiance being also now in our present Acceptation, <hi>An Obedience according to Law,</hi> that is to say, not a Blind nor absolute Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but such an Obedience as is defined and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the <hi>Law,</hi> then the Scruple that arises out of the Word <hi>Allegiance</hi> vanishes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this short Remnant,</hi> our Noter tells us, <hi>there are abundance of things liable to Exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, <hi>That he out-runs the Constable, in taking for granted an Oath of Obedience, where he hath neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97455:13"/>
bare Obedience, much less a promise of Obedience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to be due; for which I refer my self to what passed on the former part of the Paragraph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was no need of a Promise of bare Obedience, because they did actually Obey; and therefore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop argues, as I before observ'd; That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they might Promise to Obey; and if Promise, then Swear. The Bishop always own'd them to have the Point of Right, and how they came by it, in his 21<hi>st page</hi>; which I have already taken notice of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He here gives us a Notion of Allegiance by the halves; for he says,</hi>
               <q>;It is in its Original signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nothing but the Service due to the Chief Lord of the Fee.</q>
You only give the Bishop's Sense by halves; therefore I will recite his own Words contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at large in the 24<hi>th</hi> and 25<hi>th pages</hi> of <hi>the Pastoral Letter.</hi>
               <q>;The very Term of Allegiance rises out of the Feudal Law; by which the Chief Lord of a Fee, when he made any Grants to his Vassals, took them bound in co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sideration of these Grants, to adhere to him, to defend his Person, and to assist him in his Wars; but all this being done by the Vassals, in consideration of the Fee that was granted, an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contract is plainly implied in it; so that if the Lord of the Fee should go to take away the Fee it self, or to change the Nature of the Subjection in which the Vassals were put by the first Grant, then the Oath which was grounded on it could not be suppos'd to bind them any longer.</q>
So that the Bishop supposes a Reciprocal Duty between the Lord of the Fee and the Vassal, because if the former violated his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97455:14"/>
Contract, the Obligation of Allegiance ceased.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He makes the King the Lord of the Fee; to entitle him to our Oath of Allegiance. It is nothing so, for the people of England do not hold of the King, what Holy Church does I know not; they may be his Vassals for ought I know; I am sure I am none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis fixing your own private Construction upon the Bishop's Words, when you write as if he should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the King to be Landlord of all <hi>England,</hi> or as if <hi>Holy Church</hi> (as you are pleas'd to express your self) own'd or paid any Allegiance different from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Bishop tells us plainly,
<q>;Our Allegiance in general is an Obedience according to Law; which he explains; Not a Blind nor Absolute Obedience, but such an Obedience as is defined and limited by the Law.</q>
Which imports, that we owe no other Obedience, and therefore if we are commanded to do or suffer any thing that is contrary to Law, the Obligation of our Obedience ceases, and we may refuse it. And here I will insert what the Bishop affirms to this purpose, in <hi>his Measures of Submission to the Supream Authority</hi>; which may serve to clear him from the unjust ond ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Imputations of ignorant as well as prejudicial Men. <hi>Pag.</hi> 9.
<q>;There is nothing more evident than that <hi>England</hi> is a Free Nation, that has its Liberties and Properties reserv'd to it, by many positive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Laws: If then we have a Right to our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we must likewise be suppos'd to have a Right to preserve it: for those Rights are by the Law secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against the Invasions of the Prerogative; and by consequence we must have a Right to preserve them against those Invasions. It is also evidently declared
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97455:14"/>
by our Law, that all Orders and Warrants that are issued out in Opposition to them, are null of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and by consequence, any that pretend to have Commissions from the King, for those Ends, are to be considered as if they had none at all, since those Commissions being void of themselves, are indeed no Commissions in the construction of the Law; and therefore they who act in vertue of them, are still to be consider'd as private persons, who come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and disturb us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>He makes a King in Fact to be Lord of the Fee. We have been too long haunted with this word</hi> Fact, <hi>and therefore I will try to lay the Goblin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> hath nothing to do with your <hi>Goblin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Fact;</hi> He always own'd the <hi>King's Right to the Crown to be Legal, and by the Virtual Consent of the People.</hi> If the <hi>Bishop</hi> chances to write any word, though in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, it relates to other persons, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weighing, or considering the intention or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sign of it, He runs away with his whymsical mis-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter, and from his own mistake makes and forces the Bishop to say or write any thing to his squinting purpose. The <hi>Bishop</hi> applies himself to the <hi>Non jurors,</hi> because, as they could not deny him to be <hi>King in Fact</hi>; that is, to be in possession of the <hi>Throne,</hi> so they ought to swear Allegiance to him in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Protection he gave them, and that they liv'd under his Government, whether they did or would own him <hi>Rightful King</hi> or not. Your Supposition of <hi>Forcible Entry,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollows, is altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as to the <hi>Bishop</hi>; because he hath told you over and over, that the King hath a Right to possess the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97455:15"/>
Throne, by that Legal Possession of it, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>He would have people swear an Obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, in Opposition to a Blind and Absolute Obedience, though they are still to retain their Passive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which is certainly Blind and Absolute Obedience, or else there is no such thing in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this place more particularly, I appeal to Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s greatest A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mirers (if they have but common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for Truth) whether any <hi>Iesuit</hi> could have perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Intention, or Sense of any Author more <hi>Villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously</hi> and <hi>Bare-fac'd</hi> than he hath the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s in this Note: Is here the least shadow of an Insinuation of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> when our <hi>Allegiance</hi> is declar'd <hi>an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience only according to Law</hi>; that is to say, <hi>Not a Blind or Absolute Obedience; but such an Obedience as is defined and limited by the Laws.</hi> Now what could have been express'd more opposite to <hi>Passive Obedience?</hi> Nor can they, or any others, retain their <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> if they keep to the Laws, because <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is a tame submission to those <hi>illegal</hi> Commands of a King that are evidently against, and tend to destroy all Law. No Man hath asserted the Laws, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty with more Reason, nor more Nervously enforc'd than the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> (which appears from the Quotation I made out of his <hi>Measures of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Supream Authority.</hi>) And 'tis a base Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to say, <hi>That he would have any body retain the mistaken Notion of Passive Obedience, or shews how it should not hurt them</hi>; when at the same time he so plainly and positively declares the contrary. But 'tis enough for Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> to make the Bishop <hi>enter a</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97455:15"/>
               <hi>for, or to be an high Asserter of the mistaken Doctrine,</hi> when he only mentions the word <hi>Obedience,</hi> as in this place; and much more when he repeats the Highest Principles of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> in the 20<hi>th page.</hi> Tho at the same time 'tis impossible, if a Man be but honest, or hath but a mean Judgment to apprehend them any bodies (as the <hi>Bishop</hi> supposes) but <hi>the Non-Iurors</hi>; which will evidently appear, if you will take the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read part of the 19<hi>th</hi> and 20<hi>th pages</hi> of <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Lettter</hi>; where 'tis as apparent also that the <hi>Bishop</hi> argues from other Principles, <hi>That the Non-Iurors ought to swear to the present Government, even though they should retain, or according to their Highest Principles of Passive Obedience.</hi> I will only repeat a Line or two in the beginning of that Paragraph, to inform you of the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s design.
<q>;But I will in the last place carry this matter further, to justify the present Settlement, as a thing Right and Lawful in it self.</q>
Should I have said, that I was <hi>the Fairest Adversary in the World,</hi> and should have had so many plain Instances of <hi>misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> plainly prov'd upon me, I should have expected but little Credit to be given to me: But I'le warrant you, <hi>Face and Feathers</hi> will stare it out. And now I'le leave our Noter to roul and tumble in his own wit, and divert himself with his story of the <hi>Welchman,</hi> his <hi>Bow-string</hi> and <hi>Black-Box,</hi> his <hi>Thebaean Legion,</hi> his <hi>Mine-take-it</hi> and <hi>Your-take-it.</hi> And because I will be sure to win his Favour, I do own that I have, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had as great an Aversion to <hi>the mistaken Notion of Passive Obedience,</hi> as he hath to <hi>Maxims.</hi> But by the way, he must let me be convinc'd by my own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reasons, though he will not let <hi>the Bishop</hi> by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97455:16"/>
               <hi>his</hi>; To which I will only premise, That 'tis the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind to be easier perswaded and convinc'd by modest and plain Reasonings from their Errors and Mistakes, than banter'd and hector'd; and that 'tis more Christian and Generous rather to lend an helping Hand to a Blind Man, who hath mistaken his way, than rail at his Imperfection. I wonder how this <hi>Doctrine of the Cross</hi> came to be call'd <hi>the Doctrine of Passive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>; and I much more wonder how it should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain so much Credit in a Country where the Christian Religion is the Establish'd Religion, and the Laws are the Rule and Standard of all Obedience. I think moreover, that Passive Obedience is as great a Bull in Terms as <hi>Roman Catholick, Vniversal Particular</hi>; for all Obedience is Active, and to Obey is to do the thing commanded; and <hi>Passive Non-obedience</hi> would have sounded much better, because the Design of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <hi>to suffer</hi> rather than <hi>obey,</hi> or when <hi>I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi>; and <hi>the Primitive Christians</hi> were under an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to <hi>suffer even to Death rather than deny the Faith they had confess'd, and so become Apostates.</hi> What I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be the proper and true meaning of the Doctrine, is, <hi>to suffer rather than Apostatize.</hi> But to reflect on the practice of it amongst us. As where the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s <hi>Horse once sets his Foot, no Grass grows,</hi> so where this mistaken Notion of the Doctrine takes place, all Laws must be trod under Foot: The <hi>Doctrine of the Cross</hi> was, and is a true Doctrine; but not calculated for the Year 1688. in a Christian legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly establish'd Government, and is altogether impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable amongst us; because if any man, upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count soever, or from whomsoever commission'd, shall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97455:16"/>
attempt to take away my Goods or Life by force, or in an illegal manner, I may lawfully resist them, by the Laws of God, Nature, and my Country; Otherwise that which should be my Rule, would be my Snare; So that it can be no sin in me to do what the Laws of God, Nature, and my Country direct. Were I in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> should send an Express to acquaint me, <hi>That I must either turn</hi> Mahometan, <hi>or kiss the Bow string</hi>; 'tis my Duty, and I hope God would enable me rather to suffer Death than deny and renounce the true Faith of Christ. But there is a great difference between a <hi>Turkish, Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and an <hi>English,</hi> Limited, and Christian Government. Theory and Practice are two different things, and the latter many times discovers the Absurdity of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and I am sure, though I should have preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d my Lungs out in the Neighbourhood where I liv'd, not one thick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus having stated this Point, I think it will not be improper in this place to offer my <hi>Sentiments</hi> to those who do not take the Oaths, in relation to <hi>the Oath of Allegiance</hi> which they have already taken, and by which they account themselves bound up. 'Tis allow'd, that a Law is to be obey'd, and an Oath to be taken according to the sense and intention of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. In the late times there was a distinction between the Kings Person and his Authority, upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97455:17"/>
which account there was an Oath fram'd to obviate and take away any such Mischeivous Distinction, And tho it extended to secure the King as to his person and legal rights, yet it was never design'd as a foundation of an arbitrary and irresistible power, or that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might not resist any violent and illegal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and more especially when the whole rights of the Community were struct at, and a subversion of the Government undeniably put in practice. 'Tis Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to invade the Kings right, but not so, to preserve and defend what the Laws and constitution of the Government have given me a just and legal right and title to. There is a latitude imply'd in this Oath, Unless when we take it we swear to be slaves from that day forward, for if taken in a strict sense it cancels all our natural and positive rights and Laws at once; we are bound hand and foot, and only left at the mercy of an Absolute King, and contrary to all reason and justice, the Impostumated and unnaturall Power and will of one, is superiour and preferrable to the good and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the rest of the body Politick: the Original Government was by the consent of the people, as also the form and kind, and the good and welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is the undoubted end of it. <hi>Salus Populi, Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Lex.</hi> To which purpose I will only add the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judicious and Ingenious Author of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Trimmer page the 7th; When all is said, There is a natural reason of State, an undefinable thing, grounded upon the Common good of Mankind, which is Immortal and in all Changes and <hi>Revolutions,</hi> still preserveth its Original Right of saving a <hi>Nation,</hi> when a Letter of the Law perhaps <hi>would destroy</hi> it;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97455:17"/>
And by whatsoever means it moveth, carrieth a power with it that admitteth of no Opposition, being suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Nature, which inspireth an immediate consent at so critical times into every individual Member, to that which vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibly tendeth to the preservation of the whole: And this being so, a wise Prince, instead of controverting the Right of this Reason of State, will by all means endeavour it may be on his side, and then he will be secure.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Noter, who would have done but honestly to have clear'd the Bishop from this false Imputation, by informing the World with what he says in his 26<hi>th page</hi> of <hi>the Pastoral Letter</hi>; where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes those Men to have been very much mistaken, who have taken up an Opinion,
<q>;That there is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable and Supream Power lodged with our Kings by a Divine Deputation, which exempts them from being call'd to an account, or resisted by their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let their Violations of the Law be never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or so Eminent.</q>
And in the next page, he proves it from the Original Articles granted by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> which he there repeats with this Inference<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

This is an Evidence, that by the Ancient Constitution of <hi>England,</hi> there was no such irresistable Authority in our Kings. as some have been inclin'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o imagine.</q>
To which the <hi>Bishop</hi> subjoyns this wise and seasonable Caution:
<q>;But after all, if there are any who are so possest with their pre-conceited Opinions, that they either cannot lay them down, or will not confess that they have been mistaken in their <hi>Notions of Politicks,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97455:18"/>
these ought to be very sure that they are in the right, before they will adventure, as far as in them lies, to undermine and shake the present Constitution.</q>
To what base shifts is impotent Malice put, to compass <hi>its wicked,</hi> but <hi>unsuccessful designs</hi>?</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s 4<hi>th Paragraph</hi>:
<q>;This is either true, or those who live upon a Continent, and that are subject to the Conquests and Inva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon which our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter observes; <hi>This is shifting the Scene; for he knows that we are a World by our selves, and have nothing to do with the Continent. It is a Land-loping Argument, and till we are in the Condition of the</hi> Flanderkin <hi>Towns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For we are not deserted or forsaken, nor conquer`d or subdu'd, nor under the power of an Enemy, nor treated as Enemies, nor cudgelled into an Oath of Allegiance, nor ever will be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Noter</hi> in this place is <hi>cudgelling and conquering his own shadow</hi>; for the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath not affirm`d that we are so barbarously us'd, but knows that we are in profound peace. What is Reason in <hi>England,</hi> is Reason in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and all the world over; The <hi>Bishop</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comparing and stating the Point and Case of the <hi>Non jurors</hi> with that of the Subjects on the <hi>Continent,</hi> who are often subject to Conquests.

to swear Allegiance</hi>; and 'tis matter of Fact, that the <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derkins</hi> do swear Allegiance to the <hi>French</hi> when he is Master of a Town, and so in like manner to the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; so that he infers the <hi>lawfulness and reasonableness of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and offers it as a <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument to the Non-jurors</hi>; and <hi>the inevitable destruction of Cities and Societies if they did not</hi>; and so by consequence, that <hi>Allegiance</hi> is a <hi>diffeasable thing,</hi> and may be transferr'd when there is <hi>a pressing necessity for it.</hi> If I should say, Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> was wonderfully subject to <hi>error and mistakes,</hi> and that he was no more <hi>Infallible in his Notes</hi> than the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> we should have him call it <hi>a Land-loping Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his <hi>Second Part</hi>; but I am sure what he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the <hi>Bishop's Argument,</hi> by way of Comparison is <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>Outlandish</hi> to the purpose.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>weak Noter</hi> proceeds in his mistake, and tells us; <hi>If I were hired to write against the Oath of Allegiance, I would use such Arguments as this is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I verily believe you would, because I find by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience you are very apt to write what is altogether impertinent to the matter in hand, and in most places your Notes are quite contrary to the Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are we in the Case of those that are slaves under the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>and slaves under the</hi> French, <hi>that often change their Master, but never their Condition, that are Prize, and re-taken, and Prize still? Let him answer me that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will answer for <hi>the Bishop:</hi> No, we are not. Nor hath the <hi>Bishop</hi> mention'd one word of <hi>Slavery,</hi> or compar`d our condition with theirs. We have indeed <hi>chang'd our Master</hi> some time since, and I think much better'd our condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in all his Travels, could he find no Copy for us to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97455:19"/>
write after, nor no body to match us with, but a conquer'd People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> hath unluckily made use of the word <hi>Conquest and Invasions</hi>; tho apply'd to the <hi>Continent,</hi> and our <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> will have it, <hi>that the Bishop is matching our Condition with a conquer'd people.</hi> But I think any man who hath a Grain of Sense, must own the <hi>Bishop</hi> intended nothing like it; but only as he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently tryeth to prove <hi>the Absurdity and Falseness</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diffeasable Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> tells us; <hi>I love to talk with Maxims as I do the sight of an Ass, who looks like Gravity and Wisdom, and is not.</hi> I know the Reason of it, a Jest upon an Ass is thrown away, and <hi>Maxims</hi> are such wise and grave things, that they are above the short reach of your Understanding and then you lose an Opportunity of shewing your dogrel parts. But to the other part of our Paragraph.
<q>;For if subjects owe their natural Prince such an Obstinate Allegiance that neither desertion nor conquest can dissolve it, then in what a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition must they be, when they fall under the power of their Enemy, that never thinks himself secure of them, but treats them still as Enemies till they swear Allegiance to him; upon which observe our Noter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I can tell him</hi> (And that's all, I know you can't prove it, and I am sure the Bishop is not apt to beleive every thing you say) <hi>that Allegiance is so Obstinate a thing that neither desertion nor conquest, nor any thing in the World but what is intrinsical to it (that is breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or consent of both parties) dissolve it: It is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty, and Heaven and Earth may pass away before Allegiance can pass away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97455:19"/>Sincerely, Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> I thought you had been a better Lawyer than to tell us that Allegiance is a Moral duty, I always apprehended it to be a Legal Duty, and Having a <hi>Gude Memory</hi> I remember you tell us in the 21<hi>st</hi> page, <hi>that besides the service due to the Lord of Fee, as it was the Duty that the Liege Lord owed to his Liegeman.</hi> I must confess I never met with <hi>Lord in Fee, Liege Lord,</hi> or <hi>Liegeman</hi> in any book of Morality, or that treated on Moral Duties, that I ever read. But Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> is <hi>a great Scholard,</hi> and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with old musty Books which I never saw.</p>
            <p>Now, for want of judgment you are prophaning Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with your <hi>Heaven and Earth may pass away before Allegiance can pass away.</hi> I suppose I shall have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient opportunity to prove, <hi>that Allegiance may pass away,</hi> in this page, or the next; therefore I'le defer it.</p>

The <hi>Bishop</hi> owns all this that I have answer'd, in his <hi>Pastoral Letter,</hi> and was one of those who actually came with the Prince to rescue us, and to re-settle and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our Government according to its Legal Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.

            <p>
               <hi>Suppose a King and his people (who are all of a piece, till either of them break Faith with the other) are both run down, and fall under the Chance of War. It is no matter which of them is in the Conquerors hands, because they are all as one. If their King have that hard fate, they must either rescue or ransom him, tho their private Money and their Church Plate go for it. And if any of his people fall into the Enemies hands, he must do the same by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perceive already we are like to have a rare <hi>Quixo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Conquest.</hi> Our <hi>Noter</hi> supposes a King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (of one iudividual and indivisible piece) to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd.

            </p>
            <p>But to proceed to the last part of this Paragraph:
<q>;Now all the true Maxims of Government being such, that they must tend to the preservation, and not to the ruin of Mankind, it is certain that all those are false which tend to the inevitable destruction of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Societies; and therefore this of an indiffea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Allegiance must be reckon'd among these, since the fatal Consequences that must attend upon it are evident; and this is the Opinion in which all who have considered this matter, either as Lawyers or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists do agree.</q>

               <hi>I have ever had a great aversion to all Maxims of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, true or false; for there always lies lurking this Deceit in Generals and niversals, that tho they be true for the most part, yet they are conceiv'd in Terms large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

Now to speak with the Freedom of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Englishman,</hi> I am glad that I am engag'd with <hi>Mr. Iohnson,</hi> and not <hi>Your Grace</hi>; because, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your own envious Remarks on Episcopacy and Bishops, <hi>tam vivos quam mortuos,</hi> dead and alive, I am apt to conj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our <hi>Noter</hi> hath spar'd the Bishop's Maxim at present, and hath brought a Volunteer to the stake. <hi>Necessity has no Law, is another Maxim, but it is pity there is no Law for it; for it has always been on the Court side, and never on the Countries, tho one would think the Maxim lay equally betwixt them both; but the truth of it is, they either are, or should be all one.</hi>

I warrant, we have some Old Story of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first's time, or of some dead Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to be hook'd in, which signifies nothing to the Maxim, which all Mankind have a Right and Title to. A pretended Necessity is no Necessity; and a Real Necessity supercedes, and is superiour to all Law. The Court and Country agree very well together, and may equally make use of the Maxim. So that the Subject of these Two Pages, as of divers others, are but as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to stuff out our Noter's bulky book.</p>
            <p>And now I leave it to the Judgment of the imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and unprejudic'd Reader, whether Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> hath

Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s angry and peevish, because all Men did not see with his Eyes, and judge by his Sentiments; when at the same time they know him to be subject to Error and Passions as well as others; and they who are imperious and supercilious in their Positions and Dictates, must expect to meet with Opposition and Reflections. No meer Man was ever in the Right in every thing he did or said, unless we will be so Phantastically credulous as to believe him to be possess'd with an Almighty At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Infallibility; yet humane Nature apologizes for all that's mistaken through weakness and misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, without Perversity and Obstinacy.

the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> That <hi>England</hi> was a great Beast, and could not be destroy'd but by its self; and therefore the <hi>French</hi> King, being no Fool in Politicks, thinks he can do nothing so much to his own advantage and our prejudice, as to divide us, and hath sent over these following Instructions with his <hi>Lewidores</hi> to his Emissaries here amongst us, and all under the disguise of Pity and Compassion for the miserable condition we labour under.</p>
            <p>The first thing they buz in your Ears is, <hi>The Church, the Church; Oh the Church!</hi> Now I would know of any man, in what danger the Church is at this time, when it has the same Laws to support it, the King and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But we have some amongst us so wise, as to think the way to rescue the Church out of its contriv'd danger, is to bring Father <hi>Peters</hi> back with <hi>French</hi> Dragoons, to be Shepherds to take care of our <hi>English</hi> Flocks, which is the true meaning of their conceal`d design.</p>

That Indiffeasible Allegiance is a false Maxim, because it tends to the destruction of Mankind; For when a King hath Abdicated, 'tis impossible for me to pay Allegiance to him; and 'tis an undeniable Maxim, <hi>Nemo obligatur ad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilia</hi>; So that where the Duty cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, the Obligation necessarily ceases.</p>
