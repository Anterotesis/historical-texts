         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>SODOME,</hi> and <hi>GOMORRA,</hi> nor haue felowship with those rotten woundes, and stinking sores, that make the blaspheming of Gods holy name their honoure, yet they should be drowned in wicked doctrine, that by some meanes their saluation might be hindred. This estate of man; so muche the more to be lamented, how much the lesse it is regarded, would make a Christian minister to muse muche, and oftentimes, howe he might be a frutefull labourer in Gods vineyarde. For sith the children of wrathe doe not cease to walke disobediently, and with al care, and studie, some in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of euill life, some in profession of vngodly doctrine doe allure and entice other to walke with them in their open, and wide iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of euerlasting wretchednesse: how shall not the children of light, according as euery one hath receiued giftes, so apply their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure, that godlinesse, and good religion might call againe the lost children vnto the narow way of euerlasting happinesse? The latter dayes are come, and impietie dothe abound, iniquitie hath so spredde hir selfe, that she is plentifull bothe in worde and deede, and that, not in secrecie only, and in priuate assemblies, but in the face of the worlde, and in open wryting, while some preferre the present state before eternall life: other delite more in dreames, than in the worde of God. It behoueth therefore euery true christian in all places to rebuke sinne, to set forthe Gods glory in open mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and to maintaine his worde before the enimie, knowing that his rewarde is the saluation of his owne soule, and his place is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the kingdome of God his father. From this duety, neither King, nor Queene, Duke, nor Earle, honourable nor other, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, but euery one as he is higher in dignitie, so his accompt is the greater in the day of iudgement. It helpeth not the lay man to say he is no minister. Where the cause is Gods, we are all a chosen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and a royall priesthode, an holy nation, and a peculiar people to shew forth his vertue, that hath called vs out of darknesse into his maruellous light. If we will not walke in this light, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in darkenesse, and in the shadow of death. If we will not shew forthe his vertue, we are not his chosen generation, nor his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people. If we haue not his name wrytten in our foreheade, we
<pb facs="tcp:8597:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall not stand among the electe with the Lambe in Mount Syon. If we haue not the pleasant smel of life vnto life, we haue not Gods gosple engrafted in vs. As many, as be Christians, haue giuen their faith vnto Christ in their baptisme, vnder the witnesse of a great many. They haue forsaken the flesh, the world and the deuil. If they wil now be at league with the sinner, and at agrement with the euill doer, they haue broken their first promise, and they are founde vnfaithfull. And for their faith thus violate, giuen vnto the immortall God, God againe will breake with them his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt of mercie, if in time they repent not. This made me, right worshipfull sir, according to the talent, which God hath giuen me, so in these euill dayes to apply my laboure, not doubting, but that little light, with which he hath endued me by his free mercy, may shine through the cloudes, and mistes of errour, which the prince of this darknesse hath blowne abroade. God turne their hearts, that builde vpon his euill foundations, and God encrease their number, that be setters vp of vertue, and zealous in the house of the Lord. And of this number bicause God hath made you one, of good will desirous, and of authority able to defend the profession of a christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, I could not but chuse your worship, vnder whose name my little labor should appeare, both for a testimonie vnto all men, that you are one, in whome your countrey doth reioyce, and a prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto other, that by your example they might learn to liue. Ther be diuers that loue the worde of God, and in common talke make a glorious profession, but the world wil not let them go vprightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of the gosple. There be other, whose conuersation is not amisse, and in ciuil behauior giue good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but they be so drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in error, that their estate is very lamentable: they be the little flock, and few in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that do ioyne vertue and good religion togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is hard, and laborous to fleshe, and bloud, and therfore we turne vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. The way is narow, wher they are both coupled, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few do finde it. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the princes priuie cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber vnto the pore cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they haue rare dwelling.

good learning and wisdome are abused to al deceit and craftinesse. Simplicitie, and plainenesse is a cloke of many subtile cogitations. Neede, and pouertie are common dwelling places of muche dissolute life. Truthe is well nigh forsaken, and faith is almost perished from the face of the earth. But <hi>Macte ista virtute tua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet let your worship reioyce in Gods mercies, for not withstanding these daungerous rockes, yet you are passed in to narrow way, and the Lorde God be praised, who shall encrease the number, you haue some companye. There be men of great honoure, and estimation, yet louers of Gods truthe, and voide of all courtly wickednesse. Would God their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were registred in Ceder trees, and they had golden pictures in the Citie <hi>OLYMPIA<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that they might be spectacles to all noble po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie. God hath sure giuen them double happinesse. Their liues shall ende here in honoure, and then it pleaseth their father to giue vnto them his kingdome. There are other great gouernours of this common wealth, beautifull, and comely members of Christes body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which make not policie their religion, nor blasphemie Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, where mannes lawe doth not establishe it. They haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the good parte, which shall not be taken from them. God shall make their dwelling places sure, when the aduersarie shall be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe out of his seat.

They shall receiue an hundred folde in this life, and when they haue run their course, they shall haue the crowne of glory. And as in the time of <hi>ELIAS,</hi> when the Prophet thought that all the children of Israel had forsaken Gods couenaunt, broken downe his altares, and slaine his Prophets with the sworde, yet God made answere, I haue reserued vnto me 7000. men, which haue not bowed their knee to <hi>DAAL:</hi> euen so at this present time there is a remnant through the election of grace, that haue not their inwarde thoughts spotted with papistrie, nor their outwarde life with especiall crimes. With these and other, bicause your worship doth walke togither in the straight path of true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, God hath giuen vnto you this fruit of your aucthoritie, to
<pb facs="tcp:8597:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be beloued among them where you dwell, and this comfort of your conscience, that by your example they learne to know God. Nowe what remaineth, but that you pray vnto God, that he which hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I coulde not be ignoraunt of the common prouerb, which I had heard so often, that <hi>fair words do make fooles faine,</hi> and I sawe againe, the subtile kinde of wryting, the sugred words, and entising speaches, which the enimie did vse to call away the simple vnto their destruction. These euils, the more perillous they were, so I thought it appertained vnto all good men, by what meanes possible to seke the spedier reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And therefore in the great businesse, which that good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had in hande, whose happy Sermon did first so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the enimie, I thought it some parte of my duetie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the gift that God had giuen me, so to make aunswere vnto the subtile aduersarie, and helpe to confirme in Gods truthe suche our simple brethren, as were falling away. Vpon

this occasion I first toke vpon me to meddle with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioinder. And when in reading it, I founde the whole nothing worthy answer, I did chuse only so farre to touche it, as I might bothe make a sufficient discharge of all suche blame, as was laid vpon maister Iuel, and shewe forthe an open, and vndoubted proofe of the residue of maister Hardings labour. Then I toke vpon me the aunswer of his long Epistle, written to M. Iuell, wherein he spareth nothing, saue only truthe, to allure his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the defence of those .225. vntruthes, whereby he would discredite Gods true religion. By this meanes, I did trust, that some would quench their longing thirst, to drinke of that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cuppe, full of poison, and spirituall whoredomes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the whole grounde of their religion, to be nothing else but quarels, and wranglings, would at last runne forthe of their vngodly synagoges, and most frowarde assemblies. This labor I had finished more than .xij. monthes since, with so little dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that it made wiser men to consider better of it, whose wisdome was also a longer stay vnto me, least either my true meaning might run in blame for want of consideration, or my vnripe writing, might giue occasion to the enimie of triumph. But afterwarde remembring the good councell of <hi>Plutarche,</hi>

               </gap>. So I, after some continuaunce of time, read ouer againe mine owne doing, in which as I could haue wished something altered, if I had sought the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learning, so I sawe nothing but truthe maintained, and that in suche sort, as maister Harding might not wel contemne it. Then knowing assuredly, that bothe the defence of truthe might edifie the learned, and the manner of my wryting mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster grace vnto the godly Reader, I would no longer suppresse that, which being set abroade, might be fruitful. And vpon this aduise I deliuered it vnto the Printer: but after perusing it, I espied in the Printing many faultes, which the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, will not lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. Only for my discharge I thought good in this Epistle to admonishe thee of some, that by them thou mightest knowe whome to blame for the rest. In the .38. leafe

It is now no mastery, sith we know God, to know him, that lifteth vp himself against God, sith we know Christ to know Antichrist, sith we know Peter, to know Peters forged successoure. And for as much as to this issue al our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie is come, that what right, or authoritie so euer the Pope chalengeth, he maketh his whole claime from Peter, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists

themselues will defende him no further, but so farre as he succedeth Peter, I will speake a little of Peters bishoprike of Rome, so farre as the scriptures shall be my warrant. Consider thou of it, good christian Reader, that shall be said, and if thou see, that all the glorying of Peters being at Rome, is but a fasing out of an impudent he, then iudge what is their other religion. First, here I must forwarne thee, that as a lie can not long agree with it selfe, so in all this matter thou shalt hardly finde in all pointes two popishe chronicles agree togither. So that what so euer I wryte, as touching the exacte computation of yeres, there must needes be many against me. Therefore in that I will not striue, only I will wryte that which is certaine, and shall haue as I said, either some warrant of scripture, or shall be agreed on, by the consent of all ages. Our sauioure Christ was crucified for our sinnes, the .18. yeare of Tyberius, as by all histories it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. Peter is said to be put to deathe in Rome, the last yeare of Nero, so Peter liued after Christ, vnder Tyberius .v. yeare, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula 4. yeare, Claudius .13. yeare, Nero. 13 yeare. In all .36. yeares and odde monthes according to the raigne of the saide Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roures, in these .36. yeares and odde moneths, they vvryte of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus. He vvas bishop <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4. yeares in the East partes .7. yeares at Antioche, and .25. yeares at Rome, vvhere at last he died. Heere this fable doeth almost bevvray it selfe, suche hasty enstallings, and so many translatings out of one bishopprike into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth not vvell agree vvith oure sauiours vvordes, that they should haue affliction in the vvorlde. But let vs searche the scriptures, and trie hovve these Bishopprikes vvil stande. After that our Sauioure is ascended, they goe into Ierusalem all the Apostles togither, they choose Mathie the Apostle.<note place="margin">Act. 1.12. Act. 2.4.</note> After fiftye dayes they receiue the holy Ghost, Peter conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many.</p>
            <p>After certaine dayes Peter,<note place="margin">Act. 3.1.</note> and Iohn goe vppe in to the Temple, they heale the lame, they are put in prisone, they are forbidden to preache anye more in the name of Iesus,
<pb facs="tcp:8597:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then they returne vnto the other Apostles, and tary many daies togither,<note place="margin">Act. 4.18. Act. 5.12.</note> working many miracles amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people, in so much that the Cities round about resorted daily to Ierusalem, to haue their sick, and diseased healed. Then again, the Apostles are put in prison, and God deliuereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and many dayes they preach in the temple, and in euery house. After this came a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against the Church at Ierusalem, in so much, that they were all dispearsed sauing the Apostles.<note place="margin">Act. 8.1.</note> Then at the laste after many dayes, Peter is sent out of Ierusalem into Samaria, where he preacheth in diuers townes about. Thus farre good Reader, thou seest plainly Peter is no bishop, nor yet in any speciall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, when the other Apostles sende him out to preache. Then he returneth againe to Ierusalem, and this is one yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of our sauioure Christ, as the histories do all agree in reporting the conuersion of S. Paule, which was nowe done, as appeareth. Act. 9. This is the yeare of our Lord .35. In the yere of our Lord .38. He dwelleth in Ierusalem. Gal. 1.18. Likewise in the yere of our Lorde .46. he is imprisoned at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Act. 12.2. Againe in the yeare of our Lord .48. he is at the councel holden in Ierusalem. Act. 15.7. from that day forward, he giueth his faith vnto Paule, and Barnabas, that he will be an Apostle, not to the Romaines, but to the Iewes. Gal. 2.9. vvhich truely he accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed euen vntill his death, and doubtlesse neuer came at Rome. Now christian reader, seing the scripture lieth thus, that Peters aboade in Ierusalem, after the conuersion of S. Paule <hi>Anno Domini</hi> .35. is recorded .iij. seuerall times. And after the last time a couenaunt made, that he woulde continue among the Iewes. If I shall proue vnto thee, that these seuerall times are rightly numbred, according to the yeare of the Lorde, that is, that the first time was the .38 yeare, the seconde time, the .46. yeare, the third time, the .48. yeare, and then in the meane while betwene the .35. yeare, and the .38. likewise the .38. and the .46. and betwene the .46. and .48. that Peter was not in Rome, last of all, that he was true of his promise, and after the .48. yeare, came not at Rome, then I trust thou wilt confesse with me, that Peter was
<pb facs="tcp:8597:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neuer .25. yeares Bishop of Rome. But that all poperie, as it is in it selfe nothing but lies, so it is grounded wholly, and altogither vpon lies. First it is agreed vpon by all, &amp; the thing is plaine in it self, Paule was conuerted the yere of our Lord .35. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paule himself writeth thus.<note place="margin">Galat. 1.18. Act. 9.26.</note> After three yeres I came to Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see Peter, and abode in his house .xv. dayes, so this was the .38. yere of our Lord, when Peter is first in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When he was after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned at Ierusalem, Act. 12.2. that it was the .46. yeare of our Lorde, it is proued thus. The countreis about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, Tyre,<note place="margin">Act. 12.20. <hi>Suetonius in Claudio. Euse. Beda. Orosius. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> and Sidon, were then nourished with the kings prouision. But that prouision Claudius made, in the great famine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the .4. yere of his raigne, which was the yeare of our Lord .46. Againe immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, the scripture me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cioneth <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 12.23.</note> the death of Herode. But He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode was made king in the first yeare of Caligula, and raigned 7. yeare, so he died in the .4. yeare of Claudius. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is said, the .46. yeare of our Lorde. Peter being now in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at Ierusalem, and thus the seconde time, that Peter is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned to be in Ierusalem, is the .46. yeare of Christ. Afterward, when the Apostles helde the councell in Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Other number these .14. yeres from his firste going to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and so this councell is holden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An. 51.</note> that it was the .48. yeare of our Lord, it is proued by S. Paule, who after he had mentioned his conuersion, and his first going to Ierusalem, whereof we spake before, he saith thus. <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.1.</note> Then after .14. yeres, I went vp again to Ierusalem. So it was the .48. yeare of our Lord, this being .14. yeare after his conuersion, and he conuerted in the .35. of our Lorde, and thus it is proued, that in the yeares of our Lord .35.38.46.48. Peter was in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now it resteth to proue, that in the meane space Peter came not to Rome. That he was not at Rome betwene the .35. and the .38. yeare, I haue this profe. In the yeare of our Lorde .37. Pilate wrote his letter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Emperor should haue had better instruction. Thus in those three yeares Peter was not in Rome. Betwene the .38. yere,
<pb facs="tcp:8597:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the .46. yeare they say, suche is their impudencie, that Peter was Bishop all the while at Antioche. If it be so, then by their owne confession he was not at Rome. But the scripture is plain he was neither at Antioche, nor yet at Rome. And howe these 7. yeares are passed, marke, and thou shalt see. In the beginning of these .7. yeares, Peter goeth forth a preaching. First into all Iury, Galile, and Samaria, which wold require some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance. Afterward he goeth vp to the saints at Lidda,<note place="margin">Act. 9.32.</note> and there tarieth. From thence he goeth to Ioppe, and there tarieth <hi>dies multos,</hi> a long while.<note place="margin">Act. 9.39.</note> From thence he goth to Caesarea, and ther couerted Cornelius,<note place="margin">Act. 10.24.</note> the first gentile that euer he conuerted, as is plain by the scriptures, then he abideth certain dayes at Caesarea, all this well nigh .400. miles from Antioche: and now for profe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no hast to Antioche,<note place="margin">Act. 11.2.</note> he commeth home againe to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, where he is againe ioyned with the Apostles. And now the Apostle heare word, that certaine gentiles at Antioche are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, not by Peter, but by the disciples, that fled when Steuen was stoned.<note place="margin">Act. 11.22.</note> Act. 7.60. &amp; 8.1. Well did the holy ghost here name them that preached this while at Antioche, or else here had ben some coloure for Peters bishoprike. But marke further, when the Apostles heare this, to confirme the gentiles, they send to Antioche. But vvhome sende they? Peter? Sure they vvoulde haue done, had he then bene their bishop, but Peter abideth still in Ierusalem, and Barnabas is sent to Antioche, where he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth, after goth in to Tarsus to Paule, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they come againe bothe to Antioche, and there tary afterwarde one whole yeare. About this time saith the scripture, Peter was put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Act. 12.2.</note> which was as is proued, the yeare of our Lord .46. And that he continued in Ierusalem euer since Barnabas was sent to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche, we haue this coniecture. When he was deliuered out of prison, and knockt at Maries dores, Rhoade the maide knewe him by his voice.<note place="margin">Act. 12.15.</note> And so well, that the Disciples said she was madde, or else it was Peters angell. Yet were the thing neuer so incredible, she said she was sure it was euen he. This perfecte knowledge of a mannes voyce, required some continuaunce of
<pb facs="tcp:8597:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acquaintaunce. And thus we are come to the .7. yeare of his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprike of Antioche, in which time he yet neuer came at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche. Nowe the yeare of our Lord .46. the .4. of Claudius, he goeth from Antioche to Rome, and there is bishop .25. yeares, 2. months .8. dayes, from the .16. of Ianuary, to the .24 of March. Suche accompt I trow they make, that tell vs how many mile it is to heauen. But be it so, he is gone out of the prisone in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem .2000. mile of to Rome to be made bishop. If the story of dame Ioane were so incredible as this, maister Harding vvith some countenaunce might haue written against it. But let vs go foreward.<note place="margin">Act. 15.7. <hi>Orosius. lib.</hi> 7 <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Suetonius. Nauclerus.</hi>
               </note> In the yeare of our Lorde .48. notwithstanding this posting to Rome, he is yet at Ierusalem. <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> And from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth that he ment not to goe to Rome, but kepe his promise that he would continue among the Iewes, we haue this profe. First his othe where Iames, Peter, and Iohn doe sweare vnto Paule, and Barnabas, that they would execute their Apostleships among the Iewes. Which sure Peter woulde not haue done, if he had thought to haue gone to Rome, and all the Papists in the world shall neuer be able to ansvver it, iangle hovv they vvil, that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvas bishop of Rome. He vvas not, he ment it not, he kept his promisse. Paule calleth him the Apostle of circumcision.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11. Gal. 2.7. 1. Peter. 1.1. Iacob. 1.1. 1. Ioh. 2.24.</note> He vvas aftervvarde among the Ievves at Antioche, he vvry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Epistle to the Ievves, that vvere straungers, and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroade in Asia, euen as Iames dothe to the tvvelue Tribes scattered among the nations, and Iohn to them that had heard and seene from the beginning, vvhich vvere the Ievves. Thus did those Apostles minde their promise, though vve talke of bishopprikes, vve knovve not vvhat. But bicause there are yet three and twenty yeares behinde, let vs as vve may, examine them by the scriptures. In the Actes vve read,<note place="margin">Act. 18.2. <hi>Orosius. lib.</hi> 7 <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Suetonius. Nauclerus, &amp; alij.</hi>
               </note> that Priscilla and Aquila, and all the residue of the Ievves vvere banished out of Rome. But this vvas done the .9. yeare of Claudius. <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> .51. When now Peter should haue bene more than .5. yeare bishop in Rome. Thus yll may this fable agree vvith the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. But let vs examine it further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8597:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>About six yeares after this, and the beginning of the raigne of Nero, Paule wryteth his Epistle to the Romaines, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for that he then caried vp to Ierusalem, for the pore saints there abiding, suche distribution as they of Macedonia and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia had gathered,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.26.</note> which was a little before Paules last going to Ierusalem, as most writers agree, in the last yeare of Claudius. And for profe it was so, now al things are quiet at Rome, Paule saluteth Priscilla, and Aquila, which in the .9. of Claudius were bothe banished, and the Actes doe specifie certaine yeares after, in which Paule and they were togither. So now being at Rome againe, it agreeth wel, that the Epistle to the Romains, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about the beginning of the raigne of Nero, and the yeare of our Lorde .56. at which time Peter was not at Rome, as may be proued aboue all gesses, and coniectures, out of the worde of God. First he saluteth diuers by name, and yet he speaketh not of Peter,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> a sure profe that Peter was not at Rome. Againe, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth Andronicus, and Iunia, with this especial note, which are notable among the Apostles,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.7.</note> and were in Christ afore me. How muche more occasion had Paule, thus to salute and commende Peter, whome he calleth other where a piller of the Church, and who was not only before Paule,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> but before all men, sauing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his brother, called to be a disciple. Nothing may be here answered, but that only, which is true, Peter was not at Rome. If these reasons seme not strong inoughe, then good Reader, loke in the .15. to the Romaines, thou shalt haue an other, which by no meanes may be shifted off. Thus he wryteth, I enforced my self to preache the gosple, not where Christ was named, least I should haue built vpon an other mannes foundation, but as it is vvritten,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> to vvhome he vvas not spoken of, they shall see him, and they that heard not, shall vnderstande him. Then he addeth, therefore also I haue bene oft let to come vnto you, by which words it is manifest, they had but weake maintenaunce of their faith, and the true Disciples had no long continuaunce among them. But how could this be, if Peter were .25. yeare, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop there. Again, he saluteth the houshold of Narcissus, which
<pb facs="tcp:8597:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Narcissus saith, Ambrose vvas <hi>Presbiter eius ecclesiae,</hi> a chiefe ruler in that churche. and hovv coulde Paule here haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Peter, being <hi>Archpresbiter,</hi> the chiefe of all rulers, and Pope himselfe? Thus are vve past .xj. yeare of this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprike, and yet vve can not once finde S. Peter in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.

Is it possible that Peter should now haue bene thirtene yeare bishop, and yet the chiefe of the Ievves that vvere there vvhen Paule came, had scarce any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They may beleue it, that vvill nedes be deceiued. Tvvo yeare after this, vntill the yeare of our Lorde 60. the fourthe of Nero, Paule abideth in Rome. All vvhich while, vndoubtedly Peter came not once there, as may plain appeare, if thou reade the Epistles, vvhich Paule vvrote in Rome. To the Galathians he speaketh muche of Peter, and of his conuersation vvith him, about tvventy yeares paste, but of his present being at Rome, not one vvorde, and yet he speaketh of him to this purpose, to get the more credite vnto himselfe, vvhy then doeth he not name him, as novve present vvith him? In like case, vvryting to the Philippians,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.2.</note> he beginneth his Epistle thus, Paule and Timothie, vvhy coulde he not heere, haue begon Paule and Peter? Nay what folly vvas it to bring Peters testimonie many yeares past, vvhich novv might be doubted of, vvhen he might haue had his present, and most certaine vvitnesse, vvith subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ovvne hande, to confirme his doctrine? Againe,
<pb facs="tcp:8597:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he vvryteth thus vnto the Philippians, that many brethren in the Lord vvere boldned through his bandes,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.14.</note> and durste frankely speake the worde, if bandes would haue made them faithfull, no doubt Peter had long before, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, surely he would not haue shronke neither for chaines, nor prisones. It is his owne doctrine, that heere vnto we are called,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 2.21.</note> he coulde not so sone haue forgotten his owne good councell. Againe, Paule wryteth, he had no man like minded as Timothy was,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.20.</note> how coulde this be, if Peter had bene there? Againe he wryteth, he had only A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristarchus his prisone felow,<note place="margin">Col. 4.10.11</note> sure Peter would haue bene in prisone too, if he had bene in Rome. Againe, Marke, and Iustus,<note place="margin">Phil. 23.</note> are onely my felow workers, and shall we thinke that Peter was now bishop, yet would not helpe Paule in preaching? Read ouer all Paules Epistles, written in Rome, and if the spirite of truthe be within thee, thou wilt say Peter was not in Rome, yet now he shoulde haue bene euen in the floure of his bishoprike. Nowe are there on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lefte ten yeares behinde, in which likewise it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, whether Peter were in Rome. At the latter ende of this ten yeare, <hi>Anno Domini</hi> .7d. Neronis .14. Paule commeth againe to Rome, and is againe imprisonned, whence he wryteth his seconde Epistle to Timothie, as Ierome, and Eusebius, and diuers other doe thinke. Then Peter is not in Rome. Only Luke is vvith me, saith S. Paule,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.11.</note> if this be true, vvhere then vvas Peter? Shall vve thynke he vvoulde not once see Paule a prisonner? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, at my first aunswering, no man assisted me, but all forsoke me.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.16.</note>

            <p>O vnthankefull vvretches, and deseruing yll of Peter, that vvoulde novve thinke Peter vvere Bishoppe. But heere are nowe nine yeares, in the meane season, in vvhich it is sone proued, Peter coulde be no bishop.

Therfore they make this glose vpon it. From Babylon, that is from Rome, and vvhat a miserable shift is this, in defence of Peters bishoprike, to confesse Rome to be Babylon? But Rome, as it is, it shal be Babylon, and their religion, as it is, it shall be the purple vvhore, and the Pope as he is, he shall be Antichrist, rather than they vvill lose this succession of Peter.

               <p>From these vncharitable beginnings M.

We are put in minde of the country prouerb, that it is ill wyth the Géese when the Fox preacheth.

But God be praysed, the lynes are fallen to vs in pleasaunt places: yea we haue a fayre heritage,<note place="margin">Psal. 16.16</note> for the waye that Maister Iuell wadeth in, it is not that horrible gulphe, which M.

Iuell should repent him of this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying, he walketh in the way of health. God of hys good wyll and mercie shall giue vnto hym that hys course be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the same. He maketh not good euill, nor euyll good,<note place="margin">Esay. 5.20.</note> he putteth not darknesse for light, nor light for darknesse, he saith not swéete is sower, and sower is swéete. And for as much as the whole controuersie betwéene vs, doth rest in this, whether of vs is in darknesse, it shall not be tedious vnto the Christian Reader, if in the woord of God we doe séeke for triall, for that giueth vnto the simple sharpnesse of wyt, and to the children knowledge and discretion,<note place="margin">Pro. 1.4.</note> neyther is it hydden but from the eyes of the scorner, neither yet peruerted, but of the wycked.<note place="margin">Pro. 4. 2. Pet. 3.16.</note> Let vs aske of the same woord what is good, what is the lyght,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8597:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and what is swéete.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.19. Psalm. 19.</note> It is good for thée (saith <hi>Peter</hi>) to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto the woorde. And thy woorde saith <hi>Dauid</hi> is a lantern vnto our féete, &amp; a light vnto our steppes, and the same woorde is more swéete then hony and the hony combe. Then as thys same word is true, so we are assured of all goodnesse, all light, and pleasure, if we follow it: and therefore blesse onesse is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ouer hym that readeth,<note place="margin">Apoca. 1.3.</note> and them that heare that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Now doe we call the world to wytnesse, whether they or we do set out thys woorde. We haue it in our churches and priuate houses, we expounde it to the people: we exhort them to reade it: we call the ignorant from their errours wyth the same voyce that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was called, <hi>tolle lege, tolle le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi> Take vp and reade: and thys is as the holy Ghost doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, good, lyght, and swéete. But these men that crake so of their goodnesse, what haue they done? They haue pulled thys woorde out of their synagoges: they haue not suffred it in the poore mans dwellyngs: they haue not expounded it as the whole world can iudge: they haue not made it the squire of their religion: And if in any place that little booke was séene, though in the houses of Bishops and Prelats, yea, in the verie palaces of Popes &amp; Cardinalls: yet did it sléepe in the dust: or if the candle was light, it was set vnder a bushell. The people did not knowe the meanes of their saluation, the merite of Christes passion was mingled with mans good workes, his continuall intercession darkned with the mediation of saints, his bloudie drops wiped away with the remembring his holye martirs: his crying out on the crosse at the yéelding vp of his spirit, was not hard thorow the abusing the name of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mother, and in steade of other vnderstanding, wherwith our soules are comforted, we harkened after the straunge sounds of vnknowen trumpets: in gadding on pylgrimage, in paynting of Tabernacles, in sensing of Idols: in setting vp of Candels before stocks and stones, in blasphemous Masses: in idolatrous Altars, in halowing of Temples: in christining
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8597:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Bells: in selling of Merites: in turning of Roodes, in a thousand mo iuglings, inuented by Satan and practised by his ministers: that from the top to the toe, from the hill altars vnto the church doore, ther was nothing whole in that froward generation. Neither they themselues can denie this though they like to dissemble it, cry out how they will, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we make euil good, and good euill. And for the charging vs with darknes, the thing so disagréeth, that the ignorant require a further proofe, and the learned doe sée ther much wrangling eloquence: doe we make darknesse light? I say as before, what shadowes doe we walke in? what darkenesse doe we preach? wherein are we blinde leaders of the blinde? Accusations may not goe for arguments, nor slaunderings for sufficient proofe. O Maister Harding turne againe to your writings, examine your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, consider your counsails, applie your examples, looke if any line be blamable in our seruice, &amp; take hold of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. I think Maister Iuel will accept it as an article. No, no, this offer doeth not like you, you see to great a hazarde of your little estimation. Our seruice is good and godly, euerie title grounded on holie scriptures: and with what face doe ye cal it darknesse?

For the ignoraunce of gods worde the Gentiles were said to sit in darkenesse and in the shadow of death, the vnbeléeuing Iewes to be blinde leaders of the blinde, and he that knewe it not, to go he wist not whether. But the darckning of that worde hath bene your chiefest light, and ignoraunce the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your deuotion: and as in the sacrifices of <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis</hi> you haue made <hi>Harpocrates</hi> image with his finger on his lyps in token that your misteries must be kept secrete, and as the Egiptians you haue your two diuers caracters, that <hi>Robin Hoode</hi> and <hi>Gui</hi> of Warwick and <hi>Beuis</hi> of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton &amp; such like shoulde be had of the people in english letters, But the misteries of our redemption, &amp; the glorious tidings of the death of Christ were in straunge figures, &amp; for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarde of deuotion they might not be made common.

and as his manner is, blaming M. Iuels whole writing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth, as hée séeth good, where it liketh him best, and first boldlye ynough denieth, that M.

Yea, such is the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of their Church, and so little account they make of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrement, that they would make Christes Apostles teache one contrary to other. The .6. Canon, and the .40. Canon, and the .50. Canon of the Apostles, alow the mariage of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, the .25. Canon forbiddeth them to marrye. The .80.

Then by like M. Hardings Church, that is faine to make them Apostles, hath some wants. And yet bicause M. Iuell sayd thus much, he falleth out in a rage, that his Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge was foolish, his Replie without learning, his arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie much, his Gospell false, his weakenes discouered, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie stained, and I wot not what.

Concerning these other sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, his pride can not be much, that alwayes commendeth his aduersaries cunning. His Gospell is not false, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth nothing but the Gospell of Christ. His weakenesse is litle, that is vpholden with so manye authorities. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie is not stained, whose enimie euill reporteth him. Nor his bragges are manie, where the victorie abideth. Therfore this filthie fome of such vncomely railing, doth rather bewray the sicknes of the wryters mynde, then reproue the person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom it is vttered.</p>

               <p>In this long tale of M. Harding, we haue to note many things, first how vnwares he speaketh, contrarie to him selfe.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8597:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He confesseth flatly that this negatiue of <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> wherin he denieth any ought to be vniuersall Bishop, is in defence of the truth. Yet Maister Harding in the fourth article goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proue that the pope is vniuersal B. so by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession he goeth about to proue a lye. Secondarely, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth at the last, that Maister <hi>Cranmar</hi> was a Byshop, and Maister Iuell with other his felowes are Bishops, yet at other times, he, and his fellowes wil in no case graunt it. Thirdly, he saith, no B. of <hi>Sarisburie</hi> was a <hi>Caluinist,</hi> before Maister Iuell, and that is a manifest lye. Fourthly, that no Byshop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was maried, before <hi>Cranmar,</hi> and that is an otherlie. So in al this former péece, either he speaketh nothing but lyes, or if it be true, it is such truth, as by open writing he hath impugned. But Maister Harding bicause he can not deny this contrarietie, he will bid vs proue the other, that any B. of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> hath bene of one religion with <hi>Caluin,</hi> or that any B. of <hi>Cant.</hi> hath bene maried. In déede this is the ground of their whole religion, bold asseuerations without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner warrant, and then they bid vs proue the contrary. But although this vnequall dealing be not good, and he that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth anye thing, shoulde proue the same to be true: yet I am content for truthes sake, to reproue in fewe woordes these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues of Maister Hardings.</p>
               <p>First, this forbidding mariage, was vniuersally established by Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> the seconde, who was made Pope by the meanes, and woorking of the deuil, as their own writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, in the yeare of our Lord 980. Yet I graunt,<note place="margin">

For in the East church, they made no account of it, yea they thought it was no hinderaunce to the minister for perfourmance of his dutie in Gods church. But as I haue said, the West church in many places forbad it. And <hi>S. Ierom,</hi> although in many places he speake reuerently, and well of it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8597:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet in some places, vpon his owne priuate affection, he misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it. But as touching this purpose, more then thre hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ, Priestes mariage was thought verie lawfull. But the English men receiued the faith of Christ in the latter time of <hi>Nero,</hi> as <hi>Gildas</hi> witnesseth, an olde writer and a <hi>Britan,</hi> who liued in the yeare of our Lord .580. and will Maister Harding say, that the thing being lawfull, yet in .300. yeare togither, there was neuer a Byshop maried?</p>
               <p>And let Mayster Harding héere make no exception, either that in those dayes ther was no Byshops of Canterbury, or Sarisbury,<note place="margin">

So this lying negatiue of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is reproued, that sayth, no Bishop was euer maried in England, before Bishop <hi>Cranmer.</hi> For the other negatiue,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8597:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that there was neuer B. of <hi>Sarisburie,</hi> of that religion which <hi>Caluine</hi> taught, it appeareth by M. Iuels Replie, which shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, that not onely in <hi>England,</hi> but in all Christendome that religion was in the chiefest articles professed. And yet bicause it is here brought with the suretie of M. Hardings warrant, we wyll speake a little of this negatiue. It is boldlye auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of manye popish Priestes, that Christianitie was placed here by <hi>Augustine,</hi> which is called the Englishe Bishop. He was sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and landed in the Ile of <hi>Tenet</hi> in <hi>Kent an.</hi> 596. But it is alredy shewed, that we had the faith of Christ long before. Then what did <hi>Augustine</hi> here? I will tell thée Christian Reader, and I wyll tell thée that, which M. Harding shall nener be able to confute. He did first perswade the King and Quéene, not to enforce his new religion, but to leaue it fréely to men to follow, if they would. Afterward, being made Bishop of Canterburie, by consent of a Synode, he thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Church altars, vestiments, images, Masses, challices, crosses, candlesticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sensers, banners, processions, holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, holy bread, funerals, tithes, and such other stuffe, whych before that time was neuer séene in <hi>England.</hi> Then he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their kéeping of Easter day, taught them manye ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Baptisme, and when he coulde not bring all men to his diet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Beda. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>hist. Anglic. Bed. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> .33.</note> he moued great persecution against such as defended the libertie of the Church. Then he receiued from <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes of diuers Saintes, buylt a Monasterie to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> wrought many fained miracles, and so at the last he died about the yeare of our Lord .610. Now for further proofe of this, that <hi>Augustine</hi> marred, and not made our religion, it is verye probable, that we neuer receiued our faith from <hi>Rome,</hi> but from the East Church. First, bicause we (vntill <hi>Augustine</hi> came among vs) kept our Easter after the manner of the Gréeke Church. Now it is well knowen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pet. Clunia. ad D. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
                  </note> what mortall hatred there was for that matter, so that he which was enstructed of the one, would in no wyse vse the order of the other. Agayne
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8597:29"/>
when <hi>Augustine</hi> should be sent vnto them, he came backe for feare, and the Britaines would not receaue him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cal. card. de Brit. hist. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge anye authoritie of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> ouer them. Which sure they would neuer haue done, if they had receaued theyr fayth from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much then followeth, we had the faith of the Gréeke Church, without all superstitious ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so it is manifest our bishops were then of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Caluines</hi> profession, in the whole substaunce of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And so is this other negatiue of M. Harding prooued a lye. This I haue sayd the more at large, bicause M. Hardyng and his fellowes, woulde haue vs beleue, that our faith came from the Pope, and <hi>Dan Augustine</hi> the Moonke, was the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger. Now to quit these negatiues, with which M. Harding is so well pleased, with like negatiues we may well and truly ouerthrow all popish religion, taking example of our sauiour Christes doing. For he neuer alowed of their ceremonies. He neuer celebrated his last supper alone. He neuer ministred in one kinde. He neuer made any vniuersall bishop. He neuer named Transubstantiacion, Masse, Mattens, Euensong, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige, nor Trentals. He neuer went a procession, with cope, crosse, or candlesticke. He neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ensed Image, nor sang La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin seruice. He neuer went to shrift, nor sat in confession. He neuer preached of Purgatorie, nor pardons. He neuer hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Saintes, nor praied for the dead. He neuer fasted Friday, Uigil, Lent, nor Aduent. He neuer hallowed Churche, nor chalice, ashes, nor palmes, candels nor bels. He neuer made holy water, nor holy bread. He neuer wore Rochet, nor Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. He neuer had Crosse nor Myter, Corporas nor Portas, shepebooke, nor Massebooke, Frankincense nor Peterpence, wax, nor flax, nor any such trumperie. And therefore by these negatiues we may well conclude, that M. Hardings religion is not of Christes institution.</p>

Why treate you not of matters of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then these be of, which yet lye in question betwene the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Protestantes? As the presence of Christes bodye and bloude in the Sacrament, of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the value of good woorkes, of the Sacrifice of the Masse. &amp;c. Thys obscure manner of speaking maye séeme to make light of these waightye mattters, and therefore who so euer should say so of them, deserued litle blame. But héere Maister Hardings choler is to much inflamed, bicause Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste Iuell noting their inconstancie, asketh whether their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion encreaseth, and vadeth, waxeth and waneth, as doeth the moone. And hath he not, thinke you, good occasion to aske this question? Doeth not Maister Harding saye in many of these articles, that they be no keyes of their Religion? Yet héere he saith, if a man denie them, when they be receiued, they are of value inoughe to dampne him. Where is his wit become? What is so contrary to it selfe, as this? What is waxing, and waning? What is increasing and vading, if this be none? And what Christian eares can abide this saying, that suche tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels as they be of them selues, and such filthy whooredomes as they be now made of, should condempne vs, if we shoulde speake against them? He paide not the price of soules, that so easily sendeth them away from ther maister, vnto Satan. The casting awaie such scourings of the Romish vncleannes, shall neuer doo it, nay it is a witnesse vnto our consciences, that we be the children of the highest.</p>

And who sweareth by them, that are no Gods, eyther we, or they? Haue not they taught vs, to sweare by the saints of God, by his holy Euangelies, and by their wicked Masses? And trow they, this is not swearing by false Gods?<note place="margin">Ezech. 13.</note> Of whom speaketh <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that they ar like Foxes in the wasty places, euen those that Prophecied of their owne spirite, and lying diuinations, and whether doe prophecie of their owne spirite, we that search onely the woorde of God, or they that preach forth their owne traditions? Who hath séene lying diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we that reiect all their dreames, and visions, or they that doe staye their whole Religion on them? Though all the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which are written, in maner infinite, dyd not shewe it, Maister Hardings owne aunswere, would sufficientlye proue it. This is a special note, that their Pope is Antichrist, oft spoken of in the scripture,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 4.</note> and bewayled of <hi>S.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8597:35"/>
spirit as he goeth forth in euil, he doth breath out euill termes in suche sorte, that chaste eares maye not well abyde them. He calleth mariage an vnchaste life, wyues strumpets, and an vndefiled bed a lecherous neying. O Lord, are not thy eyes vpon the truth? Thou hast stricken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they haue not sorrowed, thou hast consumed them, but they haue refused to receiue correction, they haue made their faces harder than a stone, and haue refused to returne. But they knowe not the waye of the Lorde, nor the iudgement of their God. I will aunswere no otherwise but with S. <hi>Paules</hi> woordes, that their doctrine is a doctrine of Diuels. He telleth vs of spitefull guyles, and wyles, with which we intrappe men, of our lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and our false dealing, that maketh them to smart, and yet he saith, he will not chasten vs with reuiling woordes. How full of gall is Maister Harding, that these woords do not yet seme bitter? What shall we looke for, when his spiryt is moued, that thus quyetly breathed out such reproches? But so his tonge maye runne, or his pen be walking, it séemeth, he careth not what he write, or speake. Why doth he not tell vs what he meaneth? Is it like he knoweth any harme by vs, and will not tell it? Such silence would require a mylder sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke. Now after a litle talke to no purpose, when he hath swet long in bringing much for his modesty, yet can prooue none, he thinketh good pollicy, to make other compartners of his impudency, and after mature deliberation, with a fewe prety metaphores, thinketh it good to bestow his talke vppon Maister Iuell, and so with a bolde asseueration beginnes his purpose.</p>

the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not the church of Christ. And as this church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in déede the synagogue of the Deuill, so she hath not so much as the marks of Christes congregation.

                  </note> Thou must first consider that this sacrament, and Baptisme are the two sacraments that Christ hath left vnto his church, which two were prefigured in the olde lawe, baptisme in circumcision especially, and the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in the pascall Lambe.<note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> Now for the true vnderstanding of these Sacramentes, thou must remember that the Scripture vseth in them suche a phrase of speakinge, that the thynge signified, is giuen vnto the signe. So of Circumcision, whych God had commaunded <hi>Abraham,</hi> the scripture expressely saith, this is my couenant,<note place="margin">Gene. 17.10</note> yet was it the signe of his couenaunt. Of the pascall Lambe it is saide, this is the Lordes passeouer,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.11.</note> yet was it but a token of the passage of the Angell. Likewyse of the rock <hi>Paul</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. The rocke was Christ,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16</note> which was yet but a figure of Christ, and the sacrifices are saide to be the purifiynges, yet were they but a token of ther sanctification. And as this was spoken thus in the figure, so it is now in the truth. <hi>S.

                  <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismus nos quoque saluos reddit,</hi> yet it is but the seale of our saluation. The holy Ghost must come vpon them before they receiue grace, In like maner it is saide,<note place="margin">Actes. 19.6.</note> of the other parte of this Sacrament: This cuppe, yet the holye Ghost meaneth the wine.

This maye suffice the Christian Reader, concerning this transubstantiation, which M. Harding so vpholdeth. God giue his children grace, that such brightnes of his holye woord, may illumine their darke harts, that they may behold clerely, what is his truth. And thus much of his first marke.

For as it is héere ment, we haue nowe no Priest, no dayly Oblation, no Aultare, no offring vp of Christ vnto his father, no propitiatory Sacrifice, no Masse, no remission of Sinnes with out bloud, no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing for the dead. All these thinges being proued by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the scriptures, I trust all godly consciences shalbe quieted, and all Maister Hardings sacrificing imaginations shalbe buried againe in that pit of iniquity, out of which they are spronge.

Now it resteth, we should see what authority he hath giuen to his Apostels, and this we are taught by <hi>S.

And loe, I am with you alway vnto the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. Here is the whole authority of the minister out of the new Testament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.

This selfe commission is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expressed by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> when Christ saith to his Discipels. As my father sent me, so also I send you,<note place="margin">Iohn, 20.21.</note> where immediatly followeth, and when he saide it. &amp;c. whose sinnes ye remit, they are remitted. And in what sorte God sent his sonne, it is likewise expressed by the prophet, sayinge as <hi>S. Luke</hi> resiteth it, <hi>Spiritus Domini super me. &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 61.1.</note> The Spirit of the Lorde is vpon me, bicause he hath anointed me, that I should preach the Gospell to the poore, he hath sent me,<note place="margin">Luke. 4.18.</note> that I should heale the broken harted, that I shoulde preach deliuerance to the Captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, that I should set at liberty them, that are brused, and that I should preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord.

thinges are necessary, which our onely sauiour, and his eternall worde haue not commaunded? But the Apostle hath spoken, and it must be fulfilled, that the tyme should come, when mens eares would itch to harken after lyes. But let vs sée, how do these massing Priests execute that, which Christ hath committed to the Minister of the Gospell. Doe they preache? Doe they instruct the people? The great ignorance in the time of their rule, is an euerlasting witnesse, that they did not. If thou wilt yet be contentious, examine the thyng farther. Did they teache to obserue those things, which Christ had commaunded? Howe coulde they then haue pulled hys commaundements, and his whole Bible out of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? Dyd they giue sight vnto the blinde? Who could abide to heare it spoken, they made it their common Prouerb, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce is the mother of deuotion.</hi> Did they preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable yeare of the Lorde? as the Prophet sayth, alluding to the yeare of <hi>Iubyley.</hi> Nay, their own conscience doth crye no, &amp; their déedes witnesse against them. As though mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie had not bene yet wrought, the Pope hath set vp a new yeare of <hi>Iubyley,</hi> and in a marueilous sorte of innumerable people forgaue sinnes after his owne pleasure. O horrible wickednes, and blasphemie against the bloud of Christ. But let their preaching go. How are their sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts administred? Reade, that is sayd before, alledged out of the Canon of theyr own Masse, and thou shalt thinke their ministration a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet play, rather then Gods seruice. But do they remit sinnes? Sure as they doe the other, they preach in abhomination, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in apish toyes, and forgiue sins in blasphemye. Christ doth bid, heale the broken harted, but they will sende their pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, if they be paied therafter to men, that thei neuer saw.

It is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued by this, that Christ onely is our euerlastinge Priest, and we ministers of his Gospell, and that the Popish Prelates are no priestes, and therfore haue no bodyly sacrifice, neyther yet are true ministers, and therfore they are not of God. The second lye, that is founde in this assertion of M. Harding, is, that ther is dayly oblation, that is,<note place="margin">

                  </note> Christ is now dayly offered in their Masse. And for proofe of this, <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, Christ is entred into the very heauen, to appeare in the sight of God for vs. <hi>Non vt saepius offerat semet ipsum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.25.</note> 
                  <hi>quemadmodum pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex, &amp;c.</hi> Not that he should offer him selfe often, as the high priest entred into the holy place. If therefore Christ can not be offred againe, the imagined sacrifice of their daily Masse, is wickednesse. Christ is once deade, and he can dye no more,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9.</note> than how can the priest sacrifice him? So saith <hi>S. Peter,</hi> Christ hath once suffred for sinnes, the iust, for the vniust,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.18.</note> and againe <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Christ was once offred to take away the sinnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and vnto them, that looke for him,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.28.</note> shall he appeare the seconde time without sinne vnto saluation. And againe, the Apostle comparing the sacrifice of the law, with the sacrifice of Christ, saith: Euery Priest appeareth dayly ministering,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.11.</note> and oft times offreth one maner of offering, which can neuer take awaye sinne, but this man, after he had offered one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sinnes, sitteth for euer at the right hande of God, and after, for with one offering hath hee consecrated for euer, them that be sanctified. These wordes are very plaine, and the gates of hell ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not obscure their vnderstanding. If the simple Reader doe muse, why the Papistes doe not credit it, let him remember, the Scribes and Pharises woulde not credit Christes miracles, hauing farther the manifest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the worde of God. Such are the plagues that God doth sende vpon the contemners of his worde.<note place="margin">Esay. 29.14.</note> The wisdome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8597:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their wise men, shall perish, and the vnderstanding of their prudent,<note place="margin">Esay. 29.14</note> shalbe hid, and he hath sent in message vnto them the plagues, that he hath prepared, commaunding his prophet to speake vnto the obdurate people.<note place="margin">Esay. 6.9.</note> Ye shal heare in déede, but ye shall not vnderstande, ye shall plainely sée, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue. God for his mercies sake, when his good wil, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, lighten their darke harte. I haue sufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Christ hath ben offred, and he shall be offred no more. So is there no such dayly sacryfyce, as Maister Harding san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth. If they will make here escapes, and say they make no more offerings, but it is the very same which Christ did offer, this is a poore shift in déede, and a common vayle, that shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth all their eyes, least they should sée the truth. But <hi>Paule</hi> taketh away this stumbling block out of the path of the godly, saying, that by Christes will, we be sanctified, <hi>Per oblationem corporis Iesu Christi semel peractam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note> euen by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once made the sacrifice, is not onely one, but it is <hi>semet peracta,</hi> once made, and no more be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no new sacrifice may be sought for.

And this was figured in the offering of a red Cow,<note place="margin">Num. 19.2.</note> whych God commaunded to be giuen to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, and he should burne hir without the hoste, with hir skyn, and hir fleshe, and hir blood, and hir doong.

Likewise he that gathered the ashes of the Cowe, should wash his clothes, and his flesh, and be vncleane vntill Euen. No parte of it shoulde be reserued for the Priest, whereby we are taught, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our sauiour Christ, whereby his people are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, must be alone made with out any thinge appertaining either vnto the priest, or tabernacle, for which cause as <hi>S.

our sauiour Christ is the truth it selfe. He wyll not be coupled with the Tabernacle, which is blinde shadowes.

The scriptures are full of such places, which teach vs how to please God, and take holde of saluation. But in all those places no such sacrificing of Christ is mencioned, and therfore to fancie any such imaginations is, neither to please God, nor to walke in that way, which leadeth to saluation. If this be not sufficient, which is sufficient to a christian man, we haue besides most certaine proofe, which by no meanes can be coloured. <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, where there is remission of sins,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.18.</note> there is no more offering for sinne, but Christ hath alreadye forgiuen vs all our trespasses, and put out the hand writing of ordinaunce, which was against vs. &amp;c.<note place="margin">Collos. 2.13. 1. Pet. 1.19.</note> And as saynt Peter sayth, we are redeemed with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lambe vndefiled, and without spot. And therefore Christ is not now offered for sinne. And here appeareth moreouer the fift heresie in M. Hardings proposition. For if Christ be not offered to his father, neither any oblation for sinne is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning, then is there now no propitiatorie sacrifice, but onely one, which God hath already made, vpon the aultar of the crosse. And that this should be but once made, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Leuit. 26.2</note> for that <hi>Aaron</hi> might but once in the yeare goe into the holy place, within the vaile, before the mercy seate, where he made attonement for him selfe, and for his house. So spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> of the sacrifice once made, meaning it alone to be propitiatorie. If any man sinne,<note place="margin">1.

Againe he sayth, herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and sent his Sonne, to be a propitiation for our sinnes. When Christ made this propitiatorie sacrifice, he was sent of his father,<note place="margin">1. Ion. 4.10</note> and he was sent but once, euen than as S. Paule sayth, when the fulnesse of time was come. Now is the time of his imbassage done. He hath satisfied the law of God, first toward his father,<note place="margin">Gala. 4.4.</note> in that he was obedient vnto death, euen vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the

This is ynoughe, if we were not dull of hearing, to take from vs these vngodly deuises, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any other propitiatory sacrifice, than that, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made. But M. Harding, and his fellowes, that can so well peruerte the scriptures of God, they haue many shiftes to defende their owne fancies. This our sacrifice, say they, is no newe sacrifice, but the same which Christ made, yet <hi>Saint Paule</hi> saith it was one oblation, and <hi>semel peracta,</hi> but once made.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> To this againe they aunswere, that it was but once made bloudy, but theirs is vnbloudy. But the Apostle saith, <hi>Absque sanguinis effusione non sit remissio,</hi> without sheding of bloude there is no remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> what than auaileth this vnbloudy sacrifice? But they saye further, it is an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the death of Christ. But the Apostle proueth, that the sacrifices of the lawe were vnperfite,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.3.</note> bicause in them was a remembrance againe of sinnes, euery yeare, so there is now no such kinde of application. They cannot possible so turne their deuises, but the Apostle must néedes proue their Masse full of Sacriledge. Christ onely was méete to offer vp hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but they in their Masse will haue a priest to offer him. Christes sacrifice was but one, and once finished. In their Masse, if their sacrifice were one, yet is it daily iterated. There can be no remission of sinnes without bloud. In their Masse they make it vnbloudy, yet they haue it to cleanse sins. Thus their Masse, and the Apostle cannot be reconciled. God for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

neyther grounded on the worde of God, bicause it is vngodly, nor requireth much impugning, bicause it hath no reason. Yet seing M. Harding coulde neuer sée the marke to shoote at, I will let it plaine before him, if he will shoote at it with the worde of God, he shall be sure to ouerthrowe it. King <hi>Salomon</hi> hath made him fit arrowes, euen for the nonce, if he will drawe truely, he shall hit the marke. What soeuer saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> thy hande doth finde to do, do it spedily,<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.10.</note> for there is neyther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wisedome in the graue, whether thou goest. If the case stande thus with vs when we are gone, concerning our doinges, then is there no more purgatory. Againe he saith, if the trée doe fall towarde the South, or toward the North,<note place="margin">Eccle. 11.3.</note> in the place that the tree falleth, there it shalbe, and these wordes of the holy Ghost are true. Therfore no Pope, no Trentalles, no Indulgences, nor pardons can moue the trée out of his place, in which it is once fallen. Againe it is written, defraude not thy selfe of the good day,<note place="margin">Eccle, 14.14</note> and let not the portion of good desires ouer passe thée meaning therby, we should take the tyme of our lyfe. For after it will be to late to aske repentaunce, and in that chap. it followeth. Giue, and take, &amp; I sanctifie thy soule, worke thou righteousnes before thy death, for in the hell ther is no meat to finde, which sayinges are likewise confirmed by that which is spoken by <hi>S. Paule.</hi> Behold now is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time: behold now is the day of health. To the same sense it is likewise spoken. All corruptible thinges shall faile, and the worker thereof shall go withall. By which scriptures it appeareth how little holdfast these purgatory patrons haue. And here I would haue them aunswere if they can. We haue often in the scriptures the death of men described, yet neuer any worde of purgatory mencioned. In the lawe there were sacrifices, for the prince, for the people, for the priest, for ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losie, for childe birth, for the leprosie, for diuers kindes of diseases, for sundrye infections, and griefes, pertaining vnto
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8597:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men, and yet in the whole lawe not once sacrifice apointed for them in purgatory, an vndoubted token, that purgatory was than vnknowen. <hi>Dauid</hi> fasted, and went in, and lays all night vpon the earth, while his childe was sicke, but when he was dead,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 13.16.</note> he arose vp, and washed, and annointed hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and did eate, and aunswered whye he did so, while the childe, saith he, was yet aliue, I fasted, and wept. &amp;c. but now being dead, wherefore should I now fast? The popish priests might soone haue aunswered, to release him out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But the prophet Dauid did knowe of no suche matter. When we obiect these, and such other proofes, some stagger, and haue not what to saye. Some make this aunswer, that Purgatorie was not in the time of the law, but these good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons doe litle spare the great mercies of Iesus Christ, if they teache, that he brought his people this place of torment. The testimonie, that he giueth of his own good will, can not beare it,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> where he prayeth: Father, my wyll is, that where I am, there they may be with me, whom thou hast giuen vnto me, that they may sée my glorie. But the glory that his elect shall sée, is not (I trow) the paines of Purgatorie. If M. Harding will make exception, and say that was spoken onely of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, &amp; such as should be of greater perfitenesse, than other are, that deuice is confounded euen by the testimonie of the same Iesus Christ, where he sayth in the same chapiter. I doe not pray onely for them, but for suche also as shall beleue in me, through their preaching, so that whosoeuer dyeth in the fayth of Christ, he shall not know Purgatorie, but euery one, which is saued, shall dye in the same fayth, according to that, which is written,<note place="margin">Abacuc.</note> the iust man shall lyue by his fayth. And this is againe proued by the example of the théefe, who in no poynt was of such perfection, as the Apostles were, yet to him it was sayd, this day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. And S. Paule him selfe testifieth the same, where he writeth, that the crowne of righteousnes was layd vp for him, a rewarde of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8597:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all his labours. And least we should misconstre hys saying, as the Papists doe, and say, that for his great perfection, he passed from this life straight, into the kingdome of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he taketh awaye that vaine gessing, &amp; saith further, that crowne is reserued against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day, <hi>Non solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mihi. &amp;c.</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, but to euery one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loueth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Iesus Christ. They maye not well doubt, that <hi>Paule</hi> ment by that daye the daie of his death, sith he defineth it him selfe in an other place, <hi>Cupio dissolui &amp;c.</hi> I desyre to be dissolued, &amp; be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ.<note place="margin">Philli. 1</note> Then if all sortes of men, as many, as be beleuers, bi accepted a like concerning their present happinesse, as the scriptures euery where do testifie, then let all these foolishe deuises passe. Such manner hobbings, and rouings, what haue we to doe with them? Let vs harken after the word of God, the soueraigne, and alone medicine for the wounded soule. Besides all this, that we shoulde not feare any purging fire, <hi>S. Paule</hi> testifieth of Christ, that he is able perfitely to saue all them that come,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25</note> vnto God through him. But whan we go vnto God, if Christ from thence sende vs into purgatory, how doth he than make perfite our saluation, which the soule doth inioy, till such time, as it be againe ioyned to the body, and than made ful? Againe in the same Epistle: I will be mercifull vnto their vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and their sinne,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.8.21.</note> and will remember their iniquity no more. Much lesse than will he sende vs into Purgatory. But what néede we séeke longe for the ouerthrowe of such buildings? <hi>S. Paul</hi> in one word derideth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole controuersy.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27</note> It is appointed saith he, vnto all men, that they shall once dye, and after that commeth the iudgement. If it be so, what then auaileth praier for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead? What helpeth it to haue trentals? Where is purgatory? After death saith the Apostle, commeth iudgement. Here is no colour of shift, least except they wil say after death, that is, when the generall daie of iudgement shall bée. And if this might serue, then had they somewhat to saye. But <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath preuented such wrestinge of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8597:50"/>
After death, as he teacheth, is, immediatly, as soone as we be with God, for this he writeth. Blessed ar the deade which dye in the Lorde,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.13.</note> from henceforth saith the spirit, they rest from their labour. No labour abideth any more for them, after death, immediatlye they are receiued into ioy, and their workes doe follow them. And this present ioy of the godlye is likewyse specified, where the same Apostle writeth, that an hundred, fourty, and foure thousand did stande with the lambe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mount <hi>Sion,</hi> meaning the elect, which wer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ in his kingdome. An hundreth such other places there are in the scripture, which testifie of our estate after death, and do quite ouerthrowe the Popes purgatory. Nowe for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of the Reader, it were worth the labour to answere to al those places of the scripture, in which they make so many blinde gesses at purgatory. The places are <hi>Math.</hi> 5.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 12.32 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 18 34. <hi>Luc.</hi> 12.59.16.19. <hi>l. Co.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Apo.</hi> 5.15. But read these places who list, in the feare of God, and true desire of knowledge, he can by no imaginations haue one gesse at purgatory, and yet for the establishing of such a doctrine, it had bene requisite they could haue shewed euen the name for the interpretation of other men be they neuer so olde. We may saye with the Apostle. Euery man aboundeth in his own vnderstanding, but no man knoweth the thinges that are Gods, saue God alone, and his woorde, if we will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, must be our onelye guider. But they haue one place 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 12.44. in plaine words, that it is good to pray for the dead,<note place="margin">2. Ma. 14.41</note> if that booke be of able autority. We rede likewise of one <hi>Razias,</hi> an Elder of Ierusalem, which first ran vpon his own sworde, and when he missed of his stroke, he ranne to the top of the wall, and threwe him selfe downe among the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and yet hauing life in him, went to the top of an highe rocke, and pulled out his owne bowels, and threwe them among the enimies, and for this doing he is commended. So by the authoritye of the same booke, a man maye kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which Maister Harding him selfe, I trowe will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8597:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affirme, yet this being scripture it might not be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Againe the same author saith: If I haue done well, and as the story requireth, it is the thing, that I desired.<note place="margin">2 Mac. 15.35</note> But if I haue spoken slenderly, and basely, it is that I coulde. These Iffes, and Andes are not of that spirit, which hath written the scriptures. Thus doubting of his own ability, besemeth not the holy ghost. Beside this, the gréeke in the same place is so corrupt, that scarce any sense coulde be made of it. And <hi>Ioseph ben Gorion,</hi> out of whom that story semeth to be gathered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10</note> in the same place, doth quite leaue out this praying for the dead. But it maye be, that in those dayes some ignoraunt Iewes, vpon an vnwyse deuotion, did thinke it good to praye for the deade, and likewise to praye againe vnto them, that they would helpe vs. Which if it were so, by such meanes this place might come into the <hi>Machab.</hi> And that some did thinke thus, thoughe they were alwayes otherwyse instructed, it appereth by one manifest place, which is read in <hi>Philo Iudeus,</hi> where he writeth the death of <hi>Debora,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bib. antiq. cap.</hi> 40.</note> who made a godly exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hir people before she dyed. For afterward they should finde no repentaunce. There some made aunswere vnto hir, <hi>Ecce nunc mater moreris, &amp; ora itaque pro nobis, &amp; post recessum tuum, erit anima tua memor nostri in sempiternum.</hi> Praye for vs after thy departure, and let thy soule be mindefull of vs for euer. To whom <hi>Debora</hi> maketh aunswere. <hi>Adhuc viuens homo potest orare, et pro se, &amp; pro filijs suis, post fine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> autem, non poterit exorare, nec memor esse alicuius,</hi> yet while a man is liuing, he may pray for him selfe, and for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but whan he is deade, he can neyther intreate, nor be mindeful of any. And it followeth, your similitude then shal be like the starres of heauen, which are now manifest in you. Hereby we sée what iudgement the common people mighte haue in such matters. And yet howe the godly did otherwise instruct them, reade this place, thou shalt finde it so plaine, that no wrangling may shift it of, but nedes we must confesse
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8597:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it teacheth vs, that we ought neither to praye vnto sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to help vs, neyther yet agayne can we helpe them when they be gone. Wherby it appeareth what manner of archer Maister Harding hath ben, that could not shoote at so plaine a marke. But he did shoote at his own dreames, and so he ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on Purgatorie.</p>
               <p>Yet there follow a great many of markes, at the which M. Hardyng could neuer shoote home. The first is, that the masse and our Communion is one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Masse and Communion.</hi>
                  </note> wyth that marke, sayth he, I was neuer acquaynted. Hys loose without doubt is very ill, or he shooteth to low a compasse, or else he draweth not close. For M. Stapleton, that shooteth with the same bow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes hitteth this marke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The return of vntruthes, the</hi> 7. <hi>vntruth.</hi>
                  </note> euen at the first. The Masse and the Communion, saith he, duelye ministred, is all one, and it is folly to thinke any contradiction betwéene the Communion and the Masse. Thus it appeareth M. Harding is a verye wrangler, that wyll not shoote at that marke, which his owne fellowes finde. An other marke, that M. Harding could neuer shoote at,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eucharistia.</hi>
                  </note> is this, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> doth signifie not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but common bread. I maruail he could neuer shoote at this marke. For sith he began first that babling aunswere to M. Iuels learned Challenge, he hath alwaye bene hobbing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those marks, wher this is one, though he neuer shot at the selfe same, yet hath he seldome shot, but at such like. For it is a marke of slaundering, and a marke of lying, at whych marke, as well in this Reioynder, as other where M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding most commonly doth shoote very nere. I neuer said (saith he) that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> was common breade, but the sacrament. This marke I could neuer sée. In déede no maruail, for who can well sée the thing that is not. But you father this saying vpon Maister Iuell, which reporte is all togither vntrue, and slaunderous, and in shootinge at this marke, you drawe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous cleane, and haue good deliuery, be it prickes, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, you haue measured the ground so oft, that you knowe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8597:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what to shoote. But I pray you M. Harding, where sayth M. Iuell thus? What be his woordes? Wher are they to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? Thinke you, notwithstanding your oft vntrue demeanour, that you can discredite your aduersary, vpon your bare word? The place whereunto you direct vs, hath no such saying. Thus it hath: In my iudgement this woord <hi>Eucharistia</hi> in this place of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> signifieth not the sacrament alreadye consecrate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Reply pag.</hi> 40.</note> but rather other common breade. After this he alledgeth thrée sundrie aucthorities, that it maye be so taken, and in fine, hée sayth, how be it herein I will not striue. Other wordes then these Maister Iuell hath none, and is this to say <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> is not the sacrament? Hath he any such absolute saying? Or doth he affirme any whit at all? O that the Replie had bene of M. Hardings penning, he would then sure haue good matter against it. Now it is the bishops own doing, he can say little, and not corrupt his woordes. But marke Christian Reader, in this shooting, what ill fauoured feathers he hath vpon hys arrowes. The vpmost is corruption of M. Iuels woordes, the 2. that lye vpon the bow, the one is deceite, the other ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The corruption is already manifest, the deceite is, where he would haue thée to thinke, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> might not signifie bread, but where euer it were found, it shoulde make for hys transubstantiation. The ignorance is, in that he maketh it so straunge a thing, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> might signifie breade, not yet consecrate. When in his popish Masse before consecration the bread, and wyne are called <hi>sancta, &amp; illibata sacrificia,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and immaculate sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Concerning the word <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> it is found in the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament often times,<note place="margin">Actes. 14. 1. Cori. 4.14. Ephe. 5. 2. Cor. 4.9.</note> yet alway signifying either open thanks giuing, or else thankfulnes of the minde, so in that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> it is a good argument against tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation. An other marke, that Maister Harding could not shoote at, is, concerning the prophesie of <hi>Malachie,</hi> that it shoulde signifie the sacrifice of our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malachi.</hi>
                  </note> Of this mark
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8597:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reade the vntruth. An other make is this, that in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the aultare, ther is no vertue, but when it is vsed. This marke saith he, was out of my reach. But if he say true, he is then but a bragger, eyther he hath not read so much, as he pretendeth, or else he is a loytering truant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got so good a lesson. In this one thing he offendeth both waies, the godly, in that he wil not shoote at that marke, which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost hath set vp, the vngodly, and men of his owne deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that he denyeth any vertue to be in the water of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but when one is christined. For if it be so, why sing they ouer that water, where none is christined, <hi>sis fons viuus, aqua regenerans, vnda purificans. &amp;c.</hi> be thou a liuing spring a water of new birth, a water that doth purifie. &amp;c. Maister Harding cannot deny how merily this hath bene song in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, yet none haue bene christined I trow among them. And a Doctor of their own side, saith, <hi>si Asinus bibit aquam illam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>detra in Glossa.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>bibit sacramentum,</hi> if an Asse drinke that water, hee drinketh the sacrament. Whereby it appeareth they repose vertue in the water, though none be baptised. Yet in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they agrée not. <hi>Scotus</hi> sayth, it is <hi>Asinina quaestio,</hi> a question méete for an Asse. But of the water he sayth, it is cold, running, cleare, necessarie, and common, cold to represse concupiscence, running to turne the course of our disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, cleare to lighten our fayth, necessarye to bring vs into the way of health, common to all men. And in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this iudgement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In.</hi> 4. <hi>sent. dist</hi> 3. <hi>quest.</hi> 3.</note> it is written in the margine, <hi>doctrina singularissima,</hi> a most singular doctrine, fit lattin for suche a purpose, to attribute such vertue to the water. But M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will say, these vertues are in the water, as <hi>Scotus</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>in ipso fieri,</hi> but euen while the childe is a baptising. And of that opinion <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> séemeth to be, wher he saith such prayers as are sayde ouer the water,<note place="margin">3 <hi>part. sum. qu.</hi> 66. <hi>ad ter.</hi>
                  </note> are not necessarye, but onely for the solemnitie. But here we may ill beleue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Scotus,</hi> for Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> saith otherwise:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8597:52"/>
                  <hi>Siue paruuli, siue iuuenes,</hi> whether they be Infants, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be yong men, let them not come to the sacrament of regeneration, which is the wel of life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De cons. dis. siue paruuli.</hi>
                  </note> before the vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite be driuen away, <hi>exorcismis, &amp; exsufflationibus Clerico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> wyth the cuniurings, and the blowings of the Priests. And of this opinion is the Maister of the Sentences. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, howe little Maister Hardinges Doctours are manye tymes beholding to hym, that will so flatlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye their opinions. For if these thinges be necessary before the christeninge, then hath the water vertue in it selfe at other times, then the very tyme of christening. But thus muche he said rather against his Doctours, then against him self, for his wordes seme in this place to confesse a truth. There is no manner vertue in the water, but onely in the vse of it. But where he saith, it is not so in the sacrament of the aultare, but that there is vertue in it, though it be not receiued, that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the godly, and varieth quite from the worde of God, and robbeth vs of our great comfort, that we haue in Gods myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith: <hi>Panis quem frangimus</hi> the bread which we breake, is it not the communion of Christes body?<note place="margin">1. Cori. 10.16</note> For we being many, are one bread, and one body, bicause we be pertakers of one bread. By this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we might be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, if vertue be in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when it is not receiued, then we may be incorporate into Christes body, though we receiue it not, contrary to <hi>S. Paules</hi> doctrine, that saith, to be of this vnity, we must be pertakers of one bread. And here I woulde faine aske Maister Hardyng this question, if by these wordes <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the breade is become no breade, and a newe grace is put into it, whether it be receiued, or no? I demaunde, what if the bread be kept till it be consumed, concerning the flesh? He aunswereth, the Lorde departeth againe, when he is prophaned, or when he is denyed. What then is done with the grace? Doth it likewise returne? How is it then true, that the prophet wryteth, <hi>verbum meum non
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8597:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reuertetur ad me vacuum,</hi> my word shal not return vnto me in vaine. But how doth it not return in vain, when being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a dead creature. It returneth vnto him again w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out farther quickning his liuely image, which is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hardening the hart y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is already obdurate, to Gods further glory. Againe, be it thus that a lofe once consecrated be set before a stranger, who feedeth on it as vpon common breade, if ther be vertue in it,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 11.</note> he discerneth not the Lords body, so shoulde he receiue his own damnation. How could it be then true, that our sauiour saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.11</note> that, which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man, or that which <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, al things are cleane, to them that are clean, &amp; nothing is to be refused, that is receiued with thanks giuing. And in an other place, whatsoeuer is set before you, eate it, and aske no question for conscience sake. These say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cannot stande with Maister Hardings religion, about such questions, how the word of God might agrée with it selfe. Those busye heades might haue ben better occupied, then in mouing such doubtes, as a Christian heart adhorreth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. But if they had ben so occupyed in Gods most holy euangelies, as they were in <hi>Peter Lumberdes</hi> fancies, they woulde soone haue turned ouer these winde shaken opinions. Now while Maister Hardings friendes shal muse, how these sayinges may agrée, I will shewe thée godly reader, how the <hi>Eucharist</hi> hath no vse, except it be receiued. Consecrate while they will, crosse round about the bread, breath ouer it at their pleasure, looke demurely as they can, intend what they list, except the breade be receiued, no maner conueyaunce can bring Christes presence. Somewhat for proufe of this, maye appeare by the vsage of the pascall Lambe, and of <hi>Manna.</hi> Of the lambe nothing might be reserued til the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.10.</note> what did remaine, should be burnt with fire. Therfore we may coniecture it should not be lawfull to reserue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. So likewise of <hi>Manna,</hi> nothing might be reserued till morning,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.20.</note> if ought were had, it was turned into wormes,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8597:53"/>
and stanke. These being both figures of our sacrament, the coniecture is not euill, to thinke lykewise the <hi>Eucharist</hi> might not be reserued, then the case were plaine, it had no vertue, but being receiued. Howe be it, I wyll not force any suche comparisons. God doth lighten, whom it pleaseth him. The scriptures doe other where testifie plentifullye this, that we teache. First the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is to vs, as the peace offerings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, which was a sacrifice, or thanks giuing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for peace, or prosperitie, and as they that made any such offering, must doe it before the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation. &amp;c: so <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes sprinckled the bloude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the aultar, otherwise it had bene no peace offering. So we in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> must come to the Congregation, gyue thankes, and prayses vnto God, preache out the death of hys sonne Christ, and eate, and drink of that heauenly mysteries, or els it is not the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> And the church naming this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> hath well declared, that without open thankes-geuing, there is no suche sacrament. But who can doubt any whyt of thys matter, that readeth the woordes of our sauiour Christ, reported by S. Iohn, or the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and <hi>S. Paule</hi>? Labour for the meate, sayth Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6 27.</note> that the sonne of man shall giue vnto you. He sayth not, for the meate which is hanged vp in the Pixe. And the people make their aunswere, Lord, giue vs euermore of this bread. Againe Christ sayth, The breade which I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world. Ther is then no benefite, where this bread is not giuen, and in this chapter it is often repeated, that we must eate this flesh, or els we haue no lyfe in vs. Yet in all this place, nor in any place of scripture, any one word is found y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> commendeth, either mencioneth this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without the vse of it. So if we wil apply this .6. chap. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the sacrament, as M. Harding in anye wyse will doe, we sée how there is no grace, no vertue in it, if it be not vsed. Concerning the woordes of this sacrament, reported by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8597:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other Euangelistes, and by saint Paule, they are very plain: Take, and eate, thys is my bodye, saye they, and of the Cup: Drinke ye all of this, thys is my bloude. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But by M. Hardings doctrine, the holye ghost might haue spoken in this sorte: Looke all vpon this, and worship it, this is my body. And of the cup: Drinke none of you of this, yet it is my bloud. Such is the sacriledge of that wicked masse, in doing, to vndoe that our Sauiour hath saide. But here I cannot a little wonder at them. In their owne inuentions they haue placed in their Masse these words, <hi>accipite, mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and some thinke they are very requisite to transsubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: yet when they vtter them, they meane nothing lesse, than that any other, but them selues, should take part. They prepare but a litle cake, and a draught of wyne, to make sporte with. They intende not to communicate with other, yet they saye alway: take, and eate. A lye is very euill in any maner doing, but in the seruice of God, it is very detestable. God when he will, turne their hartes. Here we se concerning this sacrament, Christ commaunded nothing, but that we shoulde in a holy company eate, and drinke, in remembraunc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of his death, and passion. But how turneth the Pope, our sauiours commaundement? He careth neither for eating, nor drinking, but when he goeth forth, he setteth vp his sacrament vpon a white horse backe, and men of eche syde with tapers, and litle belles, and so teacheth the horse, that he will go to the aultare, and there knéele vpon his knées, till his Maisters god be taken downe. Thus will the Pope teach horses to worship God, euen as somtyme the Leuites woulde cary the Arke in a newe carte, when they brought it out of the house of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab.</hi> For neyther haue we any one word, to cary about the sacrament,<note place="margin">Sam. 6.3.</note> neyther had they of the carte. And this is a greate misery, that hauing no warrant for our Marchandise, our candels, our sensors, our vestiments, our oyle boxes, our corporasse, our por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8597:54"/>
other, yet we make no account of them as though they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God. If any thing séeme somewhat doubtfull, then we turne vs to Doctors, to councels, to decrees, to scholemen, and to the holy closet of the Popes owne brest, as thoughe Gods worde were not our wisedome, and our vnderstanding in the sight of all people.<note place="margin">Deut. 4.6.</note> But God be thanked for his owne ordinaunces, and lawes that are so righteous. Now to the next marke that Maister Harding coulde neuer shoote at, and this marke hath a great many péeces, and such as is not easly discerned, which is the greatest, so I knowe not certainelye wher at to measure. The first péece is this, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Priest, and the people, in the mystery of the sacrifice. But what meaneth Maister Harding, to finde the marke him selfe, and then refuse to shoote at it? Would he haue vs thinke, this were Maister Iuels marke? He saith no such thing. Sure M. Harding hath verye straunge artillery. His bow is made of slaunders, and it will shoote nothing else but lies. He can get nothing with cunning, therfore he would saue him selfe by facing. This stode them in good stede in the disputations at <hi>Oxford,</hi> wher their friends wer moderators, but in a booke that is written to all men, this shift is shameles. Let vs sée, what saith M. Iuell of this marke? Not one word. Why doth Maister Harding reporte it? He is disposed to lye. But whervpon doth he gather it? Forsoth out of <hi>Bernard,</hi> for he saith as Maister Iuell alledgeth, not onely the priest sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, but also the whole company of the faithful. But what maketh this for Maister Harding? The priest, and the people both doe sacrifice, therefore is there no difference in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterye? <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith, you are a kingly Priesthood, therfore is ther no difference in the function betwene the minister, and the laye man? True it is, that the minister, and the people do offer vp a lyke one sacrifice vnto God, but that maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Maister Hardings saying. Thus we se while he hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, and roueth, and shooteth at euery marke a lie, he was an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8597:55"/>
hypocrite, when he was at the best, and nowe is led forwarde still to be an open enimie. Reade the .222. vntruth. An other péece of thys marke, is this, that men, and women make the sacrifice of the aulter, and be Priests, after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech.</hi> Of this reade the .158. vntruth. The last péece of thys marke is yet woorst of all, nothing else but malice, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and wickednesse, here agaynst M. Iuell, bicause he wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not one such woord, and commonlye agaynst the truth of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>God is not au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thour of euill.</hi>
                  </note> which the wicked doe alwaye peruert. And this is that marke, that God is the author of euill, and driueth men to sin. What should I here aunswere, but euen saye with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:<note place="margin">Esay. 28.15.</note> The scornful haue said: We haue made falshood our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and vnder vanitie we are hid. If euerye such euyll say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myght clayme an aunswere, M. Hardings one Reioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would require many volumes. But for a sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of the Reader, I say in all M. Iuels booke, there is no one such woord. I adde further, nor in all the bookes that euer were wrytten by any godly man of M. Iuels profession. Let M. Harding, or all hys companions, in searching ouer theyr wrytings, bryng but one letter, whereby we may gesse that euer such a saying was ment, and for my part, let hys writings be approued. If he can not doe this, consider of hys religion.<note place="margin">Iob. 13.7.</note> He would not speake wyckedlye for Gods defence, nor talke deceitfully for his cause. If anye man require what our opinon is, let hym reade any learned man, intreating of the predestination of God, or of mans frée wyll, or for a better warrant, let him reade the scriptures it selfe. We say, al that God made, was very good. He created man in honour, and gaue hym frée wyll,<note place="margin">Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And agayne, God created man without corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And concerning sinne, we say,<note place="margin">Eccle. 15.16. Sap. 1.23.</note> through the enuy of the Deuill, came death into the

world. Neither néede we make exception agaynst this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, bicause it is not in the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the Apostle doth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize it, where he writeth: He that committeth sinne,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.8.</note> is of the Deuil. For the Deuill sinneth euen from the beginning. And in an other place: <hi>Diabolus est mendax, &amp; pater eius,</hi>

Now euen as the Deuill is authour of euil, so we by his suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue the next cause in our selues, which is an vncleane hart, lyke as our Sauiour saith: Out of the hart procéede euil cogitations. &amp;c.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.11.</note> Of God we say, and we say againe, and we preache it, and we wryte, and beleue it, and in it we reioyce, that God is neyther the author of euyll, neyther yet would it should be committed. The shepe goe astray, without the shepherdes wyll. The groate is lost, and the poore woman would not so. Christ woulde gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither Ierusalem, as the Hen doth hir Chickens, but they would not. But this we say, that the wayes of God, are not like the wayes of men, that he should not know what thynges were to come. He could not be deceiued in his own creature.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.19.</note> He did foresée the fall of Adam, and by his omnipotency could haue made him stand. For who can resist hys will? He coulde haue made him so pure, that he should not haue sinned, euen as he hath now made his Aungels, and wyll make the whole number of his elect,<note place="margin">Iohn.</note> that no man anye more shall take awaye theyr ioye from them.</p>
               <p>And as we are sure this is Gods omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, so why he did it not, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not assigne any cause, but bicause he would not.

To enter further into Gods

We haue so much corruption in our selues, that we néede no further prouoking vnto wickednesse. Now to Maister Hardings purpose, thus much we saye, that God permitteth synne, and with longe patience doth suffer the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction:<note place="margin">Roma. 9.22.</note> but yet this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission we say, doth appertayne vnto the will of God. For he doth not suffer it, eyther inforced, or against his will: neither yet doth he so suffer it, that he doth nothing him selfe. For he ruleth, and gouerneth, euen their iniquity. He suffereth it not, to rage at will, but guideth it, either to the punishment of the wicked, as he oft punished the Israelites with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of straunge Princes, or to the triall of his elect, as it is well acknowledged of the prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> saying of <hi>Shimei</hi>: he curseth,<note place="margin">

This therefore is our doctrine, God is no cause of wickednesse, but men cannot apply their owne wickednesse, but where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God, neither do they exercise their wickednes, but when, and how far his grace doth leaue them. For plainer declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, we may compare the grace of God, and the sunne, If the sunne be ouer the earth, ther is then light, if it be gone, then is ther darknes: yet is not the Sunne cause of darknes,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8597:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but such is the nature of the worlde, where the Sunne is not, there is foorthwith darknes: So God is the light, and man is full of darkenes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.4.</note> bicause of corruption which it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. When the light of Gods grace doth shine in this darknes, then man séeth his goings, and walketh forth in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but if the darknes do not comprehend the light, then man thorow his owne impurity, doth walke in all vncleanes: yet is not God cause of this euill doings, no more then the Sunne is cause that the worlde without it, is darknes.<note place="margin">Ion. 13.</note> But who so doth receiue this light, he is borne, not of bloud, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> And as S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith, it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy, for it is he that worketh in vs,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> both the will, and the déede, euen of his good pleasure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prophet <hi>Oze</hi> saith, thy destruction O <hi>Israel,</hi> doth come of thy selfe, but thy saluation is of me. Thus we se man doth of him self the thing that is euil, God onely doth that which is good, yet in such sort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what so euer is done in the world, good or euil, by consent, or vnaduisedly, God disposeth al. Chaunce, and fortune hath no place, all maner circumstances are at Gods will, to his glory, and the comfort of the elect. And this is plainly taught vs in that law of <hi>Moyses,</hi> wher he that presumptuously doth kil a man, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the aultar, that he may die. For there it is sayd, if any one do kil an other, &amp; haue layd no waite for him,<note place="margin">Exod, 21.13.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath offred him into his hand. So chaunce is no chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, fortune is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but God is all in al, &amp; therfore it is wel sayd of <hi>S. Ierom, nihil accidit bonorum, aut malorum temere, et sine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia, sed omnia iudicio dei accidunt.</hi> No good nor euill doth happen without a cause, or by fortune, without Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, but al thinges do happen after his iudgement. For al creatures are, as it were, Gods instruments, to vse after his owne counsell: yet man doth of him selfe, that which is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Thus vsed the <hi>Assirians,</hi> the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> the <hi>Persians,</hi> the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8597:57"/>
                  <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romains,</hi> they through their owne ambition made warre vpon the Iewes, but God appointed the tyme, when it should be a scourge for his peoples disobedience. So in all wickednesse God doth also worke, but he onely that which is good. In the punishment of <hi>Iob,</hi> the Deuil worked to satiate his malice against mankinde, God to the triall of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes faith, that he might poure againe his mercyes more abundantly vpon him. Christ was crucified on the Iewes behalfe, that they might worke, as enuy moued them, but on Gods behalfe, that he might paye the raunsome for the sinnes of the worlde. Now if this be to saye, God is the authour of euill, then hath Maister Harding founde out a true marke, if it be not, he then shooteth in a false ground, and his lying arowes are broken vpon vngodly stones. Thus it apeareth, what part we gyue vnto God in euill doyngs. And thys the scripture, when so it sheweth, how God worketh in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,<note place="margin">Exod, 4.21. Psal. 5, 4.</note> as wher it is saide, <hi>ego indurabo cor Pharaonis,</hi> I will harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Pharaos</hi> hart, we must know God is not he, that loueth wickednes. For God hath said of <hi>Pharao,</hi> I know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Egypt</hi> will not let you go,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.9.</note> but by strong hande. So his wickednesse was of his owne will, when God dyd not molle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his hart with new grace. But God did vse this wickednes for his glory, euen as he testifieth. For this cause haue I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thée,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.16.</note> to shew my power in thée, &amp; to declare my name throughout all the worlde. Now to aske further why God did not sende <hi>Pharao</hi> more grace in mekenesse of spirite: we must aunswer with <hi>S. Paul</hi>: O man, who art thou that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest with God? He hath mercy on whom he will, &amp; whom he wil, he hardeneth. Our wisdome is but foolishnes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, we must séeke no further, then Gods word hath reueled. Sure we are, he is a righteous God, &amp; sheweth mercy vnto thousandes of them, that loue him. So that, if by testimonie of our owne conscience, we hang vpon that mercy, and walke as he hath commaunded, the lesse we sée is in our selues, the more sure is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8597:57"/>
our hope. For how often we thinke on him, so many testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies we haue of hys loue, and we are sure no man can pul vs out of his hands. And thus we doe sée the markes M. Harding coulde not shoote at, méete markes for Christian Archers, saue those, which he him selfe hath set vp. With which markes, bicause he was neuer acquainted, we haue to vnderstand, that as he is now a professed enimye, so he was then a dissembler, and a man pleaser. Therfore we yeld vnto him this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that he hath not taught the Gospell in such sinceritie, as we teach it now. We beleue him with out his oth, he shal not néede to take God to recorde, that hath brought their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to confusion.</p>

For if he hath spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, then he hath confessed those fiers are but paintings: if he haue thought wickednes to be in the Masse, how could he not abhor these former wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? But we must pardon him in speaking not considerately, &amp; he will prouide to speake litle truely. Once he spake against purgatory, an other tyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Masse, but very modestly. In déede they be such ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der chicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Popes brood, that if ye handle them roughly,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8597:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they will surely dye. But if Maister Harding do speake now from his hart, when he is so vehement: doubtlesse if he were then so modest, he was an hipocrite. Now his zeale is so much to his holy father of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he spareth no reproches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods ministers. Then his deuocion was so cold in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Gods glory, that he could not spue out his déepe dissimulation. But what skilleth it how he preached then, sith he is now reuoked, and like a dogge is returned vnto his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite? Here he sheweth vs the cause why he was conuerted, or rather peruerted. And in that he is not constant, as he was before in his Religion, the grace of God (saith he) and the study of more matures yeares did instruct me otherwise. This cause doth sufficiently confute it selfe. For Maister Harding chaunged his Religion in seuen dayes, in which he had not many yeares to study<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor yet quiet time to deliberate. Héere followeth a little iesting at the name of Ministers, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Metaphores, to the defacing of their preaching, all not woorth the aunswere. And in déede who so would scoure away all that froth from his writinges, should leaue him in most places, nothing but white paper.</p>

               <p>In this paragraphe before, Maister Harding saith, that the grace of God, &amp; more mature yeares did better instruct him. But he had little hope to finde many yeares in seuen dayes, therfore now he saith, that Gods especial grace, &amp; the change of the Prince, did change him also. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whether of both did helpe, many yeares in a weeke, or the change of a Prince, he hath called God to witnes to a lye.

And for further proofe of this, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs when he was made priest, as though he had taken the charecter of the beast, and fallen downe, and worshipped hir, by the mocion of the holy Ghost?

                  <hi>¶You did once confesse to mee plainly in Sarisbury, when ye came thither in visitation, that you neuer lyked the Supremacie of the temporal Princes ouer the Churche of England. Did you not tell mee, that it stode neither with Scripture, nor with Doctours, nor with the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned men of Germany, Geneua, and the parties where you had ben?

               <p>As touching this priuate talke of Maister Iuell, had with Maister Harding at <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> concerning the Quéenes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, it is a malicious lye of Maister Hardings vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable hart. If it were true: yet I might well aunswere with the Philosophers, that there are .iiii. sorts, in whome is singular impudence, in a woman, that putteth on a mans gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a gheast, that thinketh him selfe as good, as his hoste,

Now if this accusation were true, yet what witnesse hath Maister Harding to crye out of his impudency. But what if it be false? What if it be a shamelesse lye? A christian man will saye with weeping eyes: God amende the euill spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. But <hi>Demosthenes</hi> sayd to the people of <hi>Athens</hi>: If you sée a Uiper, or a byting Spider, though they did neuer sting you, yet you will kill them, <gap reason="foreign">

If this accusation were true, the very Gentiles could not abide it, if it be false, they thinke M. Harding not woorthy lyfe. And that it is false, his own words are a sufficient witnesse, which say, he spake after the opinion of the learned men in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other where, who do all graunt that their is no authority in the earth next vnder God aboue the authority of a Prince, and that in all causes, and estates ecclesiasticall, and temporall, euen as <hi>S.

Suche blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous authority giuen vnto the Pope, made, that in the time of restoring the Gospell, euen good men attributed more vnto the Prince, then was conuenient, and flatterers more then was to be borne with all, as in the time of the sixe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and his felowes, did vnto King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, when they gaue him authority, in the church of God to institute or disanull Lawes, as it lyked him best, to forbid the mariage of ministers, to deny the people the cup in the Lords supper. The graunting of such authority is flattery in the subiect, &amp; the receiuing it, presumption in the Prince. The church is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spouse of Christ, purchased with his precious bloud, and ioyned vnto him, euen as a woman vnto hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande. The Prince is héere a subiect, and may set the church no Lawes, but as hir heade appointed. Christ doth sanctifye his church with the washing of water through the worde, that is, with baptisme,<note place="margin">Ephesi.</note> and the preaching out our iustification in

his frée mercy, if the Prince say it shall be sanctified, with crossing, and créeping, with diredges, and Trentalls, with holy Breade, and holy Water, with Pilgrimage, and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers, the Prince is rebellious, and the Subiect must yéelde his lyfe. Then for a briefe conclusion, if the Prince wil make any new holynes, or forbid the minister to preach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, that is written, or if he will say we shall Prophecie no more at <hi>Bethel,</hi>

If she shoulde héere of enimies, hir owne conscience shoulde make hir without feare, if all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie should stirre vs to rebellion, she should sit vnmoueable. The Lord hath placed hir, and who is he shall put hir downe? She is a good nourse of Christes misticall body, and no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is alone hereof, yet in all this supremacy we tye hir vnto the worde of God, and as she hath regard vnto hir owne soule in the name of hir God, we charge hir not to go beyonde it, In this is hir prerogatiue, that she can inforce other to this obedience, and no man can enforce hir.

               <p>Hitherto Maister Harding can not deny his turning, now least it should preiudice his estimation, he thinketh good to commend it, true it is, he turneth well, that turneth for the best, it is better to returne, then to run alwayes euill, but whether you haue made this turne, or no, it must be tryed not by your worde, but by the truth of God. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doeth aske the question how one shoulde turne aright,<note place="margin">Psal. 118.9.</note> and doth aunswere him selfe, by taking héede vnto Gods worde. Now I appeale to Maister Hardings conscience, what part the worde of God did worke in his turning, he maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall crying out of the church, the church, but very déepe silence of the worde of God. Yet Christ saith, heauen and earth shal passe, before his word do passe. <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith: We may not beleue an Angell, that preacheth any other doctrine. <hi>S. Iames</hi> saith: It is the word, that can saue our soules. <hi>S. Peter</hi> saith: It is as sure, as the voice of God him selfe, that was herd from heauen, and what meane these men vnder a vaine title of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8597:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
church, so to neglect it? Christ promised to be with his church vntill the latter end of the world,<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> but his word is his presence, not mans inuentions, his Euangelies are our learning, not supersticious ceremonies. The dayes are now come, that we shall say no more,<note place="margin">Ier. 3.16.</note> the arke of the couenaunt of the Lord, but by Christ alone we must make our prayers, and by him alone offer vp the sacrifice of praise vnto God, that is the fruit of our lippes which confesse his name. Therfore if you will make a good turne, you must turne to that church which turneth only vnto him, and to the simplicity of his Gospell. But you haue put on the adulterous attire of straunge intercession, and clothed hir selfe with altares, and altare clothes, with Copes, vestimentes, Awbes, Tunicles, Curtaines, Sensors, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestickes, Crosses, and such other. You are not turned from errour to faith, but from the church of God, to the synagoge of the deuill. And for our owne defence with the prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> we make aunswere vnto the blasphemers:<note place="margin">Psal. 118.42</note> Our trust is in the worde of God. After this Maister Harding findeth fault with to much constancye, and considering his owne changes, woulde haue it seme some commendation to turne vp, and downe a little. Then he bringeth in the examples of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and certaine heretickes, which in their owne opinion were founde to obstinate, and compareth Maister Iuell with them in wilfulnesse, and otherwise speaketh contumeously against him, and for all this, will be iudged by his Reioinder. Nowe consider good Reader what maner of wryting this is. In long talke before he required that his doings might be wayed, and doubted not, but Maister Iuell should be founde the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant. Then fearing that he coulde not colour the great difference betwen them, excuseth his own turning, as though he had done well. Now that his writings might be as vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, as his lyfe hath ben, he ouerthroweth quite his first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, and confesseth that Maister Iuell hath ben as obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as euer was <hi>Arrius,</hi> or any hereticke, which had rather
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8597:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dye, then in any point to seme to relent. If this be true, wher is all that a doe which was made about the sixe articles, and I know not about what subscription? O M. Harding, <hi>oportet mendacem esse memorem,</hi> it behoueth a lyer to be mindfull. Giue Lord vnderstanding, and M. Hardings writings shall néede no aunswere, one leafe doth confute an other. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning these examples, which he vseth, it appeareth, that as in these tragedies he hath set apart al honesty, so in mani places he hath more shew, than learning. How can this saying agrée with it selfe, some had leuer suffer death, then to séeme at any time to haue ben out of the way, they vse examples of <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Nestorius, Eutyches.</hi>

Sure for my part, if it be so, I will reuoke that I haue written. But this I must forewarne them, I doe not take it for vntrue, to say their Pope is Antichrist, and their Masse Idolatrous, and their church a sinagogue of iniquitye.

               <p>After sundry waies atempted, how Maister Harding might bring our doinges into suspition, at the last very modestlye he doth leaue vs vnto God, but by and by he breaketh out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8597:67"/>
he cannot suppresse his coler, and for a full proofe that all his fayer speaking is hipocrisy, he raueth streight so out of measure, that he doth excéede him selfe, not prouing anye thing, but as if his worde were <hi>Apollos</hi> oracle, he presumeth with out controlle to speake what he listeth, and goeth away so fast in his frothy matter, that contrary to his woonted cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he forgetteth how to speake, for after a great heape of words, of which euery one according to his number doth spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie a new vntruth, he writeth thus. Leaue to do as not only through your whole Replye, but also through your first article you haue done. Who euer spake after this maner? what wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? what scholer? what childe? when <gap reason="foreign">

After this vncomelye speaking he bringeth in very absurd matter, and chargeth Maister Iuell, bicause he bolstreth vp his Religion with the authorities of late wryters. Yet where Maister Harding brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth one sentence out of the olde fathers, giue me leaue in a doutfull matter to vse one of Maister Hardings gesses, Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iuell, I thinke bringeth twenty.

                  </gap> a shamlesse behauiour in him selfe. He chargeth Maister Iuel with culling out of sentences who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his whole aunswere word for worde, and findeth no fault with him selfe, that skippeth at aduentures, sometime
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8597:68"/>
two leaues at once, and aunswereth not a worde. Againe, about this he vseth a heap of vaine words, as though in much bibble babble all controuersy were decyded. This maner of wryting doeth make me remember a certaine <hi>Lacedomian,</hi> which tooke a nightingale, and pulling of hir fethers, when he saw hir little body, thou art euen a voice saide he, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and surely Maister Harding is but a nightingale take away his fethers, that is his gaye wordes, and there is nothing but a little withered carcase vnderneth. He accuseth Maister Iuell of a childish wit, but with how childish a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who séeth not? I will make no comparison of the man, he hath nothing, which he hath not receiued, if any man doe not thinke hym as well learned as anye Englishe Loua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, if <hi>Apollo</hi> might awarde him his hyre, he shoulde haue <hi>Midas</hi> eares.

               <p>Now Maister Hard. hath gone well forward in vntruthes, as the violence of his nature draweth him, he falleth into a paradoxe. If you vse a mans authoritie (sayth he) it is reason you subscribe vnto his religion. What reason is there in these words? or who would speake thus, that knew what to speake well? Doth not Mayster Harding meane to blind the eyes of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8597:69"/>
the simple, when he will aduenture to speake such monsters? or hath he not little to say,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> where he taketh hold of this? Christ vsed the testimonie of the Scribes, and Phariseis, of <hi>Pindarus</hi> an Ethnike Poet. S. <hi>Paule</hi> of <hi>Epimenides.</hi> Yet it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Christ should subscribe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewish religion, <hi>Paule</hi> should become an Ethnike, I néede not make this long by examples, they are in maner infinite euery where to be founde. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mayster Harding maketh this so straunge, I must put him in mind of a saying that <hi>Tullie</hi> vseth against <hi>Verres: Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um testimonium,</hi>

He bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Mayster Iewell leaue off to fill his readers eares with vaine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plut.</hi> Phil. 2.</note> &amp; false fables. Now <hi>Lucullus</hi> may haue leaue to speake like <hi>Cato.</hi> &amp; <hi>Antonie</hi> to accuse <hi>Tullie,</hi> for placing shakebuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Capitoll. <hi>Gracchus</hi> may speake of sedicion, and <hi>Verres</hi> may reproue men of theft. Maister Harding doth find fault with fables. I must aunswere as <hi>Tullie</hi> doth: <hi>O miseru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> siue haec tibi nota non sunt, sine sunt, qui apud tales viros tam impudenter loquare,</hi> O wretched man whither he know it, or know it not, that speaketh so shamelesly vnto his readers. Mayster Iuell hath not one tale to proue any article. Maister Harding and his companions haue aboue one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to proue their religion, and howe could it be otherwise, when the Legend it selfe, whence they fet their diuinity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lyes. After this, bicause Mayster Harding can espy neuer a fable auouched by Mayster Iuell, he thinketh good to charge him with that, he sayth not, wherby such as will beleue him on his word, may think at the least he hath brought som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for himselfe, and vpon some such consideration this he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

               <p>Here, Christian reader, thou hast foure lyes in foure lines. First sayth he, Mayster Iuell findeth much fault with me for one fable, that is one lye, for Mayster Harding hath manye fables, one out of <hi>Abdias.</hi> diuis. 5. an other oute of <hi>Leontius.</hi> diuis. 32. the thirde out of <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> diui. 33. beside all the allegations out of other petie Doctours. This is then one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, forasmuch as M. Hardings words seme to acknowledge but one fable. The second lye is, that it is reported by men of good créedite, and that is not so. <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> are of little better credite in their histories, then <hi>Arthur</hi> of little Brittaine. I haue not numbred their lyes, but sure it is, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them haue so fewe as a thousande. For triall, read the bookes, and if thou go ten lines without a lye in <hi>Antonius,</hi> thou must light vpon the couer, and in <hi>Vincentius</hi> thou shalt not séeke much further. These Authors then are not of good credit. The thirde lie is, that maister Iuell is not so well able to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the histories of <hi>Victor, Henrie,</hi> and <hi>Hildibrand.</hi> For he can hardly alleage any of lesse credite then <hi>Vencentius</hi> &amp; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius.</hi> But let the defence of the Apologie be a triall of this matter. The fourth lie is, that these fables are Mayster Iuels owne. For he doth not so much as once say they be true, but onely writeth that this it is reported, and he alleageth <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8597:70"/>
contractus,</hi> neyther in that place doth Mayster Iuell care whether they be true, or no. But Mayster Hardings tale of <hi>Amphilochus</hi> is soothly auouched, set out with many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and made a solemne proufe of his priuate Masse. Yet I haue heard many better tales tolde by olde women of Robin goodfellow. Then the warest councell that I can giue him, is, if he will further his Masse, let him speake no more of fables. The residue of this Epistle, which is very little, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning certaine vntruthes, which are aunswered in theyr places, the maner and forme of wryting is still like it selfe, full of vncomely wordes against the Replie. At the last he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus.</p>

Nowe to ende. If you feare not God, to whome of so many vntruthes you shall giue account, yet reuerence man, of whose word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly estimation you depende.

Of this shalt thou haue this great benefite, that when thou hast duely try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that is written, thou shalt cleaue in the ende to the truer part, and finde the saluation of thine owne soule. Read them with an indifferent, iudgement, and beleue as the spirite of God shall moue thée. If Mayster Harding say true, that in this first article there be .225. vntruthes, for my part I craue no parcialitie, saye boldly Mayster Iuell is not, as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. But if this be false, and Mayster Hardings report be altogither slaunderous: then pray that he may soone repent, and confesse that godly, and learned Bishop, to be a faythfull labourer in the haruest of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This first vntruth is that Mayster Harding in his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere beginneth not with a Cauill. The question is moued,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8597:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether within the space of .600. yeares after Christ, there were any priuate Masse. Mayster Harding maketh answere, that euery Masse,<note place="margin">Hard. diuis. 1. linea. 1.</note> concerning the oblacion, and Communion is common, as likewise it is concerning the first institution, and will of the Priest,<note place="margin">Linea. 6. Diuis. 3.</note> But in consideration of place, tyme, audience, purpose, rytes, and other circumstances, it may be priuate. The vntruth lyeth, whether this answere be a cauill. Here we may aunswere two wayes. One after the common vse of speaking, an other after the nature of the worde. For our common speach it is certaine, we call that a cauill which is a drawing of any word knowne wel inough, into a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge signification, as Mayster Harding vseth here his Masse. For who knoweth not that by priuate Masse, we doe meane that, which the priest practiseth alone at the altare? Nowe here to come in with this distinction, which (I wéene) neuer before was heard of, what is it else but to Cauill? Thus if we follow the common speach of men, this is no vntruth. If it lyke M. Harding to sticke vnto the nature of the worde, let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and so sée whether this distinction, be a Cauill. <hi>Cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio,</hi> saith the Lawyer, <hi>est subdola ratio, quam conscij nobis mendacii proferimus,</hi> a Cauill is a subtile reasoning, which we our selues know is false, but yet we vse it. Nowe if this distinction be false, and that Mayster Harding know well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, then is it manifestly a cauill. The distinction is this. Euery Masse by institution, will of the priest, oblation, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is common, as touching persons, place, time, &amp;c. it may be priuate. Nowe first whether the Masse by institution be common. <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> sayth, as touching the substaunce, and first institution of the Masse,<note place="margin">Biel. in can. in proemio. ca. 1. &amp; 2. Biel cap. 3. &amp; de consecrat. dist. 1. hoc quoque in glossa.</note> there is nothing necessarie, but, in the thing, bread, and wine, in the priest, orders, good pronunciation, and a pure will. These being rightly had in all places, at all tymes, whether any be present or no, <hi>Missa rite celebratur, verum est sacrificium.</hi> The Masse is truely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, there is a true sacrifice, therfore Masse by institution is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8597:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not common. If Mayster Harding will replie, and say, that euen in such Masses, the sacrifice is effectuall to the whole Church, and so the Masse is common, that aunswere were very childish, and would bréed dissention in their own church. For both <hi>G. Biel</hi> denieth it in plaine wordes, and the thing it selfe altogither disagréeth. <hi>Biel</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Biel. ca. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>impeditur tamen fructus, eò quòd inordinatè, &amp; indignè consecratur, &amp; sumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> though the Masse be a true Masse, yet there is no fruite of it, for as much as consecration, and communion are vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and vnworthily ministred. And for the thing it selfe, M. Harding knoweth the benefite of his Masse is so applied, if their be one to aunswere in the name of the people, but in these Masses it is not required,<note place="margin">Biel. cap. 3.</note> that anye one be present to make aunswere. It followeth then, that some Masse by no meanes is common, and so Ma. Hardings distinction is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. I passe ouer for breuitie the beginning of this Masse, how it hath nothing of the Apostles. And before the sixt Synode of <hi>Constantinople</hi> no part of it was euer song in Latine, but this spoken of <hi>Biels</hi> authoritie, is proufe sufficient for thys present purpose.</p>
               <p>The seconde thing that we haue to consider, is whether the Masse be common by will of the priest, or no. And thys question though it be hard to decyde, yet we may haue some probable coniecture, why the priest doth not alway meane to bestow his deuocion vpon euery man. We haue had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe, rising vpon the disagréement of the priest, and the lay man, that vpon the displeasure conceyued, we woulde say one to another. Let him neuer be in thy <hi>Memento.</hi> If as the Philosopher sayth, the voyce of the people be the voyce of nature, then it is certaine, that sometyme the priestes wyll was, to abbridge the commoditie of this common Masse, and in his <hi>Memento</hi> to seclude some from this common benefite, so that euen in this poynt Mayster Hardings distinction is a méere cauill. Againe concerning this will of the priest, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8597:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might aske of Mayster Harding, what maner of Masses Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the .vii. said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> minded nothing more than sorcery, or the priest, that poysoned Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the thirde in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or such priestes as I haue knowne some in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that when they haue played all night at dice, in the morning being called away to Masse, haue sworne a great othe, that they would make hast, and come againe. A man had néede to knowe his condicions well, that would ground his Religion vpon the priestes intent. Thus it appeareth, that neyther by institution, nor will of the priest, euery Masse is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the oblation, and communion, how can they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when in some of their Masses they haue none at al. First, their is no oblation without bread,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>in Can. Miss. catech. par.</hi> 2. <hi>Decretal de cele.

But in some of their Masses y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of wine is forbidden, as appeareth by pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> therefore in some of theyr Masses there is no oblation, or sacrifice. Then how can that bée common, which is not? Likewise it is manifest in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, how can that be made of the priest, without bread, and wine? Nowe is there no excuse remayning, why this distinction being false should not be a cauill, except Mayster Harding will say, him selfe did not knowe so muche. Yet if he doe, that will not serue. For the very nature of a cauill is onely this,<note place="margin">

               <p>Mayster Harding hath purposed to espie a great many of vntruthes, and fearing least they should not amount to their iust number, he thinketh good where oportunitie serueth, to make of one, eyther two, or mo. For where Mayster Iuell sayth, this distinction of Masse, is but a cauill, bicause the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Masse is knowne: Mayster Harding here noteth two vntruthes, one, it is no cauil, an other, it is not knowne. And what néedeth this doubling, if through vaine babling he did not think to blind the eies of the simple? Who euer would denie, both antecedent, and argument, both where they hang one of another. The noting of this vntruth, is a good proufe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other was a cauill. Whether the signification of Masse be knowne or no, small proufe will serue, let the worlde bée iudge. But whye is Mayster Harding so pleased with hys owne distinction, that vpon it, he will fownd mo vntruthes? Forsooth he is a defender of antiquitie, and such distinctions are very auncient, more than 2000. yeare agone, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> made such another, and stoode stifly in it,<note place="margin">

               <p>If Maister Harding doth not giue it these titles, then can it not be denied, this is an vntruth. Yet what occasion maister Iuell had to report them, for his better discharge, I thinke it good to admonishe thée. In the Canon of maister Hardings Masse, when Iacke an apes is at all his gestures, the rubrick, that maketh all the sport, doth bid the priest, sometime to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his deuocion vpon himselfe, somtime vpon his parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, sometime vpon his father, and mother, sometime vpon those that are by, sometime vpon all men, and at the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chalice, the priest sayth. <hi>Offero pro peccatis meis, pro salute viuorum, requie defunctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I offer this for mine owne sinnes, for the health of the liuing, for the rest of the deade, and for whom soeuer it liketh the priest.

one vntruth. It is reported, sayth mayster Iuell, of Pope <hi>Hildibrand,</hi> that he was a sorcerer, of <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, and Pope <hi>Victor,</hi>

The first of <hi>Hildibrand,</hi> the seconde of <hi>Henry,</hi> the thirde of <hi>Victor.</hi> Concerning the truth of these histories, pardon me good reader, though I dare say nothing. I can not mend that which M. Iuell hath written, Reade the defence of the Apologie. God for his mercy sake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that good Bishop, to the accomplishing of many other such labours. As touching our present purpose. No man I trow, but Maister Harding would haue noted any vntruth. Maister Iuell doth onely say, these histories are reported, and so they be, as thou thy selfe must néedes confesse. What if they be false? yet it is the errour of the historie, no vntruth in mayster Iuell. What if no man defendeth Papistrie, but enimies of Gods worde, and true religion, yet we may say, that Papistrie is defended? We may say of <hi>Gargantua,</hi> that it is reported. Of the Legend of lyes that they are written. Of <hi>Basils</hi> priuate Masse, that <hi>Amphilochius</hi> telleth it, and yet is there no controuersie, but these are all lyes. Then what if it were not, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> were a coniurer, yet it is reported, yea, and thou thy selfe, good Christian reader, vpon the sight of mayster Iuels booke, shall confesse it was so. But here I must require of thée a little to consider, the vnegall dealing of these english <hi>Louanists.</hi> Maister Harding in his aunswere speaking of <hi>Abdias,</hi> sayth that he sawe Christ in the flesh, that bicause it is altogither false, maister Iuell noteth it for one vntruth. Now commeth maister <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of this vntruth, he sayth.

And shall lying <hi>Abdias</hi> be a sufficient

ground for maister Harding, to say, this is true. And shall not so many good wryters, be a warrant for maister Iuell to say this is reported?

               <p>We had euen now thrée vntruthes in one sentence, if these were to many, in token of some moderation, here is one aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet such successe hath this vntruthmaker in his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, that euen these two can not stande with his honestie. This is maister Iuels allegation. <hi>Lira</hi> sayth, many miracles are wrought in the open Church, to mocke the people. Of these wordes thus doeth Maister Harding gather two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. The first, <hi>Lira</hi> sayth it not. The second, he sayth not to mocke the people. Here would I faine learne of Maister Harding in the first vntruth, <hi>Lira</hi> sayth it not, what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it, if he doe meane the whole sentence, why doth he repeate this peece, to mocke the people, and so maketh an other vntruth, if he meane <hi>Lira</hi> hath all but this, why doth he note the residue for an vntruth. If he meane that <hi>Lira</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sayth this, nor the other part, why doth he not marke mo vntruthes. The first, as it is one generall, <hi>Lira</hi> sayth it not. The other deducted perticularly out of euery word, as, he saith not there are many. He sayth not there are many miracles, he saith not, they are wrought, he sayth not in the open church.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8597:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He saith not to mock, &amp; so this last he saith not to mock the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This would well haue furthered M. H. number, to haue had .vii. in stéed of two, &amp; sure the sentence hath no priuiledge, but that in euery part, it may as wel be broken off, as in this one. But sith it is so, M.

Reade then the place, thus he wryteth. <hi>Similiter sit in ecclesia maxima de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio populi in miraculis, fictis a sacerdotibus,</hi>

Let Mayster Harding denie it, and denie it, and denie it againe, these are <hi>Liraes</hi> very wordes, let the booke be iudge. And what fault is there in mayster Iuell, who reporteth of <hi>Lira,</hi> that many fayned miracles are wrought in the open church, to deceyue the people? Forsooth, sayth M. Harding, <hi>Lira</hi> saith not that miracles are wrought. Yet <hi>Lira</hi> sayth, <hi>similiter fit,</hi> in like maner it is done. Further,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioind. fo.</hi> 9.</note> sayth M. Harding, he sayth not in the open Church, yet these are his wordes, <hi>in ecclesia,</hi> in the open Church, for what meane Gretian woulde denie, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to call assemblies. Last of all, maister Harding denieth that <hi>Lira</hi> saith to mocke the people. Yet thus <hi>Lira</hi> wryteth, <hi>maxima deceptio populi fit in miraculis.</hi> The people are very much deceyued with fayned miracles. But it foloweth in <hi>Lira, propter lucrum temporale,</hi> for temporall gaine, and therefore, sayth mayster Harding, it was not to mock the people. Nowe sure this is a very ill defence of hys friendes. <hi>Turpe lucrum res pessima,</hi> filthy gaine is the woorst of all thing. That it is, which hath layde to sale Masses, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Trentals, Dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Iubileis, Pardons, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

Purgatorie, and all the Popes pedlarie. This defence the truer it is, the more it verifieth Mayster Iuels saying. For he that hath pleasure in such gaine, would haue some pastime in the peoples errour. But I pray mayster Harding was all your miracles for gaine? When S. <hi>Andrevv</hi> saw dogs run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after a hare,<note place="margin">

And to come nerer home, among vs, when Roodes were made sweat, or roll their eyes, or nod theyr heades, what gaine was their in it? When Christ and our ladie came downe to walke vpon the aultare, when foure angels came downe to minister the Chalice vnto the Abbot, when the Crucifixe did walke from the sepulchre to the aultare on Easter day in the morning. When twentie such other miracles were made, was it all for gaine? Ten thousand haue seene it, and neuer cost them pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Then we our selues are witnesses, that sometime blinde miracles were wrought onely to deceyue the people.

So <hi>Donatus</hi> sayth, we vse by right, and dutie, we abuse with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, which is a rooted vice. <hi>Vtimur cùm honore, abutimur cum iniuria.</hi> So <hi>Pighius</hi> graunting <hi>Plerosque abusus</hi> in his priuate Masse, meane what he will thus he sayth, that in hys Masse of malice, of set purpose, of a wicked desire, Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are iniuriously abused. This doe the very wordes enforce. Yet I doe not thinke that <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> did so meane it, though his tong would not let his hart to lye, but as it were some iniury to racke the worde so farre, so is it great folly to denie that it may well be englished errours. Yet about this vntruth Mayster Harding maketh so great exclamations, as if he should declame for the victorie. Such <hi>Hercules</hi> buskins, he can applie to little leggs, and make so great vaunts, where himselfe is furthest deceyued.</p>

               <p>Maister Harding may score vp his vntruthes after what sorte it pleaseth him, but any indifferent man must needes thinke that Maister Iuell doth not falsifie his wordes, when he layth them altogither euen as they are written. If in repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of any part of them he doe mistake the meaning, such error deserueth verye little blame. But bicause M. Harding is so farre driuen, that if he should let slip euen the least ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, he shoulde sustaine great losse of his whole cause: let vs examine all that is reproued, and yéelde vnto the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that may appéere faultie. I say not, saith he, that <hi>Abdias</hi> was conuersant with Christ. But he sayth he saw Christ in the flesh, and wrote diuers histories of the Apostles doings, at which he himselfe was present: of this to say he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with Christ, is scarce worth the fault finding. Yet maister Harding sayth stifly, he onely sawe Christ in the flesh, he was not conuersaunt with him. By like he looked through the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with <hi>Eubulus,</hi> when Christ helped Saint <hi>Basil</hi> to Masse, and by that meanes <hi>Abdias</hi> could but sée him.</p>

                  <hi>Luke</hi> borrowed hole stories of <hi>Abdias,</hi> or <hi>Abdias</hi> of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> By this it appeareth <hi>Lazius</hi> is well content if you thinke S. <hi>Luke</hi> borrowed his writing of him.

Yet let vs admit that <hi>Lazius</hi> saying were sufferable. I aske of M. Harding, how a disiunctiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position may be improued without affirming, or denying one certaine part. Besides this, it is no newes to <hi>Wolfangus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> to speake sometime at randome, when he should speake truth. He hath other wheres many absurdities, and some both slaunderous and odious to rehearse, ywis by good account, a man may easily finde more lyes in his bookes, than frier <hi>Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> can chalenge in <hi>Sleydaines</hi> commentaries, but let them go. For this present matter, Maister Iuell eyther in contempt of this vaine imagination, or for the more appearaunce of so great an absurdity, without any suspicion of vntrue dealing, may before all good men report these wordes, as he doth.</p>

               <p>If we marke M. Iuels wordes well, we shall sufficientlye be forewarned. As touching these vntruthes, he maketh, saith Maister Iuell, many shamelesse lyes, and sayth he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Apostles doings. Here maister Harding can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no vntruth, concerning <hi>Abdias</hi> shamelesse lying, but for his presence at the most of the Apostles doing, that saith he is nothing so. Let vs take that which by silence M. Harding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8597:85"/>
confesseth, and then if <hi>Abdias</hi> haue many shamelesse lyes, how can he further Maister Hardings Masse? or if he haue not, why is it not noted for an vntruth? By like he thought that by speaking nothing of <hi>Abdias</hi> lies, they might be forgotten, and by calling them to tryall, <hi>Abdias</hi> should be quite shamed. For my part I meane not to meddle with them, they are mo in number then in short time may be recited. Onely I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise thée to reade the booke, due tryall shall be surest iudge. As touching this present vntruth, whether he were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant with the Apostles or no, it maketh no great matter, what skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, what he was, or what time he liued? It is smale credit to <hi>Esopes</hi> fables, that the author liued in king <hi>Croesus</hi> dayes. Yet for maister Hardings pleasure, let vs sée this vntruth. He sayth not, sayth maister Harding, that he was present at most of the Apostles doings. I aunswere that it is not necessary to be very scrupulous in reporting of <hi>Abdias</hi> his wordes, it is more then he deserueth, if we vouchsafe to recite his meaning. Thus much maister Harding and <hi>Abdias</hi> do say, that he was the Apostles scholer, that he was present at the death of Saint Andrew, and Saint Thomas, &amp; at the doings of Simon, and Iude, which were all Apostles, and of all this is it much, if we say that he was present at the most of the Apostles doinges? Such is this <hi>Abdias.</hi> He hath deserued yll maister Hardings friendship. His credite is so little, that he can not further hys priuate Masse. His doings are so vnreasonable, that they can not be defended without shame. But the prouerbe is verified, like will to like. An ill cause hath most ground in vnsufficient witnesse, and an ill patrone is best content with vnable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>

               <p>This vntruth is little worth, and soone aunswered. It may be gathered sayth Maister Iuell. But saint <hi>Augustine</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of <hi>Abdias</hi> saith M. Harding. It is true in déede saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth not name him, for if he did, there neded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no gathering. The thing were plaine. It is an easie thing to find many vntruthes, if we make our aduersary to say, what wée list.

But this we haue to note by the way, for the better credite of maister Hardings <hi>Abdias,</hi> that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth those tales for lyes, which <hi>Abdias</hi> telleth for a certaine truth. Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tale of <hi>Maximilla,</hi> wife to <hi>Aeges,</hi> which maister Harding saith is not reported in the same sort by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> as it is by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> first we must knowe both <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Abdias</hi> meane the same woman, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .31. vntruth. Then <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh of hir, as of a foolish &amp; vaine tale. <hi>Abdias</hi> speaketh of hir doings, as of true, and weightie stories. Thus it appeareth though Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> doe not name the parties, yet he agréeth in the tales, and when this shall be knowne, the .27. vntruth shall be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. That it may be gathered, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> meaneth of <hi>Abdias,</hi> &amp; these thre latter vntruthes, which are but the proufe of Maister Iuels coniectture, shall appeare so good, that before the true christian reader, the quoting of them shall séeme but wrangling, and this new counterfeit <hi>Abdias</hi> shall be reiected, as a teller of dreames, and a lying wryter. And for our great comfort, god will bring to passe, that when it shall be knowne to the indifferent reader, that Papistrie can not stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such shamelesse doctors, they shall begin to learne, that it is a shamelesse doctrine.</p>

The booke be like is so full of lyes, that he is sure no man can speake any good of it. But how so euer he be affectioned, we must thinke of authors no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then we finde them. He is not yet Pope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may erre, his word is no good witnesse of an other mans meaning. <hi>Gelasius</hi> whome so euer he meaneth, certaine it is he may meane <hi>Abdias</hi> for the worthinesse of the booke. And whereas maister Harding for some proufe of his side, sayth that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth certain actes of Martyrs which are thought to be written by infidels, <hi>Gelasius</hi> hath not one such worde.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioin. fo.</hi> 42.</note> But where as maister Harding saith further for the discharge of <hi>Abdias,</hi> that <hi>Gelasius</hi> speaketh of one <hi>Quiricus,</hi> and <hi>Iulita</hi> his mother, this is a mocking of his reader without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of honestie. First what kindred was betwéene these two, it skilleth not much, but <hi>Iulita</hi> may as well be his daughter as his mother, for any thing that <hi>Gelasius</hi> sayth. But let the kindred go, maister Hardings reason hangeth thus, <hi>Gelasius</hi> reiecting one hundreth bookes, among other nameth the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Quiricus, ergo</hi> he reiecteth not <hi>Abdias,</hi> and this is all the reason on which he groundeth this vntruth, reade his Reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Nowe way on the other side, what cause Maister Iuell hath to thinke <hi>Gelasius</hi> ment <hi>Abdias,</hi> and vpon conference of

               <p>If this be a burthen of vntruthes, no doubt the substaunce of them is very little. For take away the .32. vntruth, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> meaneth not <hi>Abdias,</hi> and the .33. vntruth, that <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> meaneth not <hi>Abdias,</hi> and except <hi>Eubulus</hi> come, that saw Christ helpe <hi>Basil</hi> to Masse, all this burthen of vntruthes is like to be vndone. As touching the vntruthes, there is inough saide already. Whether they ment of <hi>Abdias,</hi> it appeareth that maister Harding is to blind a iudge to gesse so boldly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Here I must put thée once againe in minde of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of these vntruthes. First Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh not of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> the .2. nor of Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> the .3. nor of <hi>Abdias</hi> his <hi>Maximilla,</hi> the .4. nor of <hi>Abdias,</hi> the .5. nor <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius</hi> speaketh of <hi>Abdias,</hi> the .6. nor they two speak of <hi>Abdias.</hi> Thus the whole being ioyned, is but one true proposition,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8597:88"/>
yet out of it after his maner of cutting maister Harding hath carued .6. lies. And thus much of lying <hi>Abdias.</hi>

yet so many as the maker would haue them, when one is told so many tymes. If this were vntrue that maister Iuell wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, yet were it not two vntruthes, but one. But bicause there is no remedie, we will take them euen as they fall out. As touching the former of these two it néedeth no aunswere, Maister Harding doth not denie it, but that <hi>Iohn Colet</hi> hath both spoken it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioin. fo.</hi> 44.</note> and preached it, then what skilleth it whether it be written, his preaching is a witnes of his opinion, though maister Harding say nay. For this other vntruth, that such other, as deny this <hi>Dionysius</hi> to be the true Areopagita, are no graue men: he is sure no graue man, that hath noted it. I may aunswere this with the wordes of Saint <hi>Paule, horum laus non ex hominibus,</hi>

                  <hi>sed ex deo,</hi> these mens prayses are not of men, but of God. Maister Harding should not for his modesty sake haue noted it for an vntruth, to call the godly fathers of our age graue men. His belligods, Popes, Cardnals, Friers, Monkes, Priestes, &amp; others of that ken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As touching this <hi>Dionysius,</hi> whether we haue his workes, or no, it is a thing soone iudged. How vnlike is it, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of <hi>Dionysius</hi> should be mencioned by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the actes of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> yet he him selfe would not mencion it once in al his workes? or if this might be, yet what may we thinke of that, that in all his booke he doth neuer so much as once name <hi>Paule</hi>? May it yet be doubted, whether he be that <hi>Dionysius,</hi> which <hi>Paule</hi> conuerted? Besides this, S. <hi>Ierom</hi> making purposely a rehearsall of all ecclesiasticall wryters, speaketh not one worde of this <hi>Dionysius.</hi> Other auncient fathers doe neuer alleage him, his owne bookes are so strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge fansies of many secrete misteries, that sure it is, he is not the true Areopagita.</p>

And for as much as the thing must trie it selfe, let vs somewhat better examine it. Maister Harding sayth in the .5. diuision of his first booke, that <hi>Ciril</hi> hath expounded the Masse vsed in Ierusalem. Maister Iuell noteth this for the .12. vntruth, saying that <hi>Ciril</hi> expounded the communion, and not the Masse. Maister Harding returneth this vntruth againe, saying it was the Masse, and not the Communion. I might with as great facility denie this again, and say it were the Communion, and not the Masse. But by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my testimonie were in this not of weight, I am content

to be furthered with the witnesse of maister <hi>Stapleton.</hi> Hée sayth plainely, that maister Harding brought not this for proufe of the question,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to laugh out of season is a great miserie. Had this defence of his <gap reason="foreign">

A manifest proufe all his Gréeke is not much, and a great coniecture, that much of his diuinitie is out of tables, but him selfe knoweth best what he is for this defence of his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it is no doubt folishe, and of so great store, he hath made very yll choyse. For in this sentence by him alleaged <gap reason="foreign">

may saye somewhat to be at some dissention, euen with hys friendes, and thus much of this. Let the reader examine these places, and he shall sée whether maister Hardings worde be a good warrant, that in consecration they all be full agréed. And sure this great disagréement is so much the more blameable, for as much as if they woulde haue followed their supreme head the Pope: there had bene no controuersie in this matter. For by his censure, the very words of the canon in the Masse, are the wordes of consecration, vsed both by Christ, and hys Apostles, although none of the Euangelists haue expressed them.<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">57</note>Now resteth the .57. vntruth to examine, whether <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> doe say that <hi>benedixit,</hi> he blessed, worketh consecration. Maister Harding standeth stiffely in it, and doth aduenture his credite, that they say it not, and being to much inflamed against Maister Iuell, he writeth with a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that of al the men, that euer wrote, he had least cause to bring <hi>Scotus</hi> for his purpose, and that he is very rashe in so doing.

               <p>
                  <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Innocentius,</hi> saith Maister Iuell, doe say that <hi>benedixit</hi> worketh consecration. That is a false lye sayth M. Harding. Then vppon good tryall let the truth appeare, and let vs here what the Authors themselues say. <hi>Scotus</hi> in déede sayth thus, <hi>verba consecrationis sunt quatuor, hoc est corpus meum.</hi> There are 4. wordes of consecration, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. If <hi>Scotus</hi> had said no more, then maister Harding had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged all. But it followeth a little after, <hi>sed haec verba, hoc est corpus meum prolata sine praecedentibus, non significant hoc absolute.</hi> But these words pronounced without the other wordes going before, do not absolutely signifie this, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration is done. Loe <hi>Scotus</hi> sayth not as maister Harding reporteth him, that consecration is wrought by these foure, but saith he there is no consecration if the wordes afore which are the blessing, be left out. And now to auoyde all vaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling about these words. <hi>G. Biel</hi> sayth, speaking of the same matter. <hi>Quid si verba praecedentia omitterentur. Respo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>detur, licet hic Scotus sit alterius opinionis tamen hoc communiter tenent doctores, quòd haec quatuor sola sufficiunt ad effectum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrationis.</hi> What if the words going afore be omitted, it is aunswered though <hi>Scotus</hi> be here of an other opinion, yet the common sentence of doctors is, these foure are sufficient. Here besides the manifest words of <hi>Scotus, G. Biel</hi> is also a witnesse
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8597:101"/>
that as maister Iuell sayth, this is the common opinion, but <hi>Scotus</hi> thinketh, that the wordes going before are necessarye. If then <hi>Scotus</hi> owne wordes, and <hi>G. Biel</hi> witnesse are better proufe of <hi>Scotus</hi> meaning, than Maister Hardings imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is true that the consecration is wrought by the whole blessing. And this other saying before alleaged by M. Harding must be thus qualified, that in that place, he saith those are the especiall words.

               <p>Concerning <hi>Innocentius,</hi> whether he thought consecration was wrought by <hi>benedixit,</hi> he blessed: if Maister Harding had regarded his owne credite, he would not haue denied it.

                  <hi>Accedat verbum ad elementum</hi> sayth Saint <hi>Augustine, &amp; fit sacramentum.</hi> Let the worde come vnto the element, and it is a sacrament. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> here maketh no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at all, he biddeth not consecrate the one with whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, the other with open voice, as maister Harding biddeth, he teacheth no difference of grace in them both, as Maister Harding teacheth. Likewise Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth. <hi>non aqua omnis sanat,</hi>

                  <hi>sed quae habet gratiam Christi,</hi> not all water healeth, but that which hath the grace of Christ. And againe, water healeth, if the holy ghost doe come downe, and sanctifie it. And againe, water healeth, if the voyce of the father be heard from heauen. So this operation of the trinity is the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the consecration of the water. This like operation doth make the bread, and wine, to be our heauenly food, as M. Harding must néedes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, so the consecration of either both is one. If he say the wordes of consecration must be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the minister, whereby, as by a meane, God doth poure his grace vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and ioyneth vs vnto him: I confesse it is so, and those wordes are these, take, eate, this is my body. So in baptisme after our prayers made vnto god, we pronounce the words of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration, wherby we know that gods mercy doth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8597:102"/>
sanctifie vs, and the bloud of his sonne doth washe away oure sinnes, and those wordes are these. I baptise thée in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. So we sée thus farre the consecration in either sacrament is one. If he make any difference in the wordes, for the maner of speaking, in that it is sayd, this is my body. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> speaketh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of baptisme that it is <hi>lauacrum regenerationis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.</note> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of our new birth, now lay these all togither. By the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist we be ioyned vnto Christ,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.</note> kéeping the feast of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer with the vnleauened bread of sinceritie, and truth. By baptisme we be sanctified and clensed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 26.</note> by the washing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through the worde. The Eucharist is sanctified by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wordes spoken of the minister in the person of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ: so the water doth washe away our vncleannesse by being baptised in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy ghost. The Eucharist for the high, and dreadfull misterie of the body of Christ, by sayth féeding our soules, is called the body, the water for the heauenlye operation which God worketh in washing away the naturall vncleannesse in which we are borne, is called the regeneration. And therefore the consecration of them both can not be diuers. M. Harding after his maner may a little dasell simple eyes, but his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth beare him witnesse, that this doctrine is true. But here I must confesse, that the popish consecrations, if maister Harding doe meane of them, do differ much the one from the other, and both from Christes institution, as I haue shewed in the epistle. So Maister Iuell speaking of the sacraments of christs Church, and saying consecration is lyke in both, sayth not vntrue, though the iuglings of the antichristian Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue are neuer so diuers.</p>

And you that will not be deceyued good christian people hearken, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth not, sayth M. Harding, the worde which we preach. And to proue this true he alleageth many lines out of the same place, in which lines it is not. But, <hi>ò singularem impudentiam. Antonie</hi> out of doubt was neuer so past shame. He sayth, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath not, which we preach, and thus he alleageth <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes, <hi>verbo dei sine dubio, vt mundare possit, consecratur,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8597:103"/>
&amp; baptismus,</hi> if it were no otherwise, yet this worde of God must be preached, for how else shoulde it be heard,<note place="margin">Ro. 10.</note> and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe fayth. But now Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>hoc est verbum fidei, quod praedicamus,</hi> saith he, thys is the word of fayth, which we do preach, with which word doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse baptisme is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated, that it may purifie vs. That which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith <hi>hoc est &amp;c.</hi> this is the worde of fayth, which we preach, Maister Harding turneth thus <hi>verbo fidei,</hi> by the worde of fayth. What clipping, what nipping, what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering is this? O if maister Harding had such a vauntage, how would he turne his phrases? How would he sport himself, with reperitions of corrupting the fathers? Well thou séest this is no vntruth. Reade his Reioinder, and conferre it with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> thou shalt soone discrie his behauiour. Here hast thou christian reader to note, that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith the worde doth consecrate, <hi>non quia dicitur, sed quia credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> not bycause it is spoken, but bycause it is beleued. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> this popish consecration is gone, they néede not feare that by common vse the wordes should be contemned, or vnwares they should work straunge miracles. Without fayth they haue no vertue. What these wordes be, I tolde thée in the .60. vntruth, out of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in the Eucharist, <hi>accipite, comedite, hoc est corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> take, eate, this is my body.

               <p>What can be more contrarie, than to say participation is of Christes institution, and againe, partakers, that is number of communicants, are not of Christs institution? In the lords cause, we will speake as the lord speaketh, heauen, and earth we call to witnesse, whether this be not contrarietie. Yet M. Harding, and I trow euen onely maister Harding, is so bolde to note this for an vntruth. But the vntruth is sufficientlye aunswered in that the indifferent reader may sée the wordes.</p>

               <p>Here Maister Harding and his friend <hi>Stapleton</hi> doe not well accorde. For Maister Harding skippeth one vntruth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of communicants, Replie. fo. 20. diuis. 3. which maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> maketh the .22. vntruth. And least we should thinke it little worth, he maketh the same againe the .23 vntruth, and for a full conclusion shutteth also the .24. vntruth in it. Yea, and though it stand here for .3. vntruthes, yet as if al they were not sufficient, he made it once afore the .19. vntruth. So much maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> maketh of one vntruth, which maister Harding accounteth not worth numbring. But the matter is not great, he loseth nothing here, that he will not finde in an other place. As touching this vntruth, these are M. Hardings verie wordes. Concerning the number of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants in one place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diuis</hi> 8.</note> that they iangle so much of, it is no part of Christes institution. For Christ ordeined the sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consecration. &amp;c. Nowe turne these wordes in forme of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and they stand euen as maister Iuel placeth them, Christ did ordeine the sacrament after consecration. &amp;c. <hi>ergo</hi> the number of communicants is no part of Christes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If these be Maister Hardings owne wordes, as sée the booke, and thou thy selfe shalt iudge, thou canst not be so simple, but thou must néedes sée this argument is no worse than himselfe hath made it. But bicause in this place he also
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8597:106"/>
fashioneth one: and in great confidence of his owne cunning, writeth in the Margent of his booke (an argument proponed to M. Iuell to be considered,) I will doe him no wrong in chaunging his woords, but for that loue which I haue to M. Iuels profession, in his behalfe I will as I can consider of it after his owne making. But first I must aduertise thée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he setteth vp his mishapen building, he layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of an ill fauored stomacke: and saith by M. Iuel, that it is easie for a scoffer, to scoffe at arguments framed of his owne scoffing head. And so it is easie for an euill speaker in defence of his wicked Doctrine, to reporte vnchristianly of Gods minister, where suche vnquiet passions do leade away vnderstanding. It may be, he may finde fauorers: but where the God of peace hath engraffed more moderation, truthe shall not be preiudiced with suche vntrue behauior. Muche other frothe ensueth in great plentie, before we come to the proposed reason, euen as a rotten wound defileth many clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes that are about it, but let it be troden out with silence, that cannot be remembred without muche loth somnesse. At the last he commeth to his argument, &amp; after his owne graue considerations, thus it is fourmed.
<q>What so euer is beside Consecration, Oblation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 96.</note> and Participation, is beside Christes institution. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Communicants in one place, is beside these thrée. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the number in one place is no parte of Christes institution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of this argument M. Harding boasteth much, and in any case will haue M. Iuel yelde vnto the Conclusion. But softe M. Harding, extorcion is no conclusion. If you will enforce a graunt, whether it be made or no, you can by that be neuer the neare your purpose. Therefore for as muche as you haue set forthe your argument, (as you say) to be considered, you séeme very vnconstant, so soone againe to claime the conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But you s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, if we wil not yelde vnto the reason, we must denie the <hi>Minor</hi> or second proposition. True it is the <hi>Minor</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:8597:107"/>
is false, but we are not yet come at it. The <hi>Maior</hi> that you thinke so sure, is made of false and vnlawfull stuffing, as by this consideration, that you require, shall well appeare. The proposition is this. What so euer is beside Consecration, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and Participation, is beside Christes institution, first this is false, and teacheth wicked doctrine. For preaching out of the Lords death vntill he come,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Co.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> is a parte of Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And our sauiour biddeth, do this in the remembraunce of me, that is with due celebration of all my benefits bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon mankind, which must then be preached vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And if it be not so done, then Christes institution, notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing M. Hardings argument, is flatly broken. Nowe as this preaching out the Lords death, is of Christes institution, and yet not rehersed in this first proposition, wherby this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is shewed false: so those other things, which are reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it, as M. Harding meaneth them, are none of them of Christes institution. By co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration he meaneth the pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of these words, this is my body, which must be done as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse boke straightly chargeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rubrica. in can. miss.</hi>
                  </note> bothe secretely, and with one breath. By oblation he meaneth Christes reall body to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vp vnto the father. By Participation, he meaneth that the priest alone may take it at the Altare, and no one of these is of Christes institution. Nay they all are contrary vnto it. So that this proposition wheron he groundeth his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wanteth somewhat, and therefore is not true, that which it hath is altogether corrupt, and therefore it containeth muche pernicious doctrine. First as touching Consecration, S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith, as is alleaged in the .56. vntruth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is wrought <hi>verbo fidei,</hi> by the worde of faith, which we preache. So saithe <hi>Iustinus</hi> martir,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iust. mar. Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Ire. lib.</hi> 5.</note> that it is sanctified, <hi>per verbum precationis, &amp; gratiarum actionis,</hi> by the word of prayer, and thankes giuing. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>quando mixtus calix, &amp; fractus panis percipit verbum Dei, fit Eucharistia corporis, &amp; sanguinis Christi,</hi> when the cuppe mingled with wine and water, and the bread being broken, hath the preaching of the woord of God ioyned vnto
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8597:107"/>
it, then it is the Eucharist, and this was the only Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on .200. yeres after Christ, neither any where any other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: except in M. Hardings Decretal Epistles, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are of credite, nor yet teach good religion. This same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Consecration is taught vs by <hi>Cyprian, Dyonisius, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus, Ambrose, Augustine,</hi> and suche other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyp. li.</hi> 3. <hi>ep.</hi> 1 <hi>Dyon. ep. ad. ixistum. Amb. de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> as liued within the first .600. yeares after Christ. Although I graunt (as appeareth by diuers recordes) many solemnities of the Masse were farre spread through superstition, yet this exacte kinde of close Consecration is muche yonger. This Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on likewise, as it was then vnknowne, so now it is of all Christians to be detested, that a mortall man should offer vp the immortall God, as I haue already shewed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle. For Participation bicause maister Harding can not proue his Priuate Masse, within the sixe hundreth yeares, and the woord doeth enforce, that it is no Participation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be a number to take their partes, I thinke it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth sufficiently, that in a Popishe Masse they haue no manner Participation, or Communion, so we sée this <hi>Maior</hi> is all together false, before we come at the <hi>Minor.</hi> Now if we will further examine the <hi>Minor,</hi> we shall finde it false al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, altogither without salte or sauor, for thus it is in effecte. The number of Communicantes is no parte of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is bothe a very childishe, and grosse absurditie. For how is there a Communion, where is no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes? Thus thou séest good Reader, this argument is not yet good. But the better to consider of it, bicause maister Harding will néedes haue it considered: let vs take the view of it once againe. This is the argument.
<q>What so euer is beside Oblation, Consecration, and Participation, is no parte of Christes institution. But the number of Communicantes in one place, is beside these thrée. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the number is not of Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

Harding saith to it him selfe. There is nothing héere saith he to be denyed, but the <hi>Minor,</hi> what, if it were so? What is now the <hi>Minor</hi>? Read the Reioinder, thus he saith. It is denyed in the <hi>Minor,</hi> that the number of Communicantes together in one place is of Christes institution.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 97.</note> Why? how now M. Harding? is this the best argument you can make? Marke good Reader, this must be the <hi>Minor.</hi> The number of Communicants together is no parte of Christes institution. Lay now the <hi>Maior</hi> to it, and the argument ariseth thus.
<q>What so euer is beside Consecration, Oblation, and Participation, is no part of Christes Institution. The number of Communicants is no part of Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. The Conclusion is as before. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants is no part of Christes institution.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Did euer M. Iewel father vpon M. Harding suche a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen argument? This is his owne, or else he belieth him selfe, when he saith that this is his <hi>Minor.</hi> But suche sleights he can vse to vnwinde him selfe out of danger. A pretie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyaunce of a litle forgerie among the ignorant, might haue escaped blame. But I wil not iudge M. Harding, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether he did it of purpose or no. This in déede should haue ben his <hi>Minor.</hi> But the Communion of many togither, is beside these thrée, so the Communion might haue bene without Communicants, which is a great absurditie, and so consequently M. Hardings argument very euil. As touching further triall of this vntruth, his wrangling is not worth the consideration. Only as he hath set forthe his argument, to proue a number of Communicants no part of Christes insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, so he shall giue me leaue to propone likewise some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for proofe that the Lordes supper may not be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate by one alone. First thus we argue.

<q>It was not among the Iewes, lawfull to eate the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Lambe without a sufficient number. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the flesh of our sauiour Christ, who is our Passeouer, must not be eaten by the Priest alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise it may be said of the gathering of Manna in the morning, and of the drinking of the rocke. I doubt not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 16 21.</note> but here M. Harding can make a spedy answer, with many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons betwene the figure, and the truthe, but the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may easily iudge. Beside this S. <hi>Paule</hi> him selfe dothe giue vs in this case a very good argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he saith. <q>

                     <p>The bread which we breake,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Co.</hi> 10.16.</note> is the Communion of the body of Christ. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there must be a number at the breaking of it.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And for a full proofe of this matter, Christ sayth.

               <p>The argument which M. Iuel saithe, hath no piece either true, or hanging of an other. Is thus before alleaged.
<q>The Sacrament must be receiued after Consecration. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a number is not necessary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Héere saith M. Harding. This is true y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the sacrament must be receiued after Consecration. But how doeth he proue it. Sure with no reason, but a great deale of railing, saying that M. Iuel is led with the sprite of malice, &amp; that he will reuoke this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 96.</note> when he is in his right minde. Or if he will not, let him take <hi>manducate &amp; bibite,</hi> eate ye &amp; drink ye, out of the gospel. As touching M. Hardings railing, bicause his mouth is no sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I wil let it passe. His reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration must not be before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Communion, then let <hi>manducate &amp; bibite,</hi> be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the gospel. One that had so long disputed of good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should now haue taken héede how he had made one so ill. This will in no wise holde, except you turne him contrary and so ouerturne M. Hardings cause with his owne proofe. For before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangelists speake the words of Consecration, this is my body, they say all take and eate, so that this folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well, if Consecration must be before receiuing: then take <hi>manducate</hi> and <hi>bibite</hi> out of the Gospel. For in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell they are placed before. How M. Hardings argument hangeth, if Consecration be not before the Communion, then take <hi>manducate &amp; bibite</hi> out of the Gospell, neither M. Harding him self, nor all his Doctors are able to tell vs. And this did <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> sée well inoughe, who considering this place of the Euangelists, that they were bid take and eate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the woords of Consecration pronounced, he doeth not as M. Harding doeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Biel in can. mis. lec.</hi> 36.</note> speake neither rime, nor reason, only to mocke the people. But he saith plainly that the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8597:109"/>
is, Christ spake not as the Euangelists report, take, eat, this is my body, but quite contrary, this is my body, take eate, thus hath <hi>Biel</hi> found a figure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to set the cart before the horse, and so maketh his religion to agrée with the gospell. Now as touching this vntruthe, where M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding saith so boldly, that the bread must haue these wordes, this is my body, pronounced ouer it before it be receiued, first he hath <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> against him, who all bid first eate and then pronounce these wordes. Againe it is confessed by <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> that we must thinke Christe spake otherwise than the Euangelists reporte his words, or else they could not agrée with their Masse, this is a sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this vntruthe.

that where M. Iuel alleageth M. Hardings owne wordes, he printeth them in a distinct letter: but this saying which so grieueth M. Harding, is in the common letter of M. Iuels words, wherby master Harding might haue wel vnderstand, had he not bene disposed to wrangle, that master Iuel allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them not as his expresse words, but rather sheweth how he should haue made his saying plaine, and this he proueth by authoritie of <hi>Bessarion</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> that after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration the sacrament be not receiued onely, as maister Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sayth, but receiued of a company, which word, as it must, so being expressely written, master Harding did directly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against himselfe.</p>

I require héere of thée, good Christian Reader, to viewe the woords well, and finde out any fault if thou canst. Surely I thinke, thou canst finde none, like as sure it is M. Iuel did thinke of none. But these two pair of Egles eyes, what haue they espied? Forsothe wher M. Harding saith, it is not called the Communion of Communicating togither in one place, M. Iuel thus reporteth it, it is not called the Communion of Communicating togither, and leaueth quite out in one place which maketh all the matter, this distinction of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating together, and Communicating together in one place, bicause it is somewhat straunge, these men should haue done well to haue proued it by some Doctor. Sure M. Harding if he may goe for a Doctor, he teacheth vs plainely in an other place, that to Communicate together, is to Communicate in one place.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8597:112"/>
taught now, that they be no more seales, and witnesses, but causes of our iustification? God kéepe vs from suche spiders, that gather poison of so swéete floures. And that thou maist take the more héede of this mannes doctrine, I must first tell thee, that for proofe of it, he bringeth not one worde of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but pretendeth the aucthority of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Cyril.</hi> I would answere the aucthoritie for suche Doctors, saue that the labor were long, and not necessary. For I will declare out of the Scripture, that the doctrine is hereticall, and thereby thou shalt be satisfied, and maist further imagine that these holy Fathers names are too muche abused. In this vntruthe of M. Hardings, he teacheth two points of Doctrine, the one, that by, and thorow the worthy receiuing of the Sacrament, we be ioyned vnto God, the other, that the Sacraments are not only seales and pledges, but also they containe grace. Now let vs sée how these two Articles agrée with the worde of God. And first, whither the receiuing of the Sacrament do ioyne vs vnto God, and as M, Harding saith, putteth also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs life immortall. Our Sauior Christ in the Gospell after S. Iohn, doth often tel his Disciples, how they are made one with God, yet in that holy Gospel, as in all other scriptures, there is not one worde that telleth vs we be made one with him by receiuing the Sacrament. But contrarily by plaine words we be taught, what vertue this Sacrament hath, that it is onely a signe of that grace, which we haue receiued, as shall appeare héereafter. In the sixthe chapter of Iohn, where Christ reproueth the fleshly hearers of his worde, and calleth them to a true beliefe in him, the Iewes make this answere. What signe shewest thou then, that we may sée it? Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eat Manna. &amp;c. Héere is first shewed what the Iewes thought of Manna, not that by it they were ioyned to God, or receiued grace, but that it was a signe, a token, and a pledge of their frée election, how they were a peculiar people vnto God. This Manna being a figure of this Sacrament of the body, and bloud of Christ, now lest vnto the Churche. Christ
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8597:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
maketh this aunswere, I am the bread of life, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me shall not hunger,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.35.</note> and he that beleueth in me, shall not thirst for euer. By this we learne, that to beleue in Christ is to haue euerlasting life, and as Manna was a signe to the Israelites, so the Communion of the body and blood of Christ is a signe to vs, that this promisse shall be made sure. It is written in the Prophet:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay.</hi> 54.13.</note> and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord: of this saying our sauior Christ teacheth vs how we be ioyned vnto him, and sayth. No man can come to me, except the father which sent me draw him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.44.</note> And to this ende it is written by the Prophet Ieremie. After those dayes sayeth the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33.</note> and I will be their God, and they shalbe my people. Of this we learne, that if we come vnto Christ, the Father must draw vs: if we be his people, he must be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teacher: if we be vnited vnto him, he must first come and dwell in our hearts: whereby it is plaine, that we must be first engrafted in Christ, before we can worthely receiue his holy Sacramentes. Furthermore it foloweth in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he that eateth my fleshe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.36.</note> and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. Therefore we must dwell in him, and he in vs, or we can not eate his body, and drink his bloud. And the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked which dwel not in him, can not receiue him. Again, where our Sauior Christ doeth teache very largely how we be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him, and become one with him, euen as his Father and he is one, he sheweth that this societie doeth come vpon vs of his Fathers frée mercy apprehended by Faithe of his woorde. And for declaration of this frée mercy, he reporteth it oftentimes, that we are giuen vnto him of his Father, as: <hi>manifestaui nomen tuum ijs quos dedisti mihi,</hi> I haue made knowne thy name vnto those which thou hast giuen me,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.6.</note> and: <hi>tui erant &amp; mihi dedisti eos,</hi> and: <hi>omnia quae dedisti mihi a te sunt,</hi> and: <hi>serua eos quos dedisti mihi.</hi> All things that thou hast giuen me, are from thée. Kéepe them that thou hast giuen me. They were thine, and thou hast giuen them me. And that we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8597:113"/>
should know that to be giuen to Christ, is to be ioyned vnto him, he addeth <hi>vt sint vnum sicut nos,</hi> that they may be one as we are one. This is also proued by all suche places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as shew that we be saued by grace. Thus we sée our ioyning vnto God, is first to be giuen vnto Iesus Christe of his Fathers owne good will. And this is on Gods behalfe, the eternall secrete purpose whereby we be made his. The other way whereby we be made his, is Faithe of his worde, when by inspiration of the holy Ghost, we apprehend in Christ the frée loue of his Father, and that héereby we be ioyned vnto God: it is in like manner often declared by the Scripture. Now are you cleane (saith Christ) through the word which I haue spoken vnto you.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.8.</note> And in an other place I haue giuen vnto them the woords which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowne surely that I came out from thée, and haue beléeued that thou hast sent me. Likewise <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.27. <hi>&amp; Ioh.</hi> 17.14. I haue giuen them thy worde. Againe sanctifie them with thy truthe, thy worde is the truthe. And to the ende we should all know this instruction were oures, our Sauior saith further, I pray not for these alone, but for them also which shall beleue in me through their worde. And now for proofe that this is our ioyning vnto God, it foloweth that they all may be one, as thou, O Father, art in me, and I in thée, euen that they may be also one in vs. This manner of ioyning vs vnto God, was shewed vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> in that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where he saw a ladder reaching from the earthe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Angels going vp and downe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12.</note> teaching vs that Christ was likewise the ladder by whome we climed vp, and were ioyned to his Father. This was likewise shewed in the thirde of <hi>Mathevve,</hi> where the Heauens are opened,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.</note> and the holy Ghost descended vpon Christ, signifying that he hath reconciled heauen and earth, and ioyned vs againe vnto God, and we by faith made partakers of that benefite. Thus we sée the manner of our ioyning vnto God, first in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal secrete purpose, after apprehended of vs by faithe. Now

this standing thus, that the promise might be certaine vnto all the séede, God hath sealed this hope with the body &amp; bloud of Christ, that we being partakers of those heauenly myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, might assure our conscience of his eternall mercy, that the gates of Hell should no more preuaile against vs. Thus are our Sacraments, signes, tokens, warrantes, gages, pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our saluation, and doe not, as M. Harding teacheth, ioyne vs vnto God, but he sayth further, they poure into vs life immortall, and dothe boldly affirme it, yet we may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue him, without great preiudice to Christ himselfe. I tel you plaine saithe M. Harding, they put into vs eternall life, but Christ saith, I know that Gods commaundement is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life, and to put it out of doubt what commaundement he meaneth, he saith in an other place, this is eternall life, that they know thée to be the only very God,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Sacraments, he could not but gape after this Popish heresie. This is a religious article in the Popes kingdome, that Sacraments doe giue grace, but what they doe, it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently already declared, beside that their names doe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beare witnesse of their efficacie. They be called Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or couenaunts, which cannot be the thing it selfe, but the pledge of our iustification. In Baptisme, if Christ doe not baptise with fire, and with the holy Ghost, the water of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration doth not auaile. Therfore S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith: ye that are baptised into Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11.</note> haue put on Christ. By which one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence all M. Hardings doctrine is ouerthrowne. For neither the water ioyneth vs vnto God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27.</note> neither yet giueth vs grace, but that is wrought only by our faith in Christ. And therfore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8597:114"/>
S. <hi>Paule</hi> writeth of Circumcision, that Abraham was first iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and after receiued the signe of Circumcision,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</note> as this seale of the rightuousnesse of faith, which he had whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was vncircumcised. By all this it is manifest, that grace is first giuen vs fréely from aboue, and then the Sacrament is lefte vnto vs as a warrant that Gods promisse shall be fulfilled. Thus we sée, that touching the Sacramentes M. Iuel saithe nothing otherwise than the Scripture teacheth, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe that M. Harding would so faine note, is nothing else but his owne heresie. And now, for as muche as M. Harding hath called vs into so long a discourse of Gods Sacraments, I desire of thée good Christian reader, to marke indifferently the great difference in this behalf, betwene the Christian and the papall Religion, &amp; thou wilt soone, as I doubt not, abhorre their great deprauing of Christes institution, which in that sinagoge is so miserably rent in pieces, that scarce any parte of it is kept inuiolate. Christ did institute his supper for this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> purpose, that he might Communicate with his disciples.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.15.</note> They appoint their Masses, that they may receiue alone. Christ in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his supper was the only offerer, they in their Masses will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as wel as he. Christ blessed with giuing thanks, they blesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with making Crosses. Christ did Consecrate with the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the word of faithe, they doo Consecrate with whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and breathings. Christ said, take and eate, this is my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> body, they say neither take nor eate, yet it is his body. Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Disciples sate downe and eate it, they bid vs fall downe and worship it. Christ said, he would drinke no more of the fruite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of the vine, they say there is no fruit of the vine at all. Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> saithe drinke ye all of this, they say drinke no man but the Priest alone. Christ saith, doe this in my remembraunce, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> is, shew forthe my death vntill I come, they of Christes death and passion doe not preache a worde. I will prosecute this repugnancie no further. It greueth me to remember their ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sacriledge. God turne their hearts, and giue them vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they may once know, and confesse that his Religion

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8597:115"/>
consider good Reader what manner of Communion it is that M. Harding would make when the Priest saith Masse in the Church, and calleth no body vnto him, yet he sayth that al the Priestes in the world which say Masse at the same time doe Communicate with him, and be made one body of Christe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. Héere I aske of M. Harding how he agréeth with S. Paule y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saith we are one bread &amp; one body,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> bicause we all are partakers of one bread. Marke reader because we eate of one bread, we become one body saith S. Paule. Bicause we say Masse at one time, we become one body saith M. Harding, though we eate not at all of the same breade. Sure these two Doctoures doe not agrée. S. Paule saith moreouer the bread which we break, is it not the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Christ, M. Harding saith, though we breake not the same bread, but be eche one of vs by our selues at our altares, yet it is the Communion of the body of Christ. Thus we sée S. Paule and M. Harding teache not bothe one Doctrine. But it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile they are not guided bothe with one spirit. S. <hi>Paule</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth truthe, and M. Harding falshead, S. <hi>Paule</hi> the worde of God, and master Harding his owne fansies, as for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of M. Hardings, it was neuer knowne in the Church of God. I remember there is a great bragger in <hi>Martial,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euen suche an other, he had euer in his mouth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All things are common among frendes: but saying thus so often when he would neuer bestow any thing among his neighbors, the Poet saith this is a very straunge Communion. <hi>Das nihil &amp; dicis Candide,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with M.

               <p>This vntruthe is sone answered. For M. Harding graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that it appeareth by s. <hi>Augustine,</hi> some receiued on Mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die thursday after supper, but saith he, that is not sometime. For saith he, he that saith somtime,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 125.</note> meaneth oftner than once a yeare. Now if it were possible that once a yeare might be sometime, then were it necessary that M. Harding did wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. But bicause once a yeare is no time, let vs sée if it may be proued, that it was done oftner. First, whether it be or no, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is at a point, and saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Ianua. Ep.</hi> 118.</note> 
                  <hi>faciat quisque quod in ea Ecclesia in quam venerit, inuenit.</hi> Let euery one doe after the custome of that Church, in which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, it appertaineth neither vnto faith, nor vnto good maners, therefore whether a man receiue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, fasting or no, so he receiue in the Lord, it skilleth not muche. Now what they haue done in the primatiue Church, let vs, as I haue said, enquire.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7.</note> It appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the scripture, that on a day when the Disciples came together to break bread, <hi>Paule</hi> disputed among them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed his talke vntil midnight. Of this if I shold conclude, that they came in the after none. M. Harding perhaps would say it were but a gesse, therefore I leaue it.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Co.</hi> 11.</note> S. <hi>Paule</hi> writeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> if any man be hungry, let him eat at home. Therfore it foloweth necessarily, that they may receiue after other meate, and if it be so, M. Harding him selfe will graunt they might receiue at night, vnlesse as he doth in the .8. diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so here he will deny that this place is meant of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and if he doe, the Doctors are then against him. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> shall stand in stead of many, who saith plainly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Ianua. Ep.</hi> 118.</note> 
                  <hi>de hoc ipso sacramento loquitur.</hi> He speaketh of this very sacrament.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8597:117"/>
Now this being lawfull to be done, and the Churche of God being so oppressed, could not méete when they wold, no doubt sometime they met at night. And further that this may be no bare gesse, that some receiued at night. It appeareth by S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</note> where he writeth that they did continue in the Doctrine of the Apostles, and in breaking bread, and that continuaunce in the same Chapter, he mentioneth againe by these wordes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which words signify a continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from morning till night, and by this aboue all coniecture, it is manifest they receiued sometimes at night.<note place="margin">

Now that some parte of the vse of the primatiue church may appeare to agrée with this doing of the Apostles, we will a little examine their doings.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bas. in Psal.</hi> 114.</note> S. <hi>Basil</hi> writeth that they were accustomed at the dedication of Temples to méete at midnight, but at the same assemblies they may well séeme to haue ministred the Communion, and therfore at after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.<note place="margin">

And yet if M. Harding wold sticke in it, I may refuse all these and many suche aucthorities. And for the iustifying of these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, stand to the plaine wordes of <hi>Sozomene,</hi> who writeth that in many Cities and Townes among the <hi>Egiptians,</hi>

Now I trust though the Thursday before Easter with mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Harding be no time, yet all these saterdayes ioyned with it, I trust do make sometimes. Here is nothing can be replied but if M. Harding wil say, that in suche méetings they did not minister the sacrament.

               <p>If I went about to aunswere M. Hardings Reioinder in this one Paragraph, through lying, and fonde speaking, he hath ministred sufficient matter to fill many leaues. But I leaue that to the godly Reader to consider. For this present purpose, thus saith master Iuel, the receit of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, when men lay on their death bed, was instituted in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Churche, especially not for the sicke, but for them that were excommunicate. This saying M. Harding dothe turne, as if M. Iuel said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 127.</note> that it was not expedient for the sick to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and so maketh that vntrue, which in déede is vntrue, and neuer spoken by M. Iuel. But without such shifts, master Hardings number of vntruthes could not grow. For maister Iuels saying, that this receiuing was especially for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, it may be sufficiently proued. And M. Harding in his Reioinder saith nothing to the contrary, for this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe, bicause M. Iuel saith no such thing. Let it stande as a slaunder not worthy aunswere. An other vntruthe héere is brought, that the people receiued not daily, and M. Harding hath such a confidence in this vntruthe, that he is not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with once noting it, but as his manner is, in many other vntruthes, when his number commeth slowly forward, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coneth up one .4. or .5. times. so he vseth this, and maketh it the 83.133.145.156.213. vntruthe. Now bicause it is so often recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by like it standeth vpon some good ground. Reade the .133. vntruthe, and thou séest what it is.</p>

But I pray M. Harding, can a thing be giuen to a dead man to eate, and not thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouthe? This vaine contention about words proueth M. Harding to be a very wrangler. This appeareth to be true by the Canon M. Iuel recites, and further we reade that it was commaunded if the persone were dying, <hi>infundatur ori eius Eucharistia,</hi> that the Sacrament should be poured into his mouthe. Héere by the way note, that in that time the people receiued the cuppe. As touching the .85. vntruth, M. Hardings Reioinder doth confute it selfe in the next vntruthe, before he said the Councel did forbid it, now he sayth it did not so, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it did or no, M. Harding hath made a lie, and except the distruction of thrusting it in their mouthes, and putting it in, there is no coloure to shadow the lie.</p>

               <p>Note good reader this hasty quoting of vntruthes, and the slender profe, and, thou shalt soone espie, that M. Harding hath more desire of his number, than regarde of any substaunce. Héere are two vntruthes in a line. The first: Christ, saith he,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8597:121"/>
commaunded that water should be mingled with the wine. This bolde asseueration concerning Christes doing, doth ask a sure proofe. For bothe we were vnthankful, if we would not folow his doing, and the daunger were great, in leauing his example. But in all the Euangelists it is plaine, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Christ commaunded no such thing. Then how doeth M. Harding proue this? Forsoth saithe he, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the sixth generall councell séeme to say it came from the Apostles. But bicause this is but a gesse, and little worth, he alleageth <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who saithe plainely Christ did it, and this beginneth to describe his ministration of the cup.<note place="margin">

But let vs sée how they proue that this mixture shold be made of wine and water, <hi>Quia vtrumque ex Christi latere proflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse dicitur,</hi>

True it is water and bloud issued out of Christ side, but this is a poore reason to mingle water and wine in this Sacrament, when Christ did celebrate his supper, before his precious side was pearced. That which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> testifieth héere, that water and bloud issued out of his side,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.34. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.</note> the same he writeth in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that Christ came with water and bloud. Teaching vs héereby that Christ is the true satisfaction for our sinnes, and the true water of regeneration to make vs cleane, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot before his father. For the forgiuenesse of our sinnes,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8597:122"/>
and the purifying of our soules were figured in the lawe by sacrifices, and by washings. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifices the bloud did purge sinnes, and was the attonement appointed to pacifie Goddes wrathe. The washings were testimonies of the true cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the minde, and remedies to doe away the filthinesse of our fleshe. Now least our faith should abide still in those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> dothe witnesse, that in Christ it is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, what so euer was wanting in those outwarde Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And for a token of that fulnesse of grace in Christ, that in him is found, all that reconciliation figured in the law, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by bloud or water, he writeth that out of his side issued both bloud and water. By the bloud he hath purged vs from our sinnes, and done out the handwriting of ordinaunce,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ebr.</hi> 9.13.</note> that was against vs, and fastened it vpon the Crosse. And that as <hi>Paule</hi> saith, not by the bloud of Goates, and calues, but by his owne pretious bloud gushing out of his side, by which he is entred into the holy place, which is heauen, and is become the tabernacle, the sacrifice, and the priest, and hath obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall redemption for vs. By the water we are assured that this benefite doth come vnto vs, bothe bicause by water we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and also bicause it signifieth the people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.13.</note> so that this miracle of bloud, and water in the death of our sauior Christ, is the performance of that, which God had promised by his Prophet, saying. In that day shalbe a fountaine opened to the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for sinne, and for vncleanesse. And thus by this water,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 15.1.</note> and bloude gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing out of the side of our Sauior, we are taught two especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pointes of the Christian faithe, the one, that by Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone all sinnes are purged, the other, that in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we haue but two Sacraments, the one of the Lordes death, the other of Baptisme, which two resembled in this bloud, and water, haue in them the whole mysterie of our full redemption. And thus the remembrance of this same place is the greatest comfort, that a Christian soule can haue in the world. But Lord those Papists, which peruert Gods scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8597:123"/>
what Doctrine haue they gathered of this comfortable saying? First that we must haue water mingled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine in the Chalice, which in this place, be it neuer so ancient, yet it hath no ground at all.

                  </gap>. And least there should want any thing to make vp the tale, they say, that he was stroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blind, and then by this bloud and water he receiued his sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">

               <p>When M.

Hue railer, that please your self so wel with Hicke scorner, is this no parte of your mysteries? Can you now deny them? Be ye ashamed of them? It skilleth not greatly what you think of this. The misterie of iniquitie, that so long hath wrought in your sinagoge, hath brought many moe abhominations into the Churche of God, all which the Lord shall abolishe with the brightnesse of his worde. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you make great a doe about these things héere alleaged, let your Doctors be the iudges. Read <hi>Scotus in sent.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 11.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I do not know. But why do you stand so in this point? It is a very learned doubt in respect of their other folish que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. <hi>Biel</hi> disputeth whether the Priest at Masse doe conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate all the bread in the market,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Can. lec.</hi> 35.</note> and all the wine in the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and concludeth, that if he stande so as he may sée it, and meaneth to doe it, he dothe no doubt consecrate euery whit. But now aske <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> an other question, how shall the Priest doe to take all the bread in the market in his hand, as the Masse booke requireth of that, which shall be consecrate. This is an other doubt, which M. Hardings Doctors would surely haue discussed, if they had heard it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In.</hi> 4. <hi>sent. dis</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> asketh what if the priest die before he speake all the words, how shall then consecration goe forewarde? Other aske what if a droppe of wine hang on the outside of the Chalice, whether is that consecrate? and what if the wine doe fréese in the Chalice, and what if the Priest at Masse do remember, that when he washt his mouth in the morning, a drop of water we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t downe his throte, whether should he receiue none, sith he had broken his fast, or whether should he let all alone. Other aske whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ be in the Pix, euen as he was on the Crosse, with his clothes and crowne of thornes about his head. And what should I recite all, which are almost infinite. A thousand such vnreuerent questions, they haue disputed in whole volumes. Yet now sayth M. Harding, they be none of our mysteries. Belike he doth yet but hobbe, &amp; roue, he will not go roundly with his Lord God the Pope. But happy were he, if as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth these vaine questions, so he wold renounce that whole adulterous religion.</p>

               <p>Now M. Hardings vntruthes go roundly forward. If this haste may haue good spéede, I warrant him his number. But if this haste doe make waste, he is neuer a whit the neare. Let vs sée then how these vntruths are gathered. The first is this. The Church is agréed vpon the Priests intent. But this can not be so, if the Gréeke Church, and the Church of Rome doe not agrée, which is the .2. vntruthe. And they can not agrée, if the one will haue transubstantiation, the other will not haue it, which is the third vntruthe. And they will haue the one Transubstantiation, the other not, if the one doe consecrate with these wordes, this is my body, the other with prayers, which is the .4. vntruthe. Then thus hang these vntruthes. If this last be true, that the Gréeke Church dothe consecrate with prayers, the thirde is true, that it intendeth not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation. And the second is true, that it hath no suche intent, as the Church of Rome hath, and the first is true, that these churches are not resolued in this intent. Now consider I beséeche thée, good Reader, what manner of vntruthes these are, that notwithstanding their great number, are yet so smal in value, that if but one be proued true, all .iiij. must be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8597:124"/>
Sure thou must néedes confesse that M. Harding, who in his Epistle would so faine shoote at hobs, and rouers, yet at this marke he hath had so good deliuery, that he hathe farre ouershot him selfe, and his whole commendation is no more worthe, than that praise in <hi>Horace</hi> of a babling Poete,<note place="margin">

For proofe of this last vntruthe, on which the other hang, we haue the plaine wordes of the Councel of <hi>Florence</hi> alleaged by M. Iuel, where it is shewed, that in the Gréekes mynisterie after the words of Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, this is my body, they make this prayer,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>fac panem hunc honorabile corpus Christi tui. &amp;c.</hi> make this breade the honourable body of thy Christ. By this prayer it is manifest, that these wordes, this is my body, being pronounced before, did not worke Transubstantiation. But bicause it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed M. Harding in to great a zeale of his number, to score vp vntruthes thus vnwisely, least his friends should thinke the matter vnsufficiently answered, we wil say somwhat of them in order, euen as M. Harding noteth them, and I doubt not but to the indifferent reader, they shall one of them sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute an other. First saith M. Harding, the Church is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued on the Priests entent. But that is very false. For the Gréeke Church, and the Church of Rome haue not one inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Greke Church, as is said, doth consecrate with prayers. The Church of Rome with <hi>hoc est enim corpus meum.</hi> The Gréeke Church maketh more accompte of the worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, than of Consecration.<note place="margin">

                  </note> The Churche of Rome thinketh we ought to haue more regarde of Consecration, than of the worthy receiuing. I leaue out other differences which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most infinite. This is inough to proue our purpose. Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily saithe M. Harding, the Church of Rome entendeth not Transubstantiation. What he entended in this vntruthe, I know not. For my parte wold God M.

Hardings good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let vs aske of him, how it may be falsified. He telleth vs of two faults, the first in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the seconde in Englishing <hi>Eucharistia</hi> the sacrament. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry saith he, yet I will define nothing, that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 157.</note> I will stande to neither of them. Is not this a straunge dealing, that he wil first finde fault, then will not bide by it, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wil score vp his vntruthe. If this vntruthe be vntruthe, why will he not abide by it? Or if he will not abide by it, why doth he say it is vntrue? must his priuate Masse, his halfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, his outlandishe prayers, his Popes supremacie, yea his vntruthes, and all be proued by paraduenture? But let it be so, what is it at the last, that héere may chance be false? this it is in the first fault about communion: peraduenture forsoth they communicated before they met. This blinde peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wer it in Cambridge or Oxford, no doubt it wold be his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of the scholes. The second fault found in translating, <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament is this: peraduenture <hi>Eucharistia</hi> here doth signifie <hi>sacerdotale mynisterium,</hi> the priestly office. Now sure good reader this is a straunge aduenture. <hi>Eucharistia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 157.</note> the priests office? Fie on such a chance, except a man had a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to make words sound, what him listed. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I trow, wold haue made this aduenture. But héere I must desire the reader to loke a little back, to take the better view of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings dealing, in the Epistle, where M. Harding sporteth him self with his good artillerie, he saith, he could neuer shote at this mark, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> might be taken, not for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread. Now either by meanes of ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arowes, or a better loose, he shootes a great way beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, &amp; saith with a good countenance, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Eucharistia</hi> is no bread at al, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priests office. Sure this is very vncertain shooting, and can neuer stand with a good archer. A man may shoote long at the Etymologie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, ere he bring it to this significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8597:128"/>
Though he haue determined to say little truely: yet he shold haue taken héede, how he had spoken so vnwisely. That other tragicall exclamation, that <hi>Eucharistia</hi> must be taken simply for bread consecrate, bewrayeth this close dealing, that it may be taken for the Priestes office. And héere againe for a good note of M. Hardings fals dealing, we haue to mark, that in this place, where M. Iuell sayth <hi>Eucharistia</hi> may be taken for common bread, but yet apointed for the Communion, M. Harding doeth not quote it for an vntruthe, yet in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle he noted it for a great heresie. And why doeth he thus? As it may be thought, bicause he foresawe, that to deny the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> at any time to note bread, not yet consecrate, were a great preiudice to his grosse distinction, that it might signifie the Priests office, and therefore for the better conueyaunce of this absurditie, he wold not quote that an vntruth, which he had so greatly impugned before. More true dealing, and lesse vaine speaking, would better beséeme a Doctor of Diuinitie.</p>

               <p>These vntruthes come more fast, than truely forwarde. It was not, saith M. Harding, abolished. Lay men might receiue at home. The councel of <hi>Caesar Augusta,</hi> which M. Iuel saith thus.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Can.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; Conc. tol.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> Of this M. Iuel saith, the lay man might not receiue it at home. And shal we think, bicause M. Harding saith nay, that notwithstanding these cursings, yet the lay man might cary it home to receiue it? Master Hardings wrangling héere about sicke men, is not worth the answere. M. Iuel speaketh of those, that may goe to Church. It was an idle matter héere to talke of sick folkes. If M. Harding for these vntruthes, be faine to wrest plaine words into a violent sense, then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes are his owne. For this second vntruthe, me thinketh M. Harding is a very partiall man. In the .108. vntruthe he will haue <hi>Eucharistia</hi> so large in signification, as no man, I trow, but him selfe could imagine. In this he so presseth the word generall, that he aloweth not that which common sense teacheth. He denieth that councell to be general, bicause there was not gathered together, I know not how many Bishops out of christendome. But if M. Harding had marked it better, he should haue knowne it well inough, that general might be applied onely to those twelue, which he saithe were there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together. If they did all well agrée, sure that councell was more generall, than their Chapter of <hi>Trident.</hi> If he will
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8597:130"/>
force the worde <hi>Oecumenicall,</hi> there is no Counsell that euer was so generall. If he will any thing restraine it, why may he not bring it downe, yea euen to twelue. This vntruthe is but a cauil, and if it were graunted, yet were M. Harding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the neare his priuate Masse. But bicause he saith so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, that that Counsell was but of .xij. Bishops in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as <hi>Peter Crab</hi> also noteth out of <hi>Isidorus,</hi> it is more, I thinke, than he is able to proue, for it is knowne that the Churche of <hi>Caesar Augusta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Asturica Augusta,</hi> an other Citie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Emerica Augusta</hi> a Citie in <hi>Portingall,</hi> ioyned in al mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and were of one felowship, so that counsaile of the other xij.

                     <hi>Hard. diuis.</hi> 17</note> before other meates, is not bread as the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels then, and the Sacramentaries now beléeue. Looke well good reader, and for M. Hardings pleasure looke againe, doeth he not say it is not bread. How is this then vntrue? Nowe must I desire thée againe, to loke diligently, and if thou mark well, thou shalt now heare of suche a distinction, as in all this booke of distinctions there is none suche. I say saithe maister Harding,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 163.</note> it is not bread, I say not it is no bread: there is great difference betwéene not bread, and no bread. Sure if thou looke not maruellous narowly, thou wilt neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this distinction. For my parte I would surely haue said it, that which was not bread, had bene no bread, and that which was no bread, had sure bene not bread, and if it were not bread, it could not be any bread, and if it wer some bread, then were it not no bread. But let not bread be some bread, and no bread be not bread, and nothing be not any thing, and not any thing be some thing. As touching maister Iuell that good simple Bishop, I dare sweare for him he neuer knewe of this distinction, and so he is wrongfully charged with this vntruthe. Yet least maister Harding shoulde please him selfe too well, I must forwarne him that I can not alow well of this distinction. If he be well aduised this is a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike rule. <hi>Aientia &amp; negantia acerrime inter se pugnant.</hi> No things are so contrary as the affirming and denyall of the same thing. But <hi>panis non panis,</hi> bread not bread, are contradictorie, not <hi>panis, nullus panis,</hi> bread no bread. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maister Hardings saying, that no bread dothe signifie more than not bread, may séeme to haue no Logike, and to speake not very wisely. And sure I muse how he could be ouerséene in this, considering the substaunce of it, is in supposition, about which his friendes haue wasted many good houres. If he haue forgotten their Doctrine, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the verse. <hi>Particulare prius facit o generale se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum.</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:8597:131"/>
But it may be that maister Harding, and his friendes, as they haue straunge deuises, so they goe about to make newe Logike, no doubt they are at some conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie. For maister Nicholas Saunders, whome his friendes thinke some body, maketh this very distinction in his fourth booke, of the Sacrament, and with this common conceite of not bread, and no bread, would faine haue an vntruthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst maister Iuell. And is it possible that these men should agrée in so great a folye, if they laid not their heades to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? Well God be thanked their generall councels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude very vnwisely.</p>
               <p>Now resteth this other vntruthe, about <hi>Tertullians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which as maister Harding saith, are falsified, bicause breade is not in the latter ende of the sentence, as master Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell doeth alleage them. <hi>Tertullians</hi> wordes are these.<note place="margin">

Euen as he did before for want of Logike, so it may be thought he doeth héere, through want of Latine. <hi>Illum</hi> saith he, is not referred to <hi>panem,</hi> and yet the Grammarian saith the adiectiue must be alway referred to a substantiue, except it be put substantiuely in the Neutre gender. Now if master Harding can not make <hi>illum,</hi> the Neuter gender, nor yet finde any other substantiue in the sentence, than <hi>panem,</hi> then his Grammer hath as euill hap as his Logike, and this is no vntruthe.</p>

In this vntruthe as M. Iuel meaneth. His helping hande must come to, or there is no vntruth to be found. This is M. Hard. plaine doctrine, the people doe receiue by the mouthe of the priest.

               <p>Maister Harding would faine shift off this argument, and his poore friend maister Rastell hathe done for him in this behalfe, what he can, but it will not be. For aunswere to this vntruth, a long discourse is néedelesse. For the simple can not conceiue it, and the learned doe sée it well inough. All maner of argumentes what so euer the propositions be, they may be reduced to the first figure. But this can be none otherwise reduced. Therefore this is maister Hardings argument, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8597:135"/>
let him neuer deny it. For being in the Hypothetical fourme of propositions, it may argue a will to deceiue, but it can not empaire the credite of his learning.

And who wil not say, that that is necessary, which Christ hath bothe done, and commaunded to be done. Then how is this vntrue? Maister Harding putteth in (whole,) and taketh out (commandement to doe the same) and maketh maister Iuel say thus: Christes whole example is of the substance of the supper, and in déede this is false. For Christ ministred after supper, and sitting, and with common bread, and in an vsual drinking cuppe, and in an house, which is neither necessary, nor al conuenient for our time.

               <p>This vntruthe is all one with the .75. and there maister Harding saith simply, that the fathers call not the sacrifice of the crosse, the daily sacrifice. Here vpon better aduise, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh his absolute assertion, and doeth qualifie it with mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iuels meaning. So if maister Harding doe not truely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maister Iuels meaning vpon a false surmise, he hathe made two vntruthes. But bicause we are come againe, to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8597:137"/>
mention of this Sacrifice, I will shew thée, what is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the purging of our sinnes. First, for thy better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, thou must learne wherein standeth the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betwixt the Papists, and vs. They say, they doe daily in their Masse offer vp Christ vnto his father, a propitiation for our sinnes. We say, that Christ hath purged vs from our sinnes, and that with the Sacrifice of his owne precious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and bloud, but that sacrifice Christ himself did once make vpon the Crosse, neither can any mortall man, offer him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. Now if we can shewe, that Christes reall body is no more offered vnto his father, then is not only this no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe, but all maister Hardings religion is deuelishe, and wicked. Let vs sée then, what the scriptures doe teache vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time that our sauior Christ did die. This Sacrifice is often mentioned, that it should be made when he had once died, it is neuer mentioned, but as already done. Before he was conceiued in his mothers wombe, the angell said his name should be Iesus.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21.</note> For he should saue his people from their sinnes. When he was born, he was called the saluation, which God had prepared before the face of all people.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.32.</note> When he was Christened, <hi>Iohn</hi> said of him, beholde the Lambe of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29.</note> which taketh away the sinnes of the worlde. The Lambe in this place, after the <hi>Hebrue</hi> phrase, dothe signifie the sacrifice, or the offering. And Christ him selfe: When I shall be exalted, I will draw all vnto my selfe. By these and all those other places, which are of the Passion of Christ, it is manifest, that the time was appointed, when this sacrifice should be once made. But when this sacrifice was done: Christ said vpon the crosse, <hi>consummatum est,</hi> all was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and in token, that there was no more sacrifice to be made for sinne, the baile of the temple did rende from the toppe to the foote. Nowe after this sacrifice once finished, not one title in the whole scriptures of any propiciatorie sacrifice to come, but vpon this one, and once made repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8597:137"/>
must be preached to all the world,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> and forgiuenesse of sinne, with this promise annexed, that whosoeuer doeth beleue, and is Baptised, shall be saued. Thus we sée from the beginning of our iourney, vntill we come to the place, which our sauior hath prepared for vs in heauen, we haue no sacrifice to passe by, but that alone, which Christ made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse, that alone is called daily, bicause it is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting intercession for vs vnto his father. What soeuer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices the papacie hath inuented, they are beside this, and they are nothing else but snares, which the Deuill hathe laid to entrappe our soules, and call vs from the only trust in Christes merites. An other proofe that the sacrifice of the Crosse may onely be called daily, is well declared in all the wrytings of the Apostles, where no one time either priest, or altare, or sacrifice, or oblation is mentioned, but onely in a spirituall vnderstanding.

And againe, Christ our passeouer is Sacrificed for vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs kéepe the feast, not with olde leauen, neither in the leauen of malitiousnesse, or wickednesse, but with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauened bread of sinceritie, and truthe. And to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> we haue an altare,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> 15.</note> of which it is not lawfull for them to eate that serue in the tabernacle. And againe, let vs offer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praise alwayes vnto God, that is the fruite of our lippes, which confesse his name. In diuers other places bothe by the prophets and apostles, we be taught that these are the onely Sacrifices left vnto vs in the Newe Testament. Then what desperate boldnesse is it, for vs to make our selues new sacrifices without the worde of God, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the holy Ghost, or any coloure of sufficient auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. I néede not adde how it fighteth directly with the Scriptures. They say the priest doeth offer vppe Christ.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8597:138"/>
But Christ neuer saith, he is offred vp by any other, but by himselfe. I doe sanctifie my selfe for them, and I doe giue my life for my shéepe.<note place="margin">

Chapters to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> but in al the scripture not one word, that euer Christ is offred by other. They say he is offred daily, but in all the scriptures he is said to be offred but once. In that he died saith <hi>Paule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.</note> he died once, and to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> with one oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he made them perfect for euer. And in the same Epistle the vij. Chapter, Christ is said to be suche a priest, as néeded not to make moe sacrifices for sinnes, or offer himselfe daily. For he did once sanctifie vs. And againe, by his owne bloud, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred once into the holy place.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12.</note> And againe, in the ende of the world, he appeared once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe. And againe, Christ hath once suffred to take away sinnes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.</note> And againe, hauing made one Sacrifice for sinne, he sittes for euer at the right hand of his father. And in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the scripture taketh away all other sacrifice, and saithe, where remission of sinne is, there is no more Oblation for sinne. Yet wil they néedes haue a daily sacrifice. What a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable religion is that, which in matters of the greatest waight, hath not one word to vphold it in the scriptures. But as the thing it selfe is the sinke of Idolatrie, so marke it wel, and thou shalt sée how wickedly they vse it. Our sacrifice say they, is the applying of that sacrifice which Christ made vpon the crosse. And hereupon M. Harding doth often say, that no Masse is priuate, bicause it is made for all the people, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this by the worde of God, and sée how it agreeth. The scripture saith, the benefites purchased by Christes sacrifice, is offred vnto vs by the worde,<note place="margin">1, <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</note> not by the Masse. You are borne a newe by the worde of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3.</note> who liueth, and indureth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8597:138"/>
for euer. And we haue felowship with God, &amp; with his sonne Iesus Christ, by the worde, which is declared vnto vs. And he that knoweth God, heareth vs, and the worde, whereby the righteousnesse of God is knowne, is the word of faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</note> which we preache. And plainly <hi>S. Paule</hi> calleth it the word of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. And the Gospell is the power of God vnto saluation to al them, that beleue.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6.</note> And <hi>Peter</hi> witnesseth that the Gospell is preached, to the ende men might liue vnto God, and Christ sanctified his Churche, by the washing of water throughe the worde. Not one place in the scripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 26.</note> that we be sanctified by priuate Masse, or daily sacrifice. But let vs let these sacrificers alone. They be blinde leaders of the blinde. Read more of this in the epistle, and in the .75. vntruthe.</p>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.</note> by breaking of bread, meaning the Communion. And in an other

How shall we make them méete for the cuppe of martyrdom, if first, we do not giue vnto them the cup of the Lords bloud, noting, that in that great persecution, they receiued daily in the morning.

And maister Harding doeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage bothe him and <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe for proofe of the daily sacrifice. Now wher they say, that we offer daily, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute sufficiently this newe fansied transubstantiation, it is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8597:139"/>
plaine they ment of this daily Communion, and of the often vse of it, maister Hardings <hi>Ignatius</hi> in like manner wryteth, when this is done continually,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad ephesios.</hi>
                  </note> the powers of Sathan are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away. These, and diuers suche proofes may be had out of <hi>Ierome, Ambrose, Iustine, Irenaeus,</hi> and other many, for this daily receiuing, and therfore these vntruthes must néedes be little worthe, that are so plentifully challenged, and may so easily be answeared. But whose aucthoritie should I rather vse in this case, than maister Hardings owne Doctors, they wryte it often, and teache very plainly, that in the primatiue Church, they receiued daily. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> writeth thus: In the primatiue church, when the people were very deuout in the Christian faith, it was decréed, <hi>vt fideles quotidie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municarent,</hi> that the faithfull people should receiue daily. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> saith in the primatiue Church, <hi>omnes fideles quotidie communicabant,</hi> all the faithfull receiued daily.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 55</note> Loe héere are maister Hardings owne Doctors, which doe sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere his vntruth. Here by the way of this one thing, I must moreouer warne the good Christian reader, that M. Harding is not able to shewe any one sufficient proofe, whereby it may appeare, that the Churche in any place within .CCC. yeares after Christ, did appoint any one day, especially for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as their confederacie at <hi>Trident,</hi> haue of late straightly charged. It appeareth by <hi>S. Luke,</hi> they met daily,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.5.</note> and it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had their méetings both day, and night, &amp; in this vse they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed their doctrine, which <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth the <hi>Colossians.</hi> Let no man condemne you in meat, and drinke, nor in respect of an holy day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.</note> or of the newe Moone, or of the Sabbothe dayes. And no doubt to take away this popish superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dayes, &amp; times, it was gods good wil, and pleasure then so to ordaine it. And for a ful proofe that the Churches vsed some saturday, some sunday, it is well shewed by that hot contention, that was raised by <hi>Victor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Anicetus,</hi> against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréeke church. After y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles time about the yeare of our Lord .115. vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Traiane,</hi> it appeareth that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8597:140"/>
the Christians vsuall méeting, was in the mornings, as is shewed by <hi>Plinie,</hi> in an epistle written to the Emperoure of the same matter. After this .30. or .40. yeare, <hi>Iustinus</hi> doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, that in his time they vsed the sonday, and any other day when there was baptizing of children. After this it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Christians of his time did not méete only on sundayes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In gen. ho.</hi> 10 <hi>In num. ho.</hi> 2</note> and holidayes, but on other dayes also. And <hi>Sozomene</hi> séemeth to deny of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Church, that they had any meetings on the Saboth day, as all other Churches had.<note place="margin">

But what dareth he not doe, to make vp his number, that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this one vntruthe fiue times? Now by the way, least I shold séeme to speake against the vse of the sunday, I say and professe, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not vse it too reuerently. <hi>Anathasius</hi> saith, that the sabboth of the Iewes,<note place="margin">

               <p>This vntruthe may be hardly verified, if the place be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether falsified. But maister Harding dothe so often speake vntruely, that now we may not beleue him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out good proofe. Let vs sée then what he saith. <hi>S. Ambrose:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Omni hebdomada offerendum est, etiam si non quotidie peregrinis, incolis tamen vel bis in hebdomada.</hi> These words M. Iuel dothe Englishe, as before appeareth. This translation saith maister Harding, is altogether false. But why saith he so? Let him bar distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and proue it if he can. Undoubtedly if snow be not black, this interpretation is true, but why dothe maister Harding finde fault wiih it? Thus he saith, <hi>offerre peregrinis</hi> is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for straungers, not to straungers, and why is it so? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soothe by this rule, all manner of verbes put acquisitiuely, that is to say, with this signe for after them, wil haue a datiue case,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 201.</note> it might haue pleased him to haue alleaged his rule truely, then it should haue bene thus, hauing this signe to or for, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, so notwithstanding this rule, yet the interpretation had bene good, but graunt the rule, what a reason is this, all verbes that haue this signe, for, after them, require a datiue case, <hi>Ergo, offerre peregrinis,</hi> is to offer for straungers. He might as well conclude, <hi>Ergo, loquor tibi,</hi> is to speake for thée, or <hi>dare tibi</hi> to giue it for thée. But M. Harding, why would
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8597:141"/>
not this rule haue serued héere, verbes compounded with these propositions, <hi>prae, con, sub, ob, in</hi> and <hi>inter,</hi> will haue a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case. Well may we haue some opinion of our Louanists English, but sure their Logicke, and their Latine is but very base. M. Dorman alleaging in his boke, this text of <hi>S. Iohn. Diabolus est mendax, &amp; pater eius,</hi> doth English it thus, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel is a lier, and so was his father before him. Was he wel in his wit? or was he yet a dreaming? or is his Diuinitie so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he knoweth not, who is the Deuils father? Sure ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance may not excuse a man, that speaketh blasphemie, the Deuil hath no father, only God created him an Angell. <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> fearing such sléeping Diuines, doth turne it thus, <hi>&amp; eius rei pater,</hi> and father of that thing. If M. Dorman had consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, and not so sodenly become of a iangling law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, an vngodly Diuine, he wold haue written more aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but (as hath bene héeretofore aptly obiected to him) he gate vpon the bridge, and was made a bacheler, and so by muche haste ouershot himselfe, muche like as maister Harding doth héere, who Englisheth <hi>offerre peregrinis,</hi> to offer for straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Alowe this for good Latine, and his distinctions for good reason, and then goe yoke Foxes, and milke hée Goates, his vntruthe shall rise at his owne pleasure.</p>

How then is this an vntruth? The word saith M.

               <p>Now M. Harding is in his biasse. He makes vntruthes at auenture, and for want of good proofe he falls to railing. This pelfe, saith he, may serue for your pulpit, when you want better stuffe. This to disproue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decretall epistles is to minister like. But thus to stand rayling, when one hath no reason, is to like a Louanist. More modest behauiour in so meane learning would better stand with honestie. This vntruth is sufficiently proued before.</p>

               <p>This vntruth doeth rise vpon these wordes, <hi>limina Petri</hi> whether they signified <hi>Peters</hi> church. For Maister Harding graunteth, that now they signifie the Church, but then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8597:144"/>
they signified his graue. Here it were reason before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue him, he should tell vs how long <hi>limina Petri</hi> did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the buriall place, and when it left his graue, and became the name of his church, who gaue it to the graue, and who toke it from it. Undouted proues must be had for so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a matter.

If in this case we sée like authoritie, we will alow the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of M. Hardings saying.

               <p>Yet it séemeth so Maister Harding to as wel learned, as you are. But this is your common fashion to belie Maister Iuels words, and then to say they be vntrue. Yt séemeth, saith he, to import a solemne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie. What if it be not so? yet it séemeth so. But what if it doe import a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? What if it can not stande with your priuate Masse? Sure then is <hi>Soters</hi> decrée not worth alleaging, as your vntruthe is not worth the quoting.

This is verie like one of your owne arguments, it hangeth so losely. For the antecedent is false, and the argument doth not follow. But why speaketh Maister Harding against his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8597:146"/>
he is assured it is not named in matters of religion, but it signifieth a great company of persons, and muche sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the things so ill, may his priuate Masse be <hi>solen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.

But bicause he hathe bene often found faultie, in as bolde asseuerations as this is, it shall not be amisse to sée his woords. Thus he saith: Well, none commeth: this is not a sufficient cause, why the godly priest, enflamed with the loue of God, féeling him self hungry and thirsty, after the heauenly foode, and drinke, shold be kept from it. And haue not these words a good plain meaning? May not one reporte of these words, that a priest may say Masse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? Why then dothe he score vp this vntruthe? Forsoothe héere is a distinction of no bodies comming: either no body may come to answer, or no body may come to receiue, and M.

               <p>This first vntruthe is, that though they offred euerie sunday bread, and wine, yet it foloweth not, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. But this Maister Harding sayth, onely, and besyde gesses, hath no sufficient proufe for it. In fine, thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth the matter. This bread, and wine was partly for the priest alone to receiue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioind. fol.</hi> 127.</note> partly for the cleargie, partly for the poore, and partely to make holy bread of, so this is become a verie beneficiall vntruth vnto Maister Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it hath not onely encreased his number, but it hath
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8597:152"/>
brought in an other article of his religion, and that is, at all a verie venture, holy bread. Here were good roome for one of Maister Hardings aunsweres, this pelfe will not serue, you must go séeke better stuffe. The second vntruth, here brought, is this, that men, and women doe not make this sacrifice. <hi>Fabians</hi> words are these: <hi>Haec altaris oblatio ab omnibus viris, et mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eribus fiat,</hi> let this sacrifice of the alter be made of all, men and women. These words I trow, are meetely plaine, but Maister Harding aunswereth thus. There is difference betwene an oblation, and a sacrifice, oblation is it, when any thing is offered vnto the Lorde, &amp; nothing done vnto it, or in it. A sacrifice is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioind. fo.</hi> 225.</note> when a thing offred vnto God, is by the priest altered, by some thing don in it, or vnto it, for religion sake: so the common people made the oblation of the alter, but they made not the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the alter. It were to be wished, good christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that these distinctions, were barred, then we should haue lesse wrangling, and fewer vntruths. But, they say, all is well, that endes well, if by examination this distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be founde good, why should not Maister Harding vse it? <hi>Theophilacte,</hi> saith he, <hi>Chrisostome</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> him selfe, haue so distinguished these words. First though they hadde done so, yet this were but a meane reason, to proue they were in like sort vsed in <hi>Fabian.</hi> The profe of <hi>Fabians</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may not well be shewed but by <hi>Fabian</hi> him selfe.

                  </gap> that is gifts and sacrifices, this is the difference, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is an oblation made with fleshe and bloud, or by fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a gift, is that which is offred vnbloudie, and without
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8597:153"/>
fire. Of this place M. Harding doeth conclude, that an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a thing offered vnto God without any thing done vnto it, but this argument hangeth as losely, as any other commonly in M. Hardings booke. A gift whereof <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacte</hi> speaketh, is is in Greke, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an oblation, whereof M. Harding speaketh, is in Gréeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So his reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hangeth thus. A gift is that, which without fire, or bloud, is offred vnto God, as an oblation is that, which hath nothing done vnto it. This argument, Christian Reader, this is his owne reason, neither better, nor worse, than he hath made it. His second authoritie, is out of <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> his wordes likewise are these,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad hebr. ho.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Oblatio erat quicquid extra sacrificium erat,</hi> that was the oblation, what so euer was beside the sacrifice, and more than this, he saith not now of these words how M. Hard. can frame his au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere to this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Fabian,</hi> doutlesse no man that meaneth plainly, can espie. This is <hi>Chrisostomes</hi> meaning, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>dona</hi> were all those sacrifices, or offerings prescribed, saue onely, such as were sinne offrings. But M. Harding goeth further, &amp; for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth <hi>S. Paule,</hi> as if of him he had learned his distinction, how be it, he neuer spake one word of it. Yea the places by M. Hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alleaged, do not so much as once name oblation, then how doth he make this exacte difference of oblations? Surely no authoritie had ben much better, than these thrée, nothing to the purpose. In the meane season by M. Hardings good skil, we may chaunge our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vse of speaking, &amp; say no more burnt offring, meate offring, peace offring, sin offering, &amp;c. but rather thus, burnt sacrifice, meate sacrifice, peace sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, sinne sacrifice, &amp; so forth. A proper distinction, &amp; méete to interprete <hi>Fabian,</hi> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolleth thus the phrase of the scripture. Here foloweth yet an other vntruth, &amp; that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these words, <hi>Non solus sacerdos sacrificat, sed etiam totus conuentus fidelium.</hi> Not only the priest sacrificeth, but also all the companie of the faithfull. This saith M. Harding, is not true in M. Iuels sense. For, saith he, that euery one of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8597:153"/>
the people, both men, &amp; women in their own person do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, &amp; ministerially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; so offer, &amp; make the sacrifice of the alter, after the order of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8597:154"/>
examine the sayings. First saith Maister Iuel, the councels words are these. All secular folke are bound to receiue the Communion, at the least, thrise a yeare. These are not the words, saith Maister Harding, and it is true. These are not the words in déede. But way yet well the whole matter, &amp; thou shalt sée Maister Harding a verie wrangler. Maister Iuel a litle before doeth recite the latine, euen as it is red in <hi>Gracian,</hi> and doeth english it word for word, hauing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion againe here to repeate the decrée, he alleageth the true meaning, and maketh onely this change, in stead of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse, Easter, and whitsontide, he saith, thrise in the yeare, and in doing so, what blame deserueth he? Looke in this same diuision, Maister Iuel alleageth the words thus. <hi>Qui in natali domini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. disc.</hi> 2. <hi>seculares.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pascate, et Pentecoste non communicant, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholici non credantur, nec inter catholicos habeantur.</hi> These verie words are found in <hi>Gracian,</hi> they, that receiue not the Communion at Christmasse, Easter, and Whitsontide, let them not be taken nor reconed for catholike people. Here is the place truely alleaged, and worde for worde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, then how can he be blamed for falsifying the councels wordes? In this place which followeth, within one leafe, he alleageth the sense of this decrée thus. All se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular christian folke be bound to receiue the Communion, at the least, thrise in the yeare. There he nameth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times, Christmasse, Easter, Whitsontide, here he saith, thrise in the yeare, and is this any vntrue dealing? This it is, that I sayd, marke well Maister Harding, and thou shalt finde him a verie wrangler. For this other vntruth, about a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, and priuiledge, except Maister Harding thinke he haue a priuiledge to wrangle, what doeth it here? It is a relaxation to those that receiued, either euerie day, or eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sunday, it was a restrainte of those that would receiue but once a yeare. Now this third vntruth, whether the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons were bounde to receiue, when soeuer there was any ministration, or no, in that maister Harding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8597:154"/>
may well disclose his owne vntruthe. He can not blame mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iuel. I require of the Christian reader, to mark diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is spoken, and then iudge as God shall moue thée. Ecclesiasticall persones were bound daily to receiue saith M. Iuel. They were not saith M. Harding, and for proofe of that, he saith only thus muche, that maister Iuel hath not proued the contrary. Now whether he hath, or not, let his Replye be iudge. He alleageth in the .29. Diuision,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cano. apost.

I trow this be a law, &amp; a straight law that is inforced vnder the paine of excommunication. They were bounde so sure, that they might not be losed, but vpon iust occasion, and necessitie, hath no law. Yet saith master Harding, it is not proued. Now thou séest he will not say alwayes true.

Masse must be celebrated no otherwise, than in the cathedrall Churches. If the Communion in the Masse, be no part of the institution, nor order, nor ministration, it is a strange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and it is a straunge Masse, that may be instituted, and ministred without it. But be it, that this were so, is mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Harding so vncourteous to his close Communion, that he wil haue it no part of the solemnitie of his Masse? He doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deserue very ill of it. For it hath more prety gestures, than all the Masse beside. But what if maister Harding will denye all this? What if he care neither for councel, nor yet for <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi> What if he say it is no part of the institution, order, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, nor yet of the solemnitie? yet he cannot auoid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glose, that speaketh expresly, without naming any circumstaunce, that the Masse must be celebrate no otherwise in small Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, than it is in the Metropolitane churche.

Now where he saith further, for this other vntruth, that he made no suche graunt, that in cathedrall Churches there was no priuate Masse, if it be true, what a vain argument made he, when he gessed at priuate Masse in little villages, by the vse of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral churches.

               <p>If M. Harding did either feare God, or reuerence the truth, he wold not deale thus vnfaithfully. Thou séest, good Reader, how boldly he saith, <hi>Foelix</hi> nameth neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8597:161"/>
nor home, and who would not thinke, that such assertions should haue some coloure, or shew of truth? yet sure in this there is none. But marke his vntrue behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he alleageth for his proofe, certaine wordes of <hi>Foelix,</hi> in which in deede these termes are not expressed, but how wickedly he doeth it, let the booke be iudge. It foloweth in the same decrée, within lesse than fiue lines.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>In domibus ab episcopis, siue presbyteris oblationes celebrari nullatenus licet,</hi> yet in houses, either by Bishoppes, or Priestes, it is by no meanes lawefull, that the Communion be celebrate. Lo here is mention bothe of house, and Communion, yet saith Maister Harding, there is mention of neither. The best excuse that in this place may be hadde, is to saye, he was deceiued: there is no exception against the words, for they are plaine. No distinction of oblation. For the glose hath interpreted it. <hi>Oblationes. s. eucharistiae.</hi> The sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. in glosa</hi>

Harding to proue his priuate Masse, hath sought for <hi>Iohn Almonar</hi> in a priuate Chapple, but the question is moued of the open church. This <hi>Iohn Almonar,</hi> liued at the least .610. yeares after Christ. The question is of .600. yeares onely. So this fable may be well reiected, both for that it is nothing to the purpose, and if it were, yet it is without the compasse of .600. yeares. Yet Maister Iuel admitting the proofe, doeth proue that it is a verie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His reason is, bicause no man might saye Masse at home. Here let vs make the best of Maister Hardings aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, and it is thus. They might not say Masse in theyr houses, but they might say them in their Chappels. This aunswere is very absurde. For who would say masse in his parlour, or hall, or kitchin, hauing a Chapple? And it is knowne to be false, and taken away by <hi>Gracian,</hi> saying. <hi>Vnicui<expan>

Dothe it folow, bicause <hi>Benedicere</hi> may be to consecrate, therfore <hi>Benedicere sancta,</hi> is to consecrate the sacrament?

debtour? <hi>Expendere,</hi> is to consider, therfore is <hi>expendere poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> to consider punishment? Sure this is a very idle proofe, though <hi>Benedicere</hi> were to consecrate, and <hi>sancta</hi> were the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But now it is shewed, that <hi>Benedicere</hi> is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not the sacrament, as Maister Iuel she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth out of <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> And in da de what reason is it, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>sancta sanctis,</hi> should be the sacrament, &amp; not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>sancta sanctorum,</hi> should be likewise the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? Now for as muche as maister Harding cleaueth so vnto the Doctors, that what so euer they say, he straight ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it for an Oracle: we may say vnto him, as our Sauior said vnto the Iewes: Euen <hi>Moses,</hi> in whome you trust, shall be a witnesse against you, so the Doctors shall be witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst master Harding, and his felowes, that when the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do require to be iudged by the scriptures, yet they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scriptures will ground their faith vpon them. Cursed be he, saith the Prophet, that trusteth in man, and maketh fleshe to be his arme. For my parte I reuerence the Doctors, and praise God for them, they were good stewards, and dispensed faithfully the goodes, that were committed vnto them, they were men of excellent learning, great diligence, and godly life, and haue sufficiently confuted maister Hardings religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">

Hyppolitus,</hi> and suche other, they confute themselues: these others are the most auntient of any credite. And as they haue these, and sundry other erroures, so from age to age in all writers erroures did still growe, great controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies were betwene the Gréekes and Latine church. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is too plaine, it néedeth no further proofe, and no doubt the spirite of God foreséeing these daungerous times, that shold ensue, when men should make Gods of those holy Fathers, grounding their faithe on them, as on the true foundation, the holy Ghost I say, did leaue them to their owne fansies, and suffred them to erre, to declare that they were but men, and that we should builde no further on them, than they did builde vpon Christ, but examine all sayings, bothe theirs, and oures by the euerlasting woord of God, the only lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne vnto our fée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, and the onely light vnto our steppes, which thing God for his Christes sake graunte vs euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to doe, <hi>Amen.</hi> For this other translation, <hi>post finem orationum,</hi> after the prayer of consecration, which is the 178. vntruthe, it is as soone proued to be yll, as maister Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath aduenturously sayde, it is good. He saith, they are <hi>Orationes,</hi> that are after Consecration, and <hi>precationes,</hi> which are before, and for this distinction he alleageth <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> Héere, christian reader, thou hast to note two things. First the distinction, then maister Hardings argument. As touching the distinction, that there are no <hi>Orationes</hi> till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration is past, that is very false, the Masse booke it selfe hath <hi>Oremus,</hi> I wote not howe many times before they are at their saccaring, and I trow he that made the Masse booke, knewe what was in the Masse. Nowe for the argument, sée how it hangeth.</p>
               <p>This it is, Prayers after consecration, are called <hi>Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Ergo, Post finem orationum,</hi> is when consecration is done, I may with as good a reason as that, argue thus. <hi>Pomeridianum tempus,</hi> is the after noone: <hi>Ergo, Peracto
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8597:164"/>
pomeridiano tempore,</hi> is immediatly after .xij. of the clocke. This is euen such an other argument, and master Hardings hangeth as losely, as it. Thus if we will graunt M. Harding all his proofes, he will bothe make his Massebooke a lier, and frame againe as euil argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as he maketh in his answer.</p>

Thus haue maister Hardings holy Popes pulled out of Goddes Churche, Gods eternall gospels, and made vs newe gospels of their owne, and of those times saith maister Harding, that decrée is ment, at which times Masse might be sayde at night. But yet, as I remember, in Lent we had not many Masses at night, but in the forenoone we had Euensong, and all least the Euening prayer should be to long. Then if it be so, what doe these fasts héere to make answer, for their Masse, notwithstanding suche obseruation of dayes and monthes, and times, yet Masse in this place must signifie common prayer, and so this is no vntruthe. Or Masse was celebrate at night, and then what meaneth the .81. vntruthe? Read it.</p>

it is common, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reader I trust, is alredie forewarned to beleue nothing that he saith, without some other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

I will omit therefore further proofe of Maister Iuels saying, and I onely require to consider this maner of vntruth. Thus Maister Iuel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth <hi>Chrisostoms</hi> words. Some are called, some brought to receiue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest. That is not so, saith Maister Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they are not called to receiue with the Priest.

But let these vntruthes alone, they cannot doe much harme. Onely I must admonish thée, that after this long ado with Maister Iuel, Maister Harding for his exercise, will fights little with him selfe.

say as Maister Harding saith, let his booke be iudge. And why then is this vntruth scored vp with other? Would he haue vs think, that this preaching were onely in <hi>Antioche,</hi> and no where else? This might well be, if papistrie hadde ben then in vre, and preaching not regarded. But to think it of that world, in which good religion florished, and Gods word was plentifull, it is an vncharitable gessing. Thus much I speake, graunting Maister Hardings wordes, that in <hi>Antioche,</hi> the people were daily taught. And then if it were so, the same vse had ben likewise kept in other cities, so Maister Hardings owne wordes going for true, this can be no vntruth, but how true those wordes are, Maister Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el doeth sufficiently proue, reade his Replie, he doeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> owne wordes, to proue, that in <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> they had sermons but once a wéeke, and therevpon he saith further, thus.</p>

               <p>I am sorie to trouble the reader, with aunswering to so vaine vntruthes, but so it is, if nothing should be said, they would be thought of some force. Maister Harding vseth this reason, to proue his priuate Masse. In <hi>Antiochie</hi> there was but a verie few to communicate sometime. Therfore in the countrey belike there was priuate Masse. Of this argument, Maister Iuel saith thus, to aduaunce the citie, &amp; to abase the countrey, he saith, in cities they had dayly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but this is vntrue. For in <hi>Antioche,</hi> they had not so. Now rise M. Hardings two vntruthes. 1. I say not they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8597:171"/>
were taught so in cities. 2. They were taught so in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche.</hi> Who could haue scraped out these vntruthes, but he? Or what force is there in them? For this second vntruth, where he still affirmeth, they had dayly preaching in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche,</hi> that is a very false lie, and yet how impudently doth be persist in it.</p>

                     <hi>Diuis.</hi> 34.</note> it must be sayd, that either the sacrifice ceased. &amp;c. Or that the memorie of our Lords death was oftentimes ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated of the Priestes in the daily oblation, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying for others to communicate with them. Marke now how Maister Iuel chaungeth these wordes, either the daily sacrifice ceased, saith Maister Harding, either the priest let cease the daily sacrifice, saith Maister Iuell. What is here falsified? If it dyd cease, the Priest ceased it. For, I trow, the lay man might not say Masse, if he would. The other péece of Maister Hardings saying is this, or else the memorie of our Lords death was often times celebrated of the priestes, in the daily oblation without tarying for other to communicate with them. These many words, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause oftedious writing, Maister Iuell reporteth this, or

the priest receiued alone. Now iudge of this place, which Maister Harding saith is altogether falsified, and praye that Maister Harding may once haue eies to sée. The .200. vntruth.

Certaine it is, Maister Harding did know, that these former partes of this allegation, were all true.

               <p>In this vntruth, we haue two things to note, Maister Hardings sight, and the cracking of his Masse. As touching his sight, I can say little. But I doe easely beleue it is not verie good. There are a great many authorities in this first article, which he can not sée to aunswere one whit, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time two, or thrée leaues together, in which he can not sée to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute one word. His owne writings are so ful of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and cloudes of errours, that he can not sée to come nigh the truth, and yet in this great shadowe of his eies, he proueth effectually the common prouerbe, who is so bold as blinde bayard? For the cracking of his Masse, he can say but little, onely in defence of that mishapen strumpet, he vseth vncomly language against the Bishop of Sarisburie. But how can a wicked cause be better defended, than with euill speaking. For his Lady <hi>Missa,</hi> she is as she is. Thanks be to God for the victorie, she is well crackt of late, she hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified hir selfe, and liued in pleasure, she hath ben full of triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phes, &amp; signes of victorie, she hath dwelt carelesse in hir fensed cities, she hath said in hir heart, I am, &amp; none else, I am no widow, &amp; I shall sée no morning. Now whether this glorie be yet crackt, or no, and these proude pecocks fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers falne downe, hir owne heauie lookes doe sufficiently

witnesse. Hir widowhed commeth fast vpon hir, and manie of hir louers are run away, hir owne barrennesse increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth daily, and hir children wax few in number, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of hir diuinations haue brought euill vpon hir, hir fornications, and idolatries haue seperated betwene God, and hir. And can Maister Harding yet think, that his Masse is still vncracked, hir dominions were verie large, &amp; wide, and hir kingdomes plentifull, hir buildings were costly, &amp; verie sumptuous, and hir cofers rich, hir apparell was gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, &amp; of nedel worke, set out in most pleasant colours, hir ornaments of inameled golde, bewtifull with manie iewlls, and precious stones, and for the full measure of hir accomplished glorie, she had the Princes of the earth to minister hir cuppes vnto hir, Kings to be hir waiting ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and Emperours to hold hir fotestoole. If this estate were yet in hir wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted royaltie, then might Maister Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well say, that his Masse were not cracked. Now seing all is lost, hir buildings are pulled downe, hir fortresses ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, hir treasuries spoiled, her estimation lost, and she hir selfe set without the quire, we giue thankes vnto God, that hath giuen this victorie, and we are sorie for Maister Hardings blindnesse, that can not yet sée how his Masse is crackt.</p>

that riseth of his .204. vntruth, maketh a flat deniall of his owne wordes, and lest this contrarietie should bréed any péece of discredit, he goeth about with a distinction to salue the whole matter, whereby he hath got this double com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, a plaister for his Masse, which before he hadde wounded, &amp; an vntruthe to make vp his proposed number. And his distinction is this. I say not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Masse is in vaine, but that the oblation is in vaine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioind. fol.</hi> 260.</note> making a great difference betwene his Masse and oblation. But this matter doth not so well thriue, as Maister Harding wéeneth his Masse and oblation must néedes be both one, else how could his Masse be saide to be a sacrifice propitiatorie for quick, and dead, sith the sacrifice can onely be ment by the oblation. But let vs take Maister Hardings words, as they are. The oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saith he, is in vaine to the people, that will not come. Here he speaketh not onely against his companions, but against the Pope, and against his Masse booke. The decrée saith the oblation is good, that is offred for <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that is for them that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the Lord.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dist.</hi> 50. <hi>et purgabit.</hi>
                  </note> And the masse booke saith, <hi>Hanc oblationem offerimus pro ecclesia tua sancta catholica.</hi> We offer this oblation for the whole catholike church. Yet saith Maister Harding,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In canone.</hi>
                  </note> this oblation is in vaine. If he him selfe will thus speake against Pope, and portus, he may peraduenture, crack his Masse, ere he be ware. But it is well. We take that Maister Harding graunteth, except the people receiue, the celebration, or sacrifice made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest is in vaine, so his priuate Masse is quit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet if there be but one, nowe there was but one afore, and so one vntruthe is made thrée. Againe, before he made no vntruth as touching the meaning: now he maketh one. Yet if there be one now, there was one afore, &amp; so of two vntruthes, which is very vnlike, he will nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but one, againe in the .204. vntruthe, he maketh but one vntruthe bothe of the words, and meaning, héere seuerally he maketh one of either: this diuersitie of gathering must néedes shewe a matter of little waight. Now as touching these two vntruthes, and the wordes héere saide of maister Iuel, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, nor meaneth that they are al in <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> But alleaging certaine, as is shewed in the .202. vntruth, he héere addeth more. For example to shew the Massing priestes how they should speake vnto the people? What, troweth maister Harding to persuade the people, that maister Iuel maketh <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to speake of their Masses? Héere in these words the Masse is plainely named, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good father did neuer know what suche spirituall whoredomes did meane. And yet héere M.

               <p>This vntruthe was numbred once before. Reade the .107. vntruthe. There are M. Hardings plaine woords. What he meaneth héere againe to recken this vntruthe, saue onely for numbers sake, no man I trow knoweth. And yet how fondly, and with what a blinde distinction he dothe it, it shall not be a misse to tell thée. He saith héere, they doe not breake bread to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But saith he, they participate of one bread,<note place="margin">

This plain saying he hath in his Reioinder, intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a few other woords. Read the place. Now if maister Harding do thus vnderstand M. Iuel, as if he ment that two priestes many miles a sunder might breake the same loafe: that imagination is too grose, and no wise man wil alow it. If he meane any spirituall breaking, then his owne words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the saying for good, then this vntruthe proueth nothing against M. Iuel, but reproueth M.

               <p>These words of <hi>S. Paule</hi> goe very nighe M.

For if they doe belong vnto it, then no doubt M. Hardings Masse is a sinke of iniquitie, that is so contrary vnto <hi>S. Paules</hi> woords.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Co.</hi> 11.33.</note> Now for better discussing of this, bicause in trying it this priuate Masse shall be better knowne, let vs examine. <hi>S. Paules</hi> woordes. Thus he saithe. Wherfore, my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for an other. This saith M. Harding, is to be vnderstand of certaine Churche feastes, which they had, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not of the Communion, and as though this were not said with shame inoughe, he saith in an other place, that in that chapter, <hi>S. Paule</hi> dothe not rebuke them for the manner of ministring this Sacrament, but for their abusing of their church feasts.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. fol.</hi> 99.</note> Now for proofe of this interpretation, he onely alleageth the bare names of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theodoretus,</hi> and this is al he can bring. Read Reioinder. fol. 306. Now let vs sée againe what on the other side may be said to proue that <hi>S. Paule</hi> meaneth of the ministration of the Sacrament. And this we may sée bothe by the testimonie of all the old Doctors, and most vndoubtedly by examination of the place it selfe. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> applieth all that place to the Communion in plaine woords, <hi>Occumenius</hi> saith only the Lords supper is there spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and vpon this place <hi>inuicem expectate,</hi> tary one for an
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8597:178"/>
other. Thus he writeth. <hi>Itaque: Quamobrem. Ne indigne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus domini, &amp; sanguinem participare probemini.</hi> Therefore saith the Apostle. Wherefore: Least you should be proued to participate the Lordes body, and bloud vnworthely. By this Doctor he receiueth vnworthily, that in the congregation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth alone. <hi>Theophylacte</hi> a later wryter vpon the same place, saith: Why should we pray our selues? <hi>Quia haudqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam meritò id mysterium sumunt multi,</hi> bicause many do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that mysterie nothing worthely. By all these Doctors this place is ment of the Communion. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> saith: It any man be impacient, <hi>domi terreno pane pascatur,</hi> Let him eate earthly bread at home. And againe, we come to gether, <hi>vt multorum oblatio simul celebretur,</hi> that the Oblation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might be made together. But <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> calleth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane meats, suche as their common feasts were, either hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bread, or our oblation. <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>qui hoc non faciunt, indigne communicant,</hi> they that tary not one for an other, doe communicate vnworthily. And héere againe, we sée this Doctors minde of priuate Masse, or as M. Harding wil haue it, of the priestes sole receiuing. <hi>Beda</hi> saith likewise, alleaging <hi>S. Augustine. Ad Ianuar. Epist.</hi> 1. that this,<note place="margin">

Ierome</hi> also dothe so enterprete it. Read all these vpon the xj. chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians. Of the same minde are also <hi>Augustine, Basil, Gregorius Romanus.</hi> And if thou rest vpon the aucthoritie of men, examine all the olde Doctors, that haue written vpon the same place, &amp; not them only, but suche as are of yonger age, as <hi>Thomas, Scotus, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Hugo, gloss. ordinaria,</hi> and suche other. They all agrée: this saying of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> tary one for an other, is ment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Dionysius Carthusianus</hi> on the same place speaketh very plaine, when ye come together to eate, saith <hi>S. Paule. Panem coelestem,</hi> saith <hi>Dionysius</hi> the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly bread, <hi>videlicet corpus Domini,</hi> that is to say, the body of the Lord. And <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> of <hi>Gorram</hi> vpon these woordes, tary one for an other,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8597:179"/>
wryteth thus. <hi>Docet modum in hora communionis ordinate accedendo,</hi> he teacheth howe to come orderly in the time of Communion. What plainer aucthoritie can there be, than these? Who séeth not that all antiquitie haue vnderstande <hi>S. Paules</hi> words of the Communion? If thou search them, thine eyes shall be thy witnesse. Yet saithe maister Harding, (as he were priuiledged, without blame or discredite to speake what he would,) that <hi>Martyr, Caluine, Cranmer,</hi> and suche other, haue deceiued maister Iuel:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reioinder. Fol.</hi> 92.</note> but it is wonderfull to sée howe he speaketh against the truthe, the Lord knoweth whether against his owne conscience. Read the Replie. Fol. 94. thou shalt further sée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how in the Communion, the people came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. But as touching this place, bicause the spirite of God is not tied to any man, or age, we will leaue our witnesses, and examine the place. First, <hi>S. Paule</hi> blameth them, bicause they come togither, not with profite, but with hurt. And then teaching how they ought to come togither, and in what sorte to haue their méetings, he teacheth them by the example of our sauior Christ, and his doctrine: saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which I haue receiued of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> For this cause, which is the vnorderly receiuing the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Yet saith M. Harding, it is ment of their feastes. After this it dothe folow in <hi>Paule:</hi> Wherfore my brethren, when you come togither to eate, tary one for an other. Now if this be not yet plaine inough, that he meaneth of the Sacrament, then looke what foloweth, an vndoubted proofe of the whole matter. Least saith <hi>S. Paule,</hi> you come togither to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Is this at any time pronounced of any manner eating, but of the vnworthy eating of that blessed sacrament? Yet for the priuate Masse sake, this plaine scripture must be denyed, and impudently wrested into a straunge sense. And marke héere how maister Harding would haue <hi>S. Paule</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8597:179"/>
the woordes before are plaine of the Lordes supper. Of those words <hi>S. Paule</hi> concludeth: wherefore my brethren. &amp;c. Then by maister Hardings meaning, <hi>S. Paule</hi> should reason thus: A man must prepare him selfe to receiue the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must tary one for an other, at their common feastes: such lose arguments, the spirite of truth doth not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

If any man heare the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures readen, and of a superstitious minde, doe thinke he should not Communicate, sette him be excommunicate:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8597:180"/>
now iudge whether these decrées teach, that the whole church should receiue together. M. Harding can answere nothing, but bringeth two distinctions, one olde, one, which we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the .151. vntruthe, an other he maketh more to answere Pope <hi>Hilarie,</hi> and that is this, where <hi>Hilarie</hi> saith: If he be not excommunicate, let him not abstaine from the sacrament. We may abstaine, saith M. Harding, sacramentally, though not spiritually. If these distinctions may be alowed, ther is no aucthoritie so good, but let M. Harding slip, and he wil answer it. But <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith, take héede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man spoile you through Philosophy, and vaine deceit.</p>

For we are al accompted of like worthinesse to receiue them. And that we should not doubt of his meaning, he maketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward along discourse to proue this same.

But suche to whome God hath giuen the spirite of knowledge, and truth, they will confesse how he doeth wrangle: and if he haue any grace himselfe, as oft as he remembreth these vntruthes, he wisheth they were againe vnder his file.</p>

               <p>This vntruthe is before sixe times, Read the .215. vntruthe. ¶Thus are we come to an ende of this weary Reioinder, wherein we sée to what issue M. Hardings great vaunts are come: his tragicall exclamations in how small matters there be ended: and his multitude of vntruthes, how without truth they be gathered. He tolde vs that this Replie was altogither corrupt and false, yet are there a great many leaues in this first article, of which he hath not confuted one word: what he would haue done in case it had bene blameable, this Reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dothe sufficiently witnesse. He cried out of corruptions, alterations, manglings, and I wote not what of the olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but <hi>quid dignum tulit hic tanto promissor hiatu,</hi> what hath he brought forthe, worthy of so wide gaping? These vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes that were so many in number, are now proued none. The controlling of so many aucthorities, is found nothing but wrangling. The often blaming of diuers interpretations is tried either childishe or wilful ignoraunce. And some of his owne Doctors, on whome with much boasting, he had groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his priuate Masse, in the ende he hathe turned to their owne defence. With so ill successe he hath impugned truthe: And with so slender proofe, he hath defended falshood. Of these
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8597:181"/>
225. vntruthes which he hath brought, some he saithe may be coloured, some be shamelesse lies. And in déede his testimonie well applied, is true. For most of them, without shame, are impudently gathered. Some as he hathe vsed them, may bring suspition of ouersight. But what they are, and howe voide of deserued blame, it shall appeare if thou reade this Confutation, in the which for thy contentation, good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader, I must assure thée, that I haue not alleaged one aucthoritie, wherein I either abridge the authors wordes, or enterlace any other of mine owne, either else misconstrue his meaning. Only sometime, bicause the wryting is tedious, I alleage the sense, and referre thée vnto the place, where thou maist examine the wordes. If any one of all the lande of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanists be able to reproue me, I wil not let openly to preache it that I haue offended. God giue them and vs bothe grace to consider, that it is now no time to dally. The matter is not suche, that it may abide any wrangling. The cause is Gods, and he néedeth not to be defended with lies. If in his cause we goe about deceite, by vttering falshoode, or by concealing truthe: by making moe distinctions, or by framing Latine as we liste, God is not mocked.</p>
               <p>How so euer we will paint our doings, or what clokes of shame so euer we will vse, it is true that the Poete saythe: <hi>Ille dolum ridens, quo vincula nectitis inquit?</hi> He laughing at oure deceitfulnesse, shall aske to what purpose we haue tied suche deuises? He is truth, and he will be defended by truthe, and he hateth all those, that doe speake lies. Therefore good Christian Reader persuade thy selfe, that as we haue our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptes to make vnto him, that iudgeth truely, so witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and willingly, we will speake nothing that shall burden oure owne Consciences before his iudgement seate. True it is we be menne: and as menne we may be deceiued. The Prophet hath pronounced the vniuersall sentence, and we be all borne vnder the lawe of it, that euery manne is a lier,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8597:182"/>
therfore, to chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vnto my doing any such absolute veritie, as though no piece of it might be blamed, it wer great arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and extreme folly: this is sufficient to the indifferent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a full contentation vnto mine owne conscience, that the Lord is witnesse, I know not of any one vntruth, I haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. And for this great number wherewith M. Iuel is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, better it had bene for M. Harding to haue made them fewer, &amp; more it might haue hindred M. Iuels cause. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that any wher he might be deceiued, were to exempt him out of the condition of man. But these .225. vntruthes in one article, while they must be multiplied, M. Harding telleth one many times, maketh straunge interpretations, diuiseth new distinctions, in suche sort, that euery man may espie his folly. God for his mercyes sake lighten once his heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yet again he may sée, whether he goeth, and leade them the way back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
