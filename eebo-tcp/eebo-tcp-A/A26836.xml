            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Merchants Remonſtrance.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Rade</hi> is the life of a State, <hi>Manufactures</hi> are the ſinews of <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> is the ſoule of both. There is ſuch a neceſſary connexion and dependency betweens them, that the one cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other; The laſt doth animate the ſecond, and the ſecond ſupports the firſt, and the firſt gives motion and quickning to the other two. Now of all ſorts of <hi>Trade, Trafficke</hi> hath been alwayes eſteemed the moſt noble, becauſe the moſt hazardous; And <hi>Trafficke</hi> is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and uſefull to <hi>Iſlands,</hi> whoſe ſecurity and power depends principally upon ſhipping, and <hi>navall ſtrength.</hi> Amongſt <hi>Iſlands,</hi> this of great <hi>Britaine</hi> hath been from all times held the moſt rich, and renowned, as well for the fertility of the ſoyle, and temperature of the ayre; as for the ſubſtantiall and neceſſary <hi>native</hi> commodities it affords in ſuch plenty to advance <hi>Trade,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99574:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and oblige all other Nations. Now there is no greater enemy to <hi>Trade</hi> than <hi>War,</hi> be it in what Countrey it will; our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Hollanders</hi> excepted, who by ſo long a habit of <hi>War</hi> ſeems to make a <hi>Trade</hi> of it; They are the onely men who by the advantage of their <hi>ſcituation</hi> can fiſh beſt in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; witneſſe the tumults of <hi>Germany,</hi> and theſe of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Yet <hi>forraigne</hi> war is not ſo great a diſturber of <hi>Trade,</hi> nor halfe ſo deſtructive, as <hi>inteſtine;</hi> For as the fire that's kindled within doores, and in the bed-ſtraw, as it were, rageth more violently: ſo <hi>civill</hi> War ruines <hi>Trade</hi> faſter then any other, and makes poverty and deſolation poſt in one after the other, whereſoever it is kindled. Now the drift of this ſmall <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> is, to ſhew the great miſery that may ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly befall this Kingdome through want of <hi>Trade,</hi> and the evill effects it may produce.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that the chiefeſt way of enriching a Kingdome, is the expence of its native or home commodities (that can well be ſpared) in forraigne parts; if it faile, the <hi>Manufacture</hi> muſt ceaſe, by which meanes many thouſands of poore Families, which have no other maintenance but by their daily labour, or by what each dayes worke will afford them, will be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed to beggery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, divers <hi>Workmen</hi> or <hi>Artificers,</hi> through want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment here, will doubtleſſe goe into other Countries, and exerciſe their <hi>Trade,</hi> whereby it may come to the knowledge and practiſe of <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> as I feare is already: being at the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereof informed, that in <hi>Zeland</hi> there are <hi>Loomes</hi> ſet up for <hi>Perpetuano's,</hi> and other Stuffes: And that in other places they are not idle ſetting up daily <hi>Loomes</hi> for <hi>Cloth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be objected, that if our <hi>Wooll</hi> (which is the chiefe materiall) be wanting, they will faile of the exerciſe of their <hi>Trade</hi> in forraigne parts: I anſwer, that ſuch Wools may be had elſewhere, as will ſerve their turne, by the due mixture of ſuch ſorts as will fit and agree beſt together.</p>
            <p>Witneſſe, The ſtore of courſe <hi>Cloth</hi> made in High <hi>Germany,</hi> where about 20000. Engliſh <hi>Clothes, narrow Liſts</hi> (commonly called by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99574:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Merchant Adventurers, Franckfort ſorts)</hi> each <hi>Cloth</hi> containing 28. yards in length, were yearely ſpent, and ſince not above 2000. vented of the ſaid ſorts; the cauſe whereof, was that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Project</hi> of dying and dreſſing of <hi>Cloth</hi> by Sir <hi>William Cockaine</hi> and others: which ſo much incenſed the <hi>Germanes</hi> (for if it had taken effect, many Families of Clothworkers and Dyers would have been deſtroyed) that they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to practiſe the making of the ſaid ſorts of Clothes; which had ſuch ſucceſſe, that in a very ſhort time the expence of thoſe ſorts of <hi>Engliſh Clothes,</hi> was brought downe from ſo great, to ſo ſmall a number. That <hi>Project</hi> found the like or worſe entertainment in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts of the Low Countries, where, before that time, many thouſands of finer ſorts of <hi>Engliſh Clothes</hi> were more vented then now are; ſo that it was obſerved, that whereas before the ſaid <hi>Project</hi> was put in practiſe, there were about eighty thouſand Engliſh <hi>Clothes</hi> of all ſorts <hi>per annum,</hi> exported by the old Company of <hi>Merchant adventurers,</hi> that in the new Companies time and ſince, not much above thirty thouſand: whence this Inference may be eaſily drawne, <hi>That Innovations in a State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth are alwayes dangerous, and ſometimes deſtructive.</hi>

            <p>Before the late war between us and <hi>Spaine,</hi> there were ſent hence thither great ſtore of <hi>knit Stockings;</hi> but the Importation of all Engliſh commodities into that Kings dominions being prohibited, his Subjects put in practiſe the making of <hi>Stockings,</hi> and in thoſe quantities, and at ſuch eaſie rates, that ſince wee have had peace with that King, it hath been free for Engliſh Merchants to import thoſe of the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; yet very few are ſent, for that they cannot bee afforded at ſuch low rates as thoſe made there. That people did then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo practiſe the making of <hi>Bayes,</hi> which tis probable, had taken ſuch effect, that if the warre had continued betweene the two Kings ſomewhat longer, the vent of Engliſh had been there quite loſt. As it was with the vent of our <hi>broad Cloth</hi> in the time of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, with the which <hi>Manufacture,</hi> our <hi>Merchants</hi> drove a great <hi>Trade</hi> in the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not any in thoſe times, nor before, being there

And among the <hi>Merchants</hi> in <hi>Her Majeſties</hi> time, were Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham, Her Majeſties</hi> Cape or chiefe <hi>Merchant,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Spencer</hi> an <hi>Alderman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> both of no little note: the <hi>former,</hi> famous for the building of the <hi>Royall Exchange</hi> (ſo named by <hi>Her Majeſtie)</hi> at his owne charge, which coſt with the purchaſe of the ground, as I have heard, 36000. <hi>l.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, a great deale of money, ſpecially in thoſe times. The <hi>latter</hi> much taken notice of in regard of his great eſtate, which was thought to be 300000 <hi>l.</hi> or rather more, both which got a great part of their reſpective Eſtates, eſpecially the former, by their <hi>Trade</hi> in <hi>Engliſh Cloth</hi> in the parts of <hi>Spaine</hi> before ſaid: But upon the breaking out into a <hi>warre</hi> with that <hi>King</hi> (ſome great reaſon of <hi>State</hi> doubtleſſe urging) he not onely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits all <hi>Commerce</hi> or <hi>Trade</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of all <hi>Engliſh Commodities</hi> by all others in amity with <hi>Him,</hi> by which meanes <hi>His Subjects</hi> comming to want their uſuall ſupplies of our <hi>Cloth</hi> fell into making of <hi>Cloth</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves procuring ſome <hi>Workefolke</hi> from abroad, and is ſince ſo much increaſed, that ſtore hath been and is ſtill ſent into the parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and elſewhere, ſo that we came wholly to loſe the vent of that <hi>Manufacture</hi> not onely in thoſe parts, but alſo in others, which make uſe of the <hi>Cloth</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> otherwiſe ours, tis like, might have found vent in the ſaid parts. Hence it followeth, <hi>that warre with forraigne States is deſtructive to our Manufactures.</hi> The totall loſſe then of our <hi>broad Cloth</hi> in <hi>Spaines Dominions,</hi> and the great decay of the ſaid <hi>Manufacture</hi> cauſed by the aforeſaid <hi>project</hi> of Sir <hi>William Cockaine,</hi> gave it ſuch an incurable wound, asit could never ſince bee healed, nor like, having contracted ſuch a <hi>Malignant humour</hi> in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of our <hi>old Drapery,</hi> that it corrodeth daily more and more <hi>like unto an exulcerated Cancer, or Canker, never ceaſing untill it hath pearced the vitall parts.</hi> And ſo is it like to bee with the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of our <hi>new Drapery,</hi> viz. <hi>Bayes, Kerſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perpetuano's, Sayes, Stockings,</hi> &amp;c. which came to a great height in the time of <hi>King James</hi> and of our <hi>Gracious King Charles</hi> till of late, giving ſuch a life to trade, that it ſeemed not to be very ſenſible of the decayed condition of our <hi>old Drapery,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99574:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where we have <hi>Trade:</hi> For, if wee take not off the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of thoſe Countries in exchange of ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they muſt ſuffer, and that not a little by it, and for remedy partly, for want of their accuſtomed imployment, and vent of their ſaid commodities; and partly, by reaſon of the want of ours, bee inforced to ſeeke out, and learne others <hi>Trades,</hi> and very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pitch or fall upon the making of ſuch as are here made: For, as <hi>in the Body naturall, there is ſuch a ſympathy and connection of the parts, that if any of them bee diſtempered, the reſt b<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Merchants Strangers,</hi> both here and abroad, in regard of theſe troubles, have withdrawne moſt part of their Eſtates hence, and will have ſhortly little in this Kingdome: We ſhall have no little want and miſſe of their monies, which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them here, partly by <hi>Exchange</hi> from forraigne parts, made over, or remitted by our Factors, in returne of ſuch commodities as wee uſually ſend hence to our ſaid Factors; and partly, by the taking up of their monies here by <hi>Exchange,</hi> to bee repayed by our Factors abroad; which monies are commonly imployed in the commodities of this Kingdome, which hath been no little furtherance to the more abundant vent of our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> and hath been otherwiſe a great helpe to our Merchants, ſpecially to ſome of the younger ſort, who had ſmall ſtocks wherewith to begin their <hi>Trade;</hi> the want whereof, I meane of the <hi>Strangers Money,</hi> muſt cauſe a great decay of <hi>Trade;</hi> and if once gone, as is almoſt, though a preſent <hi>Peace</hi> ſhould follow, it will not bee ſo eaſily brought back; They will in the <hi>Interim</hi> finde or uſe other wayes and meane for imployment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>By loſſe of <hi>Trade</hi> all ſorts of people will faile of imployment in all parts, and ſo wanting meanes to maintaine themſelves and Families, be driven into ſuch ſtraights (for <hi>Neceſſitas turpia coget)</hi> that they will lay hold on of what is next for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; neither Lawes Divine, norhumane, will bee able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them, a generall confuſion of, and in all things will

            <p>Secondly, to give a touch of ſome of the bad <hi>effects</hi> it hath ſince produced.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to offer my opinion, what may beſt bee done for <hi>remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a due regard was wanting, the deſtruction of <hi>Sheepe,</hi> and the exportation of <hi>Wooll</hi> (the chiefe materiall of this Kingdomes <hi>Manufacture)</hi> make it plainely appeare.</p>
            <p>The bad <hi>effects.</hi> Divers <hi>Artificers</hi> or <hi>Workmen</hi> for want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in this <hi>Kingdome</hi> embarked themſelves for <hi>Holland,</hi> where ſetting up <hi>Loomes</hi> for <hi>Broad Cloathes, Perpetuano's</hi> and other <hi>ſtuffes,</hi> wanted not <hi>Maſters</hi> to ſet them on work, and are made in ſuch quantities, ſpecially <hi>Perpetuano's,</hi> that <hi>ſtore</hi> is ſent thence into ſundry parts; beſides <hi>ſtore</hi> made, it ſeemes, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: here being letters lately from <hi>Legorne,</hi> which tell us, that our <hi>Perpetuano's</hi> in reſpect of their deareneſſe and badneſſe of making finde bad vent, the <hi>Italian Merchants</hi> preferring thoſe before them that are made in <hi>Narbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> and <hi>Majork</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaines Dominions.</hi> And for our <hi>Broad Cloth,</hi> our <hi>Merchants,</hi> Traders to <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> have not found ſuch bad vent as of late; and to make it the worſe, the deareneſſe here of <hi>Wooll</hi> may be a cauſe, for that they cannot be afforded at ſuch low rates as uſually have been, that ſort of <hi>Wooll,</hi> which before the War might have beene bought at or after the rate of 9 <hi>d.</hi> and 10 <hi>d.</hi> is now worth 16 and 17 <hi>d. per</hi> pound.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Commodities</hi> may have the better vent or expence, two things are chiefly neceſſary: Firſt, the <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> ſecondly, the cheapneſſe: both which properties having beene heretofore found in <hi>Engliſh Cloth</hi> cauſed it to be ſo much deſired in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne parts,</hi> that the <hi>people</hi> of thoſe parts minded little the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any other in any conſiderable quantity, untill that

unhappy <hi>Project</hi> of Sir <hi>William Cockain</hi> and others, (as is in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> ſet forth fol. 3.) and in the time of this late <hi>War</hi> (for the reaſon before ſaid) much increaſed, and that not a little, by what I heare, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſome <hi>Broad Clothes</hi> made in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been imported, and paſſed as returned <hi>Cloathes</hi> for faults, as oftentimes it happeneth <hi>Cloathes</hi> are for <hi>defects</hi> not diſcovered before the ſale there, which found, the buyer returns them back to the <hi>Seller,</hi> and the <hi>Seller</hi> or Factor ſends them over againe, to the end that ſatisfaction may bee had from the Clothier, of whom they were here bought. I cannot blame the <hi>Officer</hi> (whoſe charge it was or is to take notice of ſuch <hi>Returne)</hi> in not making a better ſearch, for how could it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his breaſt that <hi>Clothes</hi> made in a forraigne part ſhould be brought over as <hi>Merchandize</hi> into this Kingdome? he might thinke it according to our Engliſh proverbe, <hi>like the ſending of Coles to New-Caſtle:</hi> I give the more credit unto it, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the deareneſſe of <hi>Wooll</hi> here, and conſequently of <hi>Cloth,</hi> gave encouragement to ſome <hi>Merchant</hi> or <hi>Merchants</hi> to buy in <hi>Holland</hi> ſome <hi>Engliſh Wooll</hi> formerly ſhipt thither, and reſhip it for theſe parts, making entery or paſſing it in the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomebouſe,</hi> before the landing, for <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or ſome other ſort of <hi>Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of the bad <hi>effects,</hi> and that no ſmall one, is the great decay or conſumption of the <hi>Coyne</hi> of the Kingdome, and that may bee made appeare ſundry wayes, I'le onely mention two, viz. the <hi>exportation</hi> or carrying of it out, and want of <hi>Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for ſupply.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt</hi> for <hi>exportation.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> have not drawne a little from us by ſeverall wayes, and ſome hath been ſent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And then ſome <hi>Merchants,</hi> chiefly in reſpect of the falling or lowneſſe of the <hi>Exchange</hi> cauſed by the decay of <hi>Trade</hi> (the like not knowne in many yeares) have exported, it ſeemes, great ſtore of <hi>Gold,</hi> much having been exchanged for <hi>Silver</hi> from 2 <hi>d.</hi> to 8 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, and more (as have been told) by the which they have raiſed good profit, which I could make to appeare, if it were not to give encouragement to ſome <hi>men</hi> (that are too greedy after their owne private gaine, not caring
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99574:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the leaſt how much the Kingdome in generall may ſuffer by it) to practiſe the like. And as our <hi>Gold Coyne,</hi> ſo our <hi>Silver</hi> it ſeemes, hath by ſuch like men been in no little meaſure tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the parts beyond <hi>Sea,</hi> being informed there have been ſeverall ſummes from 100 <hi>l.</hi> and under to 500 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling of late knowne paid in <hi>Holland</hi> at a payment. And ſo much briefly for <hi>exportation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>defect</hi> or want of ſupply by <hi>Importation,</hi> and they are chiefly likewiſe two. The firſt is want of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Returne</hi> in forraigne <hi>Coyne,</hi> and ſometime in <hi>Bullion</hi> by divers <hi>Merchants;</hi> for part proceed of our <hi>Manufactures</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in regard of the then highneſſe of the <hi>Exchange,</hi> which highneſſe was principally cauſed by the ampleneſſe or large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Trade. Secondly,</hi> the want of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> or his <hi>Contractors, Coyne</hi> and <hi>Bullion,</hi> which was ſent from <hi>Spaine</hi> by our Ships into the <hi>Downes,</hi> and after, a good part was brought up hither to <hi>London,</hi> and coyned, and the product partly remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hence by bills of <hi>Exchange</hi> for <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and partly charged thence upon their <hi>Factors</hi> here, ſo that the ſaid <hi>Coyne</hi> and <hi>Bullion</hi> becomming <hi>Engliſh,</hi> remained among us: Whence, <hi>firſt</hi> did ariſe an <hi>Improvement</hi> of our <hi>Kings Revenew</hi> by the Minting or coynage: <hi>Secondly,</hi> a great addition to the <hi>Coyne</hi> of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a benefit to <hi>Merchants</hi> in matter of <hi>Exchange; Fourthly,</hi> a <hi>profit</hi> to <hi>Owners</hi> of Ships; and <hi>fiftly</hi> and laſtly, a great helpe or furtherance to the generall <hi>Trade</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: But the caſe being now altered, the <hi>Mint,</hi> as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo is like for the future to have little to doe; our houſhold <hi>plate</hi> is melted, coyned, and the <hi>money</hi> waſted: the <hi>Merchants</hi> bring in none, for the reaſon before mentioned; <hi>Spaines Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors</hi> dare not ſend any, for feare of a bad iſſue of theſe <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and the <hi>Armies Souldiers</hi> guarding of the <hi>Tower,</hi> adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theirs and other mens feares. And to manifeſt the feare of the ſaid <hi>Contractors</hi> ſending any hither, I am certainly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the value of <hi>ſixty thouſand pounds</hi> was lately ſent by an <hi>Engliſh Ship,</hi> named the <hi>Angell,</hi> from <hi>Spaine</hi> for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> whence it may be eaſily conveyed in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> or kind, or made over by <hi>Exchange</hi> for <hi>Flanders.

of the <hi>united Provinces</hi> are agreed, 'tis confidently beleeved they are, not any hoſtile <hi>Act</hi> having of late been offered between them ſhowes it to be ſo: the <hi>agreement</hi> for ſome reaſon of <hi>Eſtate</hi> not yet publiſhed: the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> &amp;c. forbeare therefore yet openly to trade into the <hi>Dominions</hi> of that <hi>King,</hi> but ſo ſoone as they ſafely may, 'tis very probable their Ships will bee the Conveyers of <hi>Spaines Coyne</hi> for the parts of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and if once a conveyance be practiſed that way, though theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy differences bee amongſt us reconciled, not any uſe to that purpoſe will be made of our <hi>Ships,</hi> and that is likely ſo to be, for I heare from a friend at the penning of this (who came lately out of <hi>Zeland)</hi> that ſome of <hi>Spaines money</hi> was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Middleburg</hi> brought from <hi>Spaine</hi> by a ſhip as hee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, of that place.

And now for the <hi>Employment</hi> in or about our <hi>Manufactures;</hi> And <hi>firſt</hi> to make an <hi>eſtimate</hi> of the number of our people that were employed about our ſaid <hi>Manufactures,</hi> as ſome in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring or fitting the <hi>Wooll</hi> for the <hi>Kembers</hi> or carding of it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Kembing,</hi> others in <hi>ſpinning,</hi> and ſome in <hi>Knitting, Weaving, Tucking, Carrying,</hi> &amp;c. me thinkes the <hi>number</hi> could not be ſo few or ſo little as <hi>a Million</hi> throughout the whole kingdome and Dominion of <hi>Wales:</hi> the which to make more probable, there were many <hi>Clothiers,</hi> each one giving employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to 500. <hi>perſons,</hi> and others gave more: As for or to the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> I need not ſay much, it is ſufficiently knowne unto us, they live amongſt us: they were of both <hi>Sexes,</hi> men and women, and of all ages, from <hi>Childhood</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit <hi>Old age</hi> capable of worke, the greateſt part of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort, yet lived comfortably by their labour.</p>

ſaid <hi>particulars,</hi> I thinke not amiſſe firſt to goe on with what I have more to ſay touching our <hi>Manufactures</hi> thence ariſing, and concerning the aforeſaid <hi>mines,</hi> as in relation th'one to the other in regard of their <hi>Excellency</hi> in matter of <hi>Trade</hi> and otherwiſe, and hope to ſhow ſo much worth in our <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> that with the <hi>Imployment</hi> it affordeth as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, may bee very fitly compared not onely to the Silver pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſaid Mines, but alſo unto <hi>Spaines</hi> whole <hi>Weſt India Trade,</hi> or rather to exceed it: And the better to make good what I ſay, it will not bee much impertinent to this <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> to ſhew what <hi>Silver</hi> is, though knowne to moſt men. <hi>It</hi> is no other thing then a <hi>Minerall</hi> digged out of the bowels of the <hi>earth,</hi> as <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> exceeding all other <hi>metalls</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Gold) in pureneſſe and fineneſſe; and thus much briefly of the <hi>nature</hi> of it. Now in regard of its pureneſſe or fineneſſe (as before ſaid) it gained ſuch credit at firſt in moſt parts of the <hi>world,</hi> where <hi>Trade</hi> was, that the <hi>people</hi> were then willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>it,</hi> as ſince, and ſtill men are, in <hi>exchange</hi> of any or all other <hi>Commodities:</hi> ſo that <hi>it</hi> cannot bee accounted any thing elſe then a <hi>Species</hi> or kind of <hi>Merchandize,</hi> but the chiefeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and moſt generall of all, <hi>Gold</hi> excepted, drawing all things neceſſary for mans uſe unto <hi>it,</hi> where <hi>it</hi> was known, and was and is fit it ſhould ſo be, partly in reſpect of <hi>its portableneſſe</hi> or carriage when divided by the <hi>coynage</hi> into ſmall parts or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, that men might have <hi>it</hi> ready, as well for ſmall as great disburſments or payments for ſuch things as they ſhould have need of to exchange it for, and partly when in a time of <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie</hi> or want of a <hi>Commoditie</hi> in one <hi>Countrey,</hi> and that that Countrey had not any other to exchange for what was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>money</hi> made thereof.

            <p>And now I come to th'other moſt generall <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> viz. our late <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> and that in this place as b<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99574:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Merchandize</hi> in the <hi>whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> in the time of <hi>King James</hi> and of this our moſt <hi>Gracious Soveraign King Charles</hi> till of late yeares. Our <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> having thoſe times gained ſuch <hi>credit,</hi> and ſo deſired in all <hi>forraign parts,</hi> where we traded, that wee could not want any thing in <hi>exchange</hi> of them, returning home all other ſorts of <hi>Merchandize</hi> of the growth and <hi>Manufactures</hi> of forraigne parts here in uſe, and was the cauſe of the <hi>Imployment</hi> of more <hi>Ships</hi> here in one yeare, then <hi>Spaines</hi> whole <hi>Trade</hi> to and in <hi>India</hi> in ten. A conſiderable quantity of our ſaid <hi>Manufactures</hi> were yeerely ſent from <hi>Spaine</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to <hi>India,</hi> which being there ſold or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed</hi> for <hi>Silver</hi> and other <hi>India commodities,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Silver &amp; commodities</hi> were ſent in <hi>returne</hi> of or for them: The truth is that our <hi>Manufactures</hi> gave ſuch a quickning and <hi>life</hi> to that <hi>Trade,</hi> that without them it was very dull and languiſhed not a little And notwithſtanding the great quantities of our ſaid <hi>Manufactures,</hi> which were exported into forraigne parts, yet wee were alwayes well furniſhed with the like at home for our own uſe, ſo that thoſe exported were ſuperfluous and could well be ſpared: <hi>Spaine</hi> could not ſay, it was ſo with the <hi>Silver</hi> it hath or had yeerely home out of <hi>India,</hi> for before the yeere came about, little was left even in their beſt and richeſt <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> As for the <hi>Countrey,</hi> a man might travell to many <hi>Villages</hi> and meet not with a <hi>peece</hi> of 8 <hi>ryalls,</hi> which is the value of 4 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. Sterling,</hi> or our money, but of <hi>Copper coyne,</hi> indeed, there's good ſtore, and that muſt ſerve in ſtead of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold.</hi> Now to make any reaſonable eſtimate of the <hi>value</hi> or what ſumme of money the <hi>Manufactures</hi> of this Kingdome might or did yearely amount unto, not onely of thoſe ſent abroad, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of thoſe ſpent at home, is not poſſible, but that it was to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great <hi>value</hi> not the leaſt doubt, the great <hi>Trade</hi> driven ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with within this Kingdome and Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> for their owne uſe, and the great quantities exported into forraigne parts, giving hundreds of <hi>Ships</hi> imployment to and againe, bore ſufficient teſtimony: ſo that it may be thought, <hi>they</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the value, if not exceeded all the <hi>Silver, Gold,</hi> and all other <hi>Commodities</hi> imported out of <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Spaine</hi> in one yeare,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99574:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which might be eſtimated to import the value of 4 or 5 <hi>Millions</hi> of pounds of our <hi>Engliſh money,</hi> by the which may be gathered in how great meaſure <hi>His Majeſties Subjects</hi> in generall in one kind or other were benefitted by the <hi>Trade</hi> ariſing from the ſaid <hi>Manufactures.</hi> To the which may be added the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit other <hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> had thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partly in matter of duties paid unto them upon or by the ſame, as alſo upon ſuch <hi>commodities</hi> as wee had from them in <hi>returne</hi> of the <hi>Proceed,</hi> amongſt which, chiefly <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the great <hi>duties</hi> paid there, a very great increaſe of that <hi>Kings Revenue.</hi> And partly in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Trade</hi> not onely at home among themſelves, and their neighbouring countries, but alſo into others farre more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote:</hi> as for example: The <hi>Gran Signior</hi> or <hi>Great Turkes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople &amp; Aleppo</hi> ſend a good part of the Clothes they buy there of our <hi>Levant</hi> or <hi>Turkey Merchants</hi> into divers parts of <hi>this</hi> Dominions many hundreds of miles diſtant thence.

            <p>It will be thought, the <hi>Clothiers</hi> and <hi>Merchants Gaines</hi> were not a littie, ſpecially the <hi>Merchants,</hi> to which anſwer.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Merchants Gaine,</hi> it was then ſo little, and is now leſſe then it may be made appeare for ſome yeares paſt, moſt of them have not gained by their <hi>Trade</hi> one time with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother 10 <hi>per Centum per Annum:</hi> and for the moſt part raiſe their <hi>Gaine</hi> by their <hi>Commodities</hi> exported, and loſe by what is imported, but this indeed more particularly by that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> or <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> commonly called by the name of <hi>Merchant Adventurers.</hi> That <hi>Trade</hi> is certainly beſt for the Kingdome, by which the <hi>Gaine</hi> ariſeth from what is exported, and loſſe by what is imported. So that this great <hi>advance</hi> of or from the <hi>materiall Wooll</hi> commeth to ariſe; <hi>firſt</hi> from the <hi>Manufacture</hi> or making: &amp; ſecondly, from ſundry ſorts of <hi>charges</hi> or <hi>duties,</hi> whence that duty of <hi>Tunnage &amp; Poundage,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>

            <p>HEre are now Letters out of the parts of <hi>Italy</hi> adviſing the non-ſending of any more of our <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> for that <hi>thoſe</hi> of the like kind made in other <hi>Countries</hi> and ſent thither, are not onely better but cheaper. But ſome perhaps will object, that though for preſent wee loſe the <hi>vent</hi> of our <hi>Manufactures,</hi> wee may hereafter regaine it, and that when <hi>Wooll</hi> comes to be had at ſuch low rates as formerly, which when that will be <hi>God knowes:</hi> Let not ſuch men flatteringly ſatisfi themſelves with ſo vaine a hope, but remember what hath been ſaid of the loſſe of the totall vent of our broad Cloth in <hi>Spaine</hi> in the time of <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and what hath been further mentioned of the late great increaſe of <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> elſewhere, to the great decay of the <hi>vent</hi> of <hi>Ours,</hi> and the no little impoveriſhing of the <hi>ſtook</hi> of the Kingdome. <hi>Some things,</hi> indeed, if not totally loſt, are recoverable; but would be a peere of the greateſt <hi>indiſeretion</hi> to expoſe a thing of ſuch high concernment (as have ſaid) to the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to the hazard of <hi>loſſe,</hi> when there may bee wayes of <hi>prevention.</hi> And withall conſider that when one <hi>State</hi> hath got a <hi>thing</hi> from another to it ſelfe, which is or may be advantageous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, it will uſe all the meanes poſſible to keepe and advance <hi>it:</hi> I need not ſend you further off then our owne <hi>home</hi> for a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,</hi> you may pleaſe to turne backe to Folio 5. in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi> and you ſhall finde what this <hi>State</hi> did in <hi>King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the thirds time to get the <hi>Manufacture</hi> of <hi>Broad Cloth</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and what was afterward done to keepe <hi>it</hi> here in this kingdome. Beſides <hi>People</hi> in theſe times are more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matters concerning <hi>Trade,</hi> and have better meanes to improve <hi>them</hi> to more advantage then in former times: many <hi>things</hi> which in former ages lay hidden and not thought upon, have beene diſcovered in theſe latter, and more will be in the future; <hi>mans braine is ſtill a working.</hi>
