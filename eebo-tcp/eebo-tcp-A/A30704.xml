            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN times when People are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched in their Intellectuals as well as in their Morals, and take as great a liberty of opining as they do of practiſing, it is no wonder if in this Age, when as all Sects ſeem to have a general reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sect have alſo their Abettors; but if People would but ſeriouſly conſider, that the change of the Day hath the ſame Foundation that the Scriptures themſelves have (and that is Catholick Tradition) the Controverſie would quickly be at an end: It would then be an eaſie thing to believe, that when the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Frame of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was laid aſide, it was fit that the very Time it ſelf ſhould alſo put on Mourning, and therefore well may it paſs for a Fast
<pb facs="tcp:54580:3"/>
as our Church hath rightly instituted it; but to continue it as a Feaſt to the Lord, is to put an Affront upon the Goſpel and the whole Oeconomy of it. And therefore if this Tract may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing, either to the confirming thoſe that ſtand, or the eſtabliſhing thoſe that are ready to fall, or recovering of thoſe that are already gone aſtray, the Author hath his end, and deſires thee to give God all the Glory.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>GReat is the Obligation you have laid upon me, in condeſcending ſo far as to communicate unto me thoſe Scripture grounds and reaſons, which have had ſuch an irreſiſtable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon your Conſcience, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſuch a change in your Judgement and Practice, relating to the obſervation of the Weekly Sabbath, from what you have formerly believed and practiſed, and that I am fully perſwaded in Godly ſincerity: This, Sir, is as I underſtand, the diſcourſe of many, the wonder of not a few, and the grief of ſome.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, that the report which you ſay was brought unto you, was true; I did indeed deſire that you would be pleaſed at your leiſure, if you thought good, to add ſome Scripture-proofs to thoſe Propoſitions which I had formerly received from you: Which I think I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54580:10"/>
ſhould not have taken the boldneſs to have done, but that you had given me encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as I ſuppoſe you remember when, and where, and how: which now that you have done, I ſhall endeavour to obſerve your order in giving you my thoughts of them, and that, as they ſtand in your Paper; and according to your deſire, expreſly declare my aſſent and conſent to the ſeveral particulars, ſo far as I am convinced that they are according to the mind of God; and wherein I diſſent, to give you my reaſons thereof, and yet as you expect in a Scripture way, ſo far as I am able and underſtand the meaning of that expreſſion, and ſubmit all to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning your three firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, I do both heartily aſſent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly conſent unto you, ſo far as I apprehend aright your mind in them, as divine truths of infallible veracity, deeply engraven in the Word of Truth. Oh that they were as deeply engraven in the hearts of all the Lords profeſſing People! Only I crave leave to tell you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whereas for the proof of the firſt, That Jehovah Chriſt is by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54580:10"/>
of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas, I ſay, for the proof of this you quote, if I miſtake not, near about 26 Scriptures, I cannot either aſſent or conſent, that every one of them ſpeaks clearly to the confirmation of the Propoſition, poſſibly they are miſ-written <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y the Tranſcriber; however the Truth is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſome of them, and I think all of them may afford matter of comfortable meditation for the right improvement of Chriſts Kingly Office, which perhaps is all that you intend by them. Bleſſed be the Lord, the Government is upon his ſhoulder, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.8. that he is the King of Nations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.17. that he is the King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. head over all things to the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22. hath power over all fleſh, to give eternal life to all thoſe the father hath given him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. That Scripture (which is well obſerved by you) in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.32. is much to be taken notice of; for underſtand the words in a Spiritual ſence, and they are excluſive of all other; <hi>Chriſt alone, Chriſt and no other, is our only King, and our only Law-giver.</hi> It is true, the Commands of the Magiſtrate bind the Conſcience, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54580:11"/>
we muſt be ſubject for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. yet not immediately, but by the intervention of Gods Command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. nor yet univerſally, but with limitation; we muſt obey the Lord Chriſt, upon the bare ſight of his Will: But the Laws of <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, are farther to be conſidered of, that ſo our obedience unto them may be without ſcruple, and our ſubjection not from ſelf-intereſt, but in deed and in truth, from principles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Whereas for the proof of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition, that the Holy Scripture of truth is a perfect and ſufficient rule, for Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, you produce eleven or twelve Scriptures: Thus far I conſent that the propoſition is true, and ſufficiently proved, though ſome of the Scriptures are upon ſome account or other, miſtaken or miſquoted, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. which perhaps you intend for <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. The one ſpeaks not to the point, as the other doth; from the latter, <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> as I remember, conceives that the Scriptures may be ſaid to be Canonical; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a perfect Canon, nothing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereunto, not by any Revelation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54580:11"/>
from the ſpirit, much leſs from any humane Traditions, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. If an Angel from Heaven preach any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, let him, ſaith the Apoſtle, again, and again he ſaith it, let him be accurſed. Yet I think this limitation is fit to be inſerted, that there are ſome Circumſtances concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Worſhip, and Adminiſtration of Church affairs (ſuch I mean, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to humane Actions and Societies) which are to be ordered by Chriſtian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but ſtill according to the general rules of the word, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be obſerved, that ſo as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>All things may be done decently and in order:</hi> that [<hi>all things</hi>] that is, all the Ordinances of God, for of them he ſpeaks, as appears in the foregoing verſes: <hi>Prayer and Singing of Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. This text give no other power to any Church, or Church Governors, but that all ſuch things as God appoints, be done decently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uncomlineſs, and orderly without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That whereas for the proof of the third Propoſition, That the ten words are a perfect, compleat, and ſtanding rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you produce at leaſt twenty Scriptures: I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54580:12"/>
both Aſſent, and Conſent, acknowledging the Propoſition ſufficiently proved; though I muſt ſay, as I ſaid before, that every particular text which is quoted, comes not up fully to prove the point, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth it is, beyond all contradiction, that as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. the commands are exceeding broad, containing an infinite, and incomprehenſible treaſure of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom, nothing perteining to holineſs, nothing is wanting that is neceſſary for direction to all men, in all conditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is an eternal rule of Righteouſeneſs; and as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my word,</hi> ſaith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſhall not paſs away.</hi> Thus God hath magnified his Law, and made it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21. Thus you ſee, how in truth of theſe three propoſitions I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> But now for the fourth Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the ſeventh day, which is the laſt day in every week, in the weekly revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is alone that peculiar day in every week, which is the weekly Sabbath day, to be kept holy to <hi>Jehovah</hi> in obedience to his Commands. For the proof whereof you bring <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54580:12"/>
13. to this I muſt crave leave to ſay; that as yet I can neither Aſſent, nor Conſent, being no ways convinced by any thing I find in your paper, that is according to the mind of God, revealed in his word, or proved in the leaſt, either by theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or the reaſons produced for the proof thereof.</p>
            <p>That which takes hold of my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in this matter I ſhall lay before you, when I have,
<list>
                  <item>1. Firſt told you, what is the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I obſerve in your paper.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly given you ſome few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which I think meet to be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, to avoid repititions hereafter.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I obſerve, that all your Arguments are grounded upon a ſtrong apprehenſion you are under, that the Seventh day, the laſt day in every Week, is the ſubſtance of the fourth Commandment: And that it is moral natural, written in the Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in <hi>Adam,</hi> which was framed to the perfection of the ten words, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it in your third general reaſon. But in this, I can neither Aſſent, nor Conſent: The reaſon of my Diſſent, you ſhall have in its proper place; I mean, why I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54580:13"/>
that though the Humane nature in <hi>Adam</hi> was made after the Image of God in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs; yet the Law for the laſt day of ſeven in every Week to be the only day for the Weekly Sabbath, was not written there.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> I obſerve, that your apprehenſions are ſtrong, that the laſt day of ſeven in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Week, and the Sabbath day, that is, the day of holy reſt of Gods appointment for his ſolemn worſhip in every Week, are and muſt be terms Convertible, and that the laſt of ſeven in every Week, as it was at firſt, ſo it is now, and muſt ſo continue, to the end of the World is the only day for that purpoſe. This I gather from thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given to inforce obedience to the Commands which you ſay properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this day, and are, as you think, applicable to no other day: Herein I can neither aſſent nor conſent, and why I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I ſhall give you my grounds, when I have firſt conſidered the propoſitions you lay down before them.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> I obſerve, and that not without ſome wonder, that though the whole ſtreſs of all your Arguments, is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, laid upon the 9, 10, 11, verſes of <hi>Exod.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54580:13"/>
20. Yet I find nothing at all Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to prove, that the ſcope, ſence, and meaning of theſe words, is to eſtabliſh the laſt of ſeven, in the revolution of every Week, to be the only day of Holy reſt, which is to be obſerved to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to the end of the World; which is the propoſition you engage your ſelf to make good; which till you have done by ſome other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than this paper affords, or by theſe Arguments more clearly; I do believe that what you now aſſert, will not be ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received for truth, according to the mind of God, as you think it ought, and as it ought, if it be indeed the mind of God in his Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Having obſerved theſe things, I now crave leave to lay down ſome few propoſitions, which being conſidered of, may be, according to what I apprehend, of ſome uſe, (they are at leaſt to me) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the clearing up of the matter under debate, and meet to be inſerted here, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, as you ſaid, as much as may be, repetitions hereafter. They are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, That all dayes materially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, are equal, and of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54580:14"/>
the ſame nature in that reſpect, none more neceſſary to be obſerved than another; none more ſubſervient to any ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than another; every day had the ſame efficient cauſe, all being created by God, and all very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. all ruled and governed by him, and filled up with what providential diſpenſation ſeemed good in his ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.16. Thus all dayes conſidered as I ſay materially in themſelves, now and ever will be alike: As they were under the Law, ſo under the Goſpel, none of them more eminent nor obſervable by any natural goodneſs than another. If this be ſo, and I think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed but that it is ſo, this will be one ſtrong argument, as I apprehend, to prove that the laſt day of ſeven in every week, to be the only, and perpetual day for the day of weekly holy reſt unto <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> was not written in the humane nature in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, as I hope to make evident when I come to ſpeak to the third general reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, That though the letter of the Text ought alway to be carefully heeded, yet alway to ſtick to it, and never compare Scripture with Scripture, for the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54580:14"/>
better underſtanding of the ſence thereof, may prove a dangerous ſnare. This hath been the Butt of Contention between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and this hath been the death of many faithful Martyrs, by the Popiſh Generation, when and where they had power in their hands, the one holding too pertinaciouſly to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body,</hi> for the maintaining of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; a ſad inſtance we have of this in that Conference at <hi>Huſſia,</hi> at <hi>Marpurgus,</hi> I remember (for the Book I have not by me) between <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Oecolampadius, Bucer,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Divines, as it is related in the Annals of <hi>Soul<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etus,</hi> where we read, that even <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf rejected very ſtrong reaſons, againſt which he had nothing to ſay but <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi>; this if the Tranſlator of his <hi>Menſalia</hi> hath not wronged him, he receded from that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before his death: So the Popiſh Commentators ſticking to the letter of the Text, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.14. where it is ſaid, that a man is juſtified by Works, and not by Faith only, ſo far as they are believed, overturn the foundation of Faith: The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54580:15"/>
like in part may be ſaid of ſticking to the letter of the fourth Commandment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding of the ſcope, ſence, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it: I think thereby a man ſhall caſt a miſt before his eyes, which will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hinder him from the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Mind of God therein: If I ſhould do ſo, I ſhould find it to be ſo. This being ſo, makes way for a third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which thus I lay down.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Thirdly, Though all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, believed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in order to Salvation, are clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed (though not altogether, but) in one place or other of the Scripture, ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ordinary capacities in the right uſe of means, aſſiſted by the holy Spirit of God, may attain a ſufficient underſtanding of them, ſo as not to periſh for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet all truths are not alike plain in themſelves, nor alike clear to all: Some things are hard to be underſtood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. which though <hi>Peter</hi> (ſpeaking no doubt upon his own knowledge) ſaith ſome miſconſtrued to their own ruine; yet, which is worthy our obſervation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he, nor <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf (who was yet alive, as ſeemed by that expreſſion in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54580:15"/>
the former part of the verſe (<hi>our beloved brother Paul</hi>) and in all probability knew as much in this matter as <hi>Peter</hi> did) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them I ſay, did clear or amend the difficulties, but let them alone as they were. Thus it ſeemed good to the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by whoſe inſpiration the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was written, to have it ſo: Some truths are as if it were hid under the rock, that ſo there might be digging and ſearching after the knowledge of them, <hi>as for hid Treaſures, Prov.</hi> 2.4. and if I ſay that the ſecond and fourth Commandments may be reckoned amongſt ſuch truths, I think I ſhould have many that would ſay ſo too; I have reaſon to ſay, they have been both ſo to me, but bleſſed be the Lord for that Light, how little ſoever I have received in the one or in the other. Doubtleſs it concerns us therefore to be much in Prayer, that God would open our eyes, that we might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the wonderful things of his Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10. The vail that was upon the hearts of the <hi>Jews</hi> in reading the Old Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14, 15. is not fully removed from the hearts of the moſt knowing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to this day: He that knows moſt, hath cauſe to acknowledge he knows but in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54580:16"/>
part, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. therefore I may propoſe, but I dare not impoſe any of my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions upon others.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Fourthly, I deſire this may be obſerved, which I ſuppoſe will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that a proof drawn by comparing Scripture with Scripture, or by neceſſary conſequence from Scripture rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is a ſufficient Scripture proof, even of that which in expreſs words is not found in Scripture: That which we have, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. is no where that I can ſee found in Scripture, in ſo many expreſs words and ſyllables, but the truth contained therein is clear; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith that the Scripture ſaith, that the Spirit that is in us luſteth to envy: Many ſuch inſtances might be given, evidently proving, that Inferences rightly deduced, are to be valued as expreſs Scripture. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32, the Lord Chriſt himſelf proves the Reſurrection of the Juſt, not by expreſs Scripture, but by conſequence. Thus for the Baptizing of Infants, and many other things which come frequently under ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, we have not expreſs Scripture for, or in full, and entire ſentences toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but here a little, and there a little,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54580:16"/>
which compared together, and wiſely and faithfully improved by rational Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, ſufficiently prove that Truth they are brought for: And if the Divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the firſt day of the Week, can be thus cleared up, for the day of the weekly Sabbath, as I doubt not but it may, it is ſufficient to me it is.</p>
            <p>He that conceives himſelf under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to any thing, but what he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture for, in ſo many words and ſyllables, will either enlarge his liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its due bounds, or ſtreighten his rule beyond what is written, and perhaps both: its a dangerous thing to refuſe him that ſpeaks from Heaven, which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> Fifthly, Let this be alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the holy Will of God, which is the rule of all righteouſneſs, concerning what is required of man to do, hath been revealed, though the time when, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it hath been revealed, be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture. This to me is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for the Will of God concerning Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing, was without doubt, revealed unto <hi>Abel,</hi> before the Law for Sacrifices was given; for what he did therein, he did in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54580:17"/>
Faith, and eminently found acceptance with God in what he did therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. neither the Light of Nature, which is the knowledge of Principles, neither the Law of Nature, which is the concluſions drawn from theſe Principles, could ever have made known this way of Worſhip to be a Duty, if God had not ſome way revealed his Will to him therein. This I hope will be made evident when I come to ſpeak of the third general Reaſon.</p>
            <p>If he had impoſed this upon himſelf, and that it had been the Product of his own imagination, it had been will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Therefore certainly he had ſome word for it, but when he received it, and where, and how that way of Worſhip was inſtituted for him to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, I never heard of any that could find it in the Scripture. Great uſe may be made of this, if need were, for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of this preſent Controverſie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an expreſs word for the inſtitution and obſerving the firſt day of the Week to be the Lords-day, the day for his Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath; we might ſay, that it might be inſtituted, though it be not recorded
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54580:17"/>
when, and where, as it was in the caſe of <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrificing; but I hope we ſhall not be driven to this, however I cannot but ſuppoſe it is of good uſe for ſome eſpecially to conſider of.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Sixthly, I deſire that this alſo may be conſidered, that what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtles, as they were guided by the holy Spirit of Truth, ought to be received and believed as delivered and ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf was never in perſon at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and yet 'tis ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. that he came thither and preached peace unto them: we muſt underſtand it, that he did ſo in the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, which was all one as if he had been there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. None that I know of durſt ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove, that ever they preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed any thing for all the Churches to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, but what they received in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Lord Jeſus. This was their charge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teach what I command you</hi>; and this was their practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10, 23. <hi>What I received from the Lord, that I delivered unto you</hi>: ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.</p>
            <p>It is evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. that Jeſus
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54580:18"/>
Chriſt ſpake many things unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdom of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſtate of the Goſpel-Church, of all which we have no knowledge (I have not I am ſure) in particular what they were, farther than is found in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and practice, recorded in the New Teſtament: And what if I ſhould ſay, that the change of the day from the laſt in ſeven, to the firſt in ſeven, was one of theſe things, I know not what could be ſaid againſt it; but of that more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> Seventhly, Though I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as above, my aſſent and conſent concerning the Ten words to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obligatory, or a ſtanding and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable rule for all Chriſtians in all ages to walk by, that ſo they may walk in all well-pleaſing unto God, (as once I heard very ſolidly proved by your ſelf, in an Exerciſe wholly upon that ſubject, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8, 9. As I remember) though I ſay, and ſay it again, that herein I conſent with you; yet I ſay it now, and muſt ſay it again hereafter, that the day of weekly holy Reſt is altered, and yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54580:18"/>
that alteration is no diſſolution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and that no tittle of the Law is broken thereby, and that the firſt day of the week is and ought to be as much the weekly Sabbath for the Chriſtians now, as the laſt day of the week was to the Jews of old; and that there is as good ground (though perhaps not ſo clear to every one) for the change of the day, as there was at firſt for the choice of the day: this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what you aſſerted in your paper.</p>
            <p>I come now according as you deſired me to take your 4th Propoſition into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and your Reaſons in order as they ſtand, whereby you endeavour to confirm it, having again, and again in ſome weak meaſure, I praiſe the Lord, prayed for the aſſiſtance of the holy ſpirit of truth, to guide and direct me that I may write nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth; being at this preſent under the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the dreadful ſentence that I may be called to an account, I know not how ſoon, before the great and glorious God, for what I think, for what I write, as well as for what I ſpeak, or what I do: I bleſs God I am willing that truth ſhould be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54580:19"/>
truth, and appear to be truth. Your fourth Propoſition (though I have repeated it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet I think it meet to repeat it here again) is this;</p>
            <p>The ſeventh day, which is the laſt day in every week in the weekly returns of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the proof of this, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12, 15. I conceive you lay the whole ſtreſs of your Arguments upon that in <hi>Exod.</hi> and that you do not ſo much as imagine, that <hi>Deut.</hi> the 5th affords you any more help, than what you have from the other alone.</p>
            <p>This is that which is to be taken into ſerious conſiderations, whether your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition takes in, or be agreeable unto the full ſenſe of the Commandment, and that the Commandment ſpeaks the ſame thing that the Propoſition doth; it ſeems as yet far otherwiſe to me, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment requires only the obſervation of one day in ſeven, and doth not inſtitute any particular day, either the laſt or the firſt.</p>
            <p>The laſt of ſeven had its inſtitution, as you ſeem to acknowledge, (which I was glad to find in your paper) in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. where, and when the firſt day had its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54580:19"/>
will be enquired into when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is cleared, <hi>viz.</hi> That the fourth Commandment requires only the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one whole day in ſeven for the weekly Sabbath, not inſtituting either the firſt, or the laſt, for any ſuch intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And becauſe, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. that the Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is a Light, I deſire therefore in the ſtrength of the Lord Jeſus, depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for light and direction, to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſenſe and meaning of this Law:</p>
            <p>But firſt I ſhall premiſe this, That</p>
            <p>As the ſecond, ſo the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes in ſome things under a difr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent conſideration from moſt, if not from all the reſt: my meaning is this; There is ſomething in each of them is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral natural, and ſomething which is only poſitive. In the ſecond Commandment this is moral natural that God ought to be worſhipped, not as men will themſelves, but as God himſelf wills and deſcribes; but in what ordinances, or acts of worſhip, this is only poſitive. So in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment this is moral natural, that there be a time, a ſufficient time for the ſolemn worſhip of God, and yet ſuch a ſufficient
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54580:20"/>
time, as leaves ſufficiency of time for our worldly buſineſs and affairs. This the light of nature will teach, but without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the will of God, nature cannot determine the time, as to the frequency of its revolution, or if that, not the particular day that ought to be the time, which is the matter under debate betwixt us, but of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter: only I mention it here, becauſe this is that which I have now to do, to give you my reaſons why I conceive that what the ſubſtance of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires; either as naturally moral, or poſitively moral, or Gods manner of reſting, or his bleſſing and ſanctifying the day of his reſt, or the revolution of time in which the day ought to be obſerved, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, reacheth no farther than the obſervation of one whole day in ſeven, not directly pointing out any particular day, but only by conſequence at the laſt of ſeven, becauſe it was enjoyned before.</p>
            <p>Now I cannot better nor in fewer words give you my reaſon of this, than to give you an account of my Faith, what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be the ſence and meaning of the Commandment, and it is this;</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54580:20"/>1. Firſt, I obſerve as it were the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving forth of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Remember the Sabbath day, that is, the day of holy reſt of Gods appointing, to keep it holy to the Lord: In <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.12. A text quoted in your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we have this which is the moral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Commandment not given as in ſome other places it is, by it ſelf alone, but together with all the ten words in its proper place and order; and which is to me very obſervable, the reaſon from Gods reſting is omitted, neither is it at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from the Creation, but from a Type of our Redemption, their deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage. Such a material omiſſion or alteration ſeemeth to be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant of ſomething, whereof more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, in the ſhutting up or Concluſion of the Commandment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. Wherefore the Lord bleſſed, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not the ſeventh day (of which more hereafter) but the Sabbath day of holy reſt: this is evident, yet neither in the opening, nor ſhutting up of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where we have the moral ſubſtance of the Commandment, there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54580:21"/>
of any particular day at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> I obſerve what intervenes, and comes in by way of explication or inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obedience, between the opening, and ſhutting up of the Commandment and therefore comes in to be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, In what revolution of time God had appointed this day of holy reſt to be obſerved, and that is one whole day of ſeven, of every ſeven days, ſix for labour, one for reſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and former part of <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Thus far we have a comely order in the Commandment, ſuitable to the infinite wiſdom of God, firſt ſettling a day that ought to be obſerved, and then the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of time in which that day ought to be obſerved; how often, not one in twenty days, nor one in ten days, but one in ſeven days, one day in every week, which is well obſerved by your ſelf in the third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, I obſerve the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obedience to the Commandment from Gods example of reſting the ſeventh day, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. Here I do acknowledg the laſt of ſeven is mentioned, but not as any branch of the unchangeable moral ſubſtance of the Commandment, nor the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54580:21"/>
of it directly required but onely conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, being inſtituted before as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by your ſelf: and it muſt be acknowledged by all, that the laſt of ſeven here mentioned, had firſt of all the honor to be the day of Gods appointing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it was obſerved, and no other, till the time came that another day the firſt of ſeven, was to ſucceed in the room of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Particulars of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which as far as I can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, are moſt obſervable in thoſe four Verſes quoted in your Paper, and in none of them all can I find any thing that ſeems to give any Teſtimony to the Truth of your Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Nothing as was ſaid before either in the giving forth, or ſhutting up of the Commandment, there is no mention of any particular day, one or other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing in what intervenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nothing in what expreſſeth the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of time wherein the day of holy reſt is to be obſerved. Six days ſhalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Thus I underſtand this limitation, or rule for direction.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54580:22"/>1. Six days ſhalt thou labour, unleſs God otherwiſe appoint; and he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in the old Adminiſtration, other days to be kept holy, which though not alway, yet ſometimes fell out on ſome or other of the ſix working days. This I think none will deny.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Further, Six days ſhalt thou labour, not excluding the ſolemn worſhip of God out of thoſe ſix days, as is well obſerved by our ſelf: as if it were a ſin for a man to hear a Sermon, or to ſet ſome hours a part for prayer any of theſe ſix days, as it is for a man to work upon that day of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which God ſets apart for himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet further, which is moſt to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. Six days, &amp;c. reſt one, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the laſt of ſeven that was inſtituted before, but onely thus, Six parts of the time ſhall be for your ſelves, the ſeventh ſhall be mine, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.14. you ſhall have four parts, ſaith <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the fifth ſhall be <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> Let all be divided into five parts, four ſhall be for your ſelves, the fifth ſhall be for the King, not telling them which fifth but only one of five. So <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 27. Let all be divided into ten you ſhall have nine, the tenth ſhall be the Lords, not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54580:22"/>
them which ten, but only one of ten. Thus I underſtand the word, ſix days of the week ſhall be for your ſelves, one ſhall be mine. Thus I finde not one word for the laſt of ſeven, and which I muſt remember again, in the third Reaſon you plead the equity onely for one of ſeven.</p>
            <p>I have heard that you alledged the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew particle ה <hi>verſe</hi> 10. as emphatical; but becauſe you do not mention it in your paper, I ſhall ſay nothing to it now, but when you form your Argument from it, I ſhall give that which ſatisfies me for the preſent in Anſwer to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As nothing is here where the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time is fixed which ſpeaks in behalf of your Propoſition, ſo I find nothing at all in Gods exemple for it; nothing there but one day of ſeven, from the beginning of the Creation; but it doth not therefore follow that it was the mind of God, that the ſame day muſt be obſerved for ever. I ſhall give you my reaſon why I conceive ſo, when firſt I have given you the ſence wherein I conceive the words are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Thus, We muſt not underſtand this properly according to the Letter, for the infinite glorious divine eſſence ceaſeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54580:23"/>
no more to work than he ceaſeth to be God; neither doth he reſt as man doth, becauſe he is weary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.28. We are therefore to underſtand his ceaſing to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; from the works of providence order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſpoſing all thing that he hath made he never reſteth, according to that <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. Having thus given you the ſenſe, now I ſhall give you my Reaſons, why I conceive that this example of Gods reſting is not alledged here to lay an obligation upon the Conſcience, that the ſame day wherein he reſted, which was the laſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ought to be obſerved for ever.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, It ſeems to me to relate to what God himſelf did, rather then any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as an argument to prove that for which you urge it. I will give you a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Scripture wherein the Example of the Lord Jeſus is thus to be underſtood, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. We have there the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, when, and how it was inſtituted, repeated out of the Evangeliſts, and Chriſts example is related as to the time when, that it was not only in the night, but in that particular night in which he was betrayed: now this is not recorded as a binding rule for our imitation, for then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54580:23"/>
night, Adminiſtrations ſhould not onely of abſolute neceſſity be obſerved, but that particular night in which he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is commonly called with us Thurſday night, which is more then ever I heard, that any one practiſed as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty; I am ſure the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. This example of Chriſt then, ſeems to be hiſtorically related, and whether the like may not be ſaid of Gods example in the Commandment, let it be conſidered. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, though Gods exemple be hiſtorically related, yet it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be related for ſome ſpecial end and purpoſe: As the example of Chriſt in the forementioned Scripture was without all doubt mentioned upon the higheſt ground of reaſon; which to ſpeak of here though it might be of good uſe, yet it would be a digreſſion from the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>And the ſpecial end, and purpoſe why Gods example is here related, ſeems to be this, even to ſhew that what is required in the Commandment is equal and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and for mans good: The holy Laws of God are often called Judgments, as for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54580:24"/>
other Reaſons, ſo ſpecially I think for this, to ſhew that God requires nothing but what is juſt and equal. Thus God reaſons the caſe with thoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18, 25. <hi>Hear ye me O houſe of Iſrael, are not my waies equal?</hi> and therefore certainly the ſence of the Argument from Gods example which doth beſt ſhew the equity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and to be for the good of thoſe that obſerve it, is the beſt, and trueſt ſence. Now to argue that becauſe God wrought the ſix firſt days of ſeven, and then reſted the laſt of ſeven, this carries no convincing reaſon with it, that therefore we ought firſt to work ſix days of the week, and then to reſt the laſt day of the week, and to keep it holy to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Reaſon, right Reaſon, if that alone were to judge, would rather judge it fit to keep the firſt of ſeven holy to the Lord, and ſeeing by Divine allowance we have ſix for one, take the ſix laſt to our ſelves. In reaſon we may hope, that the work on Earth will ſpeed beſt, when our work for Heaven is done firſt: But now to argue from Gods example, that it bindeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the firſt of ſeven, nor to the laſt of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54580:24"/>
ſeven, but to one of ſeven, carries very great reaſon in it.</p>
            <p>For if the great God, who needs not one moment either for reſt, or for work, who never fainteth, who never is weary, wrought ſix days, and reſted one, how much more ſhould poor frail man, hold that proportion, who by reaſon both of bodily weakneſs, and ſpiritual wants, needs ſuch a competency of time both for his worldly imployment, and Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments; and thus much you ſay your ſelf hath been already noted. Thus you have my reaſon why I conceive there is nothing in Gods example, that affords any help to afford your Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I find as little in Gods bleſſing and ſanctifying the Sabbath-day, for that which you alledge it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, To give the ſence, <hi>[he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it] i. e.</hi> ſeparated it from common uſe, to be filled up with ſuch duties as he appoints; and then <hi>[bleſſed it] i. e.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be a day of bleſſing. A day naturally conſidered, is capable of no other bleſſing, but only to be a means of bleſſing according to Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but his bleſſing and ſanctifying it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54580:25"/>
ſecures the bleſſing to the right obſervers of it.</p>
            <p>Now for my reaſon why herein I diſſent from you; 'tis this, He bleſſed and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it, but not as it was the laſt day of ſeven, but as it was the day of his Reſt, declaring thereby Creation-work to be perfected. Neither was his reſting, ſo far as I can ſee, the ground of his bleſſing and ſanctifying it, but as conſidered in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the reaſon of his Reſt, his finiſhing the Creation; and alſo with the reſult and conſequence of his Reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his magnifying and honouring that day for the time being, above all other dayes, for the greateſt work then in being.</p>
            <p>Whether this bleſſing be applicable to no other day but this, as you ſay it is not, in the third Branch of the firſt Reaſon for the confirming your Propoſition, ſhall be conſidered of when it comes to be ſpoken to, in order as it ſtands in your Paper; and I hope to make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to appear, at leaſt it appears ſo to me.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, To mention it once again, though it was hinted before, in the very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54580:25"/>
concluſion of the Commandment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. though the laſt of ſeven is mentioned in the ſame verſe, in the words immediately foregoing, it is not ſaid, I mean in that place, that he bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day, (though it be ſaid, that he did bleſs it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. in the ſence that is given above) but he bleſſed and ſanctified the Sabbath day. What ſhould be the reaſon of the ſuddain change of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? I conceive it may be this, and I think it may not be unworthy of your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration; it may be this I ſay, Becauſe the Command for the Sabbath-day, was to be of a larger extent, than the laſt day of ſeven. I cannot but think, that if God had intended to bind his Church in all ages to the end of the world, to the laſt day of ſeven, as you conceive he hath done, he would have fixed upon that day in the concluſion of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have given you my reaſons why I diſſent from you, in that ſence which you give of the Commandment in your Propoſition: And why I adhere to that Propoſition, that the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires only the obſervation of one
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54580:26"/>
day in ſeven, not fixing it either upon the firſt, or the laſt day of ſeven, but only by conſequence pointing at the laſt of ſeven, then to be obſerved, becauſe it was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and to continue till the firſt of ſeven was to ſucceed it.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid in the place formerly quoted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. ſo <hi>David</hi> his Father ſaid before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightneng the eyes</hi>; and this is the light which the Father of lights hath given me from the Commandment. I ſhall ſhut up all that for the preſent I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, as for the ſence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, with this; that as the ſecond Commandment, as I ſaid in the entrance into this diſcourſe, may parallel with the fourth Commandment, in requiring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is ſuperadded to the law and light of nature; ſo 'tis evident in this, that as the ſecond Commandment doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the worſhip of God, but only in the General, that it be according to his revealed will, and under that General, both old Ordinances, Sacrifice, Circumciſion, and the Paſſover inſtituted, elſewhere are there required; So</p>
            <p>Likewiſe New Teſtament Ordinances
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54580:26"/>
Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are both comprehended, though neither named; ſo in the fourth Commandment, both the laſt of ſeven, and firſt of ſeven, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, though neither of them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named; but onely one of them conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially as was ſaid before, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inſtituted; ſo that the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is perpetually obligatory for one day in ſeven, and then the ſubſtance of the Commandment is ſtill unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, thus the day admits of a change, not as a Ceremony, but as a Circumſtance; the change of the day being no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the morality of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, than the change or worſhip to the morality of the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And farther I add this, that I confeſs I am at a very great loſs, how it ſhould be ſo as it hath been, and as it is at this day, that in a manner, the whole Chriſtian world ſhould centre in the obſervation of the firſt day, if it had been a breach of the fourth Commandment which hath been ſo often read, and ſo often preached upon.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to ſay any more than what hath been ſaid to thoſe Reaſons
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54580:27"/>
which are produced in your Paper for the confirmation of your Propoſition, I ſhall give you in as few words as poſſibly I can, what I have for the preſent to ſay for the change of the day, from the laſt of ſeven to the firſt of ſeven; and that being done, I conceive I ſhall not need to ſay much to any of the Reaſons, though I intend not, by the Lords aſſiſtance, to paſs over any of them without ſaying ſomething, and that as you deſire, according to the order as they ſtand.</p>
            <p>To make entrance into this which I am now to ſpeak unto; as none denies but that the laſt of ſeven was the only day in the revolution of every week to be kept holy to the Lord to the end of the old world, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the Church that then was of the Jews, till the time of Reformation ſhould come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. ſo I conceive it cannot with reaſon be denied, but that ſince the beginning of the new world, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, frequently in Scripture called the world to come, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only that <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. ſince then I ſay, it cannot I think, with any ſhew of reaſon, be denied, that the firſt of ſeven hath been generally acknowledged in all Chriſtian
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54580:27"/>
Churches unto this day, and will be (to ſpeak as yet I do believe) till time ſhall be no more; though by what Authority, is the great matter in queſtion, but the thing is certain, though it hath been of late, as I have heard, dropt up and down, in and about the Town, that this exalting of the firſt day of ſeven above the laſt of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was done by the Authority of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> I wondred at this when I heard of it, for though it be true that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> writing the life of that Chriſtian Emperor ſaith, that by law he enacted, that the firſt day of the week, ſhould be the great weekly holy day to the Lord: Yet to conclude from hence, that he was the Author of the change of the day; we may as well conclude that he was the Chriſtian Religion; for by his publique Edict, the publique profeſſion of it was eſtabliſhed in all his Dominions. The Chriſtians of thoſe days then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as I have often thought, an anſwer to thoſe Prayers which their fore-Fathers in Chriſtianity no doubt poured forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, according to that injunction and direction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. that they ſhould pray for Kings and all that be in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they might lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54580:28"/>
life in all Godlineſs and Honoſty; which was much about 300. years before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was born, at leaſt before he ſate in the Throne. Let <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf be conſulted (I could eaſily quote the place if I had the book by me) and from him we may learn, that as the Chriſtian Religion, ſo the Chriſtian Sabbath was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the firſt day long before <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> Cradle was made; and not only ſo, but before there was a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the world it was ſo: and yet, as 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to me, by divine Authority, or elſe there was none in the world at all; for in the new world, that is, in the ſtate of the Goſpel Church, old things were paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, old Sacrifices, old Covenant, old Sacrament, the Seals of the Covenant, this none denies; even ſo likewiſe the old Sabbath: for the proof of this, let that Scripture, beſides others that might be mentioned, be duly conſidered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. The Apoſtle there reckoneth up ſeveral ſorts of the Jewiſh Feſtivals, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the obſervation of them in all Chriſtian Churches (for upon the ſame account he condemns them in one Church, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them in all) This will appear to be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54580:28"/>
ſo, if we conſider the Apoſtles ſcope in that, and in his Epiſtles to ſome other of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But to mention one is enough for all, it was to oppoſe ſuch of the Circumciſion as thoſe mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, 2. that mingled together the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, and that in the matter of Juſtification, and in order to Salvation; with this error, which was then a growing error, it is evident the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> was infected, upon this account it might well be that he was Articled againſt, for teaching every where to forſake the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and againſt the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.28. as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf no doubt knew that it was formerly an Article againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> that he ſpake blaſphemous words againſt the Law, and that he ſhould affirm that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould deſtroy the Temple, and change the Cuſtoms that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered them, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected that the Apoſtle there condemns their yearly Sabbaths, the Sabbath of the ſeventh year, the Sabbath of the fiftieth year, the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> and not the weekly Sabbath.</p>
            <p>By way of Anſwer, I deſire that the words of the Apoſtle may be duely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54580:29"/>
               <hi>Ye obſerve Days, and Months, and Times, and Years, I am afraid of you, leſt I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on you my labour in vain.</hi> By Years, we underſtand their yearly Sabbath, called the Sabbath of <hi>Attonement,</hi> and their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical years as above mentioned; by Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, their <hi>Annual Feaſts,</hi> of the Paſſover, Penticoſt, and Tabernacles; and by Months, their Monthly Feaſts called their <hi>New Moons,</hi> all this is clear; now I confeſs I cannot ſee what can poſſibly be meant by Days, but their weekly Sabbath days, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally finding in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. where all their Feaſts and Holy days, eight in number, are reckoned up; their weekly Sabbath is put in the firſt place, as it were, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
            <p>I fore-ſee two things may be objected againſt this interpretation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Firſt, it may be ſaid, the Sabbath of the ſeventh day cannot be here mentioned, for then <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould condemn his own Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is eaſily Anſwered, for though we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. that on the Sabbath day, that is I grant on the ſeventh day Sabbath, he went out of the City and preached to women, that reſorted thither to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54580:29"/>
their publique worſhip: and <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. that he preached in the Synagogue of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> three Sabbath days together, yet this was not as obſerving the ſeventh day Sabbath, but for the opportunity of the Jews aſſembling together on that day, which he could not have upon the firſt day; and ſo for a while condeſcending to their weakneſs, ſome other of the Jewiſh Rites, as may be inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Circumciſion, were born with. To conclude from hence that he did this as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſeventh day Sabbath as they did, it may be well concluded that he did, and therefore we muſt obſerve the Feaſt Penticoſt, becauſe he went up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> at that Feaſt, as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.21. which we may be ſure he did not for the Feaſts ſake, but for the Aſſemblies ſake, that he might have the greater opportunity to Preach the Goſpel unto them.</p>
            <p>But now if we would know what day of the week it was which he obſerved in obedience to the fourth Commandment, look into his practice among the Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jews and Gentiles, and there we ſhall find that he obſerved the firſt day for the Sabbath day, and paſſed by the ſeventh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54580:30"/>
day, as will be ſeen by and by, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> It's objected by ſome, and thoſe great and learned perſons, that this Interpretation overthrows the Morality of the firſt day of the week, as well as the laſt day of the week, and for that end they thus interpret this place, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urge it: But nothing they alledge from hence, I do acknowledge, could ever make any impreſſion upon me, and my reaſon is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Look what thoſe and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that were ſo zealous for the Law, ſought to impoſe upon the Chriſtian Churches, that and that only the Apoſtle oppoſeth: Now it ſeems to me beyond all queſtion, that they never ſought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the firſt day Sabbath, and therefore that ſtands, and will ſtand unſhaken, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Interpretation of the Text; and the Interpretation ſtanding firm, notwithſtanding theſe Objections, it ſeems yet clear to me, that Chriſtians are under no obligation at all to the old Sabbath, it is dead having ſerved its time,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Now I know it will be asked,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54580:30"/>
if this be ſo, where have we any expreſs inſtitution either for the firſt day, or for any other day? Muſt we not then, if a word of inſtitution cannot be produced, obſerve, as ſome ſay, every day for a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or take that day thoſe in Authority do appoint, be it one of 10, or one of 20, or have no Sabbath at all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Neither ſo, nor ſo, every day is not the Sabbath day, any more than every Supper is the Lords Supper, or every Table the Lords Table: Neither may we admit of one day of 10, or 20, for that is againſt the Morality of the fourth Commandment, which requires not onely the obſervation of a Sabbath, but one day of ſeven for a Sabbath.</p>
            <p>And that we have ſufficient ground (which I confeſs can be no leſs than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority) for the firſt day of ſeven, I now come to give you my reaſons why I ſo believe.</p>
            <p>Only let me have leave firſt to ask, where is there an expreſs word of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the laſt of ſeven?</p>
            <p>In the fourth Commandment there is none, that only requires the obſervation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54580:31"/>
of one of ſeven; all the inſtitution there is for it, is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, (though I acknowledg it ſufficient) but only imply'd in thoſe words, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it</hi>; and I hope there is as clear a word (though perhaps not altogether found in one place) which implies the inſtitution of the firſt day, as that which in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. doth of the ſeventh day.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to that, I deſire this may be obſerved; That there is the ſame reaſon for the inſtitution of the firſt of ſeven, that there was for the inſtitution of the laſt of ſeven. I ſaid before what I thought to be true, that the Lord bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day; not only becauſe he reſted on the ſeventh day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perfected the work of Creation; but alſo becauſe of the reſult and conſequence both of his reſt, and of his perfecting his work, namely, his honouring and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day above all other dayes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by now we know, that the memorial of thoſe ſignal works of providence wrought upon the day, hath been the occaſion of the advancing that day above other. So the Jewiſh Paſſover, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54580:31"/>
Feaſt of <hi>Purim, Eſt.</hi> 9.21, 23, and our 5th. of <hi>November,</hi> in memory of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that Treaſon plotted, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came to execution but the Traytors themſelves. Now this being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſo, hence then it may be argued, That what day ſoever above all other dayes, God honours with his moſt eminent work, is to be the day of holy Reſt unto God. This will clearly carry it, and greatly ſtrengthen, though but an implyed inſtitution for the firſt day: for that was the day of the Lords reſt from the moſt great, and the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all his works, the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I hear ſomething hath been alledged againſt this, that the firſt day of the week was not the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, and that the Tranſlators of the Bible have done us wrong in ſo rendring it: It is ſtrange to me if any ſhould ſay ſo, but I ſhall ſay nothing to it now, becauſe your Paper ſpeaks nothing of it; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you think fit to form the Argument from the error you ſuppoſe in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is as I underſtand one (and one that is well able to do it) prepared
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54580:32"/>
to juſtifie the Tranſlation, and hath done it, many moneths ago; to him I leave it, becauſe, as I ſaid, your Paper gives me no occaſion to ſay any thing of it. However this I muſt ſay, for the proof of what hath been ſaid, I cannot but aſſert this, that it is an Article of my Faith, that the Lord Jeſus roſe again the third day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21. and that as certain it is, that the firſt day of the week after his Paſſion week, is and was the third day after his Paſſion; the Lord of Life laid down his life, and was obedient unto death, the ſixth day of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going week, which with us is called <hi>Friday,</hi> lay in the Grave the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of that day, that night, and all the ſeventh day, (when the old Sabbath I think was buried with him) and then that night, and aroſe early) the next morning, which was the firſt day of the week after his Paſſion; ſo that his bleſſed body continued in the Grave two whole nights, one whole day, and ſome part of the two other dayes, the ſixth and the firſt of the week following, in all about thirty ſix
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54580:32"/>
hours: And this was accounted three dayes and three nights, according to the allowed Dialect of that Nation, as one of the moſt learned in the Jewiſh Antiquities I think this Nation afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by ſeveral inſtances makes good: And indeed there ſeems to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Scripture for it, <hi>Eſthers</hi> Faſt was for three days, and three nights, yet on the third day after her Feaſt began, ſhe preſents her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and invites him to a Banquet, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 5.1. This then is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Reſurrection of Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any thing that I think can be ſaid againſt the Tranſlation, was upon the firſt day of the week; beſides what hath been ſaid already, the Scripture is expreſs for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.13. <hi>The ſame day,</hi> i. e. the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>the two diſciples were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to Emaus,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. they ſay <hi>this day was the third day:</hi> thus the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt being upon the firſt day of the week, (though to ſpeak properly it was not ſo much the ground, as the occaſion of the choice of the day, becauſe then it was manifeſted,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54580:33"/>
that the price of our Redemption was both paid and accepted) the day of Chriſts Paſſion could not give the like occaſion, becauſe though the price was paid, the Surety was not diſcharged, the Grave was a part of his humiliation, he was not raiſed from all the ſorrows of death, till he was raiſed from the Grave, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24.</p>
            <p>And as the day of Chriſts Paſſion, could not for this cauſe give this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the change of the day, ſo neither could the day of his Aſcenſion. On that day indeed he entred into the place of Reſt, to ſit down on the right hand of the Father, but it was on the day of his Reſurrection that he entred into the ſtate of Reſt; and this day, as I ſaid, on the firſt day of the week, gives as fair and ſtrong a ground, for fixing of the day of holy Reſt, on the firſt day of ſeven, as Gods reſting from the work of the Creation did, for fixing it at firſt upon the laſt of ſeven.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, by this means we blot out the memory of the Creation, which ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:54580:33"/>Is is true, it ought not to be done, that marvelous great work comes within the compaſs of that Text, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 111.4. which ought to be had in remembrance, and the ſerious conſideration of it, is a great relief in difficult caſes: for what cannot he do that made Heaven and Earth of nothing? Thus they reaſon their hearts into a believing frame, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 124. <hi>ult.</hi> that their hope, and their help, did ſtand in the name of the Lord that made Heaven and Earth: we ought therefore, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, to magnifie God in his works which men behold. <hi>Joh.</hi> 36.24, 25. Only the work of Redemption ought more eſpecially to be remembred, as the more glorious, and indeed the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work: as therefore the work of Creation ought not to be forgotten, ſo the change of the day gives no cauſe for it; for as the firſt day of ſeven preſerveth the memory of our Redemption, ſo one of ſeven preſerveth the memory of our Creation, only preeminence is given to the work of our Redemption. But it will ſtill be enquired where is the word of Inſtitution?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54580:34"/>I Anſwer, 'tis acknowledged, that as I ſaid before, I find no expreſs word for the Inſtitution of the laſt day of ſeven, ſo we have no expreſs word in ſo many letters, and words or ſyllables for the Inſtitution of the firſt day of ſeven; but we have ſeveral particulars, which, not taken apart, but laid altogether, will clearly, and I think, undeniably imply it; and which was obſerved in the fourth Propoſition, which way ſoever God ſpeaks his minde to us, we ought not to deſpiſe him that ſpeaks from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now among all theſe particulars, I deſire theſe may be, in all ſobriety and ſeriouſneſs, taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, which I think none will deny; that Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, had power to change the day: I do not, I dare not ſay that he hah power to change the moral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Commandment, for it was not in his Commiſſion; <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it</hi>; not to change the day from one of ſeven,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54580:34"/>
but that he had power to change from one day of ſeven, to another day: that Text which you quote three ſeveral times, ſufficiently proves it; <hi>He is Lord of the Sabbath, (i. e.)</hi> of the day, and might do with his own what he pleaſeth, even as he was Lord of the Vineyard, and might let it out to what Husbandmen he pleaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. and that which we read, <hi>John</hi> 5. carries a probable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that even then he began to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he had a purpoſe to change the day, for there we read, that having healed the poor diſeaſed man who had been bedrid for thirty eight years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he bids him take up his bed and walk; but why did he ſo? this was expreſly againſt the letter of the Law; there was no neceſſity of it for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of the Miracle, that might have been done by his leaping, and walking; and the like was, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 14. he might have gone home, and come again for his bed the next day; Why then might it not be to ſhew that he had power and authority over that day, equal to what he had over the deſeaſe. To this purpoſe it is worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54580:35"/>
that all along in that chapter, he juſtifies his Acts againſt the cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Jews, by aſſerting his power, as may be ſeen <hi>verſe</hi> 17. to the end of <hi>verſe</hi> 22. As it appears by this, that he had power to change the day, what if it ſhould be ſaid, that he did according to his power actually change the day, though when, and how, it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. Let the fifth Propoſition be conſulted for this; there it appears, that there was word for inſtitution of Sacrifice, before <hi>Abel</hi> Sacrificed, (though it be not recorded when) becauſe God accepted his Sacrifice. So he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Service upon the firſt day of the week, the firſt of ſeven, and bleſſed it as eminently he did the laſt of ſeven, as I ſhall ſhew when I come to ſpeak of your Reaſons. Why then might he not inſtitute this day, though it be not expreſs'd when, or where? What can be ſaid againſt it, but that he might do in the one as in the other? Though it be not recorded, why may it not be thought to be one of thoſe things which he had to ſay unto his Diſciples, and without he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54580:35"/>
did ſay to them afterwards, becauſe they were not then able to bear them, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. Surely the change of the Sabbath, which they with the whole body of that Nation, had ſuch an high eſteem of, would hardly then have been received by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, To me it ſeems very evident, that the day was changed either by Chriſt own immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or by his Apoſtles as they were guided, and directed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit which they received, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. and what they did teach, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as thus guided, and directed, ought to be received and believed, as if it had been immediatly done by Chriſt himſelf, as was proved in the ſixth Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, and that the change of the day was thus appointed, either by Chriſt immediatly, or by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as guided by the ſpirit of truth, theſe following particulars ſeem to me undeniably to prove it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:54580:36"/>1. Firſt, by the Apoſtles practice let that be ſeriouſly conſidered, as it is recorded in ſeveral places. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. it is there ſaid, that when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Troas,</hi> where he abode ſeven dayes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt day of the week, which is infallibly proved to be the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, <hi>Paul</hi> Preached. I deſire this Text may be conſidered in the fear of God. It was ſome grief to me to think how ſlightly, as I heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few days, ſome turn it off: for if it be, as it ought to be, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered of, it will appear to have much weight in it, for it is clear in the Text, that <hi>Paul</hi> continued there ſeven days, and therefore was there on the ſeventh day Sabbath; yet there is no mention that either he, or the Church took any notice of it, more than of any other of the ſix dayes, but upon the firſt day, the work of the Sabbath was carried on, <hi>Paul</hi> both Preaching, and Adminiſtring the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54580:36"/>
Lords Supper. If this had been done upon the ſeventh day, and that he had begun his Journey upon the firſt day, it had made very much for the eſtabliſhing of the old Sabbath; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now it makes much for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the new, and Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; if there had been but one ſuch expreſs Inſtance of <hi>Pauls</hi> Baptizing but one Infant in any of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, I think it would have prevailed much with thoſe that are humble, conſcientious, and godly (as I believe many are, that ſcruple much the Adminiſtration of that Ordinance to any that are not able to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith) if I ſay there had been but one ſuch Inſtance, ſo plain and evident, in the Scripture; it would probably have prevailed much with them, though there are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſufficient in the Scripture for it, yet they are not ſo plain to them: they would (it may charitably be ſuppoſed) have yielded that ſuch an Apoſtle, would not have done this without Warrant, unleſs he had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54580:37"/>
known the mind of Chriſt for it, yet you ſee we have it for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath, and ſhall this ſignifie nothing? Surely what ever it doth with others, it ſignifies much with me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, it is farther obſerved, that the one hundred and twenty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and it may be ſome more with them, met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſtinctly from the Jews, and did not keep the Feaſt of Pentecoſt with them, but together by themſelves; and this they did with one accord, as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. and this upon the firſt day of the week, as may be undeniably demonſtrated: The Lord Jeſus was buried on the evening of the ſixth day, that day being the firſt in the Paſſion week, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Chriſt reſted in the grave, this was the ſecond day in the Paſſion week in which the firſt fruit Sheaf of was waved before the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.11. and from this day they began to count their ſeven weeks to Pentecoſt as in the ſame Chapter verſ.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54580:37"/>
15, 16. (and which ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this day <hi>Chriſt roſe again from the dead, and becomes the firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counted ſeven times, the fiftieth day is juſt the firſt day of the week. So that it is clear, it was the firſt day of the week when the the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thus met together, to obſerve it in the duties of the day, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt they knew to be the mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Diſciples met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether twice on the two firſt dayes of the two firſt weeks, immediately after Chriſts Reſurrection; if it be granted, that the firſt time they did not underſtand, the change of the day, but ſhut the doors for fear of the Jews, becauſe of the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souldiers againſt them, that they had taken away the body of Jeſus, what can be ſaid againſt it, all things conſidered, but that they knew the change of the day at their ſecond meeting? and that then they ſhut the doors for fear of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54580:38"/>
Jews, becauſe they did not obſerve the old Sabbath, the ſame that the Jews did, and as they themſelves former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had done. Thus much of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practice: Now it cannot be ſhewed, that ever they gave any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſeventh day Sabbath, as the day of holy reſt unto the Lord, after Chriſts Reſurrection; that of their Preaching ſometimes on that day, was upon another account, as hath been proved already. Neither doth it appear that any other did, by what we find in the Scripture. Its true, thoſe holy women mentioned in the Evangeliſts, obſerved it to the laſt, even to the day before Chriſts Reſurrection, and it was their duty Chriſt being not riſen. And for the Apoſtles, it is evident they ſhewed all reſpects after the Reſurrection, to the firſt of ſeven, none to the laſt of ſeven: And further, it is not nothing what is recorded of the Lord Jeſus himſelf, that he appeared ſo often unto his Diſciples on that day: For though I lay not ſo much ſtreſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54580:38"/>
upon it, as I have heard others have done, (for it is very profitable, that during theſe forty days, he appeared unto them upon other dayes as well as upon the firſt day) but this I ſay is not nothing, that there is no day mentioned by name, but the firſt day; if it had been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that he had appeared unto them but once upon the ſeventh day, I cannot but think it would have been much inſiſted upon. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now done with this, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Apoſtles practice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Their expreſſions; and that which I ſhall here take ſpecial notice of, is that in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10. where <hi>John</hi> gives this account of himſelf, that he was in the Spirit on the Lords day. This I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe was the firſt day of the week, and pointeth at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it by Chriſt himſelf; and my reaſon is this, Scripture is to be interpreted by Scripture, even about the nature and meaning of a Phraſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54580:39"/>
unleſs there be ſomething in the Text where it is uſed, why it ſhould not be taken in that Text as in others: This is generally acknowledged to be a good and ſafe rule for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of difficult places; why then may not this Phraſe prove it was the day inſtituted by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, as being parallel with that of the Lords Supper, which was inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf? The holy Spirit of God directed both <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> in their expreſſions, neither of which is uſed but once a piece, and never applyed to any thing elſe in the New Teſtament, but to the Lords Supper, and to the Lords day; why ſhould theſe Ordinances be held forth under the ſame expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, if theſe had not the ſame inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution?</p>
            <p>It would ſeem ſtrange to me, if any ſhould ſay, that the Lords Paſſover in the Old Teſtament, (though a Supper Ordinance) was the Lords Supper in the New Teſtament; and it ſeems ſomewhat
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54580:39"/>
ſtrange, if the ſeventh day Sabbath, which was indeed the Sabbath of the Lord under the Old Teſtament, ſhould be aſſerted to be the Lords day in the New Teſtament, without ſome further proof than to ſay it is ſo: I could produce Teſtimonies from Antiquity, of ſome that lived near, and of one that lived ſome conſiderable time with <hi>John</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who have interpreted the Lords day mentioned in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, to be the firſt day; but becauſe you quote no ſuch Teſtimonies, neither will I. I have been careful to obſerve your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to proceed in this order only in a Scriptural way: Thus much of the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>From their practice and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I come to the practice of the Primitive Churches, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture; as that of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. and that of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> formerly mentioned, who had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54580:40"/>
their weekly ſolemn Aſſemblies on the firſt day; I forbear to ſay any thing in juſtification of our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe as I ſaid before, you touch upon no ſuch thing in your Paper, deſiring to be dealt withall in a Scriptural, not in a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way, only I cannot but add this, becauſe I conceive it is according to Scripture, that it cannot with any reaſon be imagined, that theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would have made ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant change of the day for their ſolemn Aſſemblies, from what was formerly uſed by Gods appointment among the Jews, without conſulting with ſome at leaſt of the Apoſtles, and moſt likely with <hi>Paul,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſt acquainted with him. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think can there be produced any inſtance that particular Churches ever did determine any thing of this nature, by their own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without conſulting, I ſay, with ſome of the Apoſtles; conſidering how in other matters, not altogether of ſo great a concernment, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54580:40"/>
conſulted with <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and as hardly can it be imagined that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would ever give them any ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, unleſs they had known the mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you, in as few words as the matter would permit, a true account of the Reaſons of my diſſent from you, in the ſenſe that you give of the fourth Commandment, and of what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath and ſtill doth ſatisfie my Conſcience, that the day is changed, and that by divine Authority and that without any prejudice to the Authority of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That which I have yet to do, is to give you my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Reaſons, produced for the confirming your Propoſition, which may be done with a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to what hath ſaid done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, You ſay thoſe weighty reaſons which Jehovah the Saviour himſelf hath given, to enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54580:41"/>
unto his Commandment, in obſerving a weekly Sabbath day holy to himſelf, do properly belong and are applicable to the ſeventh day, which is the laſt day in every week in order of time, in the weekly returns of it, as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath day, and are applicable to no other day; and theſe you ſay are three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, You ſay, God reſted only upon the ſeventh day, which is the laſt day in every week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Thus far it is true, that God reſted on the ſeventh day, the laſt day from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Creation; but it ſeems to me rather as a reaſon of that limitation, ſix dayes of ſeven being allowed for labour, one of which ſeven was a day for holy reſt, and not an argument engaging to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the laſt of ſeven, for the weekly Sabbath to the end of the world: The reaſons that prevail with me ſo to judge, I have given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54580:41"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, your ſecond and third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I joyn them together, <hi>he bleſt and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the ſeventh day,</hi> becauſe you bring one and the ſame proof for both, and beſides they are to be looked upon in conjunction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>he ſanctified the ſeventh day, by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it from common uſe, to be the day for his ſolemn Worſhip, and he bleſſed it, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to be a day of bleſſing to the right obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it,</hi> In what ſenſe I underſtand this, I have given you an account before.</p>
            <p>It is true, when this Law was firſt given to <hi>Adam,</hi> being then in the ſtate of innocency (ſo you acknowledge it was, and therein I aſſent and conſent with you) the bleſſing was applicable to no other day, but the laſt of ſeven; becauſe man continuing in that bleſſed ſtate, there was not, there could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a more eminent work than the Creation of the World; but now man being fallen, the work of Redemption being every way more glorious than the work of Creation, the bleſſing is applicable to the firſt day, the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, for then the work of Redemption was manifeſted to be fully perfected, and God bleſſed for evermore hath bleſſed that as eminently as ever he did the former day, not to mention that which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54580:42"/>
is and hath been done among the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire you to look back to the ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and I think it is there made evident, that the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was on the firſt day, and then the Diſciples being together, the Holy Ghoſt was given to the Diſciples, then they received thoſe miraculous gifts, and began <hi>to ſpeak with Tongues,</hi> which they never underſtood before, and <hi>that day three thouſand ſouls were added to the Church,</hi> by the effectual working of the Spirit of God with the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles; and theſe Sermons they Preached, that are upon record, after Chriſts Aſcenſion: Was not then this day a day of bleſſing? was there ever a more eminent bleſſing, or any like unto it on the old Sabboth, the laſt of ſeven? Whatever impreſſion this makes upon the hearts of others I know not, for my own part I muſt needs ſay, I cannot but look upon it as very worthy of ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, beſides thoſe Reaſons in the Commandment you add further: 1. <hi>The name and thing of a weekly Sabboth is given only to the ſeventh day:</hi> 2. <hi>That no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to the Obſervers of any other day, no threatning denounced againſt any that ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54580:42"/>
not obſerve any other day in the week, as a weekly Sabboth day, but only the ſeventh, which is the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To all theſe I anſwer from what hath been already ſaid:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, as for the name and thing, this is that which I obſerve at firſt, and by this I am further confirmed in it, that you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the laſt day of ſeven and the weekly Sabboth, <hi>i. e. the day that is to be obſerved as a day of holy reſt unto the Lord,</hi> are Terms convertible; which to me is not yet proved, though I have conſidered your Paper from end to end, and I have given you my reaſons why I yet believe, and muſt needs believe (till I ſee them anſwered) that another is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the room thereof, and that by Divine Authority; ſo that though once they were, yet now they ſeem to me to be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Terms convertible.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, as to that which you ſay, <hi>that there is no command for any other day,</hi> I have already given you my ſenſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that no day is inſtituted there, firſt or laſt, or ſo much as the obſervation of the ſeventh directly enjoyned there, but only by conſequence, becauſe formerly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; ſo that both the Commandment and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54580:43"/>
the reaſons of the Commandment reach the firſt of ſeven, as well as the laſt of ſeven: ſee before.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Thirdly, you ſay <hi>there is no promiſe to the obſervation of any day, nor threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the not obſerving of any day as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabboth, but only the laſt of ſeven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer firſt, to ſpeak properly (as I obſerve you do ſo) the promiſe is not made to the day, but to the right obſervers of it, in the duties that God appoints. Now the duties falling upon the firſt day of the week, as I have given you the reaſons of my Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in already, the bleſſings annexed to the laſt of ſeven fall upon the firſt of ſeven, and have been given forth eminently upon the firſt of ſeven, as I have ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, I anſwer farther, that as I find no bleſſing promiſed to the right uſe of the Seals of the Covenant under the old Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, but what were then applied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the right uſe of Circumciſion, and the Paſsover, nor any thing againſt any Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or contemners of any Seals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but thoſe that contemned Circumciſion, and the Paſſover; yet I am perſwaded that you believe the Promiſes, I mean eſpecially the Spiritual promiſes annexed to the old
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54580:43"/>
Seals, the right obſervers of the new Seals, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, may in faith apply to themſelves. And the threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contemners of the old Seals, thoſe that contemn or profane the new Seals, have juſt cauſe to fear may fall upon them: even ſo the promiſe made to the old Sabboth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and the threatnings againſt the tranſgreſſors of it, are applicable to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and the obſervers of the new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both the firſt of ſeven; <hi>whatever is written, is written for our learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> I now proceed to the third reaſon, which is this, <hi>that God hath put this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment for the laſt of ſeven into nature</hi>; which if you had explained, as it ſeems you underſtand it, and that the Scriptures quoted had clearly proved it, I think I ſhould have been ſilent, and with a little more help I think ſhould have cloſed with you upon the whole in this matter. But I muſt crave leave to ſay, that to me your expreſſions are ſomewhat dark, and your proofs exceeding ſhort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that your way of expreſſing your ſelf is ſomewhat dark: for you ſay, <hi>God hath put this into nature,</hi> but you do not expreſs what I do not clearly underſtand, whether you mean that is moral natural in the fourth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54580:44"/>
Commandment, or which is moral poſitive.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, your proofs, eſpecially from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. <hi>John</hi> 1.9. ſeem to be intended for that which is moral natural, and there are ſome other Scriptures which to me have not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (pardon me if I ſay ſo) to be any thing at all to the purpoſe: And that there is one expreſſion in your further inlarging upon this reaſon, which ſeems to be for that which is moral poſitive. For thus you ſay, <hi>that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon will tell me, that ſeeing all men in all Nations do meaſure their time by weeks, and their weeks by ſeven days, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what they offer to God every day in every week, ſet apart a day unto their Maker, who hath allowed ſuch a liberal portion unto them for themſelves</hi>: herein you will find, that I do both aſſent and conſent unto you, when I have a little explained what I apprehend to be the difference between moral natural, and moral poſitive Laws.</p>
            <p n="1">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt moral natural Laws, I conceive to be theſe which the light of Nature, conſiſting in the knowledge of principles, and the law of Nature, in concluſions drawn from that light, acknowledgeth to be juſt and good, though they had never been written in the word. As
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54580:44"/>
               <hi>that there is a God,</hi> and <hi>that this God is to be worſhipped as God.</hi> Thus much your proofs, eſpecially that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. clearly prove, thus far the fourth Commandment is moral natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The law and light of nature will teach men, <hi>that there muſt be a time for the ſolemn worſhip of God, a time of reſt from all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, a ſet time that muſt return according to ſome computation of time, either weeks, or months, or years.</hi> Let it be granted for <hi>weeks</hi> (though I would gladly ſee ſome farther proof for that, than yet I have ſeen,) this the nature of man even now corrupted, either doth acknowledge, or at leaſt may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of, by arguments drawn from theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are in the hearts of all men, when he is rationally urged with ſuch principles as theſe, as <hi>that all thoſe things that are good, ought to be followed,</hi> and <hi>thoſe things wch</hi> 
               <hi>are evil ought to be avoided</hi>; I mean ſuch things, the goodneſs or evil whereof ariſeth meerly from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things themſelves, and may be acknowledged to be ſo, though the one had never been comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor the other had never been forbidden in the word. This is clear from that place you quote, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the place, and I believe herein you will both aſſent and conſent, that the Apoſtle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54580:45"/>
ſpeaks of ſuch things as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without any revelation of the mind of God in his Word, had the knowledge of by the light of Nature, which they could never have of the laſt of ſeven for the weekly Sabboth, as will appear by and by.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Secondly, Laws which are only poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I conceive to be ſuch, as the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could never have judged either good or neceſſary, if they had not ſome way or other been revealed to be the will of God; the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them ariſeth only from the will of God enjoyning them, who having abſolute authority over all, may, and doth diſpoſe of them into what condition he pleaſeth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth upon them what Laws ſeem good in his ſight; ſo that if they never had been enjoyned, the omiſſion of them had been ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin, that if any ſingle perſon ſhould have impoſed them upon himſelf, or any number of men had impoſed them upon others, as any part of Spiritual homage and worſhip which is due to God, it had been rejected as Will-worſhip. Of this nature was the law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> of <hi>not eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil</hi>; there was no evil in the fruit of the Tree, it was the creature of God, and all that he made <hi>was very good</hi>; it was only
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54580:45"/>
evil, becauſe forbidden, ſuch were the laws for ſacrifice, burnt-offerings, and peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, all the goodneſs that was in them was only from the will of God appointing them; the light of Nature could never have ſeen the good of them, nor the law of Nature ingaged a man to the obſervation of them, if the will of God had not one way or other been revealed concerning them. The human nature in <hi>Adam</hi> was created righteous, but if the revelation of the Will of God had not been ſuperadded to that knowledge wherein he was created, he could never have known but that he might as lawfully have eaten of that Tree, as of any other. It is true, when the will of God was revealed to him, he had that written in his heart, by which he ſaw obedience to that Law to be both juſt and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Of this nature I conceive was the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt day of ſeven, for the day of holy reſt <hi>to be obſerved unto the Lord.</hi> In the firſt propoſition I ſhewed there is no goodneſs in one day more than another materially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, none in the laſt of ſeven, none in the firſt of ſeven; therefore neither of theſe were written in Nature: only this is written in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when the will of God is revealed concerning any ſuch poſitive law, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54580:46"/>
either the laſt of ſeven, or the firſt of ſeven, to be obſerved, even Nature as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted cannot deny but that it is both juſt and neceſſary to yield obedience thereunto. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, corrupted Nature cannot deny, but that the will of the Soverain Lawgiver ought to be the rule of the Creature, and indeed I am apt to think this is all you intended to prove, and if no more, then I do declare herein both my aſſent and conſent: But then this is far ſhort of what the reaſon is brought to prove, namely that which is in the fourth Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that the laſt day of every week, in the weekly returns of it, is alone the particular day in every week, which is the weekly Sabboth day to be kept holy to</hi> Jehovah, <hi>in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as ſuch.</hi>

            <p>Let it be granted, which yet I confeſs I am not fully ſatisfied in, that the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without any revelation might have fixed upon one of ſeven, yet if God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his Will therein, it could never have fixed upon the laſt of ſeven; I think it would rather have fixed upon the firſt of ſeven for the reaſon alledged <hi>pag.</hi> 34. Surely, Sir, if the law for the laſt of ſeven had been written in the heart of man, we might hope to have found it fairly written in the renewed and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54580:46"/>
ſanctified heart of the people of the Lords choice. But this the experience of all ages contradicteth If any ſhould ſpeak to me in the language of <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> 5. <hi>Call now if there be any that will anſwer thee</hi>; and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn thee and ask them, <hi>Did you ever find this Law for the laſt of ſeven to be written in your heart?</hi> They would for the generality of them tell me, <hi>No, they never found any ſuch matter.</hi> This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would be the anſwer, or much to this purpoſe, even of thoſe that were moſt holy and learned, moſt dead to the world, and moſt alive to God, yea of the moſt faithful Martyrs of Chriſt for theſe ſixteen hundred years, that with a good Conſcience they could have done, as no doubt they did as there was occaſion, any work of their Calling upon the laſt of ſeven, which upon the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth days was lawful and fit to be done, and that they never found any thing written in their hearts giving any check thereunto.</p>
            <p>Either then the holy Law of God was not written in their hearts, which muſt not be admitted, or this Law for the laſt of ſeven was not written there as the reſt were; which I really believe, and therefore give my diſſent to this Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54580:47"/>4<hi>thly.</hi> Fourthly, there is yet one reaſon more muſt have ſomething ſpoken to it, and that is <hi>the example of the Lord Jeſus</hi>; and to this I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt that his example is propoſed to us for imitation, as thoſe many Scriptures you quote do ſuficiently prove, and herein I aſſent and conſent with you; for though I dare not ſay with the <hi>Socinians, that the grand end of Chriſts life and death was for example to be imitated,</hi> (curſed be that opinion which preſſeth the <hi>Imitation</hi> of Chriſt to overthrow the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt) yet this I ſay with you, <hi>that for our example he is propoſed,</hi> but yet with limitation, as not in his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and meritorious work, ſo not in every occaſional work, as his ſpending a whole night in prayer, nor in adminiſtring the Lords Supper at night; yet even in this, though we are under no obligation always to do ſo, yet when a juſt occaſion ſerves, it is lawful for us at leaſt to do ſo. But that wherein his example is obligatory, is to imitate him in the exerciſe of thoſe Graces, and practice of thoſe Duties which belong to all Chriſtians, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. and ſuch like. In all theſe, as he is by his Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us the <hi>principle</hi> of holineſs, ſo in his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54580:47"/>
example he is our <hi>pattern</hi>; and indeed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chriſtianity may be ſaid, eſpecially to conſiſt in walking as he hath walked, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that you quote in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. But now as to this particular for which you urge it, concerning the obſervation of the laſt day of ſeven,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, it is granted, that notwithſtanding all the <hi>Jews</hi> Cavils againſt him for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againſt the Law, yet he perfectly (though not in their ſenſe, as in all things elſe) fulfilled the righteouſneſs thereof: I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only that one Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, but this was during his ſtate of Humiliation, being made under the Law, but (as I have ſaid before) after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I do not find that ever he took any notice of it, or ſhewed the leaſt reſpect unto it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe forty days between his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſcention, though he both owned and honoured during that time the firſt day of the week.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the holy Apoſtles never imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his example therein: I mean not after his reſurrection: For though as I ſaid whilſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were any thing tractable, <hi>Paul</hi> eſpecially took the advantage of the 7<hi>th</hi> day Sabboth to preach unto them, but with both converted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54580:48"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> he obſerved the firſt day of the week, as hath been ſhewed. So that for ought I find in your Paper, I conceive we are no more bound to imitate him therein, than in being Circumciſed, or in deferring being baptized till we begin to be thirty years old, having no more Law for the one than for the other, and where <hi>there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
