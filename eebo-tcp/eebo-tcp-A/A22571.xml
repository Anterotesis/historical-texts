            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sithence which, a great number of his Maiesties louing subiects haue repaired to some Lords, and others of his Maiesties Priuie Councell, being his Maiesties Commissioners appointed to treat with them, and haue humbly desired Letters Patents of Licence to sell Tobacco by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, whereunto his Maiesties said Commissioners haue consented: but because it is both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and necessary that the number of those that be Licensed to sell Tobacco by Retaile, and also their names be knowne, that in time conuenient notice may be taken from them how much Tobacco in each yeere they Retaile and Uent: that vpon knowledge thereof, his Maiesty for preuenting of the issuing out of the Realme too great a proportion of the Stocke of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may giue order for the quantity of Tobacco that shall be yeerely brought in: And being resolued that any who from henceforth shall presume to vtter or sell Tobacco, not being Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, shall seuerely be proceeded against: For these and for other causes, the King our Soueraigne Lord straightly defendeth and commandeth, that neither such as by pretext of being formerly nominated as meet men to Retaile Tobacco, nor any other from henceforth presume to sell or vtter Tobacco by Retaile, vntill they shall haue obtained his Maiesties Licence in that behalfe, any permission or tolleration that may be pretended by the said Proclamation, or any other sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification notwithstanding, vpon such paines of censure in the Court of Star-Chamber and elsewhere, as may be inflicted vpon contemners of his Maiesties commands publiquely proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Wherein his Maiestie is pleased, that a part of the Fines set vpon the Contemners of this Command, be conferred vpon those that giue notice of the Offenders, so as they may be brought to iudgement.</p>
