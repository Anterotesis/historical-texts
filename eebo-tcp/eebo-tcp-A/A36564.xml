            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>ALLthough no brandiſh't Cherubins are here,</l>
               <l>Yet Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> venture not too neare,</l>
               <l>Nor pluck forbidden fruit: if with intent</l>
               <l>To viſit Paradiſe be Innocent.</l>
               <l>Here's your <hi>[Nil ultra]</hi> elſe; in each of theſe</l>
               <l>Is both a Pillar and an <hi>Hercules.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If you not dread their looks, yet may you fear</l>
               <l>The many ſtrange Fatalities they bear.</l>
               <l>The Embleme of Mortality the <hi>Yew</hi>

               <l>Does likewiſe now the Armed Agent ſhew;</l>
               <l>And if unwary Mortals ſlight their Guard,</l>
               <l>They doubly make the Garden a Church-yard.</l>
               <l>In this Conjunction miſchiefe's never ſcant,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Saturnine</hi>'s become a <hi>Martiall</hi> Plant:</l>
               <l>Far off, in Heaven it ſelfe are theſe bad Stars;</l>
               <l>What here at hand, when <hi>Saturn</hi> clubs with <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Th' <hi>Heſperian</hi> Dragon, were it not a Fable,</l>
               <l>Then theſe our Porters is leſſe admirable.</l>
               <l>Their bloud is Poyſon; Peſtilent their Breath;</l>
               <l>And very ſhade the ſhadow is of Death.</l>
               <l>But ſince in <hi>England</hi> they can doe no harme</l>
               <l>Internall, they for outward miſchiefe Arme;</l>
               <l>Deſperate Poyſon in moſt Forein ground,</l>
               <l>Inſtead of Sickneſſe, here they mean to Wound.</l>
               <l>(As lately Rebells ſerv'd that Bleſſed Head,</l>
               <l>When Poyſon might not doe, they ſtruck Him dead)</l>
               <l>Who dares be ſafe? no Turk is Armed ſoe,</l>
               <l>When every member of them is a Bowe.</l>
               <l>Ev'n Arms are Arm'd; Bows chargd with Mace or Bill;</l>
               <l>So that at once with Sroke and Shot they Kill.</l>
               <l>And lop each limbe you cannot ſtrike them dead;</l>
               <l>Each limb will multiply like <hi>Hydra's</hi> head.</l>
               <l>Some Vegitables doe themſelves Protect</l>
               <l>With Prickles, Stings, or Stinks of ſame effect.</l>
               <l>Our Garden Genii, more generall,</l>
               <l>Do not defend themſelves alone, but all.</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Heroes</hi> hung their Weapons, ſo as theſe,</l>
               <l>For ſignall Victories on ſignall Trees:</l>
               <l>But, ſure of Conqueſt, theſe preſumptuous <hi>Sophys</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Doe antidate: are Victors both and Trophys.</l>

               <l>Valour and Wit at equall Honour fly,</l>
               <l>Yet Valour often, ſeldome Wit dwells high.</l>
               <l>As Wiſemen moſt are Cowards; ſo 'tis fit</l>
               <l>That Combatants have neither Feare nor Wit.</l>
