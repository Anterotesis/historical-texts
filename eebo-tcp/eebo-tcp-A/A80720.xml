         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>ALL Knowledge muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be of God, or of his
Creatures, that is, of Nature;
the firſt is called from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<hi>Divinity;</hi> the latter, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſophy,</hi> and is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the Contemplation of
the Immediate or Mediate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God, that is, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of his Creature Man. Of
this latter kind are all Arts for
the uſe of Humane Life, which
are thus again divided: Some
are purely Humane, or made by
Man alone, and as it were intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpun out of himſelf, without
<pb facs="tcp:170474:5"/>
relation to other Creatures, ſuch
are <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> to
improve his Natural Qualities
of Internal and External ſpeech;
as likewiſe <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks</hi>
(or <hi>Law</hi>) to fulfill and
exalt his Natural Inclination to
Society. Other are mixt, and are
Mans Creatures no otherwiſe
then by the Reſult which he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
by Conjunction and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Creatures of God.
Of theſe parts of Philoſophy
that which treats of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
(properly called <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>)
which is almoſt only to be
ſought out of his revealed will,
and therefore requires only the
diligent and pious ſtudy of that,
and of the beſt Interpreters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:170474:5"/>
it; and that part which I call
purely Humane, depending ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Memory and Wit, that is,
Reading and Invention, are both
excellently well provided for by
the Conſtitution of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.
But the other two Parts,
the Inquiſition into the Nature of
Gods Creatures, and the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them to Humane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes
(eſpecially the latter) ſeem to be
very ſlenderly provided for, or
rather almoſt totally neglected,
except onely ſome ſmall aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Phyſick, and the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.
And therefore the
Founders of our Colledges have
taken ample care to ſupply the
Students with multitude of
Books, and to appoint Tutors
<pb facs="tcp:170474:6"/>
and frequent Exerciſes, the one
to interpret, and the other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Reading, as alſo to
afford them ſufficient plenty and
leiſure for the opportunities of
their private ſtudy, that the
Beams which they receive by
Lecture may be doubled by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of their own Wit: But
towards the Obſervation and
Application, as I ſaid, of the
Creatures themſelves, they have
allowed no Inſtruments, Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
or Conveniences. Partly,
becauſe the neceſſary expence
thereof is much greater, then of
the other; and partly from that
idle and pernicious opinion
which had long poſſeſt the World,
that all things to be ſearcht in
<pb facs="tcp:170474:6"/>
Nature, had been already found
and diſcovered by the Ancients,
and that it were a folly to travel
about for that which others had
before brought home to us. And
the great Importer of all Truths
they took to be <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as if
(as <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſpeaks fooliſhly
of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceive nor be deceived, or
as if there had been not only no
Lies in him, but all Verities. O
true Philoſophers in one ſence!
and contented with a very Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle!
Not that I would diſparage
the admirable Wit, and worthy
labours of many of the Ancients,
much leſs of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the moſt
eminent among them; but it were
madneſs to imagine that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns
<pb facs="tcp:170474:7"/>
of men ſhould afford us
as much, and as wholeſome Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as the Fountains of Nature.
As we underſtand the manners
of men by converſation among
them, and not by reading Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
the ſame is our caſe in
the true Apprehenſion &amp; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Things. And no man
can hope to make himſelf as rich
by ſtealing out of others Truncks,
as he might by opening and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of new Mines. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that all are already exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
let him conſider that many
lazily thought ſo hundred years
ago, and yet nevertheleſs ſince
that time whole Regions of Art
have been diſcovered, which the
Ancients as little dreamt of as
<pb facs="tcp:170474:7"/>
they did of <hi>America.</hi> There
is yet many a <hi>Terra Incognita</hi>
behind to exerciſe our diligence,
and let us exerciſe it never ſo
much, we ſhall leave work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
too for our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>This therefore being laid
down as a certain Foundation,
that we muſt not content our
ſelves with that Inheritance of
Knowledge which is left us by
the labour and bounty of our
Anceſtors, but ſeek to improve
thoſe very grounds, and adde to
them new and greater Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
it remains to be conſidered
by what means we are moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to attain the ends of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And certainly the ſolitary and
<pb facs="tcp:170474:8"/>
unactive Contemplation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the moſt ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
living, in their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Studies, can never effect
it. Our Reaſoning Faculty as
well as Fancy, does but Dream,
when it is not guided by ſenſible
Objects. We ſhall compound
where Nature has divided, and
divide where Nature has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and create nothing but
either Deformed Monſters, or at
beſt pretty but impoſſible Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids.
'Tis like Painting by
Memory and Imagination which
can never produce a Picture to
the Life. Many Perſons of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
abilities (if they had
been wiſely managed and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
employed) have ſpent their
<pb facs="tcp:170474:8"/>
whole time and diligence in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentating
upon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
who could never go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
him, becauſe their deſign
was only to follow, not graſp, or
lay hold on, or ſo much as touch
Nature, becauſe they catcht only
at the ſhadow of her in their
own Brains. And therefore we
ſee that for above a thouſand
years together nothing almoſt
of Ornament or Advantage was
added to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of Humane
Society, except only Guns and
Printing, whereas ſince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of Men has ventured to
go abroad, out of Books and out
of Themſelves, and to work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Gods Creatures, inſtead of
Playing among their Own, every
<pb facs="tcp:170474:9"/>
age has abounded with excellent
Inventions, and every year per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might do ſo, if a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number of ſelect Perſons
were ſet apart, and well direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and plentifully provided for
the ſearch of them. But our
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities having been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in thoſe former times that I
complain of, it is no wonder if
they be defective in their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
as to this way of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was not then thought
on.</p>
            <p>For the ſupplying of which
Defect, it is humbly propoſed to
his Sacred Majeſty, his moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Parliament, and Privy
Council, and to all ſuch of his

the advancement of real and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

As likewiſe the Figures of all

8. A Chamber for all

the Chappel, Anatomy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Library and Hall.</p>
            <p>That the third Court be on
one ſide of theſe, very large,

            <p>That the ſecond encloſed

            <p>That there be likewiſe built

little rarity or curioſity upon

their trouble.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it is deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conſider the loſs which
Children make of their time
at moſt Schools, employing,
or rather caſting away ſix or
ſeven years in the learning of
words only, and that too very
imperfectly:</p>
            <p>That a Method be here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
for the infuſing
Knowledge and Language at
the ſame time into them; and
that this may be their Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip
in Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
This we conceive may
be done, by breeding them
up in Authors, or pieces of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170474:26"/>
Authors, who treat of ſome
parts of Nature, and who may
be underſtood with as much
eaſe and pleaſure, as thoſe
which are commonly taught;
Such are in Latine <hi>Varro, Cato,
Columella, Pliny,</hi> part of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
and of <hi>Seneca, Cicero de
Divinatione, de Naturâ Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and ſeveral ſcattered pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Virgil's Georgicks, Grotius,
Neneſianus, Manilius;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the truth is we want
good Poets (I mean we have
but few) who have purpoſely
treated of ſolid and learned,
that is, Natural Matters (the
moſt part indulging to the
weakneſs of the world, and
feeding it either with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170474:26"/>
of Love, or with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of gods and Heroes) we
conceive that one Book ought
to be compiled of all the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
little parcels among the
ancient Poets that might ſerve
for the advancement of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Science, and which would
make no ſmall or unuſeful or
unpleaſant Volumn. To this
we would have added the
Morals and Rhetoricks of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
and the Inſtitutions of
<hi>Quintilian;</hi> and for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moedians,
from whom almoſt
all that neceſſary part of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcourſe, and all the
moſt intimate proprieties of
the Language are drawn, we
conceive the Boys may be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170474:27"/>
made Maſters of them, as a
part of their Recreation and
not of their task, if once a
moneth, or at leaſt once in
two, they act one of <hi>Terences</hi>
Comoedies, and afterwards
(the moſt advanced) ſome of
<hi>Plautus</hi> his; and this is for
many reaſons one of the beſt
exerciſes they can be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and moſt innocent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
they can be allowed. As
for the Greek Authors, they
may ſtudy <hi>Nicander, Oppianus</hi>
(whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> does not
doubt to prefer above <hi>Homer</hi>
himſelf, and place next to his
adored <hi>Virgil) Ariſtotles</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Animals, and other parts,
<hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170474:27"/>
of Plants, and a Collection
made out of ſeveral both Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
and other Grecian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
For the Morals and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may ſuffice, or
<hi>Hermogenes</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi> be
added for the latter; with
the Hiſtory of Animals they
ſhould be ſhewed Anatomy as
a Divertiſement, and made to
know the Figures and Natures
of thoſe Creatures which are
not common among us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſing
them at the ſame time
of thoſe Errours which are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
admitted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many. The ſame Method
ſhould be uſed to make them
acquainted with all Plants; and
to this muſt be added a little of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170474:28"/>
the ancient and modern Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
the underſtanding of
the Globes, and the Principles
of Geometry and Aſtronomy.
They ſhould likewiſe uſe to
declaim in Latine and Engliſh,
as the Romans did in Greek
and Latine; and in all this
travel be rather led on by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
encouragement, and
emulation, then driven by
ſeverity, puniſhment, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Upon Feſtivals and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they ſhould exerciſe
themſelves in the Fields by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
leaping, fencing, muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and training after the
manner of Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
to prevent all dangers and all
diſorder, there ſhould always
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170474:28"/>
be two of the Scholars with
them to be as witneſſes and
directors of their actions; In
foul weather it would not be
amiſs for them to learn to
dance, that is, to learn juſt ſo
much (for all beyond is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
if not worſe) as may
give them a graceful comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their bodies.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Sundays,</hi> and all days
of Devotion, they are to be a
part of the Chaplains Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
            <p>That for all theſe ends the
Colledge ſo order it, as that
there may be ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
&amp; pleaſant Houſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
kept by religious, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and careful perſons, for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170474:29"/>
the lodging and boarding of
young Scholars, that they have
a conſtant eye over them to
ſee that they be bred up there
piouſly, cleanly, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of their parents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</p>
            <p>And that the Colledge,
when it ſhall pleaſe God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their own induſtry and

of Patrons; to enrich them ſo
far, as that it may come to

Who ſhall be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to imploy their whole
<pb facs="tcp:170474:31"/>
time, wit, learning, and
induſtry, to theſe four, the
moſt uſeful that can be
imagined, and to no other
Ends; firſt, to weigh, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and prove all things
of Nature delivered to us
by former ages, to detect,
explode, and ſtrike a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
through all falſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
with which the world
has been paid and cheated
ſo long, and (as I may
ſay) to ſet the mark of the
Colledge upon all true
<pb facs="tcp:170474:32"/>
Coins that they may paſs
hereafter without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tryal. Secondly, to
recover the loſt Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and, as it were,
Drown'd Lands of the
Ancients. Thirdly, to
improve all Arts which
we now have; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to diſcover others
which we yet have not.
And who ſhall beſides all
this (as a Benefit by the
by) give the beſt Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the world (purely
<pb facs="tcp:170474:32"/>
               <hi>gratis</hi>) to as many mens
Children as ſhall think fit

Neither does it
at all check or enterfere
with any parties in State

to be embraced
by all Differences in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and can hardly be
