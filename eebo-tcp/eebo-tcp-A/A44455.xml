            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Advertisement FROM THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHen I first committed these <hi>three Letters of Animadversions</hi> to the Press, I intended to write a Preface before them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Custom of the Age, wherein nothing almost is Printed without a Preface to the Reader, to
<pb facs="tcp:63313:3"/>
Apologize for the Work, or, it may be, for the unseasonable Publication of it, or to premise an account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for which it was written, or to inform him of the knowledge of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing useful, or necessary to facilitate the understanding of it, or to supply some defect or oversight in it, or (as it often happens in Books of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy) to answer <hi>some other Preface,</hi> or perhaps to consider some things in it, which could not be so properly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the body of the Book. But the Gentleman to whom the <hi>Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were written, having sent me a Copy of a Letter, which he wrote to the Authour about the Printing of them, with his Answer thereunto; I altered my intention, thinking it much better to print <hi>them,</hi> as he gave me leave to do, than to write any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before the three Letters, to which these are a most proper and
<pb facs="tcp:63313:3"/>
pertinent Introduction, rendring any other needless; and will be, I believe, more acceptable to the learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than any I can write. Perhaps some Persons will wonder why I kept these <hi>Animadversions</hi> so long from the Press, after they were sent to me to get them published. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that I have been hindered by many avocations, of which my Friends are not ignorant; and having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Pardon for the delay, I hope, Courteous Reader, to obtain thine. I have only this to add, that the reason why the Second Letter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears abrupt and imperfect towards the end is, that some passages are wanting, which however innocent in themselves, and proper for the free and private correspondence of Friends, yet the Authour thought not fit to Print, partly because they may be maliciously wrested by prejudiced
<pb facs="tcp:63313:4"/>
Persons, and partly through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness to do any thing that may seem to revive an unseasonable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is almost two Months since our Friend at <hi>London</hi> sent me word, that he had put into your hands <hi>the History of the Reigns of</hi> Edward <hi>and</hi> Richard <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, written by the Honourable Sir</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Howard. He saith he presented that Book unto you, not for the sake of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, which you know better than the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian; but for the sake of the Preface, that finding in it how far that Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>on had been mis-led by Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>'s <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Jovian,</hi> you might be perswaded to publish those <hi>Animadversions</hi> upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Answer, which you did me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to write for my sake, shortly after it came abroad.</p>
            <p>I have formerly told you what success I have had in communicating of them to several Gentlemen, both of the Laity and Clergy, and how happily thereby I have prevented some from being mis-led, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced others, that were so, by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fallacy of Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> and how urgent thereupon every one of them were
<pb facs="tcp:63313:5"/>
with me, to procure, your leave to have them made publick: and had I been so happy to obtain it, when I first desir'd it, I am confident the timely publication of them had saved Sir <hi>Robert</hi> a great deal of needless pains in that <hi>Preface</hi> to his History, and the trouble of a long <hi>Speech,</hi> which he made almost in the words of it to a very full House of Commons, on that memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able day which was appointed for the great debate of <hi>the disabling Clause.</hi> It was then that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> chose to lay out his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in declaiming against <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and the Authour of <hi>Jovian,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and for the pleasant Doctrine of <hi>Resistance,</hi> and its Champion Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> whose <hi>answer to Jovian,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur Friend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told you, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the party so much admired, as to say, that <hi>he ought to have the Deanry of</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, <hi>to which he had a right by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must also remind you of what he told you concerning a Church-man of note, who renounced the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> (upon which he most absurdly laid the blame of his illegal active Obedience) <hi>as an errour of his Education:</hi> and if I am not since misinformed, he pretends to be Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:63313:5"/>
Proselyte. Which is perhaps for his honour to have a Convert of that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. But how much it is for the honour of a Person of his Character to be Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Convert, your <hi>Animadversions,</hi> were they published, would shew the learned World.</p>
            <p>I add this to all the former stories I have told you of this nature, to convince you how injurious you have already been to truth, and Men that are inquisitive after it, in confining your Letters to my hands, and to prevail with you at last (if it be possible) to give me leave to get them Printed, that the publick may reap the same advantage by them, that I and some few others have done. If you will consent to my request, I will upon notice of it send them up next Term, by a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Attorney, to a good Friend of yours and mine, who will take care they shall be published without any further trouble to you.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, do not longer resist our united importunity, nor the pressing desires of those, who here importune you, by me, though they do not know you. One of them bid me plainly tell you, That you ought to consent to the publication of them: and another saith, you have been very much to blame for deferring
<pb facs="tcp:63313:6"/>
of it so long. But we are willing to forgive you, if after the continued importunity of fifteen months, you will at last grant the most earnest request of</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have read Sir <hi>R. H</hi>'s. Preface, which operates quite contrary to your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and instead of inducing my consent, rather confirms my former resolution to suppress the Letters you urge me to make publick. For if Persons of his Birth, Education, Parts, and Figure in the World, are so easily imposed on, and will not be at the trouble of reading on both sides, what fruit can be expected from these Papers, what candour or justice are they like to meet with? I am sorry to observe a Gentleman professing to have his sentiments altogether free, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced by other Mens Opinions, so absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resign his Iudgment to a fond Passion for Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> and pour out his F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I know it is not the particular infelicity of
<pb facs="tcp:63313:7"/>
this Noble Person, but an unhappiness inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all great Men, that their circumstances and more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> weighty employments will not allow their Personal examination of many things which come before them. They are forced to see with other Mens Eyes, and to hear with other Mens Ears, and so long as they trust none but Persons of Iudgment and Integrity, they suffer little thereby. But it hath been Sir <hi>R</hi>'s. ill Fortune to use the Observations and Collections of some Men, who either for lack of sense or honesty, have shamefully abused his confidence in them.</p>
            <p>I cannot, out of respect to him, believe, that if Sir <hi>R.</hi> had read <hi>Jovian</hi> through, he would have failed to observe the vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between calling the Laws which secure the Rights of the Crown, <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi> and ascribing to our King's <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> or that he would have stained his Honour by that unjust Charge on Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Pref. <hi>p. 22.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That Imperial Power may make a lawless attempt or prosecution lawful.</hi> But he had that, and several other invidious reflections on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, out of the excellent Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> who made Collections out of <hi>Jovian</hi> for him, and deserves very ill of him, for doing it with so little fidelity.</p>

I cannot be so injurious to the Honourable Authour, as to believe, that he made the Collection himself, since upon examining two or three of the Citations, I find such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as I am perswaded it is impossible for him to commit.</p>
            <p>What he cites from <hi>Calvin</hi> on <hi>Daniel 6. ver. 7.</hi> is not there, nor yet hath the place to which <hi>Philanax</hi> refers, either the words or sense of what we read <hi>p. 16.</hi>

               <hi>David</hi>'s Covenant with the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> was a plain Treaty of Peace, and Submission to <hi>David,</hi> after a long and unsuccessful defence of the Title of the House of <hi>Saul.</hi> It was first concluded by <hi>Abner,</hi> and upon his Murder, renewed and solemnly ratified by the Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> See <hi>2 Sam.</hi> Ch. <hi>II, III, IV, V.</hi> But you read of no Covenant made with the Men of <hi>Judah,</hi> who Anointed him King immediately on <hi>Saul</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>The Instance of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> making a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>2 Chron. XXIII. 16.</hi> signifies as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.

<pb facs="tcp:63313:9"/>
King was, That after <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Vsurpation, they should become <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>Joash,</hi> their rightful King. He was but seven years old, and at that age incapable of contracting for himself, and it appears not that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> made any conditions for him, the breaking of which should absolve them from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
            <p>And now we are upon Scripture Collections, you shall see how unfortunate he is, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or two more. To prove, that <hi>all wrongs</hi> [done by wicked Kings] <hi>are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable in this World,</hi>

And his other instance, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, is less to the purpose. He saith, <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> medled not till God saw good to reckon with him: For God had given a special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to <hi>Saul,</hi> to destroy the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi>

            <p>You see, Sir, how dangerous it is to trust to other Mens Collections, unless you are well assured of their Fidelity. Yet I must confess, Sir <hi>R.

He deserved his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, and praise, much better than Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> tho' I do not yet find that they are any where paid him.</p>
            <p>I believe Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> is not ill pleased with this Noble Authour, for suggesting that <hi>Jovian</hi> was written by a Club, and takes it for a great Honour, that he esteems him the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of all the Learned Assertors of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Non-resistance.</hi> Yet I have great reason to tell you, that he is mistaken, that <hi>Jovian</hi> was as much the Doctors own Work, as any Book extant, was the Authours whose name it bears; and I am confident he hath no other ground for this fancy, but only that he
<pb facs="tcp:63313:10"/>
knoweth, (and who doth not know?) that <hi>Julian</hi> and its Defence were both made by a Club, and that as Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s Postscript afforded the choicest materials of the former, so Mr. <hi>Atwood</hi>'s Letter of Remarks, furnished the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reflections upon <hi>Jovian,</hi> we meet with in the latter.</p>
            <p>I might observe to you, how little Reverence Sir <hi>R.</hi> discovers for Christian Religion, and amidst all his zeal for it, takes the liberty to make sport with the Baptismal Vow, <hi>p. 19.</hi> and calls the Dreadful Iudgment, which must pass on Kings, as well as their meanest Subjects, a <hi>pretended Account</hi> to be made up only with God. Tho' I hope the latter was rather from an infelicity in expressing himself, than any bad meaning. But I must remember that I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering your Letter, and not Sir <hi>R</hi>'s Preface.</p>
            <p>The Story your Friend told me of <hi>the great Church-man,</hi> was, I confess, altogether News to me, and very surprizing, and more than I can yet believe. If he were not able to discern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience, and <hi>Blind</hi> Obedience, he had great reason to complain of an unhappy Education. Passive Obedience is not inconsistent with the liberty of examining the commands of a Superiour; it freely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth a Iudgment of Discretion, and arms a Man with Courage, to despise all the hazards he may run, for choosing to obey God rather
<pb facs="tcp:63313:10"/>
than Man. Passive Obedience tempers no Man into a soft and base compliance with the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Illegal designs of a Prince; but on the contrary alloweth a Man by all legal means to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, and in case he falls into disgrace, or any other suffering on that account, it fortifieth him with Patience to bear it like a Christian. He who understands what Passive Obedience is, will live happily and easily, so long as he keeps a good Conscience, though he puts himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by out of his Prince's Favour.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear smiling at these pleasant Gentlemen, who have so extravagant an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s. Performance and Merit; nor can I envy him such Applauses, as shew some little Wit, but no Iudgment; those merry Gentlemen too much despise <hi>the dark Subtilties of Aristotle,</hi>

               </note> to be competent Iudges of the Merit of <hi>this</hi> Cause, their Heads lie readier to take a Iest than an Argument.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, in yielding to the Desires of your self and other Friends, that I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Printing of my Letters, I have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of any of those Gentlemen; here is no Entertainment for such Readers, nor do I expect that they will vouchsafe to read, but that they will condemn them, as they did <hi>Jovian,</hi> unheard. There are too many ready to speak
<pb facs="tcp:63313:11"/>
evil of things they know not, and it were great vanity in me to hope, That I can influence the Opinions of Patriots, that is, Men who carry on their Mischievous Designs, and Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, under the Specious Cloak of a Publick Spirit. 'Tis for the sake of a more Sincere and Sober sort of Men, who have patience to hear both sides, and are ready, whatever their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sentiments are, to yield to the clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, that I resign these Papers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to your disposal.</p>
            <p>Since you assure me they have rectified the mistakes of some, I hope they may do like ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to others: and if so, I shall rejoice in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Instrument of lessening the unreasonable Esteem some have for <hi>Julian,</hi> which otherwise will unavoidably be of very ill Consequence to their Majesties and the Nation. For I always was of that great Man's Opinion, the Learned Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> now of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> in his Letter to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> That Resistance, if our Religion and Rights should be invaded, is not allowable, <hi>because the Government and Peace of humane Society could not well subsist on those Terms.</hi>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have at length gotten leisure to read over Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Celebrated Reply to <hi>Iovian,</hi> of which some time since you were pleased to require my thoughts. And though I find by your last, that my pains may very well be spared, in regard your own Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Observation hath furnished you with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances of his disingenuous management of the Controversy; yet since you still insist upon it, and have reason in your Complaint, that it is impossible for you in the Country to get a sight of many Books necessary to be consulted, that you may be able to judge of the pertinence and force of the Citations on both sides, which are many, and of great moment in this dispute, I shall the more readily comply with your desires.</p>
            <p>If the Title Page had not born his Name, as well as the beginning of the Book speaks him a Clergy-man, my Charity would have carried me to believe, that such a piece as this could not have proceeded from Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> or any other of his Profession. I should rather have conjectured, that some <hi>Republican Bully</hi> had espoused the Cause, and entered the Lists, as his Champion. For there is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63313:13"/>
nothing more difficult than to reconcile such a loose Discourse, with the Character of a Divine, or indeed of a Christian. It is written in a strain wholly unbecoming, either the gravity of his Function, or the weight of the subject under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, with little Truth, and less Modesty. With what rudeness and scorn does he all along treat his Learned Adversary, as though he were an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Pretender in all sorts of Literature, and understood nothing? With what a particular kind of assurance doth he ridicule his Arguments instead of answering them?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface,</hi> p. ix.</note> And how much soever he pretends to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, he spares not profane allusions to the Holy Scriptures, to abuse his Adversary. When I come to examine the Authorities of Writers, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical and profane, cited by him, it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear, that they are for the most part either impertinently alledged, or most uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably perverted. So that though he hath very often most foully misrepresented <hi>Iovian,</hi> his Antagonist hath the less reason to take it amiss, in regard he useth him no worse, than he hath done most other Authors, he had occasion to meddle with.</p>
            <p>I am not at all surprized to hear with what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Applause this Reply is entertained in your Neighbourhood, no nor yet that many of the Gentry and Clergy too, are carried away with his Drolls and Fallacies, and judge the Victory clearly on his side. He wants not those also, who make it their business, in the City, to cry him up in all Companies, and to magnifie his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, as one of the most absolute Conquests that ever the Pen made. But their Success is not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63313:13"/>
answerable to their Zeal, especially among the Clergy, who best understand the merits both of the Cause, and the two Persons who are engaged in it on both sides. I dare say, as low as the credit of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> runs at this day, Mr. Dean's Reputation, both for Learning and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, is more than fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> above Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s. The great esteem he justly acquired<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not only among us his Brethren of the Clergy, in the six years he was a <hi>London</hi> Minister, but also with the most eminent Persons of all Ranks and Conditions, is not to be blasted by the scurrillous and spiteful Reflections, wherewith this Reply is fraught. And in the judgment of most sober and discerning Men, Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> hath, by this frothy and rude Discourse, lessen'd and exposed himself much more than his Adversary.</p>
            <p>I confess he hath many great advantages to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend his Books among common Readers above <hi>Iovian.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Doctrine of Resistance is very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to corrupt nature, which affects an absolute freedom from all subjection, or dependance, and abhors the very thoughts of Suffering. This hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the infancy of the World, engaged our first Parents in a Rebellion against their Creator, and hath derived it self through all succeeding Generations down to ours. And 'tis very well known, that many of Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Admirers, are leavened therewith to such a degree, that they cannot bear God's own Government, as wise, just, and gracious as it is, but quarrel at his holy Laws, which restrain their intemperance, their Lusts and Revenge, as intolerable Usurpations upon the natural Rights and Liberties of Mankind.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63313:14"/>
And though their designs may sometimes oblige them to make a great noise with their concern for Religion, it is notorious, that they have as mean an Opinion of Christianity, as <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate himself, being avowed Enemies, not only to the Doctrine of the Cross, but also to the whole Gospel besides.</item>
               <item>2. His loose and comical way of writing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably suited to the frothy and malicious humour of the present Age, which is delighted in nothing so much as drolling Invectives, nauseates every thing that is close and serious, and must be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with somewhat more light and diverting. This scoffing humour hath contributed much to the credit of <hi>Iulian,</hi> and its defence. Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s scurrillous Satyrs rellish with too many more than his Adversaries solid and useful Discourse; his spiteful Reflections pass with them as Arguments, and his grossest fallacies go smoothly down in an abusive Jest.</item>
               <item>3. It is another of his Felicities, that of the multitudes who admire him, very few are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges of the point in dispute, which is a subject quite above ordinary Readers, and of which no true Judgment can be made, without more Learning and Patience than the generality are Masters of. There are many points of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be seriously weighed, many Books to be turned, Historians and Fathers, both Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, besides modern Writers. Now they who most applaud him have never been at this pains, and indeed look upon it as wholly unnecessary; they have no mind to have a Case, which (as he hath put it) appears plain to them, perplexed by hearing what is said against it, and so without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63313:14"/>
examining the Testimonies, or considering the Arguments on both sides, pronounce in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Some, who are not altogether so much bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed, want abilities to comprehend an Argument, to discern a fallacy, or to judge of the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and force of his Authorities. Others who have abilities and inclination to examine them, either want leisure, or are under your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, not having the Books at Command, and presuming further upon his Fidelity and Modesty than is safe, take several things from him upon trust, which they would see to be much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, had they the Authours to consult. So that either through want of Abilities, or Books, or Patience to examine his plausible Fallacies, and perverted Citations, most who read him are too easily imposed upon.</item>
               <item>4. Another great advantage he hath in the propitious Juncture of time, in which his Reply comes forth. The heady and illegal methods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to introduce Popery, and Oppression, which (<hi>Solomon</hi> saith) maketh a wise Man mad,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 7.</note> having driven great numbers of the Nobility and Gentry into Arms against the King, his Party is much encreased. For they all stand obliged in defence of what they have done to side with him, and their successful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Resistance hath silenced all Arguments against it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To these I might add Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s particular Confidence, which goes a great way with ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Readers, and inables him to outface the clearest Convictions, and impose the grossest falshoods and absurdities upon his willing and easie Proselytes. So that his advantages over <hi>Iovian</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63313:15"/>
lie not in the extraordinary strength of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, and clearness of his Authorities, but in the weakness and partiality of his Admirers; and the Applauses he meets with must be entirely ascribed to want of judgment, or worse defects in those who cry him up.</p>
            <p>His first care is to salve his Credit by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the late Publication of his Book, which was Printed in 1683. though he durst not let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear till 1689, and truly it had been more for his honour to have eternally suppressed it. It will hardly encrease his esteem with wise and good Men, to see him fond of such a piece of gross abuse and sophistry, after five years consideration; and to observe, that his bitter Sufferings (which I mention not to reproach him, for I abhor all Cruelty) have not been able to mortifie his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent scoffing humour. How unjust and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful soever his punishment might be, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from humane revenge, yet Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> had great reason to consider God's hand in it, and to believe it a necessary piece of Discipline graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously intended to reduce him to a more serious, meek, and charitable temper of mind. I am sorry to find Afflictions have had a contrary effect upon him; but since it is so, I shall make two or three Observations from his Advertisement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to consider the Book it self.</p>
            <p>And first I cannot but take notice, that during the Interval between the Printing and Publishing of this Book, Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> had seen his scandalous and malicious suggestions against the Assertors of the Succession, and Passive Obedience abundantly confuted. It is manifest to all the World, that those worthy Persons were not more mistaken in

            <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s reason for suppressing his Book five years together, may serve for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to your clamorous Neighbours, who expect Mr. Dean should reply to this Book, and conclude him baffled, because he hath not answered it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most before he can have read it. But if he never answer it, let them know, that Victory doth not always attend him, who hath the last word, and if the times, which would not bear it, salved Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s honour, whilst his Book lay dormant, why may not Mr. Dean be allowed to use the same discretion. I doubt not but he will consider this Reply, and be ready to defend himself against the most formidable Arguments in it, if he find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient: but I conceive he stands no way obliged to take notice of this thing called an Answer to <hi>Iovian,</hi> having declared in the close of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to that Book, that if instead of <hi>a fair, close, and substantial Answer, he should only nibble, shuffle, and prevaricate and take Sanctuary in cavil, satyr, and scurrillity, he would pass over such kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with silence and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>empt.</hi> This you will find the exact Character of this celebrated perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s, and therefore he deserves not to be considered by his Learned Adversary.</p>
            <p>That Man must have an unreasonable partiality for the cause of <hi>Exclusion</hi> and <hi>Resistance,</hi> who will allow this to be a full Answer to <hi>Iovian,</hi> wherein
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63313:17"/>
nothing is said to a great part of that Book, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any notice taken of many Arguments levelled against his two darling notions, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing <hi>is more plain than that the Empire was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,</hi> and that <hi>it is lawful to resist a Prince, by force of Arms, if he persecute against Law, as</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To disprove the former of these, Mr. Dean hath shewn, that the Succession to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was <hi>Elective, Casual,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi>; and to make it out, hath been at the pains to give a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct account from all the Writers of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial History, both Greek and Latin, how every Emperour, from <hi>Iulius</hi> to <hi>Iulian,</hi> came to the Throne; from which account it appears, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many Princes endeavoured to secure the Succession in their own Families, yet none esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Empire to be their Inheritance, or made claim to it by a right founded in proximity of blood, but on the contrary, pretended upon the nomination of their Predecessors, or the choice sometimes of the Army, sometimes of the Senate, and sometimes of both, and that when it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued some while in the same Family, no regard was had to the next lineal Heir, but adopted Sons have been preferred before the natural, the more remote Kindred before those who were nearer, and the Empire hath been divided between two or three <hi>Augustus's</hi> at once. All which, and a great deal more, which <hi>may be true for ought he knows</hi> (by his own Confession) is utterly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with an Hereditary Succession, as that of <hi>England</hi> is, whose Laws do not allow our Kings to disinherit a Son, or prefer the Issue of a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before the elder Son's Posterity, much less to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63313:17"/>
adopt Strangers, nor yet to divide their three Kingdoms among three Sons, or to set them up all together joint Soveraigns and Kings of the whole British Empire. Now to all this what saith Mr. <hi>I.?</hi> Truly nothing in effect; but thinks to sham it all with a piece of <hi>Republican Cant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alluding to a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet so Entituled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Account of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Succession.</note> he calls it the <hi>History of the broken Succession in the Empire</hi> (which is as good as he and his Friends will allow the English Succession to have been) and then he tells us, that it is of so small concernment in the Controversy, that he hath never examined it. Whether he hath examined it or no, I cannot tell. I am sure 'tis much his interest, that no body else should examine it. There is a Cloud of Witnesses against him, and they all speak home to the point, and I think if any Man will have Patience to examine them, he must have Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s own Forehead, if he dare say their Testimony is of small concernment in the Controversy. He once believed it a matter of such moment to prove the Empire Hereditary, that he thought he could not <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iulian,</hi> p. 18.</note> 
               <hi>proceed faithfully</hi> without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and therefore unless some great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath since happened in his Mind, he cannot esteem so full and clear a proof of the contrary of little or no concernment in the dispute. Perhaps it was prudently done to slight and overlook what he could not Answer, but Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath in all appearance, undertaken to answer some other passages in <hi>Iovian,</hi> without examining them.</p>
            <p>Again, it was by no means fairly done, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the account of the Roman Succession as a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63313:18"/>
meer History, and slight it when he had done, as containing nothing that he was obliged to take notice of. There are many, and (till he shew the contrary, I shall think) concluding proofs drawn from the History, that nothing is more plain than that <hi>the Roman Empire was not Hereditary</hi>; which, if he meant in earnest to defend his first Book, it concern'd him to Answer. I am sure they were such as have in my presence, made some of the most considerable of his Friends acknowledge, that he was mistaken in asserting the Empire to have been Hereditary. And if he were mistaken in that, all his Discourse from <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Case (which is founded on that supposition) falls to the ground with it. For an Argument from one case to another concludeth not, if the two Cases prove to be very different. Now all that he saith for exclusion in his first Book (abating some things in his Preface which are considered in the Preface to <hi>Iovian</hi>) is wholly deduced from <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Case, and the sence of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Christians thereupon. And therefore if he have a stock of new Arguments to produce for Exclusion in this Book, 'tis nothing to the state of the Controversy, as it stood between him and his Adversary, who undertook only to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer what he had written, and not to divine what he might say hereafter.</p>
            <p>But if the Authour of <hi>Iovian</hi> had not given us an History of the Roman Succession, and by an Induction (which is one of the strongest sorts of proof, as an Example or Case is the weakest) made it out to be Elective, and not Hereditary: He hath without that sufficiently evinced the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of the Cases of <hi>Iulian,</hi> and the <hi>D. of Y.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63313:18"/>
by shewing, that there were no entailed Estates, nor any such thing as Heir in Tail, or Hereditary Succession to Entailed Estates in the Empire, but that every Man might dispose of his Patrimony by his last Will and Testament, or sell or give it away as he pleased; or in case he died Intestate, it fell to his next Kindred, as Heir, or Heirs at Law. To this Mr. <hi>I.</hi> makes no Reply. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could he make any defence for his Foreign Notion of an Heir and Inheritance, which is in truth as great a fallacy <hi>as a scale of Dutch Miles in a Map of Middlesex.</hi> For a Roman Heir, and English Heir, like Dutch and English Miles, agree in nothing but an ambiguous Name; they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Species of Title, and have not the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conception, as Dutch and English Miles are distinct species of Measure. Whether there be not more Wit than Truth in his representing Mr. Dean's Notion of a Soveraign to be such a deceit, I shall have another occasion to consider.</p>
            <p>The other main Notion in his Book, and that which (for ought I know) he may have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of first discovering, is that a <hi>Prince persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against Law, may lawfully be resisted by force of Arms,</hi> and that the reason why the Primitive Christians treated <hi>Iulian</hi> worse than former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Emperours, was, because they persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by virtue of Law against Christianity, whereas he persecuted against Laws which established the Christian Religion. Now to this new Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> the Dean objects two things. 1. That it is next to impossible for a Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to persecute against Law, considering his absolute power over the Laws, and that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, Rescripts, and indeed his Pleasure any way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63313:19"/>
expressed, had the force of a Law. And as for what was done against Christianity, by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers presuming on his connivence, and secret ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, was no more than what had been usual in former Reigns, and therefore could no more justify resistance under <hi>Iulian,</hi> than it would have done it under former Emperours. And at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer he just <hi>nibbles,</hi> p. 158.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He saith, that if oppressing the Christians contrary to former Laws, their civil Liberties as <hi>Romans,</hi> were persecuting against Law, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Christians, as many as were <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, were also persecuted against Law, put to Death upon shams, and pretended Crimes of Treason, tortured to deny their Religion, which was their pretended Crime, and not as other Malefactors, to bring them to confess it, denied the Liberty of making their defence, which the Laws of the Empire allowed all Men, and this he makes good by the Testimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi>; and he shews at large, how <hi>Galerius</hi> invaded the civil rights of all Men, as well as the Christians, subverted the fundamental Laws of the Empire, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to introduce the <hi>Persian</hi> Tyrannical Form of Government, and to enslave the freeborn <hi>Roman</hi> People. His illegal and barbarous treatment of his Subjects in general, is described from <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and yet never in any Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did the Christians suffer more patiently than in this <hi>Galerian</hi> Persecution, when if Persecution against Law would warrant Resistance, they had sufficient provocation to take Arms; if in other Persecutions they were discouraged by want of sufficient Force and Numbers, yet in this they could not want either, but might have expected,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63313:19"/>
that their Pagan Neighbours would have joined with them for their common defence against such a Monster and Tyrant. And what saith the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Man to all this? Why truly not one word, no not so much as that this Chapter is of <hi>small concernment in the Controversy.</hi> I have noted these material parts of <hi>Iovian,</hi> to which he hath given no sort of answer to let you see how little reason his Admirers have to magnifie this Reply, in which he declines medling with the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Arguments urged against him, which stand in full force against his first Book, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Shew he makes of defending it. To avoid being tedious, I purposely omit the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many other considerable things in <hi>Iovian,</hi> of which he takes no notice. And having shewn, that he hath given no full Answer to that Book, I shall proceed to shew, that this Reply is not a fair one, but full of fallacy and deceit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he doth not consider many of <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Arguments, so when he vouchsafes to Reply to others, he frequently misrepresents them, or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cealeth the Reasons and Authorities which support and inforce them, and shams them off with a Droll. Which is very unbecoming a fair and generous Adversary, and unworthy (I will not say of a Christian or Divine, but even) of an honest Man, and a Scholar, though a meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. I will not trouble you with particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of such foul dealing, because they will frequently occur in my Remarks on several passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Book, such as the shuffle he makes to exclude <hi>Procopius</hi> from the <hi>Flavian house,</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he gives of the distinction of Laws in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Imperial and Political.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63313:20"/>2. His main Authorities are Rhetorical Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications, and flourishes in Panegyricks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, in which the Orator doth not tie him strictly to truth, and the proper use of words, so that there is no arguing from the literal sence, but abatements must be made for Hyperbolical Speech on both hands, for lofty strains of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in Panegyrick, and for heavy and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Aggravation in the <hi>Steliteutick,</hi> or Invective. This deceitful artifice is the Masterpiece of our Popish Adversaries; when they pretend the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority for the Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Invocation of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ransack their Declamatory pieces for lofty Expressions, touching the dignity and benefits of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, and take <hi>Metaphors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Answer to the Jesuits Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. <hi>p.</hi> 386. ed. 1625.</note> and <hi>Metonymies</hi> in a proper and literal sence. They urge this very Apostrophe of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> to <hi>Constantius,</hi> whence Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> would infer the Doctrine of Exclusion as a notable Testimony for the Invocation of Saints; and for my part, I think it proves the one as much as the other. This foul play his Adversaries have sufficiently complained of, but cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to leave it, he is conscious that he needs such advantages, and dares not let them go. For having made such a wild assertion, as that the Empire was Hereditary, and being hard pressed by his Answerers, and withal resolved not to bate them one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his whole Book,<note place="margin">Answer to <hi>Iovian,</hi> p. 209.</note> he is forced to outface plain History with strains of Rhetorick, in which the Orator frequently allows fancy as licentious flights, as the very Poets, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63313:20"/>
nay even to stretch Hyperboles too by an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Translation. Now this argues great want of Ingenuity, an unchristian and <hi>wrangling</hi> temper, and that he contends not so much for the love of truth, as for Glory and Victory. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath obtained it, or not, will be further seen in the particular Remarks to which I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>His Intimation, that Mr. Dean waited to see the other Answers to <hi>Iulian,</hi> and then gave the substance of them in his Book, scarce deserves any notice. It is well known, that <hi>Iovian</hi> was written, <hi>currente prelo,</hi> and great part of it Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before those Answers appeared. The expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it made my self and divers others never look into them, and quite spoiled the sale of Mr. <hi>Long</hi>'s Book, as the Bookseller concerned hath complained to many.</p>
            <p>It is more material for me to enquire, whether <hi>Iovian</hi> hath given us an <hi>outlandish notion of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi> for if he hath not, the deceit will lie at Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Door. If his Notion be supported by the joint Authority of the Common and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws, it is great injustice to call it an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish one. Now <hi>Iovian</hi> doth not set up an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Soveraign furnished with an Arbitrary, and boundless Power, like that of the French King, or Grand Seignior. He acknowledgeth him to be under the direction of the Law, though he ascribe to him a Supremacy over all Persons within his Dominions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.</note> which let Mr. <hi>I.</hi> say what he pleases, is the formal notion of a Soveraign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iovian</hi> from p. 208. to p. 214</note> unless the word be taken in an improper sence. This Supremacy he proves to belong to an English
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63313:21"/>
Soveraign by many Statutes, and the Testimony of our most eminent Lawyers both Ancient and Modern, against which Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> hath not one word to reply. He proceeds to a particular reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Essential Rights and Properties of a true Soveraign, <hi>viz.</hi> to be unaccountable, to have the sole power of the Sword, to be free from Coercion,<note place="margin">P. 218, <hi>&amp;</hi> 219.</note> and Military Resistance. He sheweth these Prerogatives to be the King's due by express Statute Law, which Statutes do not vest any new Right in the Crown, but only declare what always hath been the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Fundamental Law of this Realm in those Cases. So that <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Soveraign is <hi>an English Soveraign,</hi> for ought Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath proved to the contrary, and therefore his Jest of a <hi>Dutch Scale in a Map of Middlesex,</hi> is both false and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. For though the Miles of several Countries have no formal Conceptions, in which they all agree, as Individuals of the same Species, yet all proper Soveraigns have, <hi>viz.</hi> Supremacy, from which the foremention'd rights are inseparable. Nor will his doughty Demonstration from an Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface,</hi> p viii.</note> which useth the Term in a <hi>lax and improper sence,</hi> convince Mr. Dean, or any Man else, that the Notion of a Soveraign implies nothing in it but Superiority. For at that rate there will be no fixing the formal Conception of any thing, if it must be stretcht so wide as to take in whatsoever, though improperly, bears the same name. The sence of the Term Soveraign, with respect to a civil Society, is so very well known, and agreed upon in the World, that upon the very hearing it, every body forms a conception in his mind of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63313:21"/>
somewhat more than Superiority, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands thereby such a superiour <hi>as is above all, and hath none above him,</hi> which imports Supremacy, and Mr. <hi>I.</hi> might as well have argued, that the formal conception of a <hi>Baron of England</hi> doth not imply <hi>Peerage,</hi> with all the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghts Essential to a Peer of this Realm, because the <hi>Baron of Kinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the <hi>Barons of the Cinque-Ports,</hi> and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Exchequer,</hi> are not Peers, and have none of those great Privileges.</p>
            <p>The next material thing in his Preface, is his quarrel against the Distinction of <hi>Imperial and Political</hi> Laws. Now let us first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee how <hi>Iovian</hi> explains this Distinction, and then what work Mr. <hi>I.</hi> makes with it.<note place="margin">P. 204.</note> He calls those <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> which ascertain the Rights of the Soveraign, and those <hi>Political</hi> which secure the Rights of the Subject. That there are Laws of both sorts, I presume Mr. <hi>I.</hi> will not deny, in this and all other Kingdoms, and so I see no reason for his fury against any person who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Terms to distinguish them.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>I.</hi> represents this Distinction most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuously, and quite contrary to the Authour's Mind. As though it set up a new sort of Law never heard of in this Nation, Authorizing our Kings to do all manner of Injustice; nay, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission others also to Murder, Plunder, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all manner of outrage, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o indemnifie them when they have done it. And that he may the more effectually delude his Reader into this belief, he fraudulently confounds <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> (by which <hi>Fortescue,</hi> cited by him, understands Absolute and Arbitrary Power, which is no where given by <hi>Iovian</hi> to our Kings) with <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63313:22"/>
and then deduces from it the most odious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences he could devise.</p>
            <p>Now I defy him to shew where Mr. Dean ascribes to our Kings <hi>Imperial Power</hi> in <hi>Fortescue</hi>'s sence or pretends, that the Imperial Laws of this Realm allow them to Act, or Authorize any of those outrages he talks of. Where doth he deny, that the Advisers or Instruments of such Oppressions are accountable and punishable, or pretend that any Commission will warrant and bear them out? Therefore all his odious consequences va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish into smoke,<note place="margin">P. 172.</note> and his tedious cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of <hi>Fortescue</hi> is wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, since <hi>Iovian</hi> no where gives our Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> though he say, that the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> of this Realm forbid Subjects all Military Resistance, when their Soveraign strains Prerogative beyond its legal bounds.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> in his former Book demanded, in case we are persecuted for Religion, under a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Successor, <hi>by what Law we must die?</hi> And he supposes his Adversary devised this Distinction to answer that question. Admit it to be so, he saith by the Imperial Laws we must die. Yet it is plain, he doth not pretend that those Laws au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the Popish Successor to persecute, or give him power to subvert the established Religion, or condemn and execute its Professors against Law. All he saith, is, that those Laws forbid me in those circumstances to save my Life by Rebellion. Had I been to answer his Book, I would have turned the question upon him, and have demanded by what Law I am allowed to draw the Sword, and raise Forces against my Soveraign for self defence. Those Laws which give him the sole power of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63313:22"/>
Sword, and condemn a defensive War against the King, whether levied by the body Collective, or body Representative of the people, do in effect require me to submit to be murthered, and in that case he himself will admit that I must die, <hi>my time is come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If splitting this same Law of the Land into Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial and Political displease him, it is because he was in a peevish humour, for I never yet have learned, that 'tis a faulty distinction which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the whole into its parts. However you see he grants the Imperial as well as Political Laws to be the Law of the Land; and if they be so, let the World judge whether he hath shewn the Charity of a Christian, or the Candour of a generous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary in thus representing the Distinction.</p>
            <p>I will not reckon his Allusion to the words of the Devil;<note place="margin">Acts 19. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Iesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?</hi> among his profanations of Holy Scripture. But he is a very sorry Exorcist, who will be gravelled with his Question. Common Law we know, and Statute Law we know, but who are ye? For the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Political Laws are both common and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law, and by his own Confession the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>If his suggestion were true, that <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as it is taught by his Adversaries, is Popery established by a Law, by which he only means, that it would be an encouragement to a Popish Prince to set it up without Law, an irresistible temptation to persecute the Reformed Religion, and to commit all manner of Lawless Oppression; I say, if this were true, it is no Argument that the Doctrine of Passive Obedience is false, because

It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that it hath been so abused, yet I would urge no Man to renounce his interest, either in the one or the other, on that account. Are not Subjects as apt to be clamorous and turbulent as Princes to be Arbitrary? are not the former as apt to claim undue Liberties, as the latter undue Prerogatives? Is it an unhappiness peculiar to Princes only to be haunted with Flatterers? Have not the People also Parasites and Sycophants about them, both Divines and Lawyers, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, is not Arbitrary Subjection, and an ungovernable humour in the people, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Society as Arbitrary Government? If then the Inconveniencies which may arise, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Doctrine foolish or wicked, the Doctrine of Resistance is full as much in danger as the slavish Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous consequences, I fear, are not altogether so accidental to the former as to the latter.</p>
            <p>Oh! but <hi>Iovian</hi> owns the consequences of Non-Resistance, and saith expresly, p. 242. <hi>In all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Governments Subjects must be Slaves as to this particular,</hi> that is, of their <hi>lives and liberties</hi>; and he would fain know then in what particular they are Freemen? Is Mr. <hi>I.</hi> sure <hi>Iovian</hi> saith so? or is he sure that life and liberty are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as to which he saith Subjects must be Slaves? I doubt he is guilty of a mistake, or a worse fault. The passage as torn from the context, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Mr. <hi>I.</hi> sounds very harsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Therefore to cut off Resistance in the English Government, the three Estates have declared against all Defensive, as well as Offensive War, it being impossible for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to consist with the Liberty of that pretence.

            </p>
            <p>In all Soveraign Governments Subjects must be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63313:24"/>
Slaves in this particular, they must trust their Lives and Liberties with their Soveraign. You see what this particular is in which Subjects must be Slaves, not the particular of their Lives and Liberties, but they may not levy War against their Soveraign under colour of Self-Defence. And though he saith they must Trust their Lives and Liberties with their Soveraign, it will not follow that he makes them to be wholly at the Discretion of their Prince. If Mr. <hi>I.</hi> and his Friends will think themselves inslaved because they may not be allowed, what he calls, just and necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence when grieved and oppressed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I know no Country in the World in which they may enjoy their freedom. I am sure that Prince would purchase their good opinion at too dear a rate, who would allow them that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for they would never want pretences, which they would esteem just and necessary occasions to use it, and quickly make him know, that Kings are only Servants and Trustees, and hold their Crowns and Lives too at the Peoples Discretion. To his Zealous Cant, which, fills the next four Pages of his Preface, I shall say nothing, since they contain nothing of Answer to any part of <hi>Iovian.</hi>

And whoever he is, who asserts a liberty of rising up against him for Self-Defence, is guilty of removing the ancient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; and the Nation have reason to Curse him.

            </p>
            <p>There is but one thing more in his Preface to be considered, and that is, whether <hi>Iovian</hi> be guilty of that cheat which the learned call the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of <hi>non causa, pro causa,</hi> in asserting that Self Defence doth more mischief than the most out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious

and bloody Oppression. This he saith is repeated often, but I cannot find it so much as once; It is true <hi>Iovian</hi> saith,<note place="margin">P. 256.</note> 
               <hi>That there is some inconvenience in the Doctrine of Non-Resistance, but the inconvenience of Resisting the Soveraign is ten times worse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 260.</note> 
               <hi>and that it is a remedy against Tyranny worse than the disease.</hi> And he hath largely proved it by reasons, by instances, and by the Authority of a Book which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> pretends to honour next his Bible, The Book of Homilies, and to all this he vouchsafes not the least Reply. Only Rebellion is with him Self-Defence, Drawing the Sword without Authority must be righting ones self, and the natural and necessary consequences of this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Defence must be accidental only, and then 'tis an errant fallacy to say the Inconveniencies of Resistance are greater and worse than those of Passive Obedience, though ten thousand Lives and Fortunes are destroy'd in an Illegal Defensive War, for ten that would be lost by the Arbitrary stretching the Prerogative beyond its legal bounds. This is fallacy all over, but Mr. <hi>I.</hi> and his Friends have a notable faculty of charging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Men with their own faults, and I fear were they entrusted with the liberty of Self-Defence, they would quickly make a very offensive use of it. They would invade other Mens Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by way of Precaution. They would make sure of giving the first blow without expecting an Assault. And Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s just and necessary defence, would be a much more destructive mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering piece, than <hi>Iovian</hi>'s <hi>Turkish, Slavish, Bow-string, Cut-throat</hi> Doctrine of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAving in my former Letter given you a general view of Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s work, and a particular account of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I shall now proceed to the Book it self. I shall say nothing either to <hi>Iulian</hi>'s <hi>Arts,</hi> or his <hi>Answer to Constantius,</hi> as being no part of the task you were pleased to impose upon me, though by the way there are two things which I cannot but observe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First that he is guilty of a strange omission in enumerating <hi>Iulian</hi>'s <hi>Arts</hi> to extirpate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, in not allowing one Chapter to a very considerable Stratagem of his, which very well deserved to have been more plainly and largely insisted on. This Stratagem was the granting an unlimited Toleration to all Sects and Heresies whatsoever: this Mr. <hi>I.</hi> durst only intimate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, and in short hints, for fear of disgusting those who best relish his writings: For as things have since fallen out, it is plain he would have lost your good opinion for ever. If he durst have adventured on the Argument, it is impossible for him to have avoided observing the mischievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onsequences of that State-Engine of the Papists,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63313:27"/>
falsely called <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>; nor have we reason to think he would have baulkt so diverting a subject as the <hi>Donatists Address</hi> to <hi>Iulian,</hi> in which they flattered him in strains of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not unlike those, which some of Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s Friends used to (a Person who is in his esteem) a worse Apostate than <hi>Iulian,</hi> telling him in effect, <q>That God and his Church were more beholden to him than to any of his Christian Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, who all tyrannically imposed on mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oice of their Religion, and wickedly usurped the peculiar Jurisdiction of God, whereas he with unparallell'd Justice had done right to both, restoring God to his Dominion over the Consciences of Men, and them to their natural freedom in religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</q>
Durst he have undertaken it, he would no doubt have made admirable sport of it; for he hath a great spite at Addresses, and a notable faculty at exposing them: But Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is too sacred to be touched, 'tis an Engine which will serve others as well as Pagan or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Apostates to ruine an established Orthodox Church: 'Tis the great <hi>Diana</hi> which our <hi>Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cry up,</hi> when they have a mind to raise the Mobile, and set them on work to pull down both the Monarchy and Church of <hi>England.</hi> I cannot forgive him this omission because it's evident that it is a wilful one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I cannot but remark how favourably he speaks of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and what Censures he passeth (by <hi>innuendo's</hi>) against <hi>Hilary, Lucifer,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> for their rude treatment of him, though he will not allow the like treatment of <hi>Iulian</hi> to be blameable; as also how he insinuates
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63313:27"/>
in the Preface to <hi>Iulian,</hi> that the Orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were too stiff about words. These passages make me call to mind some of his Discourses, in which I have heard him express much tenderness for the <hi>Arians,</hi> and wrangle with extraordinary heat for the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which he would have made of equal Authority with that of <hi>Nice.</hi> These things consist but indifferently with the Character of a <hi>Divine of the Church of England,</hi> and would tempt a Man shrewdly to suspect that he is not in earnest when he calls the <hi>Arians</hi> Hereticks.</p>
            <p>This would be a necessary piece of Justice to himself by an express Declaration to satisfy the World, that he is not of the <hi>Arian</hi> Sentiments in the matter of the Trinity, but believes at least the Orthodox meaning of the word <hi>Homoousios,</hi> and that all the favour he hath for the <hi>Arians</hi> is upon the accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of their free Principles as to the matter of Resistance, that they were not like the <hi>Socinians,</hi> fettered with the Slavish Doctrine of <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sive Obedience,</hi> and 'tis possible it may be the main dislike upon which some of Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s Friends have revolted from <hi>Socinus</hi> to the <hi>Arian</hi> perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of late years. These things by the way.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it hath not been so much his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries felicity to give the pregnant Title of <hi>Iovian</hi> to his Book, as 'tis Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s, who hath taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereupon, by making a flourish against the reasons why Mr. Dean pitched upon that Title, to avoid ever looking into the Book; and to excuse himself from the ungrateful task of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a great part of his former Book: But since it is his pleasure to let so many things in <hi>Iulian</hi> shift for themselves, let us see how he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63313:28"/>
himself, and answers those parts of <hi>Iovian,</hi> which he hath vouchsafed to take notice of.</p>
            <p>The first Reason which the Author of <hi>Iovian</hi> offers, why he gave that Title to his Book is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was chosen Emperour next to <hi>Iulian,</hi> though nothing akin to him, while <hi>Procopius,</hi> a great Man, and of the Bloud, was alive; as also because at his Death he left a Son who was passed by, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> chosen Emperour by the Army, which overthrows Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s Assertion, that the Empire was Hereditary.</p>
            <p>To this he answers, 1. That the Empire was Hereditary in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Family, because the Historians mention not the Election of his Sons, but only say, that the Army and Senate, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and Recognized them to be Emperours. The falshood of this pretence I shall have occasion to shew anon, where I am to consider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of those <hi>Greek</hi> words, whence he would infer, that they were only Proclaimed and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized without any Election.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He answers, that <hi>Procopius</hi> was not a great Man, and of the Bloud, but a base Impostor, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently pretending kindred to <hi>Iulian,</hi> in whom the <hi>Flavian</hi> House was extinct.</p>
            <p>Here Issue is joined, let us see what proof <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> offers for the affirmative; and then what Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath said to justify his confident denial, that <hi>Procopius</hi> was a great Man, and of the Bloud.</p>
            <p>For the affirmative are alledged the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of good Historians <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Iovian,</hi> p. 75, 76.</note>, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly say, he was near of Kin to <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Constantius.

Wherefore upon the whole matter, the Evidence of <hi>Themistius</hi> is to be set aside, and his testimony is no balance to the Authority of those Historians alledged by <hi>Iovian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further adds, that <hi>Procopius</hi> setting up for the Empire, under pretence of being of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:63313:31"/>
Family, is a strong proof that the Empire was lookt upon as Hereditary. But by his leave, if we had not such abundant proof to the contrary, it would be at most but a <hi>presumption,</hi> which falls very far short of a <hi>strong proof:</hi> whereas the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by <hi>Procopius,</hi> after the death of <hi>Iulian,</hi> and <hi>Varronianus,</hi> after the death of <hi>Iovian,</hi> are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>presumption</hi> against him, and much more strongly infer the contrary.</p>
            <p>I have been more <hi>prolix</hi> on this head, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to expose an Adversary. As he is ridiculing <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> who stands by himself at the bottom of the <hi>Flavian</hi> Genealogy, he applies to him the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's description of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> Heb. 7. 3. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Father, without Mother, and without Descent.</hi> I appeal to all the World, whether he did not forget his Character as a Clergyman, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed abhorrence of the abuse of Scripture, when he took this liberty to expose an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and <hi>Vagabond Landloper,</hi> as he calls <hi>Procopius,</hi> in the very terms, wherein among others, <hi>Melchizedek</hi> is by the Fathers taken to be described as a Type of Christ. If Mr. <hi>I.</hi> be immoveably resolved as to <hi>Iulian,</hi> that he will not abate one syllable in the whole Book, yet I hope he will take more modest resolutions touching the defence of it, and upon second thoughts, retract this irreverent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Allusion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He answers to the instance of <hi>Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Son <hi>Varronianus,</hi> who was passed by, and a Stranger Elected, whereas the younger <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> at four years old, was Created Emperour:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63313:32"/>
That the setting aside the former <hi>signifies nothing,</hi> but the Case of <hi>Valentinian</hi> is a greater Argument that the Empire was Hereditary, than the setting aside of Ten at that Age is to prove the contrary. I would know for what reason besides Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s will and pleasure, the making <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi>'s Case parallel, is meer amusement. For besides, that his Father before him was excluded by the Power of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and himself by the Friends of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> and after by the Conquest of <hi>William,</hi> the greatest Friends to the Succession will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for a strict Hereditary Descent of the Crown in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times.</p>
            <p>But the reason why <hi>Varronian</hi> was passed by, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Younger, in the like Nonage was made Emperour, is very obvious. <hi>Iovian</hi> reigned not long enough to oblige the great Men in the Senate and Army, he was forced to make a Peace upon such Terms as he could get with the <hi>Persians,</hi> and his short Rule gave him neither time nor opportunity, by any glorious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to recover his Credit, and endear himself to the Army and People. Whereas <hi>Valentinian</hi> Reigned gloriously twelve Years, and was very Popular, had <hi>Merobaudes</hi> his firm Friend, who was a wise Man, and by his Policy the younger <hi>Valentinian</hi> was Created Emperour; Not that the Hereditary Right of the <hi>Valentinian</hi> House, would otherwise have been usurped upon; for <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Father was the first Emperour of that Race, and left his Brother <hi>Valens,</hi> and Elder Son <hi>Gratian,</hi> in possession of the Imperial Throne; but as <hi>Ammi. Marcell.</hi> intimates for fear lest on <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s Death, the Legions in <hi>Gaul</hi> (who very well knew the Empire was not Hereditary)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63313:32"/>
should create another Emperour, perhaps <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus,</hi> who was for that reason sent far enough out of the way <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 30. c. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>A second Reason for the <hi>Title Iovian,</hi> was his being a Confessour for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, under the Apostate, who is said to have persecuted against Law, and yet <hi>Iovian</hi> demeaned himself quietly. To this he replies, that if <hi>Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> were quiet, <hi>Valentinian</hi> was not so, when he struck the Priest, nor the <hi>Caesareans</hi> who destroyed the Temple of Fortune. But what is this to the Point? did they offer to take Arms against <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> or to Rebel against him that persecuted their Religion against Law?</p>
            <p>The impertinence of these instances Mr. <hi>I.</hi> was aware of, and for that reason intimates some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which if true, would be more to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>Iulian</hi> durst not trust <hi>Iovian</hi> himself, nor leave him behind, lest he should rebel during his absence in <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the plain meaning of what Mr. <hi>I.</hi> doth not speak out. He cannot imagine what necessity <hi>Iulian</hi> should have of <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Company in the <hi>Persian</hi> War, for that he was in no Post where his service could be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but a <hi>Pikeman,</hi>

            <p>This place manifestly implies, that <hi>Iovian,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his refusal to Sacrifice, continued in the same Command: for though he chose rather to lay down his Commission than Sacrifice, yet <hi>Iulian</hi> chose rather to dispense with his own Edict, than part with such an excellent Officer.

               <hi>Themistius</hi> commends the Modesty of <hi>Iovian,</hi> who was advanc'd from a Rank which was not one of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prime and most eminent, to the Supreme Dignity; he very manifestly supposeth him to have been an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of considerable Quality; as also, where he mentions his lowly and courteous demeanour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such as, before his creation, were his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours and Equals in Dignity. You see, by this Instance, how far Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is to be trusted, and how much he presumes upon either the Favour or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his Admirers, who advances a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against plain matter of fact, attested by the best Historians, and draws Inferences from his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to support a desperate Cause.</p>
            <p>A Third Reason for the Name <hi>Iovian,</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Antiochians</hi> abused and libelled him as well as <hi>Iulian</hi>: which shews, That it was the evil humour of that People to lampoon and libel eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body that displeas'd them. And he further sheweth, That their Quarrel with <hi>Iulian,</hi> was upon other accounts, there mentioned, rather than his Religion.</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>I.</hi> answers, That none but the Heathens of <hi>Antioch</hi> abused <hi>Iovian,</hi> probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a Christian: whereas 'tis evident, from his <hi>Misopogon</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> That the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Christians of <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Iulian,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the height of their Christianity and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63313:35"/>
fervent Love to Christ; and he quarrels with his Adversary as a Shuffler for calling their Zeal Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, <hi>P.</hi> 103, 104.</p>
            <p>Certainly Mr. <hi>I.</hi> would lay a very signal Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon the World, if, out of the depth of his <hi>Grecianship,</hi> he would furnish us with some sure Rule, by which it may be known when the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to be understood of none but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and when only of the Christians of that City. I acknowledge, That he doth not expresly say, that none but the Christians of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> abused <hi>Iulian</hi>; but he fouly insinuates as much, when taking no notice that the Heathens also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled him, he citeth <hi>Theodoret</hi> to prove, That their Libels were the effect of an Heroical degree of Christianity. The Historians alledged by <note n="*" place="margin">P. 99.</note> 
               <hi>Iovian</hi> do all impute the Libels, and Abuses offered to both those Princes, indefinitely, and without distinction, to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochians.</hi> Wherefore till I see some better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it than Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s bare word, I shall crave leave to suspend my Belief, that none but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of <hi>Antioch</hi> lampoon'd and reviled <hi>Iovian,</hi> upon account of the Peace made with the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> as for his Religion, none of their Libels do so much as obliquely reflect upon it, unless Mr. <hi>I.</hi> or <hi>Baronius</hi> have met with more of them than <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idas</hi> could give an account of.</p>
            <p>Again, Mr. <hi>I.</hi> answers none of <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which shew expresly that it was his morose and philosophick Humour, and setting so low a price on Provisions at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the Country People and Corn-Merchants could not afford to sell them at so cheap rates, and thereupon left off the Market, whereupon ensued great Scarcity:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63313:35"/>
Neither doth he take notice of those <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Jovian. p. 99. ad p. 104.</note> other Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which prove the evil humour of the people, who were voluptuous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Theater, and Shews, given to Satyrs and Lampoons; he turns his back upon them all, which I confess is more tolerable, than it would be for him impudently to outface so many full and express Authorities.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That a good zeal may be expressed in very extravagant, and unwarrantable ways, is no new discovery; it is an old and necessary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, which is commonly made of the pious affection from the indiscreet, and sometimes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efforts thereof. And that in the height of their Christianity, some People may fly out into as great an height of scurrility, we need no other proof than Mr. <hi>I.</hi> himself; the height of whose Protestantism, and hatred of Popery, hath made him cast many scurrilous reflections, not only on his Adversary, but also upon the best of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Bishops, and the <hi>best</hi> of the <hi>present English</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last reason for the name <hi>Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> was that to encourage him to accept the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire upon <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Death, the Souldiers all cryed out with one common Voice, that they were Christians; which shews, that their Passive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour under the Apostate, proceeded not from want of strength and numbers.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>I.</hi> replies, that all <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Army were professed Heathens, besides <hi>Iovian</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> he never read of any professed Christians among them, unless he be added whom <hi>Libanius</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> talk of. <hi>i. e.</hi> As suspected to have kill'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63313:36"/>
the Apostate. He seems, in the height of his Charity, almost willing to believe, that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers are mistaken, and that their errour lies in jumbling together the beginning and the latter end of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Reign, which ought to have been carefully distinguished; because in the beginning of his Reign, the Christians had a legal establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had numbers and Arms sufficient for their defence, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey had not in the latter end of his Reign, being disbanded and disarmed; and by this notable expedient of a distinction, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to solve the passages of <hi>Greg. Nazian.</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> which prove the fidelity of the Christian Souldiers to a Pagan Apostate.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>I.</hi> according to his old custom, takes no notice of the other Arguments which <hi>Iovian</hi> offers to prove, that it was impossible the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should want strength and numbers, if they had the will to resist <hi>Iulian</hi>; nor doth he consider how easy a matter it had been for them, in the Western part of the Empire, to have set up an Emperour of their own Religion, while <hi>Iulian</hi> was employed in the East. There were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly many Legion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> in <hi>Germany, Helvetia,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> it self, and generally Christians, for we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of cashiering Christian Officers in all these Countries; so that admitting <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Army in <hi>Persia</hi> to have been composed wholly of profest Pagans, yet Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath by no means made out what he insinuates in his <hi>Taunton Proverb,</hi> that the Christians wanted not a stomach, but only force for a Rebellion. It doth not follow because we read not the Names of any professed Christians in <hi>Iul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63313:36"/>
they were all professed Heathens. I am apt to believe the Test was not put upon all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but on Officers only; and not on them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally but only on such as did <hi>militare in Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> who had Offices in the Guards. But I will not be positive.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is very fond of the suggestion of <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> that a Christian killed <hi>Iulian</hi>; but if that instance serve the Hypothesis of Resistance, it doth overthrow what he insinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es in this place, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that there was not a fourth Christian in the Apostate's Army. For <hi>Libanius</hi> might have soon found out the Murtherer, and have describ'd him by name, had there been no more than three Christians in the Army, whereas he only describes him by his Religion, and supposeth many of the same Character to have been in the Army when <hi>Iulian</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sozom. l. 6. c. 1.</note> receiv'd his death's wound.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to his distinction, which his Answerers have been so blind as not to observe, that the state of things was vastly different in the latter end of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Reign from what it was in the beginning. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saith Mr. <hi>I.</hi> our Authour might easily
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63313:37"/>
see that <hi>Gregory</hi> mentions this Remnant, of more than 7000. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before <hi>Iulian</hi> had made any Edict against the Christians, in any kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is intolerable false Reasoning to conclude, That the state of Affairs in the End of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Reign, was the same that it was in the Beginning.

Why doth he allude to the state of the <hi>Israelites</hi> under <hi>Ahab,</hi> when the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> thought that almost no body was left besides himself, who had not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized to <hi>Baal</hi>'s worship, if he had respect only to the beginning of the Apostate's time, when Christianity was the established Religion of the Empire? Why doth he allude to the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens refusal to worship the <hi>Golden Image,</hi> if the Christians incurred no danger by refusing to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? If there had been no Edict against them, no not so much as to give them the nick-name of <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> much less any Edict to Cashier the Christians, how ridiculous is it for <hi>Gregory</hi> to celebrate their constancy, which is generally in persons of great Power and Dignity, more liable
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63313:38"/>
to be shaken through fear or hopes? What was there applied to work upon their fear, if no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Edicts had passed against them? or what should move their ambitious Hopes, if no Baits of Preferment were laid to ensnare them? In fine, how could <hi>Gregory</hi> say, That they repulsed the Assaults of the Apostate, as <hi>a brave strong Wall</hi> doth a sorry Engine, before any Assault or Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was made upon them? but rather than lose the benefit of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s distinction, Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that <hi>Gregory</hi> shall speak neither Truth nor Sence.</p>

the Passage must relate to the former part of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s Reign; St. <hi>August.</hi> Testimony will as well prove Christians commanding the Apostate's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my after the Edict, which obliged all to sacrifice to Idols or quit their Places; for he mentions their Refusal to sacrifice before their Obedience to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commands of the Apostate: But 'tis very false Reasoning to infer the order of time from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which things happen to be mentioned. We have clearer Evidence that this passage of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi> relates to the latter part of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for the <hi>Persian</hi> Expedition was in the later end of his Reign, and this was the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition on which the Apostate went. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> were the onely Nation against which <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Christian Officers led forth their Soldiers.

But immediately after his coming to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan openly to persecute the Christian Religion: and yet after this we find Christians both in the Court and Camp. <hi>Iuventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> whose bold Remonstrance against the Impiety of <hi>Iulian</hi> procur'd them the Crown of Martyrdom, were both in the Apostate's Life-Guards at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> where they sealed their good Confession with

And those who did comply, continued Christians still. They did understand it to be an implicite denial of Christ; though they were circumvented, and ensnared, they did not abjure their Saviour, nor did they leave the Army; none were cashier'd but those that came to expostulate with the Emperour for trapanning them into Idolatry. So that after this ensnaring <hi>Donative,</hi> many Christians were still in Arms about the Emperour's Person, and it is reasonable to believe, greater numbers in the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

            <p>You tell me, Sir, how much his boast of an uninterrupted Succession of five of the <hi>Constantine</hi> Family takes with many, and passeth for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which I wonder at, when Mr. <hi>I.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesseth, that <hi>it is no proof of Right.</hi> Unless those five claimed the Imperial Crown, <hi>as their Birthright,</hi> by vertue <hi>of Proximity of Blood</hi>; this Allegation is nothing to the purpose, were it true.

former of them, in a flattering Oration on <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius Iunior,</hi> recounting the various Subjects of the several Panegyricks made on the Emperour, tells us, that some Orators chose the Nobility of his Family, and <hi>Three Successions</hi> in the Imperial Throne, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Grandfather, his Father, and himself; whereas if they could have hooked in <hi>Maximian</hi> into the Succession, those Orators would not have failed to have called it <hi>a Royal Succession of Four Descents</hi> in the same house. And the later, calling <hi>Constantius the Great</hi> a third Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the same Family, doth not derive his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from <hi>Maximian,</hi> but from <note n="*" place="margin">De Claudio—<hi>Ab illo generis autore in te Imperii fortuna descendit.

And had not <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> been made <hi>Caesar,</hi> neither his Descent from <hi>Claudius,</hi> nor his Adoption by <hi>Maximian,</hi> would have given him any colourable Title to the Imperial Crown.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you see that the uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in which your Neighbours triumph, was of no more than Four, which is no such Rarity, as they are made to believe. But to prove an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire Hereditary, it's not so material to shew how many of one Family have reigned, as by what Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one succeeded another.</p>
            <p>Now for some shew of Right, Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is forced to trump up again a Passage of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> cited in his former Book; which though fully considered by <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.</note> 
               <hi>Iovian,</hi> and so clearly answered, that he hath not one word to reply; yet with a sort of Assurance,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63313:42"/>
somewhat peculiar to himself, he tells the Reader it cannot be answered.</p>
            <p>If in this Passage <hi>Eusebius</hi> had declared that the <hi>Flavian</hi> house was the Royal Family, or that the Laws of the Empire gave the Son a right to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Father, it would have been somewhat to the purpose; but he meddles not with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Constitution, he only tells us that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine receiving the Empire from his Father, left it to his Sons, for whom, and their Posterity, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd as an everlasting Inheritance.</hi> It is no more than a good abode, that <hi>Constantine</hi> leaving three Sons all <hi>Caesars,</hi> the Empire would continue for ever in his Family. And as much might be said in a Panegyrick on the present Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> if he shall leave three Sons behind him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the happiness to get the eldest made <hi>King of the Romans</hi> in his life time.</p>
            <p>But if Mr. <hi>I.</hi> think this single passage an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable proof that the Empire was Hereditary, he is a very unreasonable Man to call <hi>Iovian</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Roman</hi> Succession a deceitful medium to prove the Empire Elective; for it is a fair and compleat Induction, shewing that none of the several Emperours, from <hi>Iulius</hi> to <hi>Iulian,</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by Blood,</hi> but either by the Designaation of their Predecessours, or Caesarship, or the Election of the Senate, or Army, or both. To this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, he addeth Testimonies of the best Authours, expresly shewing the Empire not to be Hereditary, which together make the strongest and most convincing sort of evidence in Questions of this Nature. And Mr. <hi>I.</hi> grosly abuseth his kind Readers, when he insinuates, that the same Medium would prove the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63313:42"/>
Hereditary; for 'tis notorious, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our Succession have no parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the Arbitrary Translations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from one Family to another, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Blood and Birth-right. Our Crown hath all along from <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, at least. descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same line, and where the next lineal Heir hath been disturbed, it hath been by mere Violence, or on pretence that the Person in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not the next lineal Heir, which was the Plea of the house of <hi>Lancaster</hi>; or that he was illegitimate, which was the Suggestion of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third against his Brother's Issue, as also of those who were against the Succession of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, these Allegations plainly suppose, what our Laws expresly declare, That the Succession to the Imperial Crown of this Realm is Hereditary; whereas none that set up for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ever objected any thing of this Nature against their Competitours, nor was it necessary, since by the Favour of the Senate, and Legions any Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was capable thereof.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is a generous Adversary, and though he <hi>needed not to have added further Proof,</hi> after this Testimony of <hi>Eusebius</hi>; yet he is resolved to be liberal, and produce fresh Arguments for his Assertion, and those so clear and convincing, as to justify a Triumphant Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>To clear the Point, as to matter of Fact, he asserts, [<hi>P.</hi> 1.]</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Emperours of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Line were <hi>only</hi> declared, recognized and proclaimed, <hi>not elected,</hi> by the Senate or Army. And to make out this, he refers to some Passages in

At this rate of arguing, I would undertake to prove out of his own Authours, that <hi>Iulian</hi> had no title to the Crown, which was <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Right upon the Death of <hi>Constantius Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.

               </gap>h so; as also, that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had no regard to <hi>Iulian as his Kinsman,</hi> when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63313:46"/>
he made him <hi>Caesar,</hi> but advanced him to that pitch of Majesty, because he was <hi>a Philosopher.</hi> I could prove against him, that <hi>Varronianus</hi> was not set aside for Nonage, by the Testimony of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which he cites [<hi>p.</hi> 120] <hi>An Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is always at Age</hi>; the Descent of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown takes away all defects. But if in Theological Disputations we are not allow'd to draw Arguments from Parables; I think the loose and lofty strains of Panegyrick are full as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in Questions of Law and Right.</p>
            <p>For this reason I may, upon the Authority of <hi>Socrates,</hi> overlook the testimony of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as the loose expression of an Orator, who is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to accuracy and the proper sense of words.

               </gap>. And if Mr. <hi>I.</hi> would have us believe, that the <hi>English</hi> words, <hi>in his stead,</hi> import a lineal and Hereditary Succession, I beg his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; because I read that <hi>Shallum</hi> conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and killed him, and Reigned <hi>in his stead</hi>; and that <hi>Menahem</hi> slew <hi>Shallum,</hi> and Reigned <hi>in his stead</hi>; and others, who had no Hereditary Title to the Crown of <hi>Israel,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any at all, but that of Invasion, slew their Predecessors, and Reigned <hi>in their stead.</hi> But 'tis a great felicity for a Man to know his Readers beforehand: he may say any thing, who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured their favour. The passage cited from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius,</hi> comes very much short of the point. I know no body will deny, but that <hi>Constantine</hi> might be his Father's <hi>lawful Successor,</hi> without an <hi>Hereditary</hi> Title. The Right, upon which he as eldest was preferable to his Brothers, was a meer congruity; and if the Empire had been to descend from <hi>Chlorus,</hi> as a <hi>Roman</hi> Patrimony, he would have been but one of the three lawful Heirs, and only one third part would have faln to his share.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Wisdom in dividing the <hi>Roman</hi> World amongst his three Sons, I question
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63313:47"/>
it not; but how doth that prove the Empire He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary? If there be any thing in the reason, which <hi>Eumenius</hi> gives, why <hi>Constantine</hi> was his Father's undoubted Heir, <hi>viz. Primogeniture,</hi> there was more Prudence than Justice in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Testament. But since the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire could be devized by Will, 'tis a President from whence no Argument can be drawn touching the Right of Succession in this Kingdom. In the proper and ordinary sense of the term, no Kingdom is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be Hereditary, which may be devized by Will of the Prince, and that if he please, from his own Children to Strangers.</p>
            <p>The Title of <hi>Iulian</hi> to the Empire is out of all dispute: but that it was founded on <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> or that he succeeded <hi>Constantius as Heir at Law,</hi> is an impudent sham. For the <hi>ordinary Right,</hi> by which <hi>Amm. Marcell.</hi> saith, he obtain'd the Empire, was <hi>Caesarship:</hi> which, (as <hi>Iovian</hi> largely proves) was freely conferr'd upon him by <hi>Constantius,</hi> and which he might have deprived him of again, or have conferr'd on another, <hi>as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort</hi> with him, who would have been his Collegue in the Empire upon the Death of <hi>Constantius,</hi> by the same <hi>ordinary</hi> Right. By Ordinary Right, upon the resignation of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Maximia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Herculeus, Constantius,</hi> and <hi>Galerius,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Imperial Throne; and not <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Son of <hi>Herculeus,</hi> whose the Empire was, if <hi>blood and birthright</hi> had been the <hi>ordinary</hi> right by which it went.</p>
            <p>I am quite tired with exposing his gross So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, and those Childish fallacies with which he puts us off instead of Demonstrations. I shall only add, that if lofty strains of Panegyrick may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63313:48"/>
pass; the <hi>Popish</hi> Writers have admirably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was the Doctrine of the Primitive Church; and therefore I hope Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath by better Arguments proved its <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Impossibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Bravade of Demonstration our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thinks he may despise all <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as <hi>trifling objections,</hi> and without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them particularly, bloweth them off forty at one puff, and advances three Positions against them.</p>
            <p>The first is this, That there never was an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Succession in the World, and what then? This hath some shew of an Argument for Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but how he will thence infer against <hi>Iovian,</hi> that the <hi>uncertain and arbitrary</hi> Succession in the Roman Empire was nevertheless <hi>Hereditary,</hi> I cannot discern consequences at distance enough to comprehend: But if it were to the purpose, I conceive his Instance of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> doth not make out the Peoples right to govern the Jewish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in <hi>David</hi>'s Line: for <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>His second Position, that the Government of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63313:48"/>
the Succession in the R. Empire, was in the hands of the Emperour, shews, that Succession to be Arbitrary, and not Hereditary, and is so far from answering <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Objections, that it yields the Point. Wherefore to his second and third Positions, I shall return him an answer almost in his own words, and desire he would inform me in what part of the Globe that Hereditary Kingdom lies, where the present Possessor of the Crown hath the Power of declaring whom he will, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Stranger, his Successor. What sort of Hereditary Succession was that, in which the first of the Family named a single Successor, the second named a third, and the Survivour of them though he had no other choice (if Mr. <hi>I.</hi> mistake not) yet did amiss in naming <hi>Iulian,</hi> and ought to have named a Stranger. I conceive that Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is every whit as much Elective, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the free choice, and nomination of one Person, as that which is determined by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of a hundred Votes.</p>
            <p>What he addeth to prove the Empire Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in the Families of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> serves only to encrease that dislike which I ever had to works of Supererogation. It being all meer Rhetorick, such good wishes and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as might have been made a King of <hi>Poland.</hi> And therefore I am much amazed at Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in affirming, that <hi>every one knows the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Kings Children, in an Elective Kingdom, are furthest off from succeeding, who ever succeeds they shall not.</hi> He excepts only the German Empire, when every one that knoweth any thing of the State of <hi>Europe,</hi> can tell him of two other famous Monarchies both Elective, in which being of the

            <p>In his Vindication of the Paper of Reasons, whereof he will have the Bishops to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, there are many things very strange and diverting. <hi>First,</hi> he will be wiser than his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, Sir <hi>Simon Dewes,</hi> and make the Bishops Authours of a Paper, which (as <hi>Iovian</hi> observes) Sir <hi>Simon</hi> supposeth to have been drawn up in the House of Commons. 2. He accuseth the justly admired days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of most horrid Duncery, when he professeth to believe, That few besides the Bishops in those days were able to pen such a Piece; I presume he will allow Serjeant <hi>Manwood</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mounson</hi> were some of those few, and if so, the Reasons might be framed in the H. of Commons. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He will not allow the paper to be called Anonymous, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63313:51"/>
though not signed by one hand. I have heard that in a Parliament a paper hath been rejected as such, though entituled the Humble Petition of the Gentlemen and Freeholders of the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> because not subscribed by them. But what tho' the Bishops be mentioned in the Body of the paper? what though it talks of <hi>Godly Bishops</hi>

               <hi>Iovian</hi> hath shewn in this Paper gross Mistakes in Divinity and Church-History, and the inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of several Arguments. Yet saith Mr. <hi>I.</hi>

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:63313:51"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is very pleasant to see a Man who <note n="*" place="margin">p. 128.</note> saith his Adversary hath <hi>raised Objections thick and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> against this Paper, challenge him to write against, and threaten to answer him if he doth, and yet not offer one word of Answer to what he hath already said against it, I have the Charity to believe whatever Mr. <hi>I.</hi> in an heat may say, that he will not stand by those Principles which are the Foundation of a great part of that Paper, which he calls the Bishops Arguments.</p>
            <p>I cannot believe he thinks the Political Laws which God, by <hi>Moses,</hi> delivered to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> are still in force, and ought to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Christian Governments: That all Crimes punishable with Death by those Laws, ought to be Capital in all Christian Realms; and on the contrary, That it is not lawful to punish with Death any Crime which was not made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Offence by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Principle runs through that Paper or a worse <hi>(viz.)</hi> That all the Scripture Examples of good Men are at least imitable, if they have not the Force of a Precept. If Mr. <hi>I.</hi> will undertake the defence of these Principles, I am sure he will be justly chargeable of <hi>making wast Paper of most Acts of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Mr. Dean may <hi>in part</hi> he mistaken in the Instance he makes to prove it, yet he is not mistaken in saying, That though there was one good Argument why the Queen's good Subjects might urge her Majesty to put the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to death, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>She sought the Queen's Life</hi>; yet the question remains whether she could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Crown. There is no Conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63313:52"/>
from the Justice of punishing Treason according to the known Laws of the Realm with Death, to the Excluding the next Heir from the Crown meerly for being a Papist. And therefore <hi>Mr. Dean</hi> adds, that those who addressed for preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Succession, and were against Excluding the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> would <note n="*" place="margin">Preface, p. 38.</note> upon <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proof that he sought the Life of his Brother, have been willing to Exclude him out of the World.</hi> This fully answers Mr. <hi>I.</hi> and therefore, with his usual discretion, he takes no notice of it; but falls upon the Instance of the Hebrew First-born, who, <hi>Mr. Dean</hi> saith, might not be dis-inherited for cursing or smiting their Father, though they might be put to death. The Instance indeed holds not where the First-born had other Brothers, but in case of the onely Son, it is true; for <note n="†" place="margin">De Success. in bon. c. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Page</hi> 135. Mr. <hi>I.</hi> chargeth his Adversary with three things, of which I shall easily clear him.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) That <hi>Iovian</hi> talks of Statutes against King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Succession, and whereas he saith, <hi>If our Authour can shew me but one of those many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, whereby King</hi> James <hi>stood Excluded, I will yield him the Cause.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and,</hi> in a Letter to the Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd in the Collection of Papers, in the end of the first Volume of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the Reformation: but what he saith to invalidate the Will was never proved, and this Paper lying unknown, could not (if true) influence that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63313:53"/>
which recognized K. <hi>Iames</hi> his Lineal Descent from <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</item>
               <item>(2.) He quarrels with his Adversary for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Exclusion of the <hi>House of Suffolk,</hi> which he saith, <hi>never had any pretensions</hi> to the Crown. Sure Mr. <hi>I.</hi> was in a very cavilling humour. The Daughters of <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by the French Queen, and their Issue, are those whom <hi>Iovian</hi> intends by the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and why they may not as properly be call'd the House of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as the present Line the House of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I know not. For denying the pretensions of that Line to the Crown, I leave him to answer to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and some other Noble Lords descended thence.</item>
               <item>(3.) He represents <hi>Iovian</hi> as <hi>very absurd,</hi> for quoting the Act of Recognition, 1 <hi>Iacobi,</hi> when he is for invalidating all Acts of Parliament that limit and determine the Succession. But the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity is his own. He seem'd well enough to understand the difference of <hi>Declaring or Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing</hi> from <hi>Creating</hi> and <hi>Electing</hi> about 20 pages before; 'tis much he should so soon forget it. An Act of Recognition confers no Title, but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it, An Act which limits the Descent of the Crown <hi>creates a Title</hi> when it was not.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It is worth observing how strange an Answer he gives to two Authorities, cited by <hi>Iovian,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a Bill of Exclusion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 137.</note> which changeth our Succession from <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary</hi> to <hi>Elective.</hi> Saith he, <hi>An Act of Disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting from the Crown, doth own, and proclaim, and prove, the Kingdom to be Hereditary.</hi> Right. But it makes it quite otherwise. So the Act for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63313:53"/>
taking away the King's Office, doth own this Realm to be a Monarchy, but made it a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The Ordinance for abolishing Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy, doth own and prove the Government of these Churches to be <hi>Episcopal,</hi> and at the same time destroyed it. I suppose that implicit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment did not cure the manifest Injustice of those Acts.</p>
            <p>His Reflection on <hi>Iovian</hi>'s way of arguing is Childish,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 139.</note> if there be four Terms in the Syllogism, or Enthymeme, they are of his own making, and he is to answer for the honesty of it himself.</p>
            <p>No less ridiculous is his pretence, that his Adversary professeth to have <hi>sworn Allegiance to Subjects.</hi> It is possible an Oath of Allegiance may be broken by injuries done to a Subject, and yet no Allegiance be sworn to that Subject; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by ravishing, or killing the Queen, or the Prince, and yet both the Queen and Prince are no more than Subjects. Whether an attempt to debar the next Lineal Heir from Succeeding, be not an Invasion of the Rights and Prerogative of the present King, especially when he is averse to it, and an offence against his Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may possibly be a doubt with Persons of more Learning and Conscience than Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath shewn, either in <hi>Iulian,</hi> or his Defence of it. Whether it be or not I will not determine.</p>
            <p>The Rant wherewith he closeth his <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Iovian</hi>'s Preface, is to the tune of <hi>Lewis du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> Yet I presume no body takes Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> to have renounced the Doctrine of our Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, or thinks him one step nearer <hi>Rome</hi> on that Account. Some such Zealots against Popery,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63313:54"/>
as Mr. <hi>I.</hi> about 60. years since fell foul on Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> who in his <hi>old Religion,</hi> acknowledgeth the Roman to be a <hi>true,</hi> though a <hi>corrupt Church,</hi> and occasioned him to publish an Apologetical Epistle call'd <hi>the Reconciler,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>'s Works.

He explains himself as <hi>Iovian</hi> doth, asserting, that in different senses the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is both a True, and a False Church, True in Existence, False in Belief, that is, hath a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> not a <hi>Moral</hi> Trueness. As a Thief, or a Cheat, is <hi>truly a Man,</hi> though not a <hi>True Man,</hi> or as the Devil is a <hi>true</hi> Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, or Angel, though (not as Mr. <hi>I.</hi> fallaciously expresseth himself, a true Angel of Light) a false, lying Spirit. He addeth, that Antichristianism, though it justly makes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> odious, and execrable to God, Angels and Men, yet it cannot <hi>utterly dischurch it.</hi> He saith in this Doctrine he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>Zanchy, Luther, Calvin, Iunius, Plessis, Hooker, Andrews, Field, Crakanthorp, Bedel</hi> and others, who deny not the <hi>Natural Verity</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they deny it to be <hi>veram &amp; puram.</hi> They own it to be a True Church, such as the Ten Tribes were, notwithstanding the Idolatrous Worship set up by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> which is little to the advantage of the Roman Church, being only in effect to say, They are neither Jews, Turks, nor Pagans, though misbelieving, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and Idolatrous Christians, and this Epistle
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63313:54"/>
and Doctrine is approved by Bishop <hi>Morton, Davenant</hi> and <hi>Prideaux,</hi> as also by Mr. <hi>Primrose,</hi> Minister of the French Church.</p>
            <p>Thus I have attended Mr. <hi>I.</hi> through his first Stage, and here I think it best, for me, to rest a while with him. My motion hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what slower than I intended, and I confess in point of time, I have broken my word with you. But you will pardon me when you consider, that his numberless Frauds, which I had to detect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired more time than I allowed my self; for Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies are not laid open, and confuted in as few words as they are committed. And withal I have been the more particular in exposing this first part of his Answer, because here it is that I am most capable of serving you, by shewing how wretchedly he prevaricates in abusing many good Authours, which you have not at hand to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult. I hope to make a shorter business of what is behind, a great part of it being already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd in my former Letter.</p>

            <p>I Am now come to what Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is pleas'd to call an Answer to <hi>Iovian,</hi> and concur with your Observation, that Brevity is the only good thing in it, craving leave to add, that it would have been abundantly more commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon that account, had he forborn Cavils, and spiteful misrepresentations of his Adversary, without which his Answer would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the fifth part of its present bulk, as small as it is.</p>
            <p>His Argument, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> if design'd to prove, that the Christians of the fourth Century, would in our Circumstances have been for Exclusion of a Popish Successor, is <hi>wretched Fallacy,</hi> because of the vast disparity of <hi>their Case,</hi> and <hi>Ours.</hi> For Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath not been able to maintain his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, that <hi>the Empire was Hereditary,</hi> against <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>'s <hi>Arguments.</hi> And if it be design'd to prove, that had the Christians known <hi>Iulian</hi> to be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, they would have done all in their Power to have kept him from the Crown, it is no less <hi>wretched Impertinence,</hi> in regard his Adversary undertakes, that the Fathers of our Church would readily set aside twenty such Titles as <hi>Iulian</hi>'s, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63313:56"/>
secure their Religion. His pretence that <hi>Iulian</hi>'s illegal Oppression of the Christians, was the cause of that rough treatment they gave him, together with his Insinuation that nothing but their <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> kept them from taking up Arms against that <hi>Apostate</hi> to do themselves <hi>Right,</hi> Mr. Dean hath confuted by more arguments than Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 158.</note> thinks fit to take notice of. And that one at which he nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is quite too hard for his Teeth. <hi>Iovian,</hi> saith <hi>Iulian,</hi> did persecute Legally, <hi>because all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Orders, and Decrees, how unjust soever, were Legal.</hi>

            <p>If these Citations are misapplied, why doth he not shew it, at least in one or two Instances? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, his Readers are too kind if they take his word for it; and if any be so rude as to demand better satisfaction, Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> is resolv'd to be even with them for their Curiosity.

            <p>But this one Argument is by no means the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63313:56"/>
of what Mr. Dean offers against this new Hypothesis. That illegal Oppression, and <hi>Tyranny, was the cause of the Christians rough behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Julian. For he sheweth that other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, some of them Christians too, were treated as coursely as <hi>Iulian,</hi> particularly <hi>Constantius</hi> by <hi>Hilary, Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> from whom Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> cites several such passages in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> as are far ruder than any thing in the Third Chapter of his <hi>Iulian.</hi> So that the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> he would solve by this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>In the next Page we find Mr. <hi>I.</hi> in a very pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish humour, quarrelling with <hi>Iovian</hi> for what he himself said in effect over and over. 'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Phrase moves his Choler, <hi>viz.</hi> the main <hi>ground of their displeasure was, that he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally persecute them, nor put them to Death enough.</hi> Mr. Dean explains himself sufficiently, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians desired rather to be persecuted in the old <hi>Decian,</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian</hi> way, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have <hi>Their Religion</hi> made their <hi>Crime,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> their <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> This the Authours referred to in the Margin plainly evince, and the instances of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventinus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Romanus,</hi> and <hi>his fellow Souldiers shew,</hi> that some under <hi>Iulian,</hi> were as ambitious of the Crown of Martyrdom, as the Elder Christians, who sought it by voluntary Confession, and provoked their Pagan Rulers to persecute them with the utmost Cruelty.

               <hi>P.</hi> 161. Mr. <hi>I.</hi> buckles closer to his work, and pretends accurately to state the Case of Passive Obedience, and saith, he and <hi>Iovian</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreed, 1. <hi>That the King's Person is sacred, and Inviolable.</hi> 2. That <hi>Inferiour Magistracy acting by the King's Authority, according to Law, may not be resisted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am glad to see that the peevish humour hath somewhat spent it self, and that he can agree with his Adversary in any thing. I presume when he saith, that the King's Person is <hi>Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable,</hi> he means by those fine words, he <hi>may not be resisted:</hi> and if so, it may deserve consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how well he agrees with himself. For in his former Book he quoted a shrewd saying of a <hi>worthy Person,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </q>
Every one knows whose single Arm is meant, and no Man who praises that saying can agree, that the <hi>King's Person may not be resisted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How fairly he states the difference between himself and <hi>Iovian,</hi>

Where doth he give the King Boundless Power? Or the whole Legislative Power? I am sure Mr. <hi>I.</hi> can shew no such Assertions in the Book he pretends to Answer. And therefore how uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably doth he abuse both his Adversary and his Reader for almost forty pages together? And how impertinently doth he swagger with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> the <hi>Miroir, Fortescue,</hi> Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Memory, to disprove what <hi>Iovian</hi> no where affirms?</p>
            <p>It would indeed have signified something, could he have produced but one clear Passage out of all those Authours in which any of them declares it lawful for Subjects to raise but a single Regiment, or Troop, to resist Forces legally Commissioned even in illegal, and uncommissionated Acts of Violence. And till he can at least shew this in our Law-Books, he hath no right to call Mr. Dean a <hi>Proteus</hi> of Passive Obedience, or reproach him as not consistent with himself. It is no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to allow Subjects the Liberty of <hi>Private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi> when <hi>illegal Violence</hi> is offerred to them, and yet to deny them Power to raise Forces, and to wage a <hi>Defensive War</hi> against those, who, as Mr. <hi>I.</hi> maliciously supposeth, will murther in Troops. I hope he will not be so hardy as to say, that a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Captain can be made, or that one private Souldier can be listed according to our Laws, without Their Majesties Commission, or that in their Realms and Dominions, and besides Their Majesties is vested with Legal Authority to grant Commissions to levy Forces. Tho' the Laws se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure mens Lives and Properties, against Arbitrary Power, yet they do it not by giving Subjects the Power of the Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63313:58"/>By this you may see, Sir, how mean Judges your Neighbours are, who discern not how gross a Fallacy Mr. <hi>I.</hi> puts upon them, when he insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, that his Adversary is so sensless as to allow.
<q>That 'tis lawful to resist a single <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat,</hi> and yet makes it a damnable sin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <hi>Cut-throats,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ. <hi>p.</hi> 163. 169.</note> as also to hold "that the Sovereign can Authorize Forces, and great Numbers, tho' he cannot <hi>single Persons,</hi> to do Acts of illegal Violence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, you know the Author of <hi>Iovian,</hi> is as far as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> himself from believing that <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are Sacred,</hi> or can <hi>Legitimate</hi> Oppression; or that the Sovereign can give a <hi>Valid</hi> Commission to his <hi>Forces</hi> to outrage, or Murther his Liege Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and render them <hi>unaccountable</hi> for such Acts of Violence. He no where denieth Subjects the Liberty of making a <hi>Legal Defence</hi> against any number of Thieves, and Cut-Throats <hi>how great soever,</hi> and by whomsoever Commissioned. Nor doth he in the least insinuate that the <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of resisting</hi> lies in that <hi>they are Forces.</hi> But he makes it to consist in raising Forces <hi>without law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority</hi> to resist with, and in defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>in such a manner</hi> as casts off Subjection, and is a manifest, and dangerous Usurpation upon the <hi>Legal</hi> Rights of an English Sovereign. He makes that Law the measure of the <hi>Subjects Power</hi> as well as of the Kings, and this it seems is his great Crime.</p>
            <p>If Subjects be allowed to defend themselves at discretion, the King must hold his Crown but <hi>during pleasure.</hi> Some of Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Friends, will complain, that their Throats are in danger,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63313:59"/>
and will never think them safe till they have the King's Throat in their Power. They have made so good advantage formerly of what he calls <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Defence against the Vnauthoriz'd Illegal Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Subjects,</hi> that I do not wonder that they would fain be at the same Trade again. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget that they held the King's Person as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> doth, and were as clamorous Zealots for Religion, and Property, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing brought their Majesties Royal Grand-Father to the Block, subverted the Ancient, and Excellent Constitution of this Noble Realm both in Church and State, and enslaved the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Neither you nor I can have while to entertain our selves with so diverting a Spectacle as Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s Triumphs over an Adversary of Straw of his own making, and therefore leaving him for some time at that Sport by himself, bateing a few strictures here and there, I shall say little till I meet him <hi>p.</hi> 201.</p>
            <p>Among several things worthy of Censure, the first I shall note, is the rude treatment of a very Eminent Protestant Writer,<note place="margin">p. 165.</note> where having impertinently cited two passages out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> and K. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Laws, for they contradict nothing in <hi>Iovian,</hi> he concludes in these words.
<q>
                  <hi>These I hope are better Authorities in this matter, than</hi> Sam. Bochart, <hi>our Author's</hi> French <hi>Oracles,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
Certainly, Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is the first man who ever mention'd that great Name without some Addition of Respect, not to say with scorn and contempt. And that Epistle, which he so much vilifies, hath ever been in great Esteem with all sorts of men. It is in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63313:59"/>
effect an Apologetick Declaration of the whole Protestant <hi>French</hi>-Church, professing their just abhorrence of the great Rebellion, which ended in the most execrable Murther of the King. In a word, the Memory of Mr. <hi>Bochart</hi> will ever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious whilst the world pretends to retain any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honour for eminent Piety and Learning.</p>
            <p>In the next page he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mr. Dean with <hi>attributing to the Sovereign the whole Legislative Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 166.</note> and by his answer, it is plain he accuseth him of giving the Kings of <hi>England</hi> that vast Power. I marvel how Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath disposed of his Conscience, if he ever had any, or with what face he can obtrude so gross a slander.</p>
            <p>It is very evident that no such thing can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the place he refers to. For, 1. Mr. Dean is speaking of <hi>All</hi> proper, and compleat Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, as well States, as Monarchs, and not in particular of our Kings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doth not ascribe to such Sovereigns the <hi>Whole</hi> Legislative Power. The word <hi>Whole</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Mr. <hi>I.</hi> who could not otherwise have found any thing to cavil at.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In those words which respect an <hi>English</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, he ascribes no more to him, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a principal Efficient, <hi>viz.</hi> to give our Laws their last form, to give <hi>life and soul</hi> to Bills <hi>prepared by others.</hi> And who dares deny that the Royal Assent gives those Bills which pass both Houses, the <hi>Name, Essence,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of Laws, and that they are,<note place="margin">P. 202.</note> as <hi>Iovian</hi> speaks, but a <hi>dead Letter</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. How honestly Mr. <hi>I.</hi> calls this giving the Sovereign the whole Legislative Power, I need not observe for you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:63313:60"/>
               <hi>P.</hi> 171. Mr. <hi>I.</hi> will needs have <hi>Iovian</hi> to have founded his distinction of <hi>Imperial,</hi> and <hi>Political Laws,</hi> upon a perverted passage of <hi>Fortescue,</hi> who distinguisheth Dominion into Imperial, and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and mixt of both. But if he would have pleas'd to consider the Book, he pretends to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, he might easily have observ'd it, that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary fram'd that distinction upon quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, and useth the Terms in a sense, far different. For as our most eminent Lawyers, and the Laws themselves call this Realm an Empire, and the Crown an Imperial Crown, and the King an <hi>Imperial</hi> Sovereign,<note place="margin">See them cited by <hi>Iov.</hi> p. 208, &amp; 209.</note> that is as Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgman,</hi> and Mr. Dean, both expound the Term, a <hi>Free Independent, and Vnconditional</hi> Sovereign: so the Laws which secure the Rights of the Sovereign are aptly by him call'd <hi>Imperial Laws.</hi> And Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> cited in <hi>Iovian,</hi> useth the Term, tho' not precisely in this sense, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify those Laws of the Realm which secure the Royal Prerogative against the Usurpations of the Pope.</p>
            <p>But neither Mr. Dean, nor Sir <hi>O. Bridgman</hi> ever intended hereby to give the King <hi>Imperial Power,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Absolute, and Arbitrary Power, but both declare the contrary. I will cite the words of the latter.
<q>It is one thing to have an Imperial Crown, and another to govern absolutely. What is an <hi>Imperial Crown?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Trial Regis</hi> in 4 to. p. 11, 12.</note> It is that which as to the coercive part is subject to no man under God. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> hath a Crown, but what is it? At his Coronation <hi>it is conditioned</hi> with the People, That if he shall

not govern them according to such Rules, they shall be freed from their Homage and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; But the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was, an <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> and so sworn — not subject to any Humane Tribunal, or Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature whatsoever. God forbid I should intend any Absolute Government by this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner Mr. Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> making all such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> not to be <hi>Proper, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and Imperial Soveraigns,</hi> tells you what he means by an <hi>Imperial Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iov.</hi> p. 209.</note> viz
<q>One who is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream in his Dominions, next under God, who hath full, perfect, and entire Jurisdiction from God alone, and all others in his Dominions, by Emanation from him.</q>
But though he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts the Kings of this Realm to be true, proper, and Imperial Soveraigns, yet he is as far as Mr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>I.</hi> from asserting an Arbitrary, and boundless Power in them. For he at the same time declareth, that to be <hi>Arbitrary is no way of the Essence of an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Soveraign,</hi> and though after Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> he cites the Titles of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> it is not to prove, that the Saxon Kings were Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and Absolute; but to shew, that they were Compleat, Unconditional, and Independent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns, the Natural Consequence of which is, that they are unaccountable, free from Coercion, of force, and not to be resisted.</p>
            <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>I.</hi> needed not to have taken all that pains he hath done, <hi>p.</hi> 183. to prove it Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to say, that <hi>Boundless Power</hi> may be limited in the Exercise. His Adversary saith nothing like it. But only asserts, that a King under the Direction of Laws, may nevertheless be a proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:63313:61"/>
Compleat, and Imperial Soveraign. And his Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration of the matter, by the similitude of a Fountain, is clear and apposite, and what no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>body but Mr. <hi>I.</hi> will deride. The Essence of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power is not destroyed or changed by this limitation it receives from Concessions, and Civil Contracts, though the extent of it may be somewhat lessened. It is still Supream, Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, and Independent, and the Prince who enjoys it, though he be bound in Conscience to govern according to such Laws, and Compacts, yet may not be call'd to an account, or punish'd by any (save God his only Superiour) for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those Laws, and transgressing the Legal Bounds of his Power.</p>
            <p>His Answer to Mr. Dean's other Illustration of the Point, <hi>viz. That being confin'd in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, doth not destroy the Perfection of Soveraign Power, because then the</hi> Power <hi>of God himself could not be Soveraign,</hi> &amp;c. is not at all satisfactory. I confess what he saith would be pertinent, and considerable, if God were confin'd only from such things as are evil in themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inconsistent with the Perfection of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. But we all know, that the free Counsels of his own Will, have set such bounds to the Exercise of his Almighty Power, as render many things neither impossible in themselves, nor yet repugnant, either to the Wisdom, Holiness, or Goodness of God, impossible for him to do. For Example, No Man will presume to deny, That God, if he had so pleas'd, might have left faln Man to have perished without a Saviour, and that without the least impeachment of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Justice, or Goodness. And yet God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63313:61"/>
determined, and declared, that he will save all that believe in Jesus Christ, it is impossible for him to suffer all Mankind to perish. If Mr. <hi>I.</hi> please to consult the old Schoolman, whom <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescue</hi> cites as the Authour <hi>de Regimine Principum,</hi>

            <p>The twelfth Chapter of <hi>Iovian,</hi> wherein the Authour shews, what security Subjects have of their Lives, Properties, and Religion, under a Popish Prince, notwithstanding the Doctrine of Non-Resistance, is a rational, grave and pious Discourse, and deserves to be consider'd after

            <p>It is certain, that an <hi>Absolute Security</hi> against Rebellion on the one hand, or against Arbitrary Government, and Oppression on the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince nor People must expect. For this cannot be had, till either the People be so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually inslav'd, as to render them as little able to serve, and assist their Prince, as they are to disturb and dethrone him; or till the Prince hath so little Power left him, that he will be equally unable, either to protect, or oppress his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And in such a state, both King and People will be in a most desperate condition. So that whether the one or other compass their ends for the present, and obtain that absolute security which they affected, they will enjoy it but a little while; for both will inevitably hereby become the Subjects of Foreign Tyranny and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>A Moral security therefore must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erve the turn, and both Prince and People must acquiesce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and trust each other with such a measure of Power, as if abused, may be of very ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But vain and unreasonable Fears on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, must not be regarded, or provided against. If what he saith be not satisfactory to some of Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s Friends, we are the less to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seeing some of them profess to think, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63313:62"/>
God hath not given so satisfactory an assurance of his own Being, and Providence, and of the Truth and Authority of the Holy Scriptures, of the last Judgment, and a future State of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as they expect.</p>
            <p>All Men confess, that the measures of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, who during the last Reign, had too great an Influence on Publick Affairs, are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable. And the Credit that Order had with King <hi>Iames,</hi> carried him to Undertakings as contrary to his own Interest, as to those of the Nation, and by consequence a Regard to his own Honour and Safety, did not prove so effectual a Restraint from Arbitrary Proceedings, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Iovian</hi> hoped, and all wise Men reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expected. Yet Experience hath however confirm'd the Opinion of <hi>Iovian,</hi> and in <hi>violent Vndertakings,</hi> far short of the Cruelty of Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, <hi>all good men did withdraw from the service</hi> of that Unfortunate Prince, and many <hi>bad men durst not serve him.</hi> As for those few who did, they are likely to suffer exemplary Punishment according to their Demerit.</p>
            <p>I am now come to see how justly Mr. <hi>I.</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Adversary with raising Cavils against mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, <hi>pag.</hi> 157. and 201.</p>
            <p>He begins with Mr. Dean's Discourse about <hi>Iuventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> which he makes to be a <hi>whole Heap</hi> of Falsifications. Perhaps the Falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation lies in not mentioning the precise words in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> refers, <hi>Thou hast deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us to an Vnrighteous King, and such an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state as is not again upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ace of the Earth.</hi> Now who knew them till Mr. <hi>I.</hi> in this Answer vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to tell what the words were? In his first
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63313:63"/>
Book he cited no words, and refers to St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>'s Homily on their Anniversary; is it a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sification that <hi>Iovian</hi> doth not insert this passage of <hi>Theodoret</hi> into their Speech, as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> relates it? This were very hard. Mr. Dean had no Interest to conceal their words, nor do I see any great advantage Mr. <hi>I.</hi> can make of them. Do they prove that <hi>Iuventinus,</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> would have been for a Bill of <hi>Exclusion,</hi> had they liv'd in our days? Or that they would have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in defence of their Religion? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them which founds that way.

Now, what Mr. <hi>I.</hi> replies, is a shameful childish Cavil, which any School Boy who had once read <hi>Butler</hi>'s Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, is able to see thro', and would deride. He would easily comprehend the true sense of so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Figure, and understand that <hi>Iovian</hi> never intended to muster them for a compleat Legion, or represent them as a force able to have beaten <hi>Iulian</hi>'s whole Army, but only to shew that they had the same Passive Braver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Legion,</hi> the same Zeal for Christ, and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to lay down their Lives for his Religion, had the <hi>Apostate</hi> put them to it, and tho' they had been a <hi>full</hi> Legion, nay, <hi>eleven</hi> Legions to <hi>one,</hi> they would have died like them, with their Swords in their Scabbards, and not have drawn them in defence of their lives against this Lawless, Apostate Persecutor. Thus the fallacy lies at Mr <hi>I</hi>'s own door.</p>
            <p>His next quarrel with <hi>Iovian</hi> is, for <hi>shuffling</hi> with the Stories of <hi>Maris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 203.</note> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of <hi>Beraea,</hi> and <hi>Publica.</hi> By Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, a direct Answer is not <hi>shuffling,</hi> and such an Answer he hath received. <hi>Mr. Dean</hi> tells him, that these Stories are impertinently alledged, and will not make out his <hi>Hypothesis</hi>:
<q>That <hi>Iulian</hi> was worse used than former Pagan Emperours, because he persecuted contrary to Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Authour of <hi>Iovian</hi> sheweth that there was nothing singular in these stories; that elder times had many Instances, some of which he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntions, wherein the Martyrs and Confessors used no less Heroick <hi>Freedom of speech</hi> before other Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Magistrates. As for <hi>Maris,</hi> he adds, that if there be any thing singular in his case, it ought not to be drawn into example, because he was an ill Man, a persecuting <hi>Arrian</hi> Zealot, which he hath proved by unanswerable Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> replies not one word; but slides away, leaving behind him an uncharitable Surmise; for it was no more when he wrote it, but it is now improved into an impudent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Slander, by the Publication, after that his Learned Adversary hath given so many and ample
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63313:64"/>
Proofs of a <hi>sincere Zeal</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> not a jot less <hi>fervent,</hi> and abundantly more Regular and Useful than his own</p>
            <p>His Reflection on what is said touching the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochian</hi> Psalms, is a mixture of Scurrility and Prophaneness dressed to the gust of his Admirers. I am sure Men of Sence and Sobriety will think never the better of him for his <hi>rude Sarcasm,</hi> nor the worse of <hi>Iovian</hi> for expounding that passage of the Palmist <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 97. 7.</note> in a milder sence than he likes. Mr. D. followed good Versions and Authours herein. Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> had paraphrased it thus, <hi>Which may well make them all ashamed</hi> (and they shall be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him if they will not renounce their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours) <hi>who worship graven Images.</hi> Certainly the Phrase hath a milder acceptation than <hi>breaking of bones,</hi> in many places of the Psalms, as in <hi>Ps.</hi> 83. 16. <hi>Fill their Faces with shame</hi> that they may <hi>seek thy Name,</hi> O Lord; otherwise that Learned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor is frequently mistaken, particularly on <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 71. which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath expounded in Burlesque to abuse his Adversary.</p>
            <p>Be it as it will, I am sure that Man acts more like a good Christian and Casuist, who makes the best of the doubtful Actions of the Primitive Christians, than he who represents them in the worst Colours, and at the same time proposeth them for Patterns.</p>
            <p>In the same page Mr. <hi>I.</hi> complains that he is not permitted to call the joint Prayers of <hi>Gregory</hi> and his Church of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> their Prayers; and that the Practice of the purest Church of that Age, must not pass for the practice of the Church. But the Question still remains unanswered. What is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63313:64"/>
the Practice of <hi>Old Gregory</hi> and his Church to all the Churches of the Empire?</p>
            <p>If Mr. Dean were too severe when he charged Mr. <hi>I.</hi> with <hi>willfull Blindness</hi> for saying that he could not find one single Wish for <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version among the Ancients, the Censure is now become Just, since he refuseth to see one when 'tis shewn him. <hi>Sozomen</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">Sozom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Didymus</hi> upon the Emperour's Apostasie in Religion, being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved both for him [Julian] <hi>who was in a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Error,</hi> and also for the Church's Affliction, fasted, and made supplications to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>on that Account.</hi>
               </q>
Here it is very evident, that <hi>Didy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was grieved and concerned, not only for the Church's Sufferings, but also for <hi>Iulian's Error</hi>; and that he made supplication to God as well for <hi>Iulian</hi> as for the Church. Now what can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he should ask of God, with respect to <hi>Iulian,</hi> for <hi>whose Error he was grieved,</hi> but his Conversion and Return to the True Religion.</p>
            <p>By this it appears that Mr. Dean hath given the true sense of the Greek cited at large in the Margin, he was not bound to give a literal Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation. I wonder Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is not asham'd here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him of <hi>forging</hi> and <hi>foisting in words at pleasure,</hi> as he had charg'd him before with Falsifications; nay, a <hi>whole heap</hi> of them without being able to as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I acknowledge that it was the Historian's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63313:65"/>
in this Chapter to shew that <hi>Iulian</hi>'s destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was from God, for laying waste his Church, and that account of the Prayers of <hi>Didymus</hi> for the Apostate's Conversion, dropt from him on the by; we should never have heard of them, but for the miraculous Revelation of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s <hi>Death.</hi> But this doth not impeach its Truth, nay, it is a fair ground to believe, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the silence of Historians, that many other Christians did the same.</p>
            <p>However, I can by no means grant that the miraculous Answer to his Prayer was a <hi>strong Proof</hi> that <hi>Didymus</hi> prayed for <hi>Iulian</hi>'s destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that his <hi>breaking Fast</hi> upon the News, gives the least support to the conceit.

of <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Residence from his leaving <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> till he left <hi>Antioch</hi> to march against the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> as would prove it scarce possible for <hi>Iulian</hi> to have been in person at <hi>Nazianzum.</hi> We have no account that <hi>Iulian</hi> with all his Zeal against Christianity ever went <hi>in person</hi> to see this Edict put in Execution, and there is no reason to doubt, but if he had done it, <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who omits no circumstance that may aggravate <hi>Iulian</hi>'s Crimes, and the Historians would have recorded it, as an instance of his devilish Spite against Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>In the next page, he tells us, that his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's <hi>Inconsistencies</hi> and <hi>Contradictions, would fill a Book.</hi> If he had such choice, Mr. <hi>I.</hi> was much to blame, that he did not pick out more evident and palpable Instances of it, than those two he produceth. I cannot see that inconsistence in them he pretends.</p>
            <p>The Roman Empire, he saith, was Elective. Well! What then? <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> left no Sons,<note place="margin">Yet <hi>p.</hi> 9. It was decreed by the Senate to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and the Sons of his Body.</note> but died, and the Monarchy with him. For <hi>Octavius</hi> did not take the Empire upon him till long after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, he did not as an Adopted Son, claim it by Hereditary Right in Vertue of that Decree, which no Author but <hi>Dio</hi> ever mentions. And this Decree, if ever it had the force of a Law, was abrogated by contrary Usage, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put in Execution, or so much as once menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the long Succession of Emperors down to <hi>Iulian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Instance hath as little of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:63313:67"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iovian,</hi> p. 222. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns this Principle as Atheistical and Illegal here in <hi>England.</hi> That all Power is radically in the People, and that the King is <hi>their Minister,</hi> and not <hi>God's.</hi>
               </note>Yet <hi>pag.</hi> 240. he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, That in <hi>SPARTA</hi> the King had not the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power,</hi> which was <hi>Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> and <hi>Originally</hi> in the People. And again, that the Magistrates in <hi>Switzerland</hi> derive their Power <hi>from the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not able to discern the Contradiction he talks of. All Power is not <hi>Radically</hi> in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>i. e.</hi> The People have not the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power in all <hi>Nations.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> they have not, in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> they have it not. But in <hi>Sparta</hi> they had, and in <hi>Switzerland</hi> they have it. Ay, but he calls this principle <hi>Atheistical,</hi> and what is Atheism in one Country is so all the World over: True. But Mr. <hi>I.</hi> now and then, meets with Gentlemen, who so assert All Power to be radically in the People, as to give St. <hi>Paul</hi> the lie, and make Government to be no <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> but a pure <hi>Humane Invention,</hi> and with respect to them <hi>Iovian</hi> calls this Principle <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> as may appear by the latter Assertion added to explain the former, that the <hi>King</hi> is their [<hi>viz.</hi> the People's] Minister, and not GOD's. This Mr. <hi>I.</hi> fraudulently omitted. These are notoriously the sentiments of most of our <hi>English</hi> Republicans, and they are Atheistical every where as well in Popular Governments as in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies. And it would be no less Atheistical to assert that All Power is radically and originally in the King, so as to exclude its derivation from God.</p>

               </gap> doth not infer that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power is <hi>no where</hi> in the People. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Mr. Dean's two propositions set at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance by Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is neither <hi>contradictory,</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> but what the <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>Sub-contrary</hi> concerning which every Freshman hath learnt this Rule, that such propositions are consistent, and may be both true together. But Mr. <hi>I.</hi> is a happy man, he hath so candid Readers that they will overlook the greatest mistakes in Logick, History, Law, or any thing else, that he can either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or wilfully commit.</p>
            <p>The King's recommendation of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> doth not make the Authour <hi>infallible,</hi> nor yet imply his Majesties Assent to every Proposition in that Excellent Work. I am sure the passage he cites could never obtain his Majestie's Approbation.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Christ. Directory,</hi> part 4. pag. 10, 11.</note> And Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who cannot be supposed to have any design to advance Arbitrary Government, hath at large solidly confuted Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s notion. Though when All's done, what Mr. <hi>I.</hi> cites out of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> is nothing like the Propositions condemn'd in <hi>Iovian.</hi> He doth not make the King the People's Minister, nor doth he allow them to resume the Power, which by mistake he supposeth to have been once deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from them, or any way else favour the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Resistance.</p>
            <p>The last matter of Fact is, <hi>Simson</hi>'s <hi>Case,</hi> who killed the Pursuivant. Mr. Dean accuseth Mr. <hi>I.</hi> with the fraudulent concealing, that according to <hi>Brownlow</hi> it was found Homicide, or Man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and Mr. <hi>I.</hi> with most wonderful scorn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, <hi>That</hi> Brownlow's <hi>Reports were writ for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63313:68"/>
those? who understood the word</hi> Homicide, <hi>which among, other things is Chance Medley,</hi> or <hi>se defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo.</hi> I confess the word Homicide, as a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon genus</hi> includes them, and so it doth Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also, yet by Mr. <hi>I</hi>'s leave in <hi>Verdicts,</hi> and (where Jurors doubt) in the <hi>Opinions</hi> of Judges, it must have a more strict Notion, and imports Man-slaughter in the Law-sense, <hi>as it's oppos'd</hi> to all other kinds of <hi>Homicide.</hi> So that this scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is an unjust as well as a rude Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
            <p>But sure Mr. <hi>I.</hi> made this Answer without ever looking into <hi>Brownlow,</hi> who doth not use the word <hi>Homicide,</hi> but saith it was found <hi>Man-slaughter.</hi> Homicide in <hi>Iovian</hi> was added as a sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Term, by <hi>Mr. Dean,</hi> on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Iudge Crook,</hi> cited in the Margin. So that Mr. <hi>I.</hi> hath no reason to insult, or yet to enter a Caveat against the forfeiture of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, by another Man's ignorance; I very much fear that it is already forfeited, and for faults not so pardonable as Ignorance.</p>
            <p>I find that the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in that report to which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> refers in this Answer, saith it was found <hi>se defendendo,</hi> and I shall not take upon me to Umpire the matter between him and <hi>Brownlow.</hi> Nor do I think it necessary to Apologize for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>'s Ignorance of this Report, it being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect that a Divine should be able to Cap Cases with the <hi>whole Post</hi> of Republican Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</p>
            <p>But admitting Lord <hi>Coke</hi> to be in the Right, <hi>Mr. Dean</hi> put a close Question, which Mr. <hi>I.</hi> evades like a Jesuit, instead of answering. 'Tis <hi>whether he would make the Law the adaequate rule of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63313:68"/>
his Actions?</hi> The plain meaning of this Question is, Whether a Man may with a good Conscience take the utmost liberties of self-defence, which are out of the reach of the Law? Instead of an Honest, and Categorical Answer he cites a Case out of Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> quite of a different nature, and insinuates, that the Law gives a Man less li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of self-defence, than he may honestly use. Now, Sir, he is a very mean Casuist, who knows not that a Man may not with a safe Conscience do many things which will not bring his Neck into danger, and that <hi>Tyburn</hi> is not the only way to Hell.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you how great a Stranger I am to the Law-Books, but my desire to serve you in the only thing wherein you could need my help (the Examining of Citations in Books you could not consult in the Country) oblig'd me to look into Judge <hi>Crook</hi>'s Reports, where I found a Case by accident much to the purpose of <hi>Mr. Dean</hi>'s Question.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sir <hi>H. Ferrers</hi> Baronet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Crook</hi>'s Rep. Part 3. p. 372.</note> being Arrested, some in his own Company kill'd a Bailiff, and Sir <hi>H.</hi> was brought to a Tryal. He pleaded that the Bailiff had no Authority to Arrest him, because the Warrant was by the name of Sir <hi>H. F. Knight,</hi> and he was never Knighted. It was held, by all the Court, that it was a variance in an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of Name, and they had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to arrest Sir <hi>H. F.</hi> Baronet. So it was an ill Warrant, and the Killing an Officer in the Execution of it, could not be Murder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Would Mr. <hi>I.</hi> take or approve taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a <hi>Misnomer,</hi> to kill a Bailiff, and escape? If
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63313:69"/>
he durst take such a Liberty of Self-defence, he hath not that tender regard to Mens Lives which he professeth; and if he durst not, I wonder for what reason he cites <hi>Simson</hi>'s Case. Such Ghostly Fathers as he, are sometimes out in their Law, and encourage Men to exceed the Legal bounds of Self-Defence, and so cheat Men out of their Lives as well as their Salvation. But if they are not, you know, Sir, as well as I, that those are none of the honestest, or safest Spiritual Guides, who teach Men how near to sin they may adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without danger, and having remov'd all rubs out of the way, send Men to Hell with a <hi>quiet Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, my readiness to oblige you hath put me under a necessity of having too much to do with a Casuist, of whom I now most joyfully take leave; and after the performance of so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a task, in obedience to your Commands, I am sure you can have no reason to doubt that I am,</p>
