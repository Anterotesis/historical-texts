            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The Approach of Bleeding <hi>Britain</hi>'s Destiny?</l>
               <l>That Glorious Land which Justly did Preside,</l>
               <l>For Wit and Wealth, o'r all the World beside?</l>
               <l>In vain Victorious <hi>NASSAV</hi> did Advance</l>
               <l>His Conquering Arms against the Power of <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Since from those Conquests he is hardly come,</l>
               <l>But here's a Civil War broke out at Home:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Britannia</hi>'s Warlike Sons disturb the Isle,</l>
               <l>Delighting one another to Dispoil,</l>
               <l>Enur'd to Discord, Envy, and Debate,</l>
               <l>Hereditary Frenzies of the State.</l>
               <l>The Fruits of Ten Years War they now prevent,</l>
               <l>By Civil Feuds, and Private Discontent.</l>
               <l>The Peace We Gain'd! Does it so Cheap appear,</l>
               <l>To Prize so Low, what We have bought so Dear?</l>
               <l>The Blood, the Treasure, which has been Destroy'd!</l>
               <l>Methinks We shou'd with War and Wounds be Cloy'd,</l>
               <l>But 'twill not be, We cannot hope to find</l>
               <l>That in the Birth which is not in the Kind:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> are Natives of our Soil,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Freeholders born,</hi> and have Possess'd the Isle</l>
               <l>Long before <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> Landed here,</l>
               <l>Or <hi>Picts,</hi> or <hi>Painted Brittons</hi> did appear,</l>
               <l>A stubborn People, Barbarous and Rude;</l>
               <l>Who, like the <hi>Kentish Men,</hi> were ne'r Subdu'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Fierce <hi>English Men,</hi> in Blood and Wounds delight,</l>
               <l>For want of Wars, with one another fight:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54803:3"/>Nothing's so dangerous to them as Peace,</l>
               <l>To feed the Flame, and nourish the Disease;</l>
               <l>No Laws can this Contentious humour Curb,</l>
               <l>Their Charter's such, they will themselves Disturb.</l>
               <l>O <hi>Iulian, Iulian,</hi> who begun the Cry</l>
               <l>Against our Safety, for our Liberty,</l>
               <l>Who wou'd no Mercenary Troops allow,</l>
               <l>Wou'd you Disband our Standing Army now?</l>
               <l>Behold a Civil War is just at hand,</l>
               <l>I'th' very bowels of your Native Land;</l>
               <l>The strong Contention's grown to such a hight,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Pen's already drawn,</hi> and has begun the fight.</l>
               <l>The Pen's the certain Herald of a War,</l>
               <l>And Points it out like any Blazing Star:</l>
               <l>Men Quarrel first, and Skirmish with ill Words,</l>
               <l>And when they're heated then they draw their Swords;</l>
               <l>As little Bawling Curs begin to Bark,</l>
               <l>And bring the Mastive on you in the Dark.</l>
               <l>We had some Jealousies of this last Year,</l>
               <l>Both sides rais'd Forces, both in Arms appear;</l>
               <l>But some Sage Doctors did them both Advise,</l>
               <l>To make it up without Hostilities:</l>
               <l>But the deep Quarrel's now of such a Nature,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Magna Charta</hi> fights with <hi>Alma Mater</hi>;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Doctors fight,</hi> and who shall heal the Matter?</l>
               <l>The Dreadful Armies are Drawn out to fight,</l>
               <l>Encamp'd at large in one anothers fight;</l>
               <l>Their Standards are the <hi>Red Rose</hi> and the <hi>White.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nothing but dire Destruction does Impend,</l>
               <l>And who knows where the fatal Strife will end?</l>
               <l>The Men of Sense against the Men of Wit,</l>
               <l>Eternal fighting must determine it.</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Nokor</hi> does the Men of Sense Command,</l>
               <l>Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> Trailes a Pike at his Right Hand;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54803:3"/>Heroic <hi>Nokor</hi> made the first Attack,</l>
               <l>And threw <hi>Drammatick Wit</hi> upon its Back;</l>
               <l>Sixteen Battalions of <hi>Old Brittons</hi> stand,</l>
               <l>Enrich'd with Conquest from the <hi>Neustrian Strand,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Ready to Charge when he the Signal makes;</l>
               <l>And thus the Bloody Combat undertakes.</l>
               <l>His Sence was good, but see what Fate Decrees!</l>
               <l>His hasty Talent threw him on his Knees,</l>
               <l>A Storm of Words the Hero overtook,</l>
               <l>Disorder'd all his Lines, and all his Squadrons broke.</l>
               <l>The adverse Troops pour'd in their <hi>Light Dragoons,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Charg'd him with <hi>Forty thousand Arm'd Lampoons</hi>;</l>
               <l>The Shock surpriz'd him into a Retreat,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Wits Gazette</hi> Proclaim'd a huge Defeat;</l>
               <l>Printed a List of Wounded and of Slain,</l>
               <l>And bragg'd he ne'r cou'd Rally up again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But <hi>Nokor,</hi> like a Prudent General,</l>
               <l>Resum'd new Courage from a seeming Foil,</l>
               <l>The same Campagne again in Arms appear'd,</l>
               <l>And what the <hi>Prince</hi> had lost, the <hi>King</hi> repair'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> Knighted him upon the spot,</l>
               <l>With other Royal Bounties I've forgot.</l>
               <l>The Wits Commanders tho' they did retreat,</l>
               <l>Will not allow it to be a Defeat;</l>
               <l>Their Troops, they say, soon made a stand again,</l>
               <l>Besides they lost but Thirteen thousand Men.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>C—r</hi> came next in order to the Charge,</l>
               <l>His Squadrons thin, altho' his Front was large,</l>
               <l>A modest Soldier, resolute and stout,</l>
               <l>Arm'd with a Coat of Sense from head to foot;</l>
               <l>No more than need, for he was hard put to't.</l>
               <l>He Charg'd the strongest Troops of all the Foes,</l>
               <l>And gave them several signal Overthrows,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54803:4"/>But over-power'd by multitudes of Wits,</l>
               <l>By Number, not by Force oppress'd, retreats;</l>
               <l>So Sense, to Noise and Nonsence, oft submits.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>C—r</hi>'s a calm and steady Combatant,</l>
               <l>And push'd the forward Troops with brave Intent,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Modest,</hi> a Fault not known among his Tribe,</l>
               <l>And honest too, too honest for a Bribe:</l>
               <l>The Wits wou'd fain ha' bought his fury off,</l>
               <l>And proffer'd him <hi>Applause,</hi> and Gold enough,</l>
               <l>But 'twou'd not do, he boldly Charg'd again,</l>
               <l>And by Ten thousand Wounds at last was slain.</l>
               <l>Some say he was by his own Men betray'd,</l>
               <l>And basely left alive among the Dead,</l>
               <l>But I cannot understand how that can be,</l>
               <l>For how can Treachery and Sense agree?</l>
               <l>In <hi>Honours Truckle-Bed</hi> the Hero lies,</l>
               <l>Till Sense again, <hi>the Lord knows when,</hi> shall rise.</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>M—n,</hi> a Renegade from Wit, came on</l>
               <l>And made a false Attack, and next to none;</l>
               <l>The Hypocrite, in Sense, could not conceal</l>
               <l>What Pride, and want of Brains, oblig'd him to reveal.</l>
               <l>In him the Critick's ruin'd by the Poet,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Virgil</hi> gives his Testimony to it;</l>
               <l>The Troops of Wit were so enrag'd to see,</l>

               <l>They sent a Party out, by Silence led,</l>
               <l>And without Answer shot the <hi>Turn-Coat</hi> Dead.</l>
