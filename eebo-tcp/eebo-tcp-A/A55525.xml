            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And the simplicity of their Conduct may be sufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd, as from several other Instances, so by those especially, where an
<hi>Achilles,</hi> an <hi>Hector,</hi> or an <hi>Ajax</hi> are introduc'd opposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to vast Numbers, and by the force of their own Valour put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to flight whole Squadrons of their Enemies. Nor is the Poet to be thought blame-worthy, or to have transgress'd the rules of probability in such Relations; which, tho' perhaps strange and incredible in our Days, were no doubt accommodated to the manners of the Times, of which he wrote. For even in the Sacred Story we find it recorded, that a single <hi>Goliath</hi> defy'd all the Armies of <hi>Israel</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">I <hi>Sam.</hi> XVII. 11, 14.</note>, and with a big look, and a few ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant Words, put so great terrour into them, that they fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this, in the revolution of a few Ages, <hi>Greece</hi> became the celebrated Mother of the bravest, and most experienc'd Souldiers in the World: For being canton'd into a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of little independent States, all which, tho' bordering upon one another, were govern'd by different Laws, and prosecuted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Interests, it became the Seat of continual Wars; every Hamlet being ambitious of enlarging it's Territory, by encroaching upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32839:6"/>
it's neighbour-village, and contending for the addition of a few Lands with no less heat and fury, than if whole Kingdoms had been the Prize: The consequence whereof was, that the <hi>Grecians,</hi> being from their childhood inur'd to Martial Affairs, and having to their native Bravery added long and constant Experience, were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as well in good Order and Discipline, as true Courage and Valour, superiour to most other Nations. They became a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to all the Countries round about them, and with small Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers often put to flight vast multitudes of the <hi>Barbarians</hi>: The <hi>Persians</hi> frequently experienc'd the sad effects of it in the loss of numerous Armies, and at length of the greatest Empire in the World. And (to enumerate no more Instances in a thing so well known) the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> tho' Men of great Courage, and excellently skill'd in the Art of War, being worsted in <hi>Sicily</hi> by <hi>Timoleon</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> in several Encounters, and by unequal numbers of Men, were driven into an admiration of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Valour; and forc'd to confess, that they were the most pugnacious and insupportable of Mankind; and forthwith made it their business to entertain as many of them as they could procure, in their Service <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>But tho' almost all the <hi>Grecians</hi> had their share in Military Glory, yet were the rest far inferiour to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who by the Laws of their Country were under an obligation to make War their Profession; they never apply'd themselves to any Art, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or the exercise of Trade, which they accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Generous and Free-born Souls; but, committing all such cares to the <hi>Helots,</hi> who were a gentiler sort of Slaves, spent their Time in manly Exercises, to render their Bodies strong and active. They were also accustom'd by hard Diet, by Stripes, and other severities, patiently to undergo any hardships, to endure Wounds, to encounter any Dangers, and, if the Honour of their Country so requir'd, to throw themselves into the Arms of Death without Fear, or Regret. Yet were they not so imprudent or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy, as to court Dangers, or Death; but were taught from their childhood to be always prepar'd either to live, or die, and equally willing to do either; as appears from those Verses, cited by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>

Nor was this Indifferency to Life or Death only discours'd of amongst them, as a point of meer Speculation; but carefully and seriously instill'd into their tender Years, and always embrac'd as one of the first Principles of their Actions; which begot in them such an undaunted Courage, and so firm and unmoveable a Resolution, that scarce any thing compos'd of Flesh and Blood was able to stand before them. This extraordinary and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd Bravery, being adorn'd and strengthen'd with the wisest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the most perfect Skill in all the Stratagems of War those Times were capable of, has render'd them famous in Story, and examples of Military Vertue to all succeeding Ages: <q>For (these are <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     </note> words) the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were most expert and cunning in the Art of War, being train'd up and accustom'd to nothing more than to keep themselves, from Confusion, when their Order should be broken; to follow any Leader or Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handman, so rallying themselves into Order; and to sight on what part soever Dangers press.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore by no mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be wonder'd, that foreign and vastly remote Nations should be desirous to entertain the <hi>Laceac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> into their Service; that <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Younger should think That the readiest and most effectual Method to advance himself to the Empire of <hi>Persia</hi>: That <hi>Crasus,</hi> the wealthy King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and several of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monarchs, tho' surrounded with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Forces of their own, should never esteem themselves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure without assistance from <hi>Sparta</hi>; or that the <hi>Sicilians, Thracians, Carthaginians,</hi> with the <hi>Cyrenaeans,</hi> and many others, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to it for Protection, and Deliverance from powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And for the <hi>Grecians</hi> themselves, whenever any of their little States were in danger of being swallow'd up by their more powerful Neighbours, we find them having Recourse for Aid to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who were a common Refuge to the oppress'd, and restrain'd the Ambitious Invaders of other Men's Rights.</p>
               <p>Hence likewise it came to pass, that in all Confederacies they were look'd on as the principal Associates; and in all Wars carry'd on by publick Contributions, they challeng'd the chief Command as their right and peculiar. Nor could any Exigency prevail with them to depart from that Claim, or resign it to the greatest of Princes: <hi>Gelon,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> tho' promising to furnish them with large Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> on condition he might be declar'd Captain-general of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Forces, was rejected <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Herodotus</hi> lib. VII.</note>. Yet we find, that after the Victory over <hi>Mardonius</hi> at <hi>Plataeae, Pausanias</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> General, having by his excessive Severity, and Tyrannical Behaviour to the rest of the Souldiers render'd the <hi>Spartans</hi> very odious, in the end they revolted to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>

the gentle and courteous Carriage of whose Commanders, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> and <hi>Cimon,</hi> had endear'd them to all the rest of the <hi>Grecians</hi>: And here the Magnanimity of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was wonderful; For when they perceiv'd that their Generals were corrupted, and their Minds too much elevated and puffed up by the greatness of their Authority, they left off sending any more of them to the Wars, choosing rather to have Citizens of Moderation, and that persever'd in their ancient Manners and Customs, than to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Superiority of all <hi>Greece</hi>

                  </note>. But this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did not put an end to the <hi>Lacedomonian</hi> Greatness; for we find them in a little time re-assuming their ancient Spirits, and disdaining even <hi>Alexander</hi> himself (tho' submitted to by the rest of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and declar'd their General against (<hi>Persia</hi>) for their Superiour: Which is the reason, that in the Monuments erected after the <hi>Persian</hi> Victories, and bearing the Names of <hi>Alexander</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were excepted by Name, as having no share in that Honour <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> alone were able to dispute with the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> this Prerogative; some few times excepted, when some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Success rais'd any of the other States beyond their ordinary Grandeur; as it happen'd to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who, from a mean and despicable People, were by the Conduct of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi> advanc'd to an Equality, is not a Superiority over the most flourishing Cities of <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>Notwithstanding these, and some other Obstacles, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> for the most part made good their Pretensions, and, in most Wars carry'd on by a Confederacy, were Generals of all the Land-forces; but were at length constrain'd to leave the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Seas to the <hi>Athenians</hi>; who having laid out their whole Strength in sitting out a Navy against <hi>Xer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The younger Men in both Cities, with those, who by reason of their Age were discharg'd from Military Service, were left at home to defend their Habitations.</p>
               <p>Some Persons were excus'd by reason of their Age; for having spent their Youth and Strength in serving their Country, it was but reasonable to discharge them from farther Service, that they might end their Days in Peace.

Thus they despis'd the poor <hi>Carians</hi> for introducing a Custom, which in a few Ages after was so far from being look'd upon as unworthy their Birth, or Education, that we find it practis'd by the whole Nation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who not only receiv'd Pay for serving their own Common-wealths, but listed themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foreign Kings, and fought their Battles for Hire; their chief Magistrates not disdaining to accompany them in such Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>The first that introduc'd the Custom of paying Souldiers at <hi>Athens</hi> was <hi>Pericles,</hi> who, to ingratiate himself with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, represented how unreasonable it was, that Men of small Estates; and scarce able to provide for their Families, should be oblig'd to neglect their Business, and spend what their Industry had laid up, in the publick Service, and thereupon preferr'd a Decree that all of them should have Subsistence money out of the Exchequer <note n="(e)" place="bottom">

               <p>The ordinary Method of raising this Money, was by imposing a Tax on the whole Common-wealth, whereby all Persons were oblig'd to contribute according to the value of their Estates. But this was done only, when the publick Treasury was exhausted, and the constant Revenues from Tributary Cities, publick Lands, Woods, Mines, or from Fines and Amercements were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to desray the charges of the War. In cases of greater Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the Richer Citizens at <hi>Athens</hi> were oblig'd to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Contributions, and there appears to have been a generous and laudable Emulation amongst the Men of Quality in that City, who voluntarily offer'd more than was requir'd of them, and contended which of them should most largely contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Honour and Preservation of their Native Country.</p>
               <p>Confederate Wars were maintain'd at the common Charge of all the Allies, every one of whom was oblig'd to send forth a proportion of Men; as we find practis'd in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, which was the first, wherein the whole Country of <hi>Greece</hi> united against a foreign Enemy. Sometimes they were carry'd on by publick Contributions of Money, levy'd by Persons delegated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of the Confederates, which was only the Practise of later Ages; the primitive Wars, wherein the Souldiers serv'd at their own Expence, and supply'd their Necessities out of the Spoils of their Enemies, being manag'd with less charge to the Publick. The first Tax, or Tribute of this Nature that we find paid by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was after the Expulsion of <hi>Xerxes</hi> out of <hi>Greece,</hi> when they agree'd to make an Invasion upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, under the conduct of the <hi>Athenians</hi>: For then <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> at the general desire of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> survey'd the whole Country and Revenue, and assess'd all particular Persons Town by Town, according to every Man's ability: Thus he tax'd them four hundred Talents, to which <hi>Pericles</hi> added about a third part more; for we find in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <p>Their manner of declaring War was to send an Herald, who bid the Persons that had injur'd them to prepare for an Invasion, and sometimes in token of Defiance cast a Spear towards them. The <hi>Athenians</hi> frequently let loose a Lamb into their Enemies Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; signifying thereby, that what was then an Habitation for Men, should be laid wast and desolate, and become a Pasture for Sheep <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>This was rarely done without the Advice and Encouragement of the Gods; the Soothsayers, and all sorts of Diviners were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, the Oracles enrich'd with Presents, and no Charge, or Labour spar'd to engage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heaven (so they imagin'd) to their Party: Instances of this kind are almost as common as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of War, which was never undertaken before the Gods had been consulted about the Issue: Nor was the Verdict of a single Deity thought sufficient, for in Wars of great Moment and Consequence, whereon the Safety of their Country and Liberties depended, they had Recourse to the whole Train of prophetical Divinities, soliciting all with earnest Prayers lifted up to Heaven on the Wings of costly Offerings and magnificent Presents, to favour them with wholesom Counsell. A remarkable Example whereof we have in <hi>Craesus</hi> before he declar'd War against the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> when not content with the Answers of his own Gods, and all the celebrated Oracles in <hi>Greece,</hi> in consulting which he had lavishly profus'd vast Quantities of Treasure, he dispatch'd Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors as far as <hi>Libya</hi> loaden with Wealth, to ask Advice of

               <p>When they were resolv'd to begin the War, it was customary to offer Sacrifices and make large Vows to be paid upon the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Enterprize.

               <p>THERE are no Footsteps of any Siege amongst the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Grecians</hi>; their Cities were not fortify'd with Walls, but lay open to all Invaders, and, their Inhabitants once vanquish'd in open Field, became an easy Prey to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore 'tis not to be wonder'd, that the People of those Times enjoy'd no fix'd and settled Habitations, but frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from one Part of the Country to another, being forc'd to quit their Seats, whenever they were coveted by a Power superiour to their own <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

Contrivance to enclose their Houses and Possessions within Walls; this at first was look'd on as a Work so wonderfull, so far above Human Capacity, that the Gods were frequently call'd from their blessed Mansions to undertake it: The Walls of <hi>Troy</hi> (to mention no more) were of Divine Workmanship, and rais'd by no meaner Persons than <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi>: But if Mortals had the Happiness to project, and finish so great a Design; they seldom sail'd of being translated to Heaven, and having their Names enroll'd among those exalted Beings, to whom they were thought to make neat Approaches, whilst on Earth.</p>
               <p>And, since it was their Custom to immortalize the first Authors of every little Contrivance, 'tis no Wonder if they conferr'd the same Honours on those great Benefactours, to whom they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd for the Security and quiet Possession of whatever the rest of their Deities had gratify'd them with.

Not long before, the <hi>Grecians</hi> were perfect Strangers to this Piece of Humanity, for we are told that <hi>Hercules</hi> was the first that ever gave leave to his Enemies to carry off their Dead <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Aelianus</hi> Var. Hist. lib. XII. cap XXVII.</note>; and others report, that the first Treaty made for the recovering and burying the Bodies of the Slain, was that of <hi>Theseus</hi> with the <hi>Thebans</hi> to interr the Heroes that lost their Lives in the <hi>Theban</hi> War <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

                  </note>. In all succeeding Ages, it was look'd on as the greatest Impiety to deny what they thought a Debt to Nature, and was rarely, or never done to lawfull Enemies, except upon extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall Provocations; for it was thought below a generous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and unworthy <hi>Grecians</hi> to vent their Malice, when their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were depriv'd of all Power to defend themselves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> seem to have been carefull to Excess and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in procuring an honourable Interment for the Bodies of their own Souldiers, that had valiantly lost their Lives; insomuch that the ten Admirals, that gain'd that famous Victory over the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the Sea fight at <hi>Arginusae,</hi> were put to death on no other Pretence, but that they were said not to have taken due Care in gathering the Bodies that floated on the Waves; when yet they alleg'd, that they were hinder'd by a Tempest that might have been dangerous to the whole Fleet, had they not provided for their Safety by a timely Retreat <note n="(d)" place="bottom">

<hi>Athenian</hi> General, finding that two of his Men were left by an Oversight, when they carry'd off the Dead, made an Halt, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32839:72"/>
sent an Herald to the Enemy for Leave to carry them off, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by renouncing all Title to the Victory, which belong'd to him before, and loosing the Honour of erecting a <hi>Trophy</hi>; for it was presum'd that he, who ask'd Leave to carry off his Dead, could not be Master of the Field <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

As to the heavenly Bodies, they were observ'd by Sailors upon a two-fold Account, being of use to them in prognosticating the Seasons, and Guides which way to shape their Course.

As to the Direction in their Voyage, the first Practitioners in the Art of Navigation, being unacquainted with the rest of the celestial Motions, steer'd all the Day by the Course of the Sun, at Night betaking themselves to some safe Harbour, or resting on the Shoar, and not daring to adventure to Sea 'till their Guide was risen to discover their Way: That this was their constant Custom may be observ'd from the ancient Descriptions of those Times, whereof I shall only observe this Instance <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

This sort of Combat was not unlike a Siege, where the stronger Party prevailing over their Enemies, enter'd their Vessels by laying Bridges between them, and, having kill'd, or taken Prisoners all they found in Arms, seiz'd and dragg'd away their Ships.</p>
               <p>When a Town was besieg'd by Sea, they us'd to environ it's Walls and Harbour with Ships rang'd in Order from one Side of the Shoar to the other, and so closely joyn'd together by Chains and Bridges on which arm'd Men were plac'd, that without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Order, there could be no Passage from the Town to the Sea; this Leaguer <hi>Diodorus</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For this reason, such as dy'd in foreign Countries, had usually their Ashes brought Home, and interr'd in the Sepulcres of their Ancestors, or, at least, in some Part of their native Country; it being thought that the same Mother, which gave them Life and Birth, was only fit to receive their Remains, and afford them a peacefull Habitation after Death: Whence it is, that all ancient Authors afford us innumerable Instances of Bodies convey'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Command of Oracles, sometimes out of the good Will of their Friends, from foreign Countries to the Sepulcres of their Fathers, and with great Solemnity deposited there: Thus <hi>Theseus</hi> was remov'd from <hi>Scyrus</hi> to <hi>Athens, Orestes</hi> from <hi>Tegea,</hi> and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32839:108"/>
his Son <hi>Tisamenus</hi> from <hi>Helice</hi> to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Aristomenes</hi> (to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more) from <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Messene.</hi> How far this Custom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Souldiers, and by whom it was first introduc'd into <hi>Greece</hi> has been discours'd in the precedent Book.</p>
               <p>Nor was this pious Care limited to Persons of free Condition, but Slaves also had some Share therein; for we find the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Law-giver commanding the Magistrates call'd <hi>Demarchi</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a severe Penalty to solemnize the Funerals not so much of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, whose Friends seldom fail'd of paying the last Honours; but of Slaves, who frequently were destitute of decent Burial <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>But if any Person was backward in paying his dead Friends due Respect, or but sparing in his Expences about their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies and Monuments, the Government look'd upon him as void of Humanity and natural Affection, and thereupon excluded him from bearing any Office of Trust and Honour; for one special Enquiry concerning the Lives and Behaviour of such as appear'd Candidates for the Magistracy at <hi>Athens</hi> was, whether they had taken due care in celebrating the Funerals, and adorning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Relations <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Xenophon</hi> de dictis <hi>Socratis</hi> lib.

               <p>The great Concern they had about Funerals may farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Respect paid to Persons officiating therein: For we find the <hi>Cretan</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, who had the Care of Funerals, to have been reverenc'd equally with their Priests; and when their Laws permitted to steal from others, as was likewise customary at <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> those Men were exempted from the common Calamity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey away any Part of their Goods being look'd on as a kind of Sacrilege <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

               <p>Notwithstanding all this, there were some so unhappy, as by their Actions whilst alive, or the aggravating Circumstances of their Death, to be unworthy of all Title to the common Funeral Rites, and some to any Funeral at all: Such were these that follow;

Some restrain this Practice to Sons, or very near Relations; but it appears by many Instances to have been common to all that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:32839:126"/>
thought themselves oblig'd to express their Respect, or Love to the Dead; insomuch that upon the Death of great Men, whole Cities and Countries were commonly shav'd.</p>
               <p>This Practice may be accounted for two ways; for the <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liast</hi> upon <hi>Sophocles</hi> observes, that it was us'd, partly to render the Ghost of the deceas'd Person propitious, which seems to be the Reason why they threw Hair into the Fire to burn with him, or lay'd it on his Body; partly, that they might appear disfigur'd, and careless of their Beauty; for long Hair was look'd on as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry becoming, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> prided themselves in it, whence they are so frequently honour'd by <hi>Homer</hi> with the Epithet of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>It may be farther observ'd that in solemn and publick Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was common to extend this Practice to their Beasts, that all Things might appear as deform'd and ugly as might be. Thus <hi>Admetus</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Alcestis</hi> commands his Chariot-horses to be shorn <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>It may be objected indeed to what I have been speaking, that Shaving was a Sign of Joy; whereas to let their Hair grow long was the Practice of Persons in Affliction: Hence <hi>Ioseph</hi> is said to have been shav'd, when he was deliver'd out of Prison; and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth,</hi> during the Time King <hi>David</hi> was banish'd from <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> let his Hair grow, but on his Return shav'd himself: Thus likewise Mariners upon their Deliverance from Shipwrack us'd to shave themselves: To which Practice <hi>Iuvenal</hi> hath this Allusion <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Sat XII. v. 82.</note>;

               <p>Wherefore two Things may be observ'd for the solution of this Difficulty:</p>
               <p>First, the manner of being shav'd: For tho' to be shav'd, or trimm'd by Barbers, was a Token of Cheerfulness; yet those that cut off their own Hair, and that in a negligent and careless manner, were look'd on as Mourners: Whence, tho' <hi>Artemidorus</hi> reports, that no Man under the Pressure of Misfortunes was ever shav'd <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib I cap. XXIII.</note>; yet he adds in the same Chapter, that for a Man to dream of shaving him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf was a Prelage of some great Calamity; because Men in such Circumstances were wont to be shav'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the different Fashions of several Nations are to be consider'd: For where it was customary to wear short Hair, there the Length of Hair was a Token of Mourning; but where long Hair was in Fashion, there Mourners shav'd themselves. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Herodotus</hi>

               <p>But the Custom of most of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in later Ages especially, was to bury their Dead out of their Cities, and chiefly by the High-ways: Which seems to be done, either to preserve themselves from the noisom Smells, wherewith Graves might infect their Cities; or to prevent the Danger their Houses were expos'd to, when Funeral Piles were set on Fire: Or, it may be, to fill the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:32839:137"/>
Minds of Travellers with Thoughts of Mortality; or to excite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to encounter any Dangers, rather than permit an Enemy to approach their Walls, and despoil the Monuments, or disturb the Peace of the Dead; Lastly, (to trouble you with no more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions) others think it most probable, that this Custom was first introduc'd by a Fear of contracting Pollution from the Dead, of which I have already treated in a foregoing Chapter.</p>

               <p>Every Family was wont to have their proper Burying-place, to be depriv'd whereof was reputed one of the greatest Calamities that could befall them: Wherefore when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were resolv'd to conquer the <hi>Messenians,</hi> or lose all their Lives in the Attempt, we read that they bound Tickets to their right Arms containing their own and their Father's Names; that, if all should perish in the Battle, and their Bodies be so mangled, as not to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd, those Notes might certify what Family they belong'd to, that so they might be carry'd to the Sepulcres of their Ancestors <note n="(b)" place="bottom">

               <p>It has been a Question, whether the <hi>Cenotaphia</hi> had the same religious Regard, that was paid to Sepulcres where the Remains of the Deceas'd were reposited: For the Resolution hereof it may be observ'd, that such of them, as were only erected for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Dead, were not held so sacred as to call for any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon such as profan'd them; but the rest, wherein Ghosts were thought to reside, seem to have been in the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Sepulcres, the Want whereof they were design'd to supply.</p>

               <p>BEFORE the Company departed from the Sepulcre, they were sometimes entertain'd with a Panegyrick upon the dead Person.

               <p>WHO it was that first introduc'd the Custom of loving Boys into <hi>Greece,</hi> is uncertain: However (to omit the infamous Amours of <hi>Iupiter, Orpheus, Lajus</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and others) we find it generally practis'd by the ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that not only in private, but by the publick Allowance and Encouragement of their Laws: For they thought there could be no means more effectual to excite their Youth to noble Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, nor any greater Security to their Common-wealths, than this generous Passion. This the Invaders of their Liberties so often experienc'd, that it became a receiv'd Maxim in the Politicks of Tyrants, to use all their Endeavours to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First we shall find it to have been so generally practis'd, so highly esteem'd in <hi>Crete,</hi> that such of their well-born and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Youths as never had any Lovers, incurr'd the publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as Persons some way or other faulty in their Morals; as if nothing else could hinder, but that some one's Affections would be plac'd upon them. But those that were more happy in being admir'd, were honour'd with the first Seats at publick Exercises, and wore, for a distinguishing Badge of Honour, a sort of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment richly adorn'd; this they still retain'd after they had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to Man's estate, in memory they had once been <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Strabo</hi> lib. X.</note>, for that was the Name the <hi>Cretans</hi> gave to Youths that had Lovers, the Lovers themselves were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. One Thing was remarkable in this Place, that the Lovers always took their Boys by force; for having plac'd their Affections upon any one, they gave notice of it to his Relations, and withal certify'd them what Day they design'd to take him: If the Lover was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Boy, they refus'd to yield him up; but if his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Virtues were answerable, they made some slight Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to satisfy the Law, and pursu'd him to his Lodgings, but then gave their consent: After this the Lover carry'd the Boy whither he pleas'd, the Persons that were present at the Rape, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him company; he entertain'd him some time, two Months at the farthest, with Hunting, and such Diversions, then return'd him home: At his Departure, 'twas order'd by Law, that the Boy should receive a Suit of Armour, an Ox and a Cup, to which the Lover usually added out of his own Bounty several other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of value. The Boy, being return'd home, sacrific'd the Ox to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> made an Entertainment for those that had accompany'd him in his Flight, and gave an account of the Usage he had from his Lover, for in case he was rudely treated, the Law allow'd him Satisfaction <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Idem.</note>. 'Tis farther affirm'd by <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Tyrian,</hi> that during all the Time of their Converse together, nothing unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing repugnant to the strictest Laws of Virtue pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Dissert. X.</note>; and however some Authors are inclin'd to have hard Thoughts of this Custom, yet the Testimonies of many others, with the high Characters given by the Ancients of the old <hi>Cretan</hi> Constitutions, by which it was approv'd, are sufficient to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it from all false Imputations: The same is put beyond Dispute by what <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Loc. cit.</note>, that 'twas not so much the external Beauty of a Boy, as his virtuous Disposition, his Modesty, and Courage, that recommended him.</p>

Whether this Phancy owe it's Original to the suppos'd Perfection of the Number three, because, containing a Beginning, Middle, and End, it seems natural to signify all Things in the World; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Esteem the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and some other Philosophers had for it, on the account of their <hi>Trinity</hi>; or, lastly (to mention no more Opinions) to it's Aptness to signify the Power of all the Gods, who were divided into three Classes, Celestial, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, and Infernal, I shall leave to be determin'd by others: Thus much is certain, that the Ancients thought there was no small Force and Efficacy in unequal Numbers; whence we find <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> advising, that the Ditches round Encampments should be at the least nine Feet in breadth, at the most seventeen, but always of an unequal Number <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Lib.

               <p>THE first Inhabitants of <hi>Greece</hi> liv'd without Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, no Bounds were prescrib'd to their Passions, their Love (like the test of their Desires) was unconfin'd, and promiscuous Mixtures, because forbidden by no human Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were publickly allow'd. The first that restrain'd this Liberty was <hi>Cecrops,</hi> who, having rais'd himself to be King over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple afterwards call'd <hi>Athenians,</hi> amongst many other usefull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, introduc'd that of Marriage <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Vide Archaelog. hujus lib.

Others refer the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Institution, together with the Invention of Dancing, to <hi>Erato</hi> one of the Muses; but some rather understand that Story of the Marriage-solemnity, the regular Conduct whereof, they say, was first order'd by <hi>Erato.</hi> However that be, it was in some time receiv'd by all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for no sooner did they begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their salvage and barbarous Course of Life, and joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Towns and Societies, but they found it necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the unruly Lusts of Men by establishing lawfull Marriage, with other Rules of good Manners.</p>
               <p>Marriage was very honourable in several of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, being very much encourag'd by their Laws, as tho abstaining from it was discountenanc'd, and in some Places pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd: For the Strength of States consisting in their Number of People, those that refus'd to contribute to their Increase, were thought very cold in their Affections to their Country.

What was the design of this Entertainment we learn from <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who (to pass by the Joy and Mirth it was intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote) tells us, there were two Reasons for it; the first was the Respect due to the Gods of Marriage, who were invok'd before the Feast, and had no small Share in it, and 'tis thought by some that most of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Festivals were first observ'd on this Ground: The second End of this Entertainment was, that the Marriage might be made publick <note n="(c)" place="bottom">

                  </note>, <q>In order to the good Education of their Youth (which is the most important Work of a Law-giver) <hi>Lycurgus</hi> went so far back as to take into consideration their very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Birth, by regulating their Marriages: For <hi>Aristotle</hi> wrongs the Memory of this excellent Person, by bearing us in hand, that, after he had try'd all manner of Ways to reduce the Women to more Modesty, and Subjection to their Husbands, he was at last forc'd to leave them as they were; because that in the Absence of their Husbands, who spent a great Part of their Lives in the Wars, their Wives made themselves absolute Mistresses at home, and would be treated with as much Respect as if they had been so many Queens: But by his good Leave it is a Mistake; for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> took for that Sex all the care that was possible: For an Instance of it, he order'd the Maidens to exercise themselves with Running, Wrestling, throwing Quoits, and casting Darts, to the end that the Fruit they conceiv'd might take deeper Root, grow strong, and spread it self in healthy and vigorous Bodies, and withall that they might be more able to undergo the Pains of Child-bearing: And to the end he might take away their over-great Tenderness and Nicety, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd they should appear naked as well as the Men, and dance too in that Condition at their solemn Feasts and Sacrifices, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Songs, whilst the young Men stood in a Ring about them, seeing and hearing them: In these Songs they now and then gave a Satyrical Glance upon those who had misbehav'd themselves in the Wars; sometimes sung Encomiums upon
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:32839:189"/>
those who had done any gallant Action, and by these means inflam'd young Men with an Emulation of their Glory: For those that were thus commended went away brave and well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with themselves; and those that were rally'd, were as sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touch'd with it, as if they had been formally and severely reprimanded; and so much the more because the Kings, and whole Senate saw and heard all that pass'd. Now tho' it may seem strange that Women should appear thus naked in publick, yet was <hi>true</hi> Modesty observ'd, and Wantonness excluded; and it tended to render their Conversation free and unreserv'd, and to beget in them a Desire of being vigorous and active, and fill'd them with Courage and generous Thoughts, as being allow'd their Share in the Rewards of Virtue as well as Men: Hence came that Sence of Honour and Nobleness of Spirit, of which we have an Instance in <hi>Gorgo,</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who, being told in Discourse with some foreign Ladies, That the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> were They only of the World, who had an Empire over the Men, briskly repartee'd, that there was good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>For they were the only Women that brought forth Men.</hi> Lastly, these publick Processions of the Maidens, and their appearing naked in their Exercises and Dancings, were Provocations and Baits to stir up and allure the young Men to Marriage, and that not upon <hi>Geometrical</hi> Reasons, as <hi>Plato</hi> calls them (such are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and Equality of Fortune) but from the Engagements of true Love and Affection.</q>

               <p>Afterwards, when <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws were neglected, and the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> had degenerated from the strict Virtue of their Fore-fathers, their Women also were ill spoken of, and made use of the Freedom, which their Law-giver allow'd them, to no good Purposes; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they are censur'd by ancient Writers for their Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, and excessive Desire of unlawful Pleasures, and branded by <hi>Euripides,</hi> as cited by <hi>Plutarch</hi>

In which Words <hi>Agamemnon</hi> excites <hi>Teucer,</hi> the natural Son of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon,</hi> to behave himself with Courage by two Reasons; First, That so doing he would be instrumental in delivering the <hi>Grecians</hi> from their Enemies, who daily got Ground of them: The other, That such an Action would be a Credit to his Father, whose Honour he ought to have a more tender Concern for, since he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:32839:200"/>
such extraordinary Benefits from him; as having, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Illegitimacy, been carefully educated, and that not in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Place, where he might have been neglected, but under <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon</hi>'s own Eye, and in his own House: This is so far from esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing an Equality between legitimate Children and Bastards, that it evidently shews the contrary, the Particle <gap reason="foreign">

It may indeed be objected, that (as <hi>Servius</hi> observes) natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sometimes succeeded in their Father's Kingdoms; but that only happen'd (as the same Author tells us) for want of legitimate Issue; nor was it always allow'd in such Cases: In some Places the Bastards of private Persons likewise inherited the Estates of their Fathers having no lawful Children or Relations, as appears from an <hi>Athenian</hi> Law cited by <hi>Demosthenes</hi>

'Tis not worth disputing whether Signification is more pertinent in these Passages, since 'tis certain that both are agreeable enough to the Practice of Antiquity: For as Persons having Relations were usually succeeded in their Estates by them; so when any dy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawful Heirs, their Possessions belong'd to the Prince, the Common-wealth, or supreme Magistrates, as the Laws of every State directed.</p>

Estates: What Regard the <hi>Athenians</hi> had of those Men's Children, who lost their Lives in fighting for their Country, has been shew'd in a former Book; how they treated the Posterity of others, who had deserv'd well of their Common-wealth, shall now appear from one or two Instances: The first is that of <hi>Aristides,</hi> who dying poor, the <hi>Athenian</hi> People bestow'd upon his Son <hi>Lysimachus</hi> an hundred <hi>Attic</hi> Pounds of Silver, with a Plantation of as many Acres of Ground; and, upon the Motion of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> order'd farther that four <hi>Drachms</hi> a Day should be paid him; furthermore, <hi>Lysimachus</hi> leaving a Daughter nam'd <hi>Policrite,</hi> the People voted her the same Provision of Corn with those who obtain Victory in the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games: The same <hi>Aristides</hi>'s two Daughters had each of them three hundred <hi>Drachms</hi> out of the publick Treasury for their Portions: Nor is it to be wonder'd (proceeds my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) that the People of <hi>Athens</hi> should take care of those, who resided in their City; since hearing the Grand-daughter of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stogiton</hi> was in so low a Condition in the Isle of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> that she was like to want a Husband, they sent for her to <hi>Athens,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her to a Person of great Quality, and gave with her a Farm for her Dowry; of which Bounty and Humanity the City of <hi>Athens</hi> (saith he) in this our Age has given divers Demonstrations, for which she is deservedly celebrated and had in Admiration <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>Men's Vices and dishonorable Actions were likewise participated by their Children; for it was thought no more than reasonable, that those, who share in the Prosperity and good Fortune of their Parents, should partake likewise of their Losses and Miscarriages. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> could be prevail'd on by no Arguments to spare <hi>Antimachus</hi>'s Sons, their Father having endeavour'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> to be murder'd, when they were sent on an Embassy to <hi>Troy</hi>
