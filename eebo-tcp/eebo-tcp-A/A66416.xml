            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>They have taken crafty counſel againſt thy people, and conſulted againſt thy hidden ones: They have ſaid, Come, and let us cut them off from being a Nation, that the name of Iſrael be no more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Pſalm</hi> may either refer to ſome particular time, when the Land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had War with, and was invaded by the <hi>Edomites, Iſmaelites,</hi> and the other Nations ſpoken of here, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8; as it was in the Reign of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1, &amp;c. and <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 1, 10. Or elſe it may be applied to the condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſeveral enemies which they had from time to time, to the Captivity. At which time eſpecially we find the <hi>Amonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> the <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25, with thoſe of <hi>Tyre,</hi> chap. 26, to have been ſworn enemies to the welfare of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to have rejoiced in the deſtruction and captivity of that people. Upon which of theſe occaſions this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30740:3"/>
penned, it is not ſo fit to determine, as it is to obſerve the lively repreſentation that is here made of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which the wicked do bear to the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; and of the need which the Church hath of, and of the protection it finds by the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were a typical people, an emblem of what the Church was like to be, and of what it was like to meet with in future ages. They were ſeldom or never without enemies, and thoſe enemies never without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns, which they laid with great cunning, and proſecuted with all their might; but they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo never without a defence, and with which they were always ſafe. The enemies might adviſe and conſpire, confederate, aſſemble and joyn together; they might proceed, and promiſe themſelves ſucceſs in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; but as long as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was the Church of God, it was ſafe: and as till it needed perſecution, it ſhould be preſerved from it; ſo till it deſerved it, ſhould never be forſaken. This is the account which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives of the ſtate of that Church with reſpect to its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that ſought to deſtroy it, and with reſpect to God, who took care to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>In the Words we have,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An evil deſign laid and contrived, which was to deſtroy the people of God; <hi>They have taken counſel againſt thy people, and conſulted againſt thy hidden ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30740:3"/>
               <hi>2. Their Confederacy in this deſign;</hi> They have ſaid, come, and let us cut them off. <hi>So again,</hi> verſ. <hi>5,</hi> They have conſulted together with one conſent: they are confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſucceſs which they promiſed themſelves in it; <hi>Come, and let us cut them off;</hi> as if it was what they could as ſoon do as ſay; what they could not be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or prevented in.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the wicked do bear an enmity to the Church of God, and ſeek the deſtruction of it. Where I ſhall conſider whence that doth proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what ways they do ſhew this enmity, and what courſe they take to afflict and deſtroy the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The confidence which they have of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By way of Supplement, I ſhall ſhew by what ways their deſigns may be prevented, and their enterprizes overthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the enmity which the wicked bear to the Church of God, and from whence that doth proceed.</p>
            <p>When we conſider what the Church of God is, and of what excellent perſons its Family doth conſiſt, and by what excellent Rules it is ordered, we may think it as ſafe from all outward violence, as from any inward diſtemper; and that it ſhould not find any enemies, ſince it doth not by any juſt invitations make them. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30740:4"/>
               <hi>they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Ye luſt and have not: ye kill and deſire to have. James</hi> 4. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. When men do greedily deſire what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth poſſeſs, and uſe violence to thruſt him out of his right that they themſelves may enjoy it: when they do envy the good of others, and do maliciouſly endeavour to ſupplant them in it: when they do ſeek to revenge themſelves upon thoſe that have done them a real injury, or that have prevented them from doing it to another; they grow quarrelſom and contentious, and fill the World with diviſions and ſtrifes, hatred and variance, blood and ſlaughter. But now when men are meek and peaceable, when they are not forward to do any wrong to others, and backward to reſent what they receive from them; one would think that they are as ſecure from receiving, as they are above the deſign of doing any hurt; as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13, <hi>Who will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> This is indeed often the reward of meekneſs, and modeſty, of integrity and faithfulneſs, of juſtice and honeſty, of goodneſs and piety, that it gains the good will and the good word of others, and procures peace and ſafety to thoſe that practice it. But yet it is no rare thing for the beſt of men, and the beſt Religion in the World to meet with fierce oppoſitions and ſharp perſecutions. An inſtance of which is the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were continually practiſed upon, invaded and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by thoſe that were their neighbours. We find
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30740:4"/>
that no tie or obligation could ſecure them againſt, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage others to be for them, but that they watched and took all advantages to ſurprize, to ſpoil and to ruin them. Some of theſe nations ſpoken of in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> had more reaſon to be their Friends than their Enemies. The <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> deſcended directly from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Hagarens</hi> are ſuppoſed to be his poſterity alſo by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah,</hi> whom ſome think to have been <hi>Hagar</hi> that he took again after <hi>Sarah</hi>'s death. The <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> were the off-ſpring of <hi>Lot.</hi> The <hi>Edomites</hi> ſprung from <hi>Eſau</hi> the brother of <hi>Jacob:</hi> And which three laſt, beſides this relation by blood, had a particular reaſon to forbear all Acts of Hoſtility, as they were not diſturbed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they paſſed by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan,</hi> Deut. 2. 5, 9. The reſt of them were ſuch whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not diſturb or invade, unleſs when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, contenting themſelves with what was given them by the decree, and order, and appointment of God. But it is not always quietneſs and innocency that are a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient protection; even that, when nothing elſe can be the foundation of a quarrel, ſhall ſerve to make it. So that the Church may be perſecuted without fault, and may fare ill, not becauſe it is worſe, but better than thoſe it receives injury from: and that will appear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider from whence this doth proceed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This proceeds from the craft and policy, the malice and ſpite of the Devil, who being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with God for dominion in the World, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30740:5"/>
whoſe whole deſign it is to defeat him in the good that he would do for mankind, doth perpetually labour to put a ſtop to whatever may be offered toward the delivering of the Souls of men out of his ſnare. How doth he triumph in being <hi>the god of this World,</hi> and in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that he hath upon poor and miſerable mortals; moſt of whom he hath in all ages made his tributaries and vaſſals; and by whom he was ſo generally ſerved and obeyed, that it was but in a ſpot of the earth that God was truly worſhipped, a Country not above 200 miles in length, and 80 in breadth. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20, <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob: his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation, and as for his judgments they have not known them.</hi> Whatever good men might be ſcattered through the World, and however Religion might be preſerved in ſome particular Families and Tribes of other nations, (as it was in that of <hi>Job</hi> and his friends) yet there was no intire nation that kept up the Religion of the only true God, beſides that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> When mankind had baſely degenerated, and the ſtate of the World grew worſe and worſe, God choſe out the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for his peculiar ſervice; and as for other ends, ſo to be an inſtrument of winning others over to the ſame practice. This people he ſeparated from the reſt of the World; and by his dealings with them, in dividing the Seas, piercing the Rocks, deſtroying the nations for them, and preſerving them when threatned with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30740:5"/>
the greateſt dangers, ſo that no violence could hurt them, nor power diſpoſſes them, nor any thing deſtroy them but their ſins; by theſe and the like ways he made them conſpicuous to the Nations far and near, and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch upon enquiring whence all this ſhould proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo at length they might be won to own the ſame God, and put themſelves under his protection. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6, <hi>Keep therefore and do them</hi> [my ſtatutes] <hi>for this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the ſight of all the nations, which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this great nation is a wiſe and underſtanding people.</hi> So <hi>Verſ.</hi> 32. 33, 34. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>And when God had ſo viſibly ſeparated a people to himſelf from all the World, and that by ſuch eminent tokens of his preſence with them, he had made them and himſelf known to the World, it was no wonder that the Devil ſet himſelf with all his might to prevent this growing-danger that threatned his Kingdom, and to provide that his dominions which he had kept hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to intire to himſelf, might not be invaded; and what he had uſurped might not be wreſted out of his hands; Nothing ſhould in ſuch a caſe be wanting on his part that either his wit could invent, or his power perform; and ſo without doubt he did ſtir up enemies to aſſault, vex and deſtroy them. And he that did thus beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the firſt ſettlement of a National Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to have forgot himſelf or to neglect his cauſe ſo far, as not to uſe an induſtry great and ſufficient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30740:6"/>
in proportion to the danger that was approaching; when no leſs a deſign was ſet on foot than of bringing the whole world into the ſame condition, and making al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mankind to adore the King of kings, and Lord of lords in the ſame way. When this deſign was laid, and ſuch a power appeared in its behalf, as threw him out of his Empire in a ſhameful way, and tore up the foundations of it; we may ſuppoſe that he would bend all his forces that way, and that all his Crew would take up Arms to oppoſe whatever was like to procure the total overthrow of that Empire he had ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Then the gates of Hell, all the power and policy of it, would combine againſt the Church which Chriſt eſtabliſhed ſo much to the prejudice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils dominion. It's ſaid <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 12, 13. <hi>Wo to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the Sea: for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath but a ſhort time. And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſtout unto the earth, he perſecuted the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which brought forth the man-child.</hi> He that prided himſelf before in the extent of his dominions and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Subjects, being deprived of that Supremacy, breaks forth into the greateſt rage againſt all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of his government, and ſeeks to deſtroy thoſe whom he could not retain and keep firm to him. And this is one cauſe why the Church of God meets with oppoſition and perſecution, as the Devil is concerned in the quarrel, and doth inſtigate bad men to manage and to carry it on.</p>

            <p>When ſin hath erected its Empire, and come to be predominant, it then becomes an intereſt; and the heart of man which of it ſelf is perpetually in motion, will then, being made a party, move ſtrongly in its deſires and deſigns that way which by ſuch a depraved temper it is directed to. It's always then prepared for action; and as it is habitually diſpoſed, ſo being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the leaſt occaſion, it preſently is all on fire, and engages in the quarrel. It will then appear in the Cauſe of Sin, and fight its battels; and whatever doth obſtruct and oppoſe it, ſhall be looked upon and dealt with as an Enemy. This doth all ſin more or leſs wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is. But there are ſome ſinners that from their own natural temper, or their manner of life, are more unquiet than others, and whom it's neceſſary for the peace and ſafety of the world, to find out ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for (as they ſay it is for a Spirit when it is raiſed

by the power of charms and witchcraft) and to watch over them, or elſe they will be perpetually hatching and doing of miſchief. Such eſpecially are they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are very dangerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherever they do reſide. It's ſuch as theſe that will not ſuffer Princes or People to be quiet (where they are admitted and indulged) but are perpetually inſtigating them, and putting them forward upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterprizes. Theſe, that pretend to be under an Obligation not to divulge the ſecrets of Confeſſion (although a Prince, and Parliament, and thouſands of People ſuffer by the concealment of it, as it had likely to have proved in the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon)</hi> make their advantage of theſe to breed ill blood, to foſter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote jealouſies and contentions betwixt Prince and people, betwixt Nation and Nation, that their Cauſe may be promoted by it, and by this means others may

be made unable to hurt them, or defend themſelves. It's but fit therefore, ſince ſuch have choſen the life of a Cloyſter, that they ſhould be confined to it, or elſe they are enough to ſet all the World on fire, and to draw men into perpetual quarrels and contentions. Theſe are they that keep the Church from being quiet, and Chriſtians from the practice of thoſe duties that tend to the peace, the order, and the ſecurity of it.</p>

This is one great reaſon of the quarrel betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all thoſe attemps made upon us by a Foreign Power. <hi>England</hi> is a fruitful Country, and the people, of their own temper, inclined to devotion; and it was a plentiful harveſt which ſome men reaped here in former times from <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> and firſt-Fruits, and Penſions, and Appeals, and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Indulgences, and Jubilees, and Pilgrimages; they were goodly days when there were frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in theſe kinds from hence to <hi>Rome:</hi> but now that there is a great Gulph fixed, by Laws and Statutes and Penalties, betwixt us and them, ſo that they which would paſs from hence to them cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence about ſuch affairs without danger, whilſt thoſe Laws are in being, and are put in execution; their bank is ſunk, and they would fain be returning to their old quarter. There are <hi>Abbies,</hi> and <hi>Monaſtries, Frieries</hi> and <hi>Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> with noble Mannors and large <hi>Demeſnes;</hi> there are Benefices and Colledges which they thirſt after. Theſe are the Souls that they ſo dearly prize and venture ſo hard to reſcue out of the fire; theſe are the <hi>Proſelytes</hi> which they above all labour to gain: and becauſe they are ſtill kept out, what broils and ſtirs do they make? what do they not threaten and endeavour? And beſides, there is danger, leſt if they invade not us, that we ſhould grow upon them, and other people begin to be wiſe as well as ours. Such alſo may come to ſee that Religion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30740:8"/>
conſiſts not in the viſiting of a Church, or looking devoutly upon a <hi>Relique,</hi> or kiſſing a piece of wood, or bowing to an Image, or croſſing the breaſt, or in ſingring of Beads, or ſaying Prayers by tale, or being clad with the Robe of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> or walking barefoot, or in being all night locked up in a Cloyſter, or in faſting by eating of Fiſh, or in lighting up of Tapers, and making proceſſions, and a thouſand of the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and fantaſtical Ceremonies; nay, they might come to underſtand, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not Chriſts Vicar, nor his Holineſs Infallible; nor that he hath power to deliver Souls out of Purgatory; and what is more, that there is no ſuch place as Purgatory, and ſo no need of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead, nor of Money to purchaſe thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This is a great reaſon why our Religion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is a Reformation of thoſe corrupt errors and practices that are crept into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſo much diſliked and inveighed againſt by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> faction. For what would <hi>Rome</hi> ſignify if it had no ſupremacy over other Churches? what appeals would be made thither? what directions, commands and grants would be expected thence, if each had as much authority within it ſelf, as that now claims over all? If the reſt of the Apoſtles had authority equal with St. <hi>Peter;</hi> if all their ſucceſſours in the ſeveral parts of the World, were of the ſame degree, and none had ſuperiority over the reſt; if the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> where St. <hi>John</hi> was, or that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where St.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30740:9"/>
               <hi>James</hi> did preſide, had as much priviledge as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> then ſhe might ſit as a widow in reſpect of what for theſe laſt ages ſhe hath been, and be bereaved of all that Pomp and Greatneſs, that Wealth and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence that ſhe hath abounded in.</p>
            <p>Again, if there be no infallibility amongſt them, if their <hi>Popes</hi> have miſtaken in point of faith, and their decrees have been erroneous; if their Councils have miſcarried in their determinations; if Tradition hath failed in what they pretend to be conveighed down by it; if their Church, that is, be no better than others; and whatever it pretends to, can really claim no better infallibility; Then what need will there be of being ſolicitous and inquiſitive about what ſhe ſhall require or determine? what need any one take a long journey thither, when he may with greater eaſe and as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty have his caſe reſolved at home? Could that Church do no more than others, and had it no ſuch thing as a treaſure of Merits and Superarogaions, no publick and general ſtock from whence ſuch may be relieved as having made little conſcience of Religion whilſt they lived, have no other claim to the priviledges of it when they come to dye; where would be the profit that doth daily accrue to it by the iſſuing out of Indulgences? Were there nothing in the <hi>Reliques</hi> that are ſhewed by them, and no more in that Blood of Chriſt which they expoſe to the view and veneration of the people, than that of a Duck (as my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> in his Hiſtory of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30740:9"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> ſaith it was found to be) were there no more in the Stairs of <hi>Pilate</hi> which the people with great devotion do climb up at <hi>Rome,</hi> and expect great Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences for, than in thoſe of an ordinary Church, who would make ſuch tedious Pilgrimages thither? If Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory be yet a place to be diſcovered; and what there is not ſo much proof of, as for a World in the Moon; if the proof of it depends upon Legends and Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. what will become of the <hi>Dirges</hi> and Prayers offered for the dead, and of the Prieſts whoſe incomes much depend upon it? If their Prieſts can do no more than ours, and to the eye and experience of the world, make no more alteration upon the Bread and the Wine conſecrated by them, than what is conſecrated by us; that after all their ceremony and a do about it, it is no other than what it was before, is of no other colour or taſt, is of no more weight, and takes up no more room than before; what will become of the veneration that the Prieſt obtains, and the profit that he makes by it? If they can forgive ſins upon no other terms than we, and repentance and amendment of life muſt be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, What becomes of all their Diſpenſations, Pardons, Penances and Indulgences? If theſe and the like things fail, and that they are in the ſame condition with other Churches, a great part of their gain and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is loſt. And it is no wonder that they exclaim againſt us, that are ſo bold as to queſtion and deny what they would in theſe and the like particulars im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30740:10"/>
upon the Chriſtian world. They do then with as great reaſon ſet themſelves againſt us, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the Crafts-men did oppoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his aſſociates, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 25, <hi>Sirs, Ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</hi> This, this is a caſe puts them hard to it, and therefore they are concerned, nearly concerned to ſee that this Hereſie ſpreads no further, and to root it up wherever it hath already prevailed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may proceed from the excellency of a Church, when it doth outſhine them in the beſt and trueſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that true goodneſs and ſubſtantial piety is there taught and practiſed. When it is not taken up with little things, with imageries and fantaſtical appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, but that the Religion it owns is what tends to make men better, and that they are made by it not ſo much Proſelytes to a particular way, as to Vertue and Chriſtianity. Give me a Religion that works this way, that we may lay hold upon, that gives ſuch rules and directions as will abide the examination, and laſt throughout ages, and are of good uſe to the world. There are ſome principles which run all into Air, and carry you away till you know not where you are; that hoiſe a man above ground, and make him full of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit; and which he is ſo mighty fond of, that all that are not as fanciful as himſelf, ſhall be accounted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and what not. This is too true of ſome amongſt our ſelves, and it is alſo as true of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that talk of infallibility, infallibility, and yet the Popes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30740:10"/>
and their own Councils have as groſly miſtaken, as thoſe that never pretend to it; that talk of Abſolution and Indulgence, and yet mens ſins are no otherwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given than upon the terms of the Goſpel, ſuch as Faith, Repentance and new Obedience (as the ſoberer of themſelves acknowledge); that tell of Chriſt's being bodily preſent at the Sacrament, fleſh and blood as much as our ſelves, and yet he is no otherwiſe to be ſeen than by our plain way of Faith, unleſs they take fancy for another. Theſe and the like notions are full of wind, and make their Religion look big and bulky, but its either all art, and not nature; or, what is worſe, the diſtemper and not the conſtitution of it: It's a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo far of their own making, and which is made to ſerve an intereſt. But now if a Church is plain in its Doctrine, grave in its Directions, ſubſtantial in its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and what drive at preſent practice (as theſe of ours do), it ſhall be ſtruck at by theſe kind of <hi>Hectors;</hi> and if they could, baniſhed out of the world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may proceed from the diſpoſal of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that for the puniſhing of the ſins of a Church, doth not only ſuffer others to afflict her, but turn their diſpleaſure that way. When the heart is of it ſelf bent upon miſchief, and full fraught with evil and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations and deſigns, God may make uſe of that temper for the ſerving of his own Providence, and may direct it as he pleaſeth without being guilty of the ſin of it. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 25, <hi>He turned their heart to hate</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:30740:11"/>
               <hi>his people, to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants.</hi> Their heart before was corrupt and miſchievous, and he made uſe of it for the ſerving of his own deſign; He doth not infuſe this into ſuch, or neceſſitate them by any abſolute decree or act of his own to be ambitious, or proud, or covetous, or cruel, but it is what he finds; and the direction of it to ſuch objects, doth no more make him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, than that perſon that divides and directs the Stream, can be the maker of it. It is what he finds to his hands, and what he doth only order and diſpoſe of.</p>
            <p>And thus much is intimated in the phraſe uſed in Scripture of <hi>ſtirring up an adverſary.</hi> God by his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ordering and directing the inclinations of men that were before in the heart, according as time and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requireth. This is plain in what is ſaid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 14, <hi>The Lord ſtirred up an adverſary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, he was of the Kings ſeed in Edom. Hadad</hi> being beaten out of his Country by <hi>David,</hi> and forced to take ſhelter under the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> did doubtleſs wait an opportunity of returning, and yet notwithſtanding, we had nothing of any attempts made by him that way till the latter end of <hi>Solomon</hi> (to whom God had promiſed a peaceable reign, as long as he continued to ſerve him) when <hi>his wives had turned away his heart after other gods, verſ.</hi> 4. and then <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> is ſaid to have deſired <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s leave to depart, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. God then making uſe of the ſetled inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30740:11"/>
of his mind, in puniſhment to <hi>Solomon</hi> for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy. So God is ſaid to <hi>ſend the Aſſyrian, Iſa.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 5, 6. His pride and vain glory, were what did engage him to invade the dominions of others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. 8, <hi>It is in his heart to deſtroy, and cut off nations not a few. For he ſaith, are not my Princes altogether Kings?</hi> And God ſerved himſelf of this temper of his, and turned him upon <hi>the people of Gods wrath,</hi> as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are there called. So he is ſaid to <hi>bring Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar againſt them, Jer.</hi> 25. 9. So that a Church and people may come thus to ſuffer through Gods wiſe and powerful ordination, as they by their ſins have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger; and when it hath done this work, and ſerved this end, and that by it they are brought to repentance, the ſame hand that brought it on will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it off.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall proceed to the ſecond general, which is to obſerve the ways in which they ſhew this enmity, or the courſe which they take for the deſtruction of the Church; and that is, deep conſultation and joynt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, <hi>They take crafty counſel, and are confederate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the moſt likely way to accompliſh a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, when it is cunningly contrived, and cloſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. For all the action in the world, without good conſultation, may be baffled and diſappointed; and the ſhrewdeſt conſultation without vigorous action will come to nothing; but when both theſe do meet, it hath the faireſt hopes of ſucceſs. And this the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30740:12"/>
of the Church are not wanting in, who do too often ſurmount in both, thoſe that have the beſt cauſe, and whoſe greateſt intereſt it is to defend it. But there are particular ways which ſuch do take. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Slandering their adverſaries, and raiſing falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of them. They are then dealt with as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians were by their perſecutors, who were dreſſed up in the skins of ſuch Creatures as would the more exaſperate and invite the wild beaſts to which they were expoſed, to tear and devour them; they ſhall be repreſented as Hypocrites and Deceivers, as Hereticks and Infidels, as pernicious and dangerous. So it was with the Chriſtians of old, who were ſaid to be <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and contemners of all Religion, and guilty of the fouleſt crimes, as Sacriledge, Sedition, Inceſt and Murder; and it is no wonder when thus repreſented, that ſome of the beſt of the Heatheniſh Emperers made Laws and Edicts againſt them, and followed them with ſevere perſecutions, as <hi>Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> till they were made to underſtand better by their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts.</hi> And ſo it happens often in the World, that Religion for want of being underſtood, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious for want of being truly known, are evil intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them that mean well. But as ſuch by miſtake and miſreport may become Enemies to what is good, thinking it to be evil; ſo bad men are willing to have it ſo, and do therefore take all occaſions to aſperſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they may expoſe that and thoſe that are better
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30740:12"/>
than themſelves to obloquy and reproach; for by how much the more they can caſt dirt upon them, by ſo much the more do they think themſelves vindicated. And this is no ſmall artifice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the foul dealing which they ſhew to thoſe that will not own its authority, and ſubmit to its unlimited Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; they will take Hell it ſelf for calumnies, and ſay any thing that will ſerve to diſgrace them. They will dreſs them up as the poor people that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Hereſie by the Inquiſition, in <hi>Sanbenito's</hi> and Coats painted over with Owls and Devils, to make them ridiculous or worſe, and to take the people off from condoling their misfortune; they will deſcribe their adverſaries in Characters of blood and ſoot, and what not, to ſet the people on with fury, and render them implacable. Thus we find they did by <hi>Luther,</hi> whom they will needs have to dye, juſt when he had entertained his Friends with merry conceits, and had been entertained at a plentiful Supper, and that immediately his Soul was carried away by Devils; when the truth is, that after he had been long troubled with a pain in his breaſt, and was brought by it under great weakneſs, he was in continual expectation of death; (though he ceaſed not to Preach as he had any intermiſſion) and the night that he died, though weak, yet ſet down with his Friends, diſcourſing about the ſtate in Heaven, and whether we ſhall then know one another; and then retiring, according to his cuſtom, to private Prayer, he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30740:13"/>
found that his pain increaſed; and perceiving, after ſome hours, that his end drew near, he exhorted his Friends, and declared his perſeverance in the Faith; and praying with great fervency, concluded that and his life together, with, <hi>Father into thy hands I commit my ſpirit; thou haſt redeemed me, O God of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So they tell us that <hi>Calvin</hi> was given to gluttony and <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi> and was branded for Sodomy at <hi>Noviodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> where he was born; whereas he was a man of great abſtinence, never eating any thing for Ten years before his death till evening; and is cleared of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by <hi>Jacob le Vaſſeur</hi> Dean of <hi>Noviodunum,</hi> in his Book which he publiſhed of the Annals of that Church in 1633. Thus would they make our Religion and all that profeſs it, look miſcreantly in the eyes of the world, that they might fall on us without mercy, and worry us with ſome reputation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By dividing the Church, and ſetting one part of it againſt the other. It's the policy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that though they have more and greater diviſions amongſt them, as about the ſeat of infallibility it ſelf (which is a fundamental principle with them) than we, yet that there is a ſuperiour power to cruſh them; and though they cannot be reconciled and put to an end, yet that that puts them to ſilence, and ſo they are kept from doing miſchief. But where perſons have a free liberty, and few or no reſtraints laid upon them, they are tempted to break into parties, and thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30740:13"/>
are apt to break one againſt the other, by which means they are often made a prey to the common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. And I pray God this be not the event of this ſtate with us. I am ſure there hath not been wanting endeavour on their part to effect it; endeavour I ſay, to make and aggravate and perpetuate differences, that ſo all might lie at their mercy. How do they ſort with all perſons, ſtrike into all Societies, take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the guiſe of all parties, that they may bring each to war againſt other, and fight the battels of <hi>Rome</hi> whilſt they fight one with the other, and all may fall a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to its fury.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By downright force: that when other means do fail, or that they are weary of expecting what will be the iſſue of them, they do without more ado, run to their Arms, and bring the Cauſe to a deciſion in open Field. In open Field, ſay I, I wiſh that were all; nay they will aſſaſſinate and maſſacre, blow up or burn, or do any thing that either treachery or cruelty can teach them. This is too true a Character of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That ever ſince it firſt drew the ſword in the time of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> never knew what it was to ſheath it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but that hath proſecuted it's Cauſe by force of Arms to this day. It's that which hath claimed a Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Princes, and a power to depoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne them. It's that which hath diſpoſed of their Kingdoms, and given Subjects authority to rebel againſt them. It's that which hath raiſed Armies, and animated
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30740:14"/>
Princes to head them againſt the Laws of Nations. It's to that we are beholding for 88, when with the <hi>Popes</hi> bleſſing, no leſs than a Fleet of 130 Ships, with 19290 Souldiers on board, beſides Seamen, was ſent to invade <hi>England,</hi> and deſpoil Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her Crown and Kingdom. But what is all this to their bloody Conſpiracies! An Army cannot move without giving an Alarm, it awakens others, and puts them upon their guard; but when the malice <hi>walks like the peſtilence in darkneſs,</hi> and is diſguiſed either with the ſhews of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and peace, or elſe lies out of all diſcovery, it's far more dangerous. This makes the Church or people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it is deſigned, more ſecure; and the Enemy more confident of ſucceſs. Which brings to the fourth general.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is the confidence that they have of ſucceſs, and that may proceed from the review which they take of their own policy and ſtrength, and from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which they make of the weakneſs of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; weak perhaps of themſelves, weaker perhaps with their diviſions; weak becauſe they are ſecure, and not aware of an aſſault; and weak becauſe they have made no proviſion againſt it. Confident again they may be of ſucceſs becauſe the deſign lies out of ſight, and what's not eaſily diſcovered, though they are never ſo inquiſitive; when it lies under ground in Vaults or Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as it was in the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon;</hi> or what is ſo well banded together, that it cannot be well prevented,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30740:14"/>
though never ſo watchful, as that in 88. Confident again they may be of ſucceſs; becauſe it is masked and diſguiſed, that it's carried on whilſt they pretend peace, friendſhip, and alliance. So was the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572, when under the pretence of great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, upon the marriage betwixt the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> ſiſter to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in great numbers were drawn into the City, and then above 30000 of them barbarouſly murdered. So it was in 88, when a peace was propounded, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on both ſides ſent to treat about it, with great and ſolemn proteſtations on the Prince of <hi>Parma's</hi> ſide that no invaſion was intended, and yet within a few days after this, the <hi>Invincible</hi> (as it was called) <hi>Armado</hi> ſet forth from <hi>Spain.</hi> So again in 1605, there were ſent from the <hi>Pope</hi> orders to forbid Conſpiracies againſt the Government, whilſt at the ſame time the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon</hi> was not without his privity in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whilſt theſe and the like arts are uſed, it is no wonder that they promiſe themſelves good aſſurance of carrying the day, and that in good time they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over them that they have thus far blinded and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated. But <hi>let not him that girdeth on his harneſs, boaſt himſelf, as he that putteth it off;</hi> nor talk too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of ſucceſs, till he is ſure of it. For in this caſe there is a promiſe of God that is ſurer than all the counſels and power of men, which is, That <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt the Church;</hi> and as God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30740:15"/>
have a Church in the world, do men or Devils what they can; ſo alſo a particular Church ſhall reap the benefit of that promiſe, if they take the courſe pointed to in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which brings to the fourth General.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The courſe by which the Church and People of God may and ſhall be ſecured; intimated here, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, <hi>Keep not thou ſilence, O God, hold not thy peace, and be not ſtill, O God;</hi> Which is fervent prayer to God, and intire dependence upon him: in ſum, the behaving themſelves as thoſe that are his ſervants; for then God will be their Friend, and their Patron, and they will be as ſecure notwithſtanding the power of the enemy, as if they had no enemy to encounter, or that enemy had no power to aſſault them. Then they ſhall find that vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 9, 10, <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves, O ye people, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces, and give ear all ye of far countreys: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces: Take counſel together, and it ſhall come to naught: ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand: for God is with us.</hi> Let us then betake our ſelves to this courſe, and engage the Divine Protection by our importunate prayers to God, and a due conformity to his commands, that we make good our profeſſion by a ſuitable practice, and as much exceed our adverſaries in the life and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our Religion, as we do in the Purity and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it; and then we ſhall find, that though they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30740:15"/>
may dig deep, their counſel ſhall be brought to light; though they combine together, they ſhall be broken; though they ſummon up all their force they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and we ſhall then be able to ſay with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 6, <hi>The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> Thus our Anceſtors were delivered. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee: they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them: They cryed unto thee, and were delivered: they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> And to encourage you hereunto, I ſhall give you a brief account of Gods great mercy to them and this Church, in the deliverance which we are this day met to commemorate, and that I ſhall do in the order of the Text.</p>
            <p>Their deſign was to root out the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> A Religion that hath the Scriptures, and the practice of the Primitive Church to defend it; a Religion planted amongſt us, with peace, and by Authority; that made not its way by blood and ſlaughter, by rebellion and diſobedience; that was ſetled without any injury to the Prince, or prejudice to the people, and what did huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the ſecurity of both: A Religion that dealt candidly and fairly with thoſe that were againſt it, and was never an enemy to them, till they became an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to it; Firſt, by receiving and owning the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> that meant no leſs than to depoſe the Queen, and turn her out of her Throne, and then practiſing accordingly. A Religion, that when in its own
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30740:16"/>
defence it had Laws againſt ſuch, yet rarely put them into execution; and that notwithſtanding which, many of them held Offices, and all their Eſtates, unleſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feired by ſome particular Treaſon. This Religion which hath ſo much to ſay for it ſelf, and God hath ſo much honour, and we our comfort and ſalvation by; nay, this Religion which they lived ſo ſafely under, did they ſeek to ſubvert.</p>
            <p>And that in a way ſo barbarous, that it wants both parallel and defence, and which the boldeſt of that Way cannot hear of without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bluſhing; and howſoever they would have been in the ſucceſs of it, cannot find any thing to excuſe.</p>
            <p>To Murder a King in their way, was no new caſe; ſo fell <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; ſo fell our King <hi>John,</hi> ſo fell alſo <hi>Henry</hi> the third and fourth of <hi>France.</hi> To Butcher a people; and without reſpect to Order, Age, or Sex, to fall upon them, was what the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> felt of old, and thoſe of <hi>France</hi> in the Maſſacre at <hi>Merindol, Anno</hi> 1545. and at <hi>Paris</hi> before ſpoken of, had experience of. But when Prince, Parliament, and People were to be aſſembled, without any regard to what they were, to blow them up all at once with Gun-powder, and ſcatter the limbs of 30 or 40000 perſons that muſt then have neceſſarily periſhed by that practice, was what we are yet to find a name for, and what <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Murder</hi> are too ſoft words to expreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:30740:16"/>
And this was not the Act of ſome raſh and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate perſon, but what many confederated together in; not a deſign all on a ſudden thought of, and as ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced, but what had been conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, and adviſed upon; what <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> had been conſulted about, as the Tranſactions of <hi>Baldwin, Owen,</hi> and <hi>Baynham</hi> do ſufficiently witneſs. It was what they had ſpent much time and many thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what they therefore did promiſe themſelves ſucceſs in. And ſucceſs they found, for they quickly met with an houſe fit for their purpoſe, adjoyning to that of the Parliament; there they attempted to make a Myne fit for the receiving the ſtowage which they had provided. But the time of the Parliament's ſitting came on too faſt, they wanted hands, and their own hands wanted exerciſe in ſuch hard labour to bring this to perfection; and here again ſucceſs waited upon them, and <hi>fortune</hi> (which they call'd <hi>providence)</hi> ſeemed to be of their party; for the Parliament was adjourned from <hi>February</hi> to <hi>November;</hi> and they in the mean while alſo met with a Vault which they ſoon hired, and was more convenient for their purpoſe, as what was already ſitted for them, and nearer to the place of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments convention.</p>
            <p>The time now grew near, and they are big with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; the train was laid for their deſign in the Country as well as here, and in all parts they were ripe for action. But that which went on for ſo long a time
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30740:17"/>
as ſmoothly as their hearts could wiſh, was all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den interrupted. For ten days before (which was the ſame time that the Conſpirators appointed to aſſemble) one of them doubtleſs by the over-ruling Providence of God, more tender-hearted than the reſt, wrote a Letter to the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> to diſſwade him from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the firſt day of the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>A Letter in the reaſoning of it very obſcure; but what by the fortunate interpretation of the King was found to ſignifie much, and proved the happy diſcoverer of the whole. Then as ſucceſs waited before upon them, ſo it doth as much in the further diſcovery, whilſt <hi>Faux</hi> is taken without the Houſe (that if otherwiſe within, would have blown up, though not the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet thouſands with himſelf), and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators are purſued, and taken in the Countrey, before they were known to be guilty of this horrid Treaſon. Theſe and many other particulars might be obſerved in this Action; but that I ſhall chuſe to refer you for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to what hath formerly, and of late been publiſhed upon that ſubject, and to the Act of Parliament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be read upon this day, which follows.</p>

            <p>FOr as much as Almighty God, hath in all Ages ſhewed his power and mercy, in the miraculous and gracious deliverance of his Church; and in the Protection of Religious Kings and States, and that no Nation of the Earth hath been bleſſed with greater benefits, than this Kingdom now enjoyeth, having the true and free profeſſion of the Goſpel under our Moſt Gracious Soveraign Lord King <hi>James;</hi> the moſt Great, Learned, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King that ever reigned therein, inriched with a moſt hopeful and plentiful Progeny, proceeding out of his Royal Loyns, promiſing continuance of this happineſs and profeſſion to all proſterity; the which many malignant and deviliſh <hi>Papiſts, Jeſuites,</hi> and <hi>Seminary Prieſts</hi> much envying and fearing, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt horribly, when the Kings moſt Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Queen, the Prince, and all the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, and Commons ſhould have been
