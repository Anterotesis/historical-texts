            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May it please Your Highness,</opener>
            <p>THE Rise of our Animosities, and the reason
why they are warmer in <hi>Scotland</hi> than in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is, That <hi>England</hi> reformed by the
Royal Authority, and therefore the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Church was suted to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;
but <hi>Scotland</hi> Reforming by force and violence, some
of our Reformers coming from <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the Republicks
of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> tho otherwise good Divines, yet were so
far mistaken in their Politicks as to inspire many of their
Converts with an aversion to the Monarchy, as well as to
Popery; <hi>Buchanan</hi> and others wrote Books which were
thereafter condemn'd as Treasonable even in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
minority. These <hi>Puritans</hi> (as they were then called) so
vex'd the righteous Soul of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6th, that he
was never at ease or secure till he succeeded to the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> and then he setled Episcopacy in <hi>Scotland;</hi> as
most sutable to the Monarchy, and fitted to unite the two
Kingdoms: and though it was fully agreed to for many
years, yet some factious and ambitious Noblemen being
desirous to advance themselves, though by the ruin of their
Country; and some Priest riden and blind Zealots among
the Gentry, admiring the Parts and Persons of their Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick
Preachers, were instigated by them to join with the
Puritanical Party, and at length to rise in a most unjustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99416:3"/>
War against their lawful Sovereign. During which,
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> entred in a Covenant, wherein they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
themselves by solemn Oath to extirpate Prelacy and
bring all opposers of their Covenant to condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and thereafter into a League with <hi>England,</hi> wherein
they obliged themselves to reform <hi>England</hi> after the Model of
the best reformed Churches abroad, for their own ends leaving
the Rule thus general. All these Oaths and Leagues being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into by Subjects without and against, yea and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of the Royal Authority, and the evident design of
them being to overturn the fundamental constitution of the
Church and State in the two Kingdoms, were therefore
mostly justly condemn'd as Treason by the Parliaments in
both Nations. Notwithstanding whereof, the Covenanters in
prosecution of the black designs of these Oaths, raised first the
Rabble, and afterwards strong Armies against that most pious
and Protestant King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who out of a religious desire
as much as in him lay to preserve their peace and his own,
condescended to all that they desired, in a Parliament held
by himself at <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the lust of rebellious Zealots
hath no bounds; for the Faction encouraged with this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and having obtained now the Government of the
Church, they immediately after usurped that of the State,
calling by their own pretended Authority rebellious Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein they rescinded all the Royal Prerogatives,
murthered thousands of the Kings best subjects, and almost
quite ruined all the Antient Families of the Nation who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them, preferring and enriching chiefly mean and
factious persons who headed the Rabble, robbing more from
these Loyal Families in one month, without any pretext of
Law, than hath been exacted from them since the Kings
Restauration in prosecution of it; besides the many other
barbarities which they committed under pretext of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
as the Poyniarding hundreds of them in cold bloud
after Quarter granted, and the hanging them with the Kings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99416:3"/>
Commission about their Necks. At length having robbed
the King of all Power to defend himself, they gave him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously
up to those who inhumanly murthered him at his
own Palace-gate, to the great reproach and scandal of the
Reformation; themselves being all the while after supported
by these very Regicides, against the Royalists, whom they
called Malignants; till God restor'd King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and
then offers of Peace and Pardon were made to these <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi>
provided, they would but disown the Covenant
and their rebellious principles. But they refusing all offers,
Episcopacy was restored chiefly for the Monarchies sake:
The Faction being enraged at this, proceeded with all fire
and fury to preach up Rebellion in their Conventicles. The
Parliament in the mean time justly displeased at this inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and contempt of Authority, and desirous to secure
the peace and the people from the Poison of rebellious and
false Doctrine, appointed all to come to Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they broke forth in open Rebellions, and some of their
Ring leaders being taken in the guilt, and not disowning nor
promising to help these faults, were punish'd in order to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
others; and this is all the Severity complain'd of.</p>
            <p>By this your Highness may see:</p>
            <p>1. That You being come to support our Laws, You are
in honour bound to support Episcopacy, which is confirmed
by twenty seven Parliaments.</p>
            <p>2. That Episcopacy is necessary for support of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and that the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbytery is not opposed by us as
an Ecclesiastical Government, but as having incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it many horrid Principles, inconsistent with humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
in which the Monarchy is more concerned than we.</p>
            <p>3. That what these who were in the Government did,
was conform to Law, and that these Laws were made for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99416:4"/>
preservation of the Protestant Religion, Monarchy, humane
Society, and Self-defence. And that they value their Church-Government
more than the Protestant Religion, is clear by
their late compliance with the Papists upon getting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence;
Whereas the Church of <hi>England</hi> and we hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all rather than comply; They magnified the dispensing
Power, and we opposed it.</p>
            <p>4. This appears more clearly by their present Principles,
whereby many, as we are informed own, that Subjects have
a right to force their King to do them Justice, and that they
are his Judges, and may dethrone him; That the Rebellion
against King <hi>Charles</hi> the First and Second, and in favour of
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> were just; and that the Monarchy
being returned by Forfeiture to the People, there remains
no Prerogative with future Kings who are to have no more
power than the People will give them: and because we love
the Monarchy, we are decry'd as Slaves; whereas it had
been easier for us to have connived at their Insolencies, and
to become Republicans with them.</p>
            <p>5. To evidence that they resolve not as yet to be quiet;
They in place of accommodating differences at this time,
wherein all Protestants should shew what happy change
they hope for from Your Highness coming to restore our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Laws, do threaten Magistrates out of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Ministers from their Charges, forcing them to swear,
after many indignities, that they shall never return to their
Imployments, doing thereby all that in them lies to disgrace
Your Highnesses designs, and to persuade the Nation that
they onely must give Measures, and that none can live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
there without complying with all their Inclinations.</p>
            <p>6. That their numbers are not near so great as ours, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
convincingly from this: that twenty seven Parliaments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99416:4"/>
have run unanimously against them under four Kings, and
that they have still been easily overcome in all their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions:
and though now they appear numerous here, yet that
proceeds from their being all here, upon design to make
themselves appear considerable, that they may be thought
necessary; and to the end, that some of them may recover
what was justly taken from them, and may get Employments
by procuring the Possessors to be incapacitated. Whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
trusting to the Laws, the Interest of the Monarchy and
Your Highness's just sense of things, thought no such appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
necessary till the Convention. These <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have
also instigated some Tumults, to fright honest Men, who will
not rise in Arms without Authority, yet if there be not Forces
sent down under well-principled Officers, they will be forced
again to beg leave to raise new Forces in self-defence, without
which we can neither live at home nor go to serve Your
Highness in the Convention.</p>
            <p>7. Many of them pretending that their <hi>Presbytery</hi> is <hi>Iure
divino,</hi> and that they are bound to it by Oaths (tho declared
Treason) do own that they can submit to no Laws incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with <hi>Presbytery,</hi> whereas we are ready to comply with
whatever Your Highness and a Parliament shall find conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the Monarchy and the good of the Kingdom, being
grieved at those Animosities in which they delight. And to
demonstrate our Innocence and our readiness to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
all matters justly, we desire to be heard before Your
Highness or any You shall name.</p>
            <p>8. We do in the next place, offer to Your Highness's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
whether in this Age, wherein Episcopacy is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to have been the best Bulwark against Popery,
the <hi>English,</hi> who so justly love and reverence Episcopacy will
unite with <hi>Scotland,</hi> if subjected to <hi>Presbytery;</hi> especially
since the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who generally own the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99416:5"/>
sworn to extirpate Episcopacy, having violently and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concurred in the last Age, to throw it out of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Which Oath will certainly bind them to overthrow
Episcopacy in <hi>England</hi> more industriously, when <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Union becomes a part of their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>We design not by this to load all of that persuasion, amongst
whom we confess many are so moderate as to deserve, that for
their sake we should encline heartily to such an Indulgence as
may satisfie sober Dissenters, nor would we have troubled your
Highness with this Account, if we had not been assured that
there was an Address prepared, craving a total extinction
of Episcopacy, as contrary to the divine right of <hi>Presbytery;</hi>
which if it be acknowledg'd, they can be subject to no Law;
and the Covenant, though illegal and irreligious, must be the
Rule: Which if yielded, no sober Man can live in security;
and though some things may now be reformed in that Address
by advice from <hi>London,</hi> yet the first draught shews their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination:
And even the extinction of Episcopacy which will
certainly be craved, they being sworn to it in their Covenant,
obliges us to offer this in defence of our Laws, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the inconveniences and insolencies which would ensue
on so great an Alteration.</p>
            <p>Lastly, We humbly entreat Your Highness to consider,
that in the Church, as it is now established by Law under
Episcopacy amongst us, we have no Ceremonies at all, no not
so much as any form of Prayer, no Musick but singing in the
Churches, the Doctrine and Discipline is the same both in the
Church and Conventicle; and in a word not one Ace of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the two, but that in the present Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of their Moderators, whom themselves have sometimes
confess'd may be Constant, we have Bishops whom the King is
pleased to make Lords, allowing the <hi>Presbyters</hi> a free Vote
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99416:5"/>
in their Elections; and even the Bishops govern only by <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries</hi>
and Synods, as the World shall have a more particular
and full account of hereafter. And now after this we leave
Your Highness and the World to judge, what just ground
they have for their separation from our Churches Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
or if the difference betwixt us and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for
such they all own themselves, be indeed such as may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their constant clamour, present noise and tumults, their
uncharitable Censures and cruel Persecutions of their reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Brethren; whether the difference betwixt us be truly such
as may warrant their dividing the Church, disturbing the State,
and weakning the Reformation, which Your Highness hath
so generously and piously ingaged to protect; and which we
shall always heartily pray God to prosper You in.</p>
            <p>THe Reader is desired to observe first, that the
Figures placed in the Address, lead to the
Annotations, on that part of it which are marked
with the same Figures. Secondly, that the <hi>publick

Parties among the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians, who as
they found favour from the Usurper, or had Power
and Interest with the Rabble, mutually excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
and persecuted one another. These were

ADDRESS
FROM
SCOTLAND
TO THE
Prince of Orange.</head>
                        <opener>May it please <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.0">your Royal Highness,</ref>
                        </opener>
                        <p>WHen we <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.1">(1)</ref> begin to think how the Lord hath
blessed your illustrious Progenitors in being
the happy Instruments of so much good to his
Church, and in standing in the Gap, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
for the People of God, his Truth and Interest in
Times of the greatest Extremity, when matters seemed despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in the Eyes of all who could look no higher than the Hand
of second Causes, and how the Lord crowned their resolute En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99416:6"/>with the Success of planting <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.2">(2)</ref> a beautiful Church in
the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and delivering the People of God there
from the fury of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Persecutions. And that your Royal
Highness hath succeeded these Worthies of the Lord, as in their
Estates and Dignities, so in their Zeal for the Gospel of Christ,<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99416:7"/>
sympathy withi his <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.3">(3)</ref> suffering People, and magnaninous
Resolution in appearing in such an astonishing way for the <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.4">(4)</ref>
Kingdom of our Lord Iesus, and for his faithful Servants,
while lying in the Mouth of the Lyon, while Refuge failed,
and we looked on the Right and Left Hands <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.5">(5)</ref> and no
Man was found till the Lord raised up your Highness, and put<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99416:7"/>
it in your Heart to lay down Life and all things of a <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.6">(6)</ref>
corporal Interest at the stake, while ye did act for his Glory,
and lamentably oppressed Servants. Ah, we have not Hearts
to prize that wonderful Mercy, the greatness of past and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Sufferings, the inexpressible hazard, the irremediless (as
to the hand of Man) condition we seemed to be in, do heighten
the Mercy beyond our apprehension, so that when your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
first appeared, we were like them that <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.7">(7)</ref> dream, and
our Hearts were filled with matter of Hope and Ioy, yet
how are we overwhelmed with fear, considering our <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.8">(8)</ref> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
and sinning in the face of Iudgments, and in a
day of so much Wrath and Indignation, the combination of so
many potent Adversaries, the Perils from Winds and raging
Seas, the hazard to your valiant Army, but especially to your
Highnesses Royal Person, sent us to the Throne of Grace (and
oh how great had our guiltiness been, if we had lain by) to<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99416:8"/>
                           <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.9">(9)</ref> wrestle for the protection of Heaven towards your
Highness's Person, Army and Navy. And now that the Lord
hath not despised the Prayer of the destitute, and hath made
his out-stretched Arm appear in the prudent Conduct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
Success of such an Heroick Vndertaking, and that the
Lord hath <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.10">(10)</ref> melted the Hearts of some in making them
joyn with your Highness's Forces, hath bound up the Hands
of <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.11">(11)</ref> implacable Adversaries, and hath stopt all ways of
escaping, is the doing of our God, and it's wonderful in our<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99416:8"/>
Eyes. And God forbid, that ever we forget such a Mercy,
or that we neglect to stir up the People under our Charges to
magnifie his Name for so seasonable and so great a Mercy,
which upon several accounts may be compared with the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God's People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
from Antichristian Darkness by the Reformation, begun by
<hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> if now we get Grace to improve it to
the <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.12">(12)</ref> Honor of his Name.</p>
                        <p>Great Sir, as the Welfare and Happiness of the Kirk hath
mainly influenced your Highness's great Vndertaking, so we
are confident, that the sad Case of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99416:9"/>
occasioned by the overturning of that <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.13">(13)</ref> beautiful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government of the Kirk esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
there, and Mother Churches in <hi>France, United
Provinces,</hi> &amp;c. will by your tender Care, and Providence,
now find a sutable Remedy: and that your Highness will
commiserate the deplorable State of a Kirk once <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.14">(14)</ref> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for its Reformation, Purity, <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.15">(15)</ref> Piety, Order and
Vnity. <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.16">(16)</ref> And oh how refreshing was it to Christs afflicted
ones, to find that your Highness was so nearly concerned, and
so deeply touched with our late Sufferings, as to hold forth your
Sympathy in your Highness's Gracious Declaration, containing<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99416:9"/>
one just Epitome of our sad Tryals, and unparallel'd (on such
account) Sufferings, which would require a Volume for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
the several particulars, and giving a full History of the
merciless Perseiutions we were forced to lie under, since the
erection ef Prelacy: yea, the Severity ran to such an heighth,
that by the eighth Act of King <hi>James</hi> the Seventh his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it was statute and ordained, that all Preachers in Houses
or Field Conventicles, and all present at Field-Meetings,
should be punished by <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.17">(17)</ref> Death, and Confiscation of
Goods. And tho by the Light of Nature, and Law of Nations,
it be the Oppresseds innocent Refuge to supplicate the Iudges or
Ruler, yet with our Rulers it was accounted a Crime of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Demerit. And his Majesties Commissioner in his first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
after his Return from Exile, sent to the several
Provincial Synods, then meeting at the set time, to raise them;
which accordingly they did. So soon as they did move, as all
of them were to do, towards a supplication to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ratifying the Government of the Kirk, established<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99416:10"/>
by King and <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.18">(18)</ref> solemn Acts of Parliament. And what
Tongue can express the Oppression we have met with since that
day. And tho it were not pertinent in this our humble Address
to trouble your Royal Highness with an account of particulars,<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99416:10"/>
yet we have given to <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.19">(19)</ref> these now sent from us to your
Highness, such Information concerning those, as during the
short time of our staying together, we could provide, which
they are ready to offer to your Highness, when required;
neither could we take upon us to condescend upon any method
for remedy of our Grievances, but intirely relying upon your
Highness's Zeal for the Glory of God, and good of this Kirk,
do in all Humility beseech, and in the Bowels of Christ Iesus
intreat your Highness to procure the <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.20">(20)</ref> Extirpation of
Prelacy, and Re-establishment of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government
of this Kirk, and of the restoring of the faithful Ministers
of Christ to their respective Charges, from which they were so
unjustly thrust out.</p>

                        <p>It will not <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.21">(21)</ref> (we hope) seem strange to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's
Goodness, tho some of us being on the place about the
time the King allowed to Ministers the free Exercise of their
Ministry, opened the Prison Doors, and set the Captives at
liberty, recalled the Exile, took off the Arrests, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99416:11"/>
these to return to their homes, <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.22">(22)</ref> who know not where
to hide their Heads, did by their Address thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Favour of a little Respite from so much Slavery and
intolerable Sufferings, all of them being ready solemnly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that it was far from their thoughts to homologate the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
granted to Papists, or the Arbitrary Dispensing Power,
to speak nothing of that absolute Power, without reservation,<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99416:12"/>
claimed by his Majesty, and <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.23">(23)</ref> asserted by Parliament
and Council. But our confidence of your Highness's perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Integrity in that matter, makes us forbear any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apology. But oh, as the Lord hath followed your pious
Endeavours for the delivering of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> from the
Persecution they were lying under (while we could espie no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
with wonderful Success: So he will be pleased to strengthen<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99416:12"/>
your Highness <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.24">(24)</ref> for going on in his Work, and will make
you an happy Instrument for delivering of other Churches
groaning under Popish Persecution. <hi>Babylon</hi> the great
must fall. And that this may be the time, and your Highness
the Man of Gods Right Hand, whom he hath made strong for
being eminently instrumental in such a Glorious Work, that
he would more and more sanctifie and <ref target="#WM169.NOTE.25">(25)</ref> humble you under
his bountiful Dispensation, and would guard and preserve
your Person, and multiply his choice Blessings spiritual and
temporal on your precious Princess, your Royal Consort, shall

                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.0">YOu are pleased to call the Prince Royal Highness, we do not
grudge him the highest Titles; we know he deserves the
greatest that are due to the most worthy Heroes, and we hope,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99416:6"/>
that in due time he shall justly enjoy these that are proper to the
most glorious Monarchs; only we cannot but think it strange, that
the Popes and Puritans should be the only Clergy-Men that take
upon them, without publick consent, to dispose of Royal Titles.
Just so in your late Address to King <hi>Iames</hi> the Seventh, you are
pleased to compare him to some of the great Deliverers of God's
People in the Old Testament, altho in your former Books, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Prayers, you would allow no better Titles to the best of
your own Protestant Kings, but that of <hi>Ahab, Iehu,</hi> or <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.1" n="1">(1) <hi>When we begin to think,</hi> &amp;c.] The Reader ought not to
imagine, that this Address is like their extemporary Prayers,
(wherein if one may judge by their Expressions, they never
so much as begin to think.) No, this is the last Effort of all the
Remonstrator-Wit in the Nation revised and refined, and indeed
the Smoothness and Harmony of the first Paragraph is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
proof of their thoughtfulness and eloquence. However, I
hope the glorious Actions of the Prince, and those of his illustrious
Ancestors shall be recorded far otherwise than in the Panegyricks
of Enthusiasts.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.2" n="2">(2) <hi>A Beautiful Church,</hi> &amp;c.] This Expression is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
for that the Protestant Church in the <hi>United Provinces</hi>
presume not to prescribe to the State, as your Assemblies always
did; sometimes purging the Army, as you did the King's at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
to the Ruin of it; sometimes declaring against the publick
Acts of the Nation, as you did against the honorable Attempt,
made by Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to relieve the King, when Prisoner at
the Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi> For tho that Army was raised and sent under
his Grace for that purpose into <hi>England,</hi> by the publick Authority
of the Nation, yet you were pleased to condemn it as an irreligious
Design, and the Battel it self as an unlawful Engagement; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
compelling the best of the Nobility to do open Penance in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99416:7"/>
Sack cloth before your Congregations, for being concerned in it.
Moreover, it's worth your notice, that the Reformed Churches in
the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> which you confess so beautyful, have their
Organs, which they use in the Divine Service; they observe other
Holy days besides the Lords Day, and in all their publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
have a grave Liturgy, or set Form of Prayer, wherein they
Religiously and constantly use the Lord's Prayer, Creed and Ten
Commandments, all which you disclaim as superstitious Fooleries.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.3" n="3">(3) <hi>His suffering People,</hi> &amp;c.] Tho you made others to suffer
more, and with far greater Bitterness and Cruelty; yet you would
have your selves thought the only People in <hi>Britain</hi> that dare suffer
for Conscience sake. You forget, it seems, how in the time of
your Covenant your Scaffolds stood up for some Months, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the bloody Execution of many noble and worthy persons,
who because of their previous Oaths of Allegiance, and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Obedience, could not in Conscience or Honor submit to your
Covenant, the Obligations whereof you thought sufficient to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
all former Tyes, even those of the Ten Commandments not
excepted.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.4" n="4">(4) <hi>The Kingdom of the Lord Iesus,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Id est,</hi> Presbytery,
after the <hi>Scotch</hi> Model, for that in their Language is the Kingdom
of Christ, altho your Ruling Elders and you, governed with such
a Rod of Iron, as seems quite opposite to Christ's Scepter.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.5" n="5">(5) <hi>No Man was found to help us,</hi> &amp;c.] Did not Father <hi>Petre,</hi>
with all vigor, employ his power and interest, at the Court, to
procure your Indulgence and Toleration? If he had not applyed
himself to serve your Interest, he had not obeyed the Directions
of his Society for distracting the Reformation: then you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
served the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in supplanting the Church,
when her Face was against a more powerful and formidable
Enemy.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.6" n="6">
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99416:7"/>
(6) <hi>Of a Corporal Interest,</hi> &amp;c.] A fulsom expression indeed,
but that's not extraordinary for some Men to use, were not Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Reputation things of far greater value for a Prince to
venture, but you presume to measure his Highness by your own
Scantling.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.7" n="7">(7) <hi>Like them that dream,</hi> &amp;c.] When his Highness knows
you better, he will find that you are Dreamers indeed. 'Twere
good for the People, whose Morals you have debauched, that you
dream'd less; for it cannot be denyed, but that in the multitude
of your Dreams there are divers Vanities.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.8" n="8">(8) <hi>Our Provocations,</hi> &amp;c.] There is certainly nothing could
recommend you more to his Highness, than most ingenuously to
confess and forsake your habituul Faults, your incurable spight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Royal Race, your sawciness to King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth,
your binding King <hi>Charles</hi> the First a Sacrifice upon the Altar,
your open Rebellions against King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. If you
will heartily acknowledge these Provocations, and what you have
frequently done against the Authority of King and Parliament,
and by some publick Deed of yours renounce the Principles that
naturally yield such Consequences, then there is no doubt but the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> will accept your Repentance.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.9" n="9">
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:99416:8"/>
(9) <hi>To wrestle,</hi> &amp;c.] It cannot be denyed indeed, but that
your Prayers in the publick are Wrestlings without a Metaphor,
but they are levelled most against the Pulpit, and all the struggling
is how to press out one sentence after another, and to keep wind
in the Bags for two hours together. Just so we were told, after you
were warmed with the dispensing Power, that the Queens Big
Belly was the effect of the Heat and Pregnancy of these your
Wrestlings in Prayer. But the Priests thought 'twas the Result
of their Devotions at <hi>Loretto.</hi> And as you ascribe all the courage and
conduct of this wonderful action of the Prince to the prevalency of
your own Prayers; so in your Addresses to King <hi>Iames,</hi> you alledged
all the piety and goodness you so much magnified in the late Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
to have proceeded from the same fountain; altho it be well
known that that very Indulgence was first framed at the Conclave,
&amp; sent hither from <hi>Rome:</hi> &amp; Secr. <hi>Coleman's</hi> Letters, still upon Record,
are sufficient to convince the world, that such an Indulgence was all
along design'd as the readiest method to destroy the North. Heresie.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.10" n="10">(10) <hi>Melted the Hearts of some,</hi> &amp;c.] Namely, the Sons of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> who, as you would charitably represent them, can
do nothing in favours of the Protestant Religion, but when they are
forced to it by some extraordinary Accidents, or outward Violence.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.11" n="11">(11) <hi>Implacable Adversaries,</hi> &amp;c.] Compare this with your late
Address to King <hi>Iames,</hi> when you had neither the Courage nor
Fidelity to open your Mouths against Popery, altho your selves
could not but be convinced, that it was violently breaking in upon
us at the Door which <hi>was opened mostly by your Divisions.</hi> Here you
also promise to stir up the People under your Charges; I know
not how they came to be under your Charge, but this the whole
Nation too well knows, that the Design of most of your Sermons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99416:8"/>
and Prayers too is to stir them up, as you have done formerly, to
Tumults, Calumnies and Assassinations, and whose name I beseech
you, do you magnifie in this, unless it be his who was a Lyar and
Murderer from the beginning. Here also it's observable, that in
the List ye assign of the first Reformers, ye make no mention of
the Learned <hi>Calvin;</hi> sure the peaceable Father <hi>Knox</hi> would not
have denyed him the honor of naming him among the Reformers,
and at least have given him equal place with either <hi>Zuinglius</hi> or
<hi>Luther.</hi> But ah his Letters, his unsavoury Letters, these unadvised and
unholy Letters to the Limbs of the Beasts, the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi>
our throughly reformed Consciences cannot away with these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherein like a worldly Courtier, and carnal Politician he
compliments and commends these Popishly affected Bishops, and
approves of the Constitution of their Superstitious Church, as
most agreeable to the Government of the State and Monarchy
of <hi>England,</hi> tho not to the Republick at <hi>Geneva.</hi> These ye think
were carnal and worldly ends, unbecoming the purity of your
new Light and Doctrine, therefore the poor old Gentleman
<hi>Calvin</hi> must be no longer mentioned among the Reformers. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Dash of a through-paced Assembly would certainly exclude
<hi>Luther</hi> too; for you know he never took the Covenant, and therefore
could not be throughly reformed. And besides he seems to smell
rankly of the Scarlet Whore, in the Superstitious Forms of Prayer,
Ceremonies in Worship, and Holy Days, which he allowed and
appointed to be observed in the Church where he was concerned.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.12" n="12">(12) <hi>Improved to the Honor of his Name,</hi> &amp;c.] You should have added
here, and to the Persecution of far better Christians than our selves.</p>

(13) <hi>Beautiful Government,</hi> &amp;c.] If the Devils Sacrifices, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Blood aud Slaughter, the trampling upon the State, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irpation
of all Liturgies, and the everlasting Contentions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Resolutioners and Remonstrators could make it beautiful, it
cannot be denyed but that it was so in the highest degree.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.14" n="14">(14) <hi>Once famous for,</hi> &amp;c.] A Church without Prayers, whose
Worship is invisible, and as often vaiyed as the several Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
appear in different places, or are affected with different Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
a Church without Canons, without Uniformity, and void
of Decency, in this sense your Church was and is still famous.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.15" n="15">(15) <hi>Purity and Piety,</hi> &amp;c.] In this Catalogue of excellent
things that made your Church famous, not one word of Charity;
indeed that's none of the Ingredients of the Remonstrator-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
He who would see that in its proper Colours, let him
strip Christianity naked of all Morality, and in lieu of that, place
these Vices which our Saviour reproved in the Pharisees; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
Pride, Insolence and Singularity. Then add to these a
Conversation so ordered, as to apply the Prophetical Language
of the Old Testament, frequently and impertinently to every
trifling Occurrence, keeping at the same time the greatest distance
from what's recommended in Christ's Sermon on the Mount;
and by this means a Man may have some Idea of the Religion of
our Remonstrators.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.16" n="16">(16) <hi>On how refreshing,</hi> &amp;c.] 'Twas very comfortable indeed
to you, that you imagined his Highness the Prince had no account
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99416:9"/>
of the Regular Clergy, but from these that studied to defame
them, and to represent them all, without exception, either as
ignorant or wicked persons. But to your great Grief the Prince is
not precipitant, he will deliberately enquire into your former ways,
and how the Remonstrator-Learning appeared, either in Sermons,
as Books against Popery, when it so fiercely assaulted us. May
be some will be so just as to tell his Highness, that Learning was
never so much your Talent, and that
some of the most famous Doctors<note n="*" place="margin">The Learned Doctors at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and expelled, for disputing against the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of some Subjects imposing Oaths upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of lawful Authority.</note> our
Nation had since the Reformation,
Men whose Learning and Conscience
were their greatest Crimes, were not
allowed a Country Church to preach in,
nor so much as the benefit of a private
School to teach, when you were last upon
the Stage.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.17" n="17">(17) <hi>Punished by death,</hi> &amp;c.] It would be difficult for you to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99416:10"/>
name one Man put to death for being present at a Field-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
tho I could name some that you
have killed formerly for wearing the King's
Livery.<note n="†" place="margin">Two of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Life-Guard murthered at <hi>Swyn Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> some few years ago, being by some of that Party barbarously shot from the Windows, and killed, as they sate at Supper in their Inn.</note> And it would be as impossible
for you to justifie your Meetings in the
Field with vast numbers of armed Men,
when the Laws have declared it treasonable,
and when there is not any thing in the
Worship of the Church established by Law,
that you scruple at, except the Lord's
Prayer, the Doxology, and the Reading of
the Scriptures before the Minister goes into the Pulpit: neither of
which we are ashamed of; tho you ought to be for separating upon
that account.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.18" n="18">(18) <hi>Solemn Acts of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.] The King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
having experience of your sawcy Behaviour, and unheard
of Cruelties for so many years did in a full and Free Parliament
re-establish the Episcopal Government about a year after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
of King <hi>Charles;</hi> and it is arrogant, as well as unjust,
for you to imagine, that his Highness the Prince will believe you,
when you asperse the Memory of his Royal Uncle King <hi>Charles,</hi>
(whom all Men know to have been merciful and wise to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle)
with such Cruelties as are inconsistent with the Laws of
Nature and Nations. Ye ought in Justice to have told the Prince
also how many Indulgences he emitted in your favours, and how
little you deserved them at his Hands: you should have likewise
told him, that Episcopacy never forced it self upon the State by
violence, (as Presbytery did, and still endeavous to do.) But the
King, Nobility and Gentry, wearied with the tyrannical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of your Assemblies, did over and again ratifie that Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Government in Parliament, and cannot therefore now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
till those many Laws be taken away even by them who are
deeply sworn never to endeavour the alteration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church or State. Which Oath was not as your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99416:10"/>
pressed upon any without the consent of lawful Authority,
nor under any penalties, except the not being intrusted in publick
Offices be accounted as such; and it were very hard not to allow
the Government the choice of such as should serve in it.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.19" n="19">(19) <hi>These sent from us,</hi> &amp;c.] And you are confident his
Highness will believe all they say without any farther examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
just as you would have the ignorant Mobile believe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all your Doctrines with an implict Faith.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.20" n="20">(20) <hi>Extirpation of Prelacy,</hi> &amp;c.] And will nothing less sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, than the total Extirpation of that Government which
hath now continued in all the parts of the Christian Church for
fifteen hundred years, and was first planted with Christianity it
self by the Apostles, whose Doctrines, it seems, you relish not
in these Points which are not agreeable to your Covenant. When
the Parliament is legally constituted, and the Sense of the whole
Nation fully heard, there may be some things in the Constitution
of the Church-Government made more perfect, but it is strange,
if it can be entirely removed, unless the Civil Government of
the Nation be again usurped by a Committee of the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
It will be considered who they are that demand this
Change? A Set of Men who have renounced the Communion of
all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> Presbyterian or Episcopal:
for the Conform Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> are willing to refer all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
between them and you to foreign Presbyterians, who cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99416:11"/>
be supposed to have any Biass to our side. And tho your Industry
and Faction (in populous Cities on the South Side of <hi>Forth</hi>) make
you appear numerous; yet any, who throughly knows the Nation,
knows that you are not truly one twentieth part of it. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your strength be, let me intreat you, that when ye beg for new
Revolutions, ye would forbear to abuse the sacred Name Jesus, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it the Prologue to Confusions in his Church; alas, it hath been
too too ordinary to usher in such black Designs with that holy Name.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.21" n="21">(21) <hi>We hope,</hi> &amp;c.] Now comes in your Apology for your
late Address, under the Influences of the Dispensing Power, and
then your zeal against Popery appeared in a profound silence;
for you told your People you preached Christ, and that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
tho you did not insist on the particular Controversies
against <hi>Rome.</hi> Now and then you darted some waspish Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when she was otherwise em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
than to take notice of your whistling Arguments and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
spight against her, which appeared more visible lately
when it was tost in your Divan; whether or not you should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for abolishing Episcopacy over all <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but tho you be sworn to that in your Covenant,
yet you must wait some further time for it. It is a part of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
ye use in removing the conformed Clergy of the West,
to inquire if they have the Book of Common Prayer of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and if they have it, it is wrapped up in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
Gown, and both committed to the flames together, with
loud shouts of Joy and Triumph. Witness your late Outrage to
Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> Minister of <hi>Kilmarnock,</hi> and even your pretended kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is known to be much cooled, since
you heard of his communicating with the Church of <hi>England:</hi> nor
is it long since you preached that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was more
idolatrous than the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> because they received the
Sacrament kneeling, where they believed no Corporal Presence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99416:11"/>
to be. Just so one of these whom you have since appointed a
Commissioner from you to the Prince, hearing that his Highness
frequented the Prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that he
had received the Sacrament from the Hands of a Bishop, was so
unadvisedly indiscreet and impertinent, as to say, that he <hi>never
expected better of a</hi> Dutch <hi>Conscience.</hi> A true Specimen of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrator's
Charity, and signal evidence, that ye value not the
best Consciences, when they will not stretch to the full length of
your covenanted Standard. I cannot here omit what one <hi>Veatch,</hi>
canting in Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Meeting House at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> lately
said, his words were these; <hi>Oh Sirs, wonderful things, and great
things, Sirs, very great things have been done here by mean Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
(meaning the Rabble, on whose commendation he had
fully enlarged before.) <hi>But alas, Sirs, the half of your work is not
done, so long as the Prelates and Curates are to the Fore</hi> (that is in true
English so long as they are left alive) <hi>and if the Prince of</hi> Orange
<hi>will not put to his helping hand, and lend God a lift, I will say to
him as</hi> Modecai <hi>did to</hi> Hester, <hi>Hester</hi> iv. 14. Who knows but thou
art come to the kingdom for such a time as this; but if thou wilt
altogether hold thy peace, deliverance will come from another place
to the Jews, (a most pertinent Epithet for Remonstrators)
but thou and thy fathers house shall perish. Another of their
Preachers about the same time, holding forth to his Auditory, said,
<hi>Oh Sirs, Sirs, but ye be an hide-bound people, a lucken handed and fast
griping people, Sirs, I could gar</hi> (that is cause) <hi>a few Fourteens</hi>
(that is <hi>Scotch</hi> Marks) <hi>drive all the Prelates and Curates out of the
Town; indeed I could easily do it, Sirs.</hi> This is a Doctrine very
agreeable, I confess, to the Covenant; but whether it be so to
the Gospel of Peace or no, I leave the World to judge.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.22" n="22">(22 (<hi>Who knew not where to hide their Heads,</hi> &amp;c.] Good lack,
poor Gentlemen, no where to hide their Heads! and yet if we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99416:12"/>
may believe what ye confidently affirmed before, the Byass of the
whole Nation is for Presbytery; it seems they were a very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as as well as unconscionable People, who were so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to your Cause, and yet would not allow the Professors of
it, when persecuted, the least shelter, (<hi>Mendaces oportet esse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores</hi>)
but this was your comfort, in these troubles, that many
Angels were sent to support you, and if it were not that I am
resolved to avoid all personal Reflections, I could name some, who
when removed from their places for Nonconformity, had little or
nothing; and yet purchased considerable Estates under the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persecution. The Severity of our Laws never appeared against
Dissenters for having different Opinions from the established
Church; nor can you instance any one that suffered either Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
or Civil Censure, only upon that account, but for High
Treason against the State. Some indeed, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
suffered death, such as <hi>Cameron,</hi> one of your Preachers,
who emitted a Declaration of War against the King, declaring,
that every covenanted Brother was bound to cut off from the face
of the Earth his Majesty, and all that had, or did bear Office un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him: and <hi>Hackstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathallat,</hi> and a Weaver, Murtherers
of the late Archbishop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> as also a Fidler, who had
murdered his own Wife, when big with Child. These were
some of the Martyrs of your new Gospel, whose Heads and
Hands you have lately removed from the publick Gates at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and buried with all the Solemnity that the Reforming
Rabble, and your Preachers upon their Van, could possibly
make.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.23" n="23">(23) <hi>Asserted by Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.] The absolute power seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
implied not asserted in some Parliaments, is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99416:12"/>
in that unlimited sense, that your Assemblies assumed it to
themselves, but as it is restrained and interpreted by the constant
tenor of our Laws, the practice of the Nation, and the just and
necessary exceptions that all such general words must be supposed
to receive from Reason and the Liberties of Mankind.</p>
                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.24" n="24">(24) <hi>For going on in his work,</hi> &amp;c.] Let it be a through Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
a truly covenanted Work, such as may bring all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
the most Protestant Kings not excepted, to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

                        <p xml:id="WM169.NOTE.25" n="25">(25) <hi>Humble you,</hi> &amp;c.] He will be sufficiently humbled, if
ever you get him under the Yoke of Presbyterian Discipline, and
you should take all care to conceal from him the Methods you

and misrepresenting them. However in the present business,

a day of Thanksgiving for our Deliverance from Popery and

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99416:13"/>
to. In the mean while it's worth the Prince's notice; how you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
without the State to appoint publick Solemnities. It may
be some will inform his Highdess how your Predecessors appointed
a Thanksgiving on that very day wherein the State had injoyned a
Fast. And to shew their cross Disposition, a Fast at another time,
when King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth had appointed a Feast for the publick
entertainment of Foreign Ambassadors in the City of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>THis is the Address which in your publick Meeting of
the Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> you agreed to, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
but upon the News of the Prince's having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with the <hi>English</hi> Church, you demurred a little,
and the sending of it to his Highness was delayed till ye
heard from your Friends at Court, by whose advice your
Address perhaps suffered some Alterations before it was
sent thither; but these, as I am credibly informed, were
not material, and therefore deserve no notice. However,
the industry you used to have some persons of Quality at
<hi>London</hi> subscribe it, was very remarkable; for, as some
of these persons themselves have told me, you would not
allow them to read it, till they should first sacredly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to subscribe it. A Method very agreeable to that
which ye used in getting hands to the Covenant, when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
young Children were taught to write their Names of
purpose to affix them to it; and School-Boys were brought
from dreiving their Tops, to dreive on the Work of the
Lord in subscribing the Covenant. Implicit Faith, it seems,
is a Doctrine as much in vogue among <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians,
as among Papists themselves; and the Consistory and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
do not really differ so much as you would have the
World believe.</p>
            <p>In all this that I have said, I must tell you, that I have
no thoughts of Cruelty against Distenters, I indeed pity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99416:14"/>
them, as deluded. And if it were in my power I would
not persecute them, but rather, as Brethren, restore them
with the Spirit of Meekness. I allow, that so long as they
are willing to contain themselves within the just Liberties
and Limits of Subjects, they have as good a right to the
Royal Protection, as any other Set of Men in the Nation;
but then they should let the World see, that they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
other Protestants to live too, as having the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Right with themselves: and that they are capable of
such an Accommodation as the Learned Protestants abroad
are not against: and that they do not abhor the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and Practices of other Reformed Churches; and
particularly, that they do not think themselves bound by
the Covenant, or any other Tye to persecute these of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, it were very just and pertinent in them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their resolutions never again by their Sentences, to
counteract and condemn the Decrees of the supreme Civil
Judicatures of the Nation; and to satisfie the World in
this, it will be fit for them by some publick deed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
and renounce that absolute Supremacy or Papacy
which the Kirk hath always claimed over Kings, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Powers. Many publick and known Instances might be
assigned, wherein they have challenged and usurped this
power; but <hi>Hercules</hi> may be known by his Foot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one instance that's yet fresh in the memory of many,
shall serve for all; and it's that of the unnatural as well as
undutiful Behaviour of the Kirk to their lawful Sovereign
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in the year 1650, when like a
hunted Partridge he fled from the Birds of Prey in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to them for Sanctuary. The easiest Proposals they
made to him were no less than these: 1. To subscribe
the Covenant, which they knew his Majesty did not, nor
could not like, because of the Destruction it had brought
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99416:14"/>
upon his Father and Kingdoms, and of the Door it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for continual Rebellion against himself. 2. To make
publick satisfaction to the Kirk, that is open Penance
before their Congregations, for his own Sins, and these
of his Fathers House, particularly for his and his Families
Godless Opposition (as they called it) to the Cause of God,
the Work of the Covenant. 3. That his Majesty should
subscribe, and publish to the World a Declaration, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself and his Family with the whole guilt of all the
Miseries and Blood (not excepting that of the Royal
Martyr his Father) which had been occasioned by these
unhappy Civil Wars themselves had raised, and carried on
for so many years before. Upon these Conditions they
promised to make him a most glorious King indeed.</p>
            <p>But when his Majesty modestly declined the last two,
which in Honor and Conscience he could not submit to,
immediately out comes that Tundering Bull from the
General Assembly against him, THE ACT OF THE
WEST KIRK; it was commonly called so, because
the Assembly was held at the West Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
where both the foresaid Declarations which they would
have imposed upon the King, and that Act of the West
Kirk are still kept, and to be seen upon Record in the
publick Register at that place. A true and exact Copy of
which Act, as it was faithfully transcribed from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Original, I shall here for the satisfaction of the
Reader subjoyn.</p>

            <p>Many Papers to this purpose, and more odious, might
be published, but my Design is not to expose, but if
possible, to reclaim those whom this antimagistratical
Party leads by an implicit Faith of the Assemblies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
in all its Oracles; nor would I have sent this
abroad, if our whole Church and Nation had not been
first attacqued by them, and that not only in their
present outrages against all who are not of their Gang;
but also in most scandalous and scurrilous Libels, in one
whereof they have accused the Government in all its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
since the Restoration, to have been worse than the
Inquisition; tho it was malicious, yet it was cunningly
done in them to print and publish this among Strangers;
for they knew it could find no credit at home, where the
Falshoods of it would have been as easily discovered as the
Malice of the Authors is. The publick Proceedings of the
Nation against that Party, were indeed no more than self-defence,
and therefore may easily, as they will be shortly
vindicated, and justified to the World, where all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact of that which they call Persecution, and the
true Causes of it, will be impartially discovered and laid
open, which will be but little to the credit of the Party, or
their pretended Martyrs, of whom they have now promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

impartial and unprejudiced part of Mankind will abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and abhor when they hear the former and present Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities
