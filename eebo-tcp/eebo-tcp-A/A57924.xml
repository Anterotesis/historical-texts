            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                              <hi>WEE (though not an acceptable number of a more unacceptable County) having by Gods Blessing, so fair an advantage of giving our due respects to your Honour, do with them present our persons also; which we most unfainedly protest have been hitherto by us, most vnvoluntarily separated, as our former readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and frequent indeavours to advance this service; besides imprisonments, fines, or other most miserable suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the same can evidently testifie: And therefore we first blesse the great Lord of Hosts, by whose providence you are made such victorious Ministers of our dilive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from such intollerable bondage; and next to our great and Wise counsel, by whose publike care and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we have the happinesse this day to see you conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors for the preservation of our Religion, so long violated, and restitution of our liberty so long inthralled: Neither may we omit a grateful acknowledgement of the unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled valour and vigilance, which have been so magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously exercited for the reducing of this unhappy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the woful condition of a bloody war, to so fair hopes of an assured and most happy peace: And now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36735:4"/>
since it hath pleased God thus to blesse us; we presume not to motion through difference your future care of his Glory, and the Common Wealths good; having so many rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of your readinesse to defend both: However, give us leave as a people that is our great grief and misery have so long a time wanted the happy influence and equity of the Law to relieve us, to mention our desires of their repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereby also to distinguish our selves from those which have with an high hand indeavoured to subvert them: and as hitherto you have not wanted our prayers to God for a blessing upon your counsels and actions. So now, your Honour shall not want the ready, though weak assistance, so far as the lives and fortunes shall extend of your servants and faithful vocaries.</hi>

            <p>The taking into consideration this Petition, and the coming in of the persons afore-mentioned; as also the rising of the Inhabitants at <hi>Camelford, Ginny-Hill,</hi> and other parts in the East and North of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal: For our assistance it was held fit to summon a Posse of five or six of the Hundreds, to appear at <hi>Bodman</hi>-Down to morrow being Friday, where some will be fitted with Instructions, to impart the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals minde unto them: For to morrow, part of the Army advances to S. Columbe and other parts; the Enemy is retreated from Castle-Dennis, and last night had his Head-quarter about Truro: some part of their Forces at S. Allens, and kept Guard neer S. Columb; as our staying here three dayes will prove to our advantage in setling these Eastern parts of the Countrey; So we are confident it will do so for the Western; for <hi>Gerings</hi> Horse will sufficiently

incline the people to wish the coming of this Army for their ease and preservation. The Enemy gave out they would plunder Truro, because the people there already appear for us; but it was answered, Whether should they go with their plunder when they had it: Several of the Princes servants have sent unto the General for Passes to come in, and to repair to their homes; which I conceive they now solicite for, in regard the Prince is gone to Sea: but where he is landed, we yet hear not. Last night a Vessel out of Ireland came into Padstow, the Townsmen seized upon her, and three other Vessels, going out with plundred Goods, and sent to our Forces at War-bridge for assistance, which was this morning accordingly sent unto him. A Spie is just now come from the Enemies Quarters; most of their force are North of Truro: We shall be very neer Truro to morrow night. I beleeve the General after one dayes advance, will send a Summons to the Lord <hi>Hopton.</hi> I take my leave, and rest</p>

               <p>SInce the writing of my Letter, here is Cap. <hi>Farre</hi> come from Padstow, who with Cap. <hi>Wogan</hi> boarded the Irish Vessel; and with the assistance of the Towns-men and Towns-women put them all to the Sword but two, about thirty in all, wicked natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Irish. God hath most seasonably brought that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36735:5"/>
Vessel thither: It enrages the Countrey against the Kings party, for bringing in of forraigners. These are but the fore-runners of many thousands speedily to come over, as by their Packets of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appears: Indeed, of so great concernment considering from whom they come, that it is not fit to be lightly mentioned: they were thrown into the Sea, yet recovered; an expresse is to come up with them: We have cause to blesse God for such a mercy. Several of those Letters subscribed by <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan, Ormond</hi> and <hi>Digby,</hi> were this day read to Mr. <hi>Corriton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Glanvile,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trevisa,</hi> &amp;c. And one of the two that had not his throat cut, was brought before them, which hath further satisfied them of the Kings intentions, and ready preparations to bring in bloody Irish Rebels into his Kingdom, that they offer, to the hazard of Life and Estate, in person to oppose them. I will say no more till the Letters come: Pardon my haste.</p>
