         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To have ſeen in the ſaid Emperors Cabinet,
Branches of <hi>Coral</hi> of ſeveral colours upon the
ſame Body; ſo that the Body of it was <hi>Coral</hi>
and <hi>Stony,</hi> and the Branches <hi>Ligneous</hi> and
<hi>Woody,</hi> which is not improbable to me;
for I have ſeen in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> a
Lake called <hi>Lake Neaugh,</hi> wherein, if a
piece of Wood that groweth thereabout be
planted, that part which is in the Ground
ſhall be turned into <hi>Iron,</hi> that which is in
the Water into <hi>Stone,</hi> and what is above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall remain <hi>Wood.</hi> But let us come to
<hi>Coral</hi> again, whoſe generation is not much
unlike; for when that Juyce that is in it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the <hi>Latins, Succus Lapideſcens,</hi> runneth
thorough the Body of the Vegetable, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
it, and turneth it into a ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
Whence we may g<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſs, That <hi>Coral,</hi>
under Water, is not altogether ſoft and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though it groweth ſtony, when expoſed
to the Air; which cannot be wondered at,
ſeeing there be many Stones, both in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> which being newly digged out
of the Ground, are in a manner as ſoft as
Cheeſe: But having been a while expoſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30448:8"/>
to the Air, grow to a conſiderable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Sun and the Air having exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the wateriſh part of them. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Coral</hi> groweth out of the Petrifying
Juyce, or being ingendred as other Plants,
is at laſt altered by the ſaid Petrifying Juyce,
is a queſtion. For my part, I believe that
it doth not grow without that Petrifying
Juyce, no more then the <hi>Sea-fan,</hi> called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallina,</hi>
the <hi>Alga,</hi> and other Herbs which
grow in the Sea, and that it doth not petrifie
till it dieth: By dying, I mean, that when
by the ordinary courſe of Nature, or by
the violent action of the Stony Juyce, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
the inmoſt parts, the Plant is petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Now it is certain, that Nature maketh
uſe ſometimes of the Petrifying Juyce for
the producing of the Plant; for it hath been
obſerved by many, that <hi>Coral</hi> hath grown
out of the pieces and fragments of Earthen
Pots. And in the Iſland called <hi>Tabacco,</hi> near
<hi>Africa,</hi> which is half ſwallowed up by the
Sea, much <hi>Coral</hi> is found, having its Roots
in pieces of Earthen Pots. Now the reaſon
why <hi>Coral</hi> ſhould petrifie, and other Plants
not, is becauſe of its peculiar diſpoſition: As
alſo, becauſe naturally there is a Petrifying
Juyce in it, which forceth the Plant to receive
a ſtony form; beſides the peculiar diſpoſition,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30448:9"/>
and preparation of it to receive ſuch a form.
No reaſon can be given for its colour, no
more then for that of a <hi>Roſe;</hi> for it cannot
be referred to the firſt or ſecond qualities, no
more than the ſight of the eye. God hath
been pleaſed to adorn things with ſuch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and hath ſo inſerted them into their
Seeds, as their <hi>Archaeus</hi> can produce none
other; <hi>Coral</hi> ſometimes groweth to the
height of a man before it be ripe and turned
Red, it ſeemeth of ſeveral colours; for as
many Plants as I have ſeen that were not
wholly petrified, were all of a Dusky, Green,
or ſuch colour as we ſee in other Trees; and
thoſe only begun to be Red, that had nothing
woody in them, as we ſee that in Pears and
Apples, the Red colour is a ſign of their ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and maturity. When <hi>Coral</hi> is newly
taken out of the Sea, many impure things
ſtick to it outwardly, which being taken of,
the true colour ſheweth it ſelf. There are
ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Coral</hi> in reſpect of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for ſome is ſoft, other hard, ſome ſolid,
ſome hollow, ſome rough, ſome poliſhed,
ſome porous.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Coral</hi> is taken out of the Sea, it is
for the moſt part rough, and then is made
ſmooth and poliſhed by the Artiſts: There is
a Black <hi>Coral</hi> found in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> a Province
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30448:9"/>
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch another ſort of courſe
one, called <hi>Savalia,</hi> is brought from <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi>
having the inſide woody, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
horny, and ſtony, of a Black, Yellow,
and Green colour. There is alſo a ſort of
White <hi>Coral</hi> found in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and called
by the <hi>Spaniards Polo:</hi> This hath no Bark,
and groweth in the bottom of the Sea, and
not upon Rocks, as the Red doth. The
beſt <hi>Coral</hi> is now found upon the Coaſts of
<hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Tripoli. Theophraſtus</hi> in his Book
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> reckoneth <hi>Coral</hi> among the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones; and <hi>Orpheus</hi> in his Book <gap reason="foreign">

ſpeaketh very much of <hi>Coral.</hi> Before
I end this Chapter, and ſpeak of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Coral,</hi> I will here, in favor of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
clear a doubt, and ſhew an error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its Nature that hath reigned a great
while (becauſe <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that <hi>Coral</hi> while
it is in the Sea, is as ſoft as Wax, but aſſoon
as it cometh to the Air it groweth hard) by
an Hiſtory, taken out of. <hi>Beguinus</hi> own words
in his <hi>Tyrocinium Chymicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Controverſie, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> of
<hi>Nicole,</hi> Squire of the City of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> chief
Commander for the Fiſhing of <hi>Coral</hi> in the
Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> hath aſſured me, That in
the year One thouſand five hundred eighty
four, being upon the Sea of <hi>Biſerty,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30448:10"/>
to the ſaid <hi>Tunis,</hi> where the ſaid Fiſhing
of <hi>Coral</hi> was, and being curious to know
the Nature of <hi>Coral,</hi> and how it groweth in
the bottom of the Sea, cauſed a young Man
to dive into the Sea a hundred fathom deep,
being tied to a rope of a ſufficient length,
with a weight of five and twenty pounds in
each hand, to go to the bottom, charging
him to bring ſome <hi>Coral</hi> from the bottom,
and to obſerve, whether it was hard or ſoft.
Being come above Water, he brought a
Branch of <hi>Coral</hi> in each hand, affirming,
That it was as hard in the bottom of the Sea,
as out of it, and that being about eight or
nine fathoms near the bottom, he felt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
cold. The ſame <hi>Nicole</hi> not contented
therewith, as the Nets were coming up, and
before they could be in the Air, caſt himſelf
into the Sea about one fathom deep, and took
ſome <hi>Coral</hi> ſticking to the Nets, which he
found as hard as when it is in the Air. The
ſame hath been confirmed to be me by the
Lord of <hi>La Piotier,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Lion,</hi>
who within theſe two years returned from
the ſaid Fiſhing of <hi>Coral.</hi> Beſides this, the
ſaid Squire <hi>Nicole</hi> aſſured me, that in the
Spring when the <hi>Coral</hi> is plucked up, in the
breaking of it, there iſſueth out a liquor like
unto Milk, which falling upon any Stone,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30448:10"/>
Wood, Iron, or ſome other matter, produceth
<hi>Coral;</hi> and that he had ſeen in the Cabinet
of the great Duke at <hi>Piſa,</hi> the Skull of a dead
Man, upon which was grown in the Sea, a
great Branch of <hi>Coral;</hi> and an Anchor taken
out of the Sea, upon which were ſeveral
Branches of <hi>Coral,</hi> produced by the Juyce of
<hi>Coral</hi> that fell upon it.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt rectifie a kind of ſeeming
contradiction, which is, when we have cited
<hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Mathiolus,</hi> and ſaid, That <hi>Coral</hi> was
ſoft under Water, and grew hard when it
came into the Air; and in another place,
That by the experiment of Squire <hi>Nicole,</hi> it
was found to be hard under Water; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
underſtand this only to be <hi>Secundum
magis &amp; minus,</hi> as of thoſe Stones which we
have ſaid to be as ſoft as Cheeſe in the Earth,
and then to harden in the Air when digged
up, for the Reaſons before alledged. For
though <hi>Coral</hi> may be hard in the bottom of
the Sea, yet it is nothing ſo hard as when it
hath been expoſed a while to the Air; and ſo
we perceive it to be in all kind of Trees which
dry and harden to the Air, when once wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſeparated from their natural ſap or
moiſture, and growing place.</p>

               <hi>every moment, and having been without
ſleep four days and four nights; inſomuch, that
all thoſe about me, deſpaired of my life, by
taking in a Spoon ſix drops of the ſaid Tincture,
with the decoction of Violets, upon an inſtant,
and as it were miraculouſly, I was cured. For
aſſoon as I had taken two Spoonfuls of the ſaid
Tincture, I felt my Vital Spirits ſo refreſhed,
and my Intrals ſo comforted by the gratefulneſs
and efficacy of the ſaid Remedy; that as if the
Light had expelled Darkneſs, I found manifeſtly
the ſtrength of the diſeaſe abated, and fell into a
critical Sweat (of which before there was no

Prince of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> who ſaith this. As <hi>Coral</hi>
doth wonderfully grow, ſo the Secrets that
are in it, are altogether admirable, and its
Faculties beyond expreſſion. The virtue of
its Tincture is ſuch, that it is able to cleanſe
and renew the Blood in ſuch ſort, as to cure
all Diſeaſes that comes from the corruption
thereof, and to reſtore health, ſtrength, and
alacrity. It ſtoppeth all immoderate Fluxes

It doth corroborate the Stomach, the

            <p>The fifth Author ſhall be the moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Fernelius,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Coral,</hi> ſaith
thus; <hi>Coral</hi> being cold and dry in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
by his Aſtringent quality ſtrengthneth the
Stomach, and efficaciouſly ſtoppeth all Bloody
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30448:15"/>
Fluxes, preſerveth the ſtrength of the Heart,
and fenceth it againſt all malignant and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Diſeaſes. Being taken inwardly, it ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the monethly Courſes of Women, and
ſtrengthneth the Conception. It hindereth
Excreſcences of Fleſh, filleth up the cavity of
Ulcers, and weareth out the Scars in the Eyes.
It cooleth the heat of Choler, and ſtayeth the
eruptions of it, whether upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
It ſtrengthneth the ſubſtance of the
Liver, let it never be ſo looſe.</p>
            <p>I could in confirmation of the Premiſſes,
bring the authority of all the beſt Phyſicians
in all Ages that have made mention of <hi>Coral,</hi>
but that I am an Enemy to Prolixity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.
Theſe will ſerve to ſatisfie any
reaſonable perſon, or elſe nothing will.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Virtues of <hi>Coral</hi> are ſo great
and wonderful, that many grave and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Authors did not ſtick to ſay, That it was
an Amulet or Charm againſt Fearfulneſs, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings,
Sorceries, Poyſons, Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Aſſaults of the Devil, Lightnings, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorms,
and other dangers whatſoever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ancient time it was dedicated to <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Apollo.</hi> But of theſe laſt qualities, let
every one believe as much as he thinketh fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
Certain it is, by the teſtimony of <hi>Pliny,</hi>
and others, that anciently it was among the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30448:15"/>
               <hi>Indians</hi> almoſt of an equal value with Pearls
of the ſame bigneſs. It is alſo certain, that
Red <hi>Coral,</hi> if worn by a Man, hath, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
its colour better than that which is
worn by a Woman; perhaps, becauſe the
heat of a Man is greater than that of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and the vapors that exhale out of his
Body are purer.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is an undoubted truth, That
Red <hi>Coral</hi> will grow pale, blewiſh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
with ſeveral ſpots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it is worn
by one that is nigh death, or dangerouſly ſick,
and will foretel Diſeaſes by the changing of
its colour. This I found true by a ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of my own; for having once a Girl
about Twelve Moneths old that wore a Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
of <hi>Coral,</hi> ſhe fell into a Peſtilential Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
So that when I came home and ſpied
the <hi>Coral</hi> quite altered, I began preſently to
deſpair of her recovery, which I would not
have done, if I had known then the Tincture
of <hi>Coral,</hi> as I do now. She lived but two days
in that caſe. After her death I would have
taken the Bracelet from her, and tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I could have brought it to its former
colour again; but the Mother would never
ſuffer it, but would have it buried with her,

            <p>TIncture is an Extract of the Colours ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering

formal qualities thereof. Whence cometh it,
that Tinctures are ſometimes called <hi>Oyls,</hi>
ſometimes <hi>Spirits,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence.</hi>
In the Extraction of Tinctures, the
Chymical Artiſts do chiefly labor, that they
may ſeparate the formal Virtue of the mixed
Bodies, in which lieth the faculty of curing
Diſeaſes from its proper Matter or Feculent
Body, which is unprofitable, Terreſtrial or
Wateriſh; for they draw by Extraction and
Means of a determinated <hi>Menſtruum</hi> (for the
ſame <hi>Menſtruum</hi> is not fit to draw all kinds of
Tinctures) the Tincture or Eſſence of it,
which is the moſt ſecret and internal ſubſtance
that Nature had incloſed and concealed in the
Intrals of it, to preſerve it from all external
injuries and accidents. And after that, they
draw or abſtract the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> from it; and
the Tincture or Eſſence remaineth in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Veſſel, in the conſiſtence of Honey

<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and repreſenting the colour out
of which it is drawn, then it is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Tincture.</hi> Therefore obſerve that by the
word Tincture, the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> underſtand the
colours ſticking to the Eſſence of the mixed
Bodies, and to the formal qualities drawn out
of them.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt make an exact diſtinction,
between a Diſſolution and an Extraction of
the Tincture; for in a true Tincture we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
only the formal Virtue of the ſubject,
the maſs and lump of the Body remaining
whole; but in a diſſolution, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
is reduced into minute parts. Hence
cometh it, that the doſe of the Tincture is
ſmall, but that of the diſſolution muſt be in
a greater quantity, becauſe it is not ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo, That there is no true Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
but that which remaineth of the ſame
colour as the mixed Body was, after the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi>
is extracted from it. If by this rule
many Tinctures be examined, it will be eaſily
known that they are no true Tinctures, but
that their colour proceedeth from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> with the Body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:30448:18"/>
For example, Let any body take of the
Vulgar Tinctures of <hi>Coral,</hi> if you exhale or
diſtil the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> from them, it will go
away pure and clear, and that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſhall not be Red, but ſhall look either
like Lime or Salt; whereas, if it were a true
Tincture, and a Red Subſtance extracted from
the Body, it ſhould remain ſo, though the
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> were abſtracted from it. But that
Tinctures are not always true, but vary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> is evident in that
ſeveral colours may be extracted out of one
and the ſame thing by ſeveral <hi>Menſtruums.</hi>
For example, if you put upon Silver calcined
with <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimate, the <hi>Spirit of Salt;</hi>
you ſhall have a Green colour like an Emerald,
but if you put upon it the <hi>Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with the <hi>Salt of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> it will be
of a Blew colour. Theſe contradictions did
perſwade once <hi>Crollius,</hi> an excellent Chymiſt,
when he wrote his Book called <hi>Baſilica Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica,</hi>
That the true Tincture of <hi>Coral</hi> was
impoſſible to be had, or at leaſt, that it was
not his fortune ever to ſee any. But we ſhall
convince him ſufficiently of the contrary, and
as many as ſhall be of his opinion.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot wonder enough at many
Chymiſts and Phyſicians of good note, who
through ignorance, or by hear-ſay, for the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30448:19"/>
obtaining the Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> adviſe to
calcine it, that the Tincture may be drawn
out of it, without conſidering that in the
Calcination the fire burneth and conſumeth
the Tincture, and that Calcination is good
for nothing but to Extract the Salt of it, which
alſo hath ſeveral Faculties in Phyſick of which
we ſhall ſpeak in its proper place. For Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination
is the Reduction of a mixed Body
into a Calx or Lime made by fire, which
depriveth the ſaid mixed Body of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
or moiſture that united the parts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Now it is time to come to the true Tincture
of <hi>Coral.</hi> Take therefore (for an experiment)
half an ounce of the beſt <hi>Coral</hi> in Powder,
put it in a Viol of about half a pint, pour
upon it ſix ounces of our <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and ſtop
the Viol cloſe with a Cork, you ſhall perceive,
that within four hours the ſaid <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
will be coloured Red, then pour it out, and
put new upon the ſame <hi>Coral,</hi> and ſo do, ſo
often till you ſhall ſee the <hi>Coral</hi> white in the
bottom of the Glaſs, then abſtract the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi>
in <hi>Balneo,</hi> in the bottom ſhall remain
the true Tincture of <hi>Coral</hi> as Red as Blood,
and the Body ſhall remain in the Viol as white
as Snow: Edulcorate, that is, Waſh the ſaid
Tincture from its <hi>Menſtruum</hi> with ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30448:19"/>
Water, which you ſhall afterwards Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
from the Tincture in <hi>Balneo,</hi> till it be
almoſt dry, then ſhalt thou have the true
Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> moſt efficacious for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
Diſeaſes, being given in ſome
appropriated <hi>Vehiculum,</hi> and fit for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper.
The doſe is from ten drops to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or thirty, in two ounces of an appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Liquor.</p>
            <p>When you have Extracted the Tincture of
<hi>Coral,</hi> do not ſlight or throw away the Body
of <hi>Coral</hi> which remaineth in the Viol, for
out of it may, by Chymical Art, be Extracted
the Salt of <hi>Coral;</hi> which in all reſpects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulateth
and cometh very near the Tincture,
except in the curing of malignant and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential
Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>I am here much ſurpriſed at the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
opinion of <hi>Philibert Guibert,</hi> a famous
Phyſician of <hi>Paris,</hi> who in ſeveral places of
his Book, called <hi>The Charitable Phyſician,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
highly commended the uſe of <hi>Venice

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Diſeaſes, according to the doctrine of
the beſt Phyſicians, doth at laſt in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Plague, exclaim againſt it as againſt
an infamous Remedy, contrary to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the beſt Phyſicians, and the conſtant
experience of all Ages, as I have ſhewed in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30448:20"/>
my Treatiſe of the laſt Plague <hi>Anno</hi> 1665.
and inſtead of it, ſubſtituteth two Antidotes
of his own, which are ſomething Comical.
The firſt is, The uſe of good Wine; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is that which he calleth <hi>Electuarium de
tribus Adverbiis. Cito, longe, tarde.</hi> That is, to
be gone quickly out of the infected place, to
go far from it, and to come back as late as
one can, according to this old Diſtich.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Haec tria tabificam pellunt Adverbia Peſtem,</l>
               <l>Mox, longe, tarde, cede, recede, redi.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But as we do not deny that Wine is a noble
Aliment, and a great Cordial, ſo do we think
it too weak alone to cure the Plague, as is
ſeen in many places where people drink no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Wine, and that of the beſt: No
more than his Antidote of the three Adverbs,
many having met with the Plague in the
Countrey, which they might have avoided,
if they had ſtayed in the City, as I did all the
while: For I do undertake (with the Grace
of God) to cure the fierceſt Plague with
<hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> and my Tincture of <hi>Coral.</hi>
Add to this, that many people are not able to
go out of Town, either want of means or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
or being incumbred with a numerous

Before we finiſh this Chapter, it will be
worth the curioſity of the Reader to know
how to Extract the Salt of <hi>Coral,</hi> which we
have ſaid to emulate the Virtues of the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
except in the curing of the Plague, and
malignant Feavers.</p>
            <p>Take therefore that white Body of <hi>Coral</hi>
which remaineth in the Viol, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the Tincture, waſh it very well
with fair water, dry it gently upon a ſoft fire,
and then pour upon it by degrees Vinegar,
that hath been diſtilled three times, as much as
will cover it four Fingers above, then digeſt
and diſſolve that together, and after the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Abſtract the Vinegar till the <hi>Coral</hi> be
dry; then waſh the <hi>Coral</hi> with diſtilled water,
to take away the acrimony of the Vinegar;
after that, evaporate the Water till there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
a Salt as white as Snow, and free
from all acrimony, which muſt be kept in a
Glaſs cloſe ſtopt.</p>
            <p>Its virtues are moſt excellent, for it purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Blood in all the Body, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth
to its former ſtrength. It ſtoppeth
all Fluxes of the Womb, of the Belly, and of
the Haemorrhoides. It ſtrengthneth the Heart,
and the Stomach; it openeth all the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the internal parts; it diſſolveth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
Blood. It is moſt excellent in the

Dropſie, Palſie, Convulſion, the Stone,
Fits of the Mother. <hi>Crollius</hi> is of the ſame
opinion; for he ſaith, That it purifieth the

            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <head type="sub">Why in the Curing of Diſeaſes, we chuſe
rather to make uſe of the Tincture of
<hi>Coral,</hi> then of the whole Body in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
however prepared.</head>
            <p>DIſeaſes never come upon mankind, but
by a Segregation and Heterogeneity of
humors; for while the Craſis or Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Humors, remaineth whole, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conſtantly performeth her Functions, the
Spirits play their part, and the oeconomy of
the Body remaineth intire; but aſſoon as the
Humors begin to ſeparate themſelves, and to
jar one againſt another, the Spirits are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
the Humors putrifie; and if there be
any malignity in the Air, it introduceth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
immediately into that <hi>Chaos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe Indications teach Phyſicians,
firſt, to expel the malignity as the moſt preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ſecondly, to ſettle the Spirits; thirdly,
to unite again the Humors. Now the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
being aerial, cannot be expelled, but by
formal Qualities, neither can the Spirits be
ſettled but by the ſame; which both being
done, the third, which is the union of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30448:22"/>
Humors, will of neceſſity follow; for the
Cauſe being removed, the Effect inſueth. Theſe
things cannot eaſily be done by a Body in
Subſtance, (ſuppoſe <hi>Coral</hi> in Powder) for in
that Body the three Principles of Nature, to
wit, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> remain
united together, and ſo adhere one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
that although nature may digeſt them,
yet will they not ſeparate themſelves to do
the Body any determinate good, but will
either undigeſted or digeſted, go all along and
keep company together; whereas, when they
are ſeparated one from the other, they work
determinately by the help of a proper <hi>Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi>
upon the diſeaſe aimed at. For though
all the parts (for example of <hi>Coral</hi>) be friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to an Humane Body, yet are they more
friendly one to another, and will not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themſelves to do a Body good, but will
rather ſtick cloſe and periſh together, to the
illuſion of the Phyſician, and the deluſion of
the Patient. The ſecond Reaſon is, That when
the Remedy is given in Subſtance, Nature is
put to the work and task of digeſting it, and
in the mean time the diſeaſe (chiefly if it be
aerial) getteth footing, the ſtrength declineth,
and ſo many times the Scales weigh down;
whereas, if it be given ſeparate (ſuppoſe the
Tincture of <hi>Coral</hi>) Nature preſently layeth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30448:23"/>
hold on it, cheareth up the heart with it,
who preſently as the Sun of the Microcoſm
ſendeth it, by way of irradiation, to the part
affected, and ſo relieveth the Patient.</p>
            <p>Another inconveniency ariſeth from giving
Remedies in Subſtance, which is, that when
the thinneſt part of the Remedy, is diſſolved
in the Body, the thickeſt, which the <hi>Latins</hi>
call <hi>Faere</hi> or <hi>Craſſamentum,</hi> remains in the
way, and many times cauſeth ſtubborn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and other accidents, whoſe Cauſes
being unknown to the Phyſician, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected,
produce many times ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
worſe than the Diſeaſe that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at firſt to be cured. This is to be daily
obſerved in thoſe that uſe groſs and f;aeculent
Means, and by the Reaſon we have alledged
before, fall into ſtoppages and obſtructions,
and conſequently into divers Diſeaſes hard to
be cured.</p>
            <p>From this Reaſon it is, that Spirits and
Eſſences ſeparated and ſublimated, work
more powerfully and efficaciouſly, than when
they are wrapt and involved in their whole
Bodies, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whom they cannot eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
themſelves, and ſhew forth their
power and virtue, as you may obſerve in
Spirit of Wine well rectified, one ſpoonful
of which ſhall work more effect then a quart
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30448:23"/>
of the common one, out of which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
The ſame is of Vinegar, which, if
it be pure and good, ſhall in the quantity of
a ſpoonful, in Sawces, Salets, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
do more effect than a quart of the
common one, and with leſs charge and more
gratefulneſs; becauſe its efficacy and virtue
before was dulled, allayed, and made ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
by the faeces, phlegm, and other impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
that adhered to it. Upon this Reaſon,
the Remedies that are to be adminiſtred to
Humane Bodies, are to be pure, rectified and
exalted: If you well conſider the effect you
expect from them, and the dignity of the
ſubject with whom you have to do. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the beſt Chymiſts in all Ages have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
and labored to make their Remedies
as pure and defaecated as poſſibly they could,
that the effect aimed at, might follow, and
the Humane Bodies excellency ſhould not be
violated, as it is not, when in the preparation
of the Remedies, the pure is ſeparated from
the impure, the uſeful from the unprofitable,
the ſpiritual from the corporeal, and the
cordial from the poyſon: And thus they do
not lie heavy upon the Stomach, they beget
no impurities, cauſe no new obſtructions,
but immediately fight againſt the Diſeaſes,
and overcome them. Thus, Beer well ſettled
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30448:24"/>
is wholeſomer than new; thus Wine ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from its Tartar, is better for the taſte, and
for the health, then when it is newly extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Grape; thus the Meats we eat,
being ſeparated by Nature from their Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
after many light concoctions and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of Excrements in the Liver, and
in the Veins, are at laſt made fitter for the
nouriſhment of the parts. Thus, <hi>Cinnamon
Water</hi> ſhall ſooner and more efficaciouſly
comfort the Heart, than <hi>Cinnamon</hi> it ſelf in
Subſtance; thus, a few drops of <hi>Oyl of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeed</hi>
ſhall work more effectually then many
Seeds, and thus of the reſt. Whereby you
may ſee that Remedies well prepared and
purified, are extraordinary efficacious for the
cure of the worſe Diſeaſes; as the Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs,
the Convulſion, the Dropſie, the

commonly deemed incurable; and that with
all ſafety diligence, and alacrity, imitating
Nature in this, which doth not ſend to the
parts for their nouriſhment the Meats as they
are raw and whole, but altereth them in the
Stomach, digeſteth and deſtroyeth them, and
in the Liver ſeparateth the pureſt from the
Excrements.</p>

            <head type="sub">How the Tincture of <hi>Coral</hi> worketh upon
Diſeaſes.</head>
            <p>BUt that we may make this obvious to the
meaneſt capacities, we will lay here open
the moſt ſecret Foundations of Phyſick, to
wit, The Actinoboliſm of Natural things,
which is no where elſe ſo clearly to be ſeen as
in Medicinal ones; and this is twofold, either
to life or to death. Which that you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
you muſt obſerve, That as all things
were created for Mans ſake, even ſo there
was given to every one a particular virtue by
which Man might be preſerved: For he that
intendeth the End, intendeth alſo the Means
to attain it, as are the Virtues of Natural
things. Seeing then that there is no Member
in an Humane Body, but hath its proper and
peculiar infirmities, the moſt High hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Remedies againſt all them; ſeeing alſo
that there be Members hidden and concealed
in the moſt retired places of the Body, where
there was no acceſs for Herbs and Plants to
come to. He hath given them like as it were
Beams of Light, ſpreding themſelves round
like thoſe of the Sun, which paſſing through
all the Body, do by their Actinoboliſm or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30448:25"/>
Irradiation, penetrate to that Member which
is correſpondent to them, and hath need of
their Faculties and Virtues. Hence cometh,
that the Remedies having ſpred the Beams of
their Virtues, go directly to that Member
which is analogal and correſpondent with
them, and ſtrengthen and comfort it. Thus
all Cordials by their Actinoboliſm, do not
meddle with the Liver, Brains, or Spleen;
but with the Heart.</p>
            <p>The Hepatical Remedies by their Actino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſm,
do not comfort the Kidneys or the
Lungs, but the Liver: Thus, the Diureticks
meddle not with the Liver, Heart, or Brains,
but with the emulgent Veins, and the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Thus, the Actinoboliſm of the Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Diaphoreticks, gather together into
the Intrals, all the Choler lurking in the Body,
and from thence carry it away as a ſuperfluous
and noxious thing.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, by what Reaſon the
compounded Medicines, indowed with divers
qualities, work upon the Body unconfuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and are no hinderance one to another, no
more than the Suns Beams are among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as it is demonſtrable in Mathematicks.
For ſeeing that the Specifick Virtues of each
Medicines which enter into the Compoſition,
remain in it after the loſs of their firſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30448:26"/>
when they are received in the Stomach,
as in a Natural place, every kind, without
mixing one with another, and confounding
their Beams, tends to that part to which it is
affected, and hath correſpondency with, and
with their Actinoboliſm, do wonderfully
ſtrengthen and comfort it. Whence cometh,
that all the Members being comforted, the
Natural heat muſt alſo of neceſſity be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and the more it is, the leſs power will
the Diſeaſe have; inſomuch, that we may
imagine in Phyſick as many Centers of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
as there be Individuals that compound
it; and if there be many Cordials mixed
together, they all ſhall caſt their Beams upon
the Heart: Thoſe Herbs that have relation to
the Lungs, ſhall work that way, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patical
ones, ſhall all tend to comfort the
Liver. And thus by the Aggregation of ſo
many Virtues, the Body muſt of neceſſity
prevail againſt the Diſeaſe: So contrariwiſe,
that Antipathetical Actinoboliſm which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from poyſons, and poyſonous things,
aſſoon as it is got down into the Stomach,
doth firſt attack the Heart, as the fortreſs of
the Body. Thus the Mineral Poyſons, as,
<hi>Arſenick, Orpine, Ochra,</hi> and the Poyſons of
Serpents, by their radiation, infect the next
Blood, and that the next, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30448:26"/>
till it hath reached to the Heart. Whence
if it be not expelled by the Antactinoboliſm
of ſome counterpoyſon it bringeth deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the party: Beſides that, every Member
hath its peculiar Poyſons; for ſome do not
attack the Heart immediately, but the Lungs.

            <p>We may ſee by theſe and ſeveral other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
which I omit for brevities ſake,
that the ſeveral Members and Parts of the
Body have their ſeveral Subſtances, which do
not work by their proper Poyſons, but by the
Diffuſion of their Radiant Virtues; which
cannot be remedied, but by the Radiation of
contrary Subſtances which deſtroy thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
qualities, even as the ſhadows and
darkneſſes cannot be deſtroyed but by the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30448:27"/>
Radiation of Light. From all theſe things it
is evident, that there is nothing in Nature
without that virtue of Radiation, inſerted
by the Author of Nature, for thoſe ends beſt
known to himſelf, and in imitation of the
Light, inſomuch, that the Judicious Reader,
by this Doctrine of <hi>Actinoboliſms,</hi> and that of
<hi>Magnetiſms,</hi> may as with two Wings ſoar to
the higheſt knowledge of Natural things.
He that will be further ſatisfied in examples
of that nature, let him read <hi>Skenkius de
Venenis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe muſt be added what we have
ſaid before, to wit, That the Specifick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of each Medicine that enters into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
remain in it after the loſs of their
firſt qualities which may be proved by this
Experiment.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Nettles,</hi> dry them, and burn them
to aſhes, make Lees of thoſe aſhes; expoſe
the Lees in the night to the Air, till it be
covered with an Icy thin Skin, and you ſhall
ſee in that Skin the perfect figure of a <hi>Nettle,</hi>
with the ſtretching of its fibers and jagged
Leaves, as if it were a Natural one; and if
you look upon it with a Magnifying Glaſs,
you ſhall perceive with admiration all the

ſame will happen in any other Plant, to ſhew
that no Seed can be ſo exactly mixed with
other things, but it will retain and affect
ſtill its own Nature. All this that we have
ſaid, tendeth to ſhew how <hi>Coral</hi> bringeth to
paſs all thoſe wonderful Virtues we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to it. Thoſe that ſhall deſire to be
better ſatisfied in this Doctrine of Actinobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſm
and Radiation, let them ſeriouſly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Plaſtical Virtue of all Seeds, in which,
being ſeated in the abſtruſeſt parts of the
Body, doth without any tools or noiſe,
produce a work ſo wonderful in variety and
comlineſs of Parts, and that, out of a rough
and inform matter, in which there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of parts, nor variety that may be
obſerved by the Senſes. For we ſee that in
the Seed, without any appearance lieth and
lurketh the whole Tree, with the Roots, the
Body, the Boughs, the Leaves, and the Fruits.
Out of one Corn of Wheat, proceedeth the
Root, the Stalk, the Ear, and the Corn. In
an Egg, which is the Seed of Birds, lurketh
the whole Bird, with all, and every one of its
Limbs, and all the differences of its colours.
In the Seed lieth the Body of the Animals
with all its Limbs, the Heart, the Brains, the
Lungs, the Liver, the Spleen, the Stomach,
the Kidneys, the Bladder, the Nerves, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30448:28"/>
Muſcles, Veins, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every
one of which hath its proper and certain
figure, its colour, and proprieties. Who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
ſo many various things hidden in an
Homogeneal Body, who ſeparateth an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Matter into Bones, Humors, Fleſh,
Griſtles? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None other certainly, but that
Plaſtical Virtue which the Almighty hath
inſerted into all things that were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by Generation. This Virtue giveth
to every Limb its due ſcituation, colour, figure,
proportion, and quality: By its workmanſhip
the Body is hollowed into ſo many Pipes,
Chanels, Paſſages, and Meanders. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we ſuppoſe, that the ſame Plaſtical Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is diffuſed in all the parts of the Seed:
So that it is all in all, and all in every part of
the Seed.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, That the Productions are
ſometimes but one, and ſometimes many;
and that the Production that cometh from
one part of the Seed, is no leſs perfect than
that which cometh from the whole: And
finally, that there is no confuſion nor inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of parts, which of neceſſity ſhould
happen, if it were not uniform with the
Subject; for if one part of the Seed were
taken away, one part of the Production
ſhould alſo be wanting. And thus ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30448:29"/>
happen a Confuſion in the Figure by the
tranſpoſition of the parts: And although
the Seed, in order to the Senſes, ſeem to have
no diſtinct and heterogeneal parts; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
being conſidered in it ſelf, it hath:
Seeing that it is not a ſingle, but a Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of many; for that part of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Virtue which frameth the Brains, ſhall
not frame the Heart or the Liver; and that
part which hath framed the Bones, ſhall not
ſtretch the Membranes, or diſpoſe the Guts
into a winding compaſs. The only difficulty
is, Why that Plaſtick Virtue, which is ſo
confuſedly mixed, yet, worketh without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and diſpoſeth of all things with an
admirable order, and as the Greeks call it
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But this concerning not our Subject at
preſent, we paſs it over, being contented to
have ſtirred up the curious Reader to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
and Study of the <hi>Magnetiſms</hi> and
<hi>Actinoboliſms,</hi> in which he ſhall find matter
enough to ſatisfie himſelf in the proceſs of
Nature, and in the admiration and love of
the Creator. But this digreſſion hath paſſed
a little already the bounds of our Subject, let
us go back from whence we came.</p>
            <p>We conclude then, That the Tincture of

            <head type="sub">Of the Virtues of the Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi>
in the Curing of all Malignant and
Peſtilential Feavers.</head>
            <p>WE give this inſtance firſt, as the moſt
conſiderable, and of greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Theſe Feavers under the notion and
name of a Cold, having deſtroyed ſo many of
late, that a Body cannot without grief, and a
certain horror, read the increaſe of the Bill of
Mortality upon this particular point, while
the Patients flatter themſelves that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Cold; and the Phyſicians, either
by ignorance, wilfulneſs, or mutual Envy,
preſcribe Bleeding, Purging, Bliſtering, and
ſuch other dangerous and prepoſterous
means; which though they may ſometimes
be uſed in other Feavers, yet in this are they
Mortal.</p>
            <p>As firſt for Bleeding, it hath always been
condemned by the moſt judicious in Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Peſtilential Diſeaſes, by reaſon that
it weakneth Nature, by exhauſting the Blood
wherein the Life conſiſteth, by diminiſhing
the Spirits which are the tie of the Soul with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30448:30"/>
the Body, and by ſuffering the venemous
quality to rage the more by ſubſtracting that
ſweet and Natural Juyce, which was rather
to be incouraged for the taming and allaying
of it.</p>
            <p>Purging is neither to be admitted, unleſs
there be an extraordinary fulneſs of Humors,
it being ſufficient to keep the Body ſoluble;
as alſo, becauſe in thoſe Feavers there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a perturbation of Humors, which Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot ſegregate, till they be perfectly
concocted, and appear ſo by the Urines, and
the ſlacking of the bad Symptoms. <hi>Concocta
medicari oportet non cruda,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As little ſignificant as theſe, is the new way
they go about by Bliſtering; for whereas this
Peſtilential Feaver hath its ſeat in the Spirits,
what communion is there between their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
and Bliſters, which do not reach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the skin, ſet the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in torture and anguiſh, and cut the
troath of the Patient before the Wounds can
be cicratrized? This practice ſeeming only
invented to beget Apothecaries practiſe and
Phyſicians ſomewhat to ſay, when they are at
their wits end.</p>
            <p>Now nothing remaineth to overcome ſo
powerful an enemy but <hi>Cordials,</hi> ſo called,
becauſe, without doing any violence to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

or weakening her ſtrength, they directly
go to the Heart, chear it up, fight againſt
the malignity; and as a Light diſperſeth
darkneſs, ſo do theſe, any thing that is ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Mans life. Which being done, that
wholſome temper, in which conſiſteth Life
and Health, taketh place again, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is reſtored to his former ſtate.</p>
            <p>Under that name of <hi>Cordials,</hi> every one
almoſt obtrudeth what his own fancy and
imagination thinketh, or hath heard to be ſo,
though it be but a ſimple Diſtilled Water,
coloured with ſome Sirrup; and thus trifle
away the moſt precious thing of the World,
which is time (as <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſiphon</hi> ſaith) while the
malignity gets footing, and never ceaſeth till
it hath deſtroyed the Patient.</p>
            <p>Now, as we do not deny that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of thoſe Remedies called <hi>Cordials,</hi>
in Nature; ſo we deny that it is every ones
Talent to know them, or the uſe of them,
or the preparation of them. As for example,
What good can be expected from the Water
of a Plant Diſtilled in a Mettallick Furnace,
having been firſt irrorated or ſteeped in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, that the greater quantity may
be drawn, as it is now commonly practiſed.
Beſides the inconveniency of the Metallick
quality of the Limbeck which communicateth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30448:32"/>
it ſelf to the Water, as it is evidently ſeen,
and have often tried my ſelf: For having
occaſion ſeveral times to preſcribe Mineral
Waters, as that of <hi>Epſom, Tunbridge, &amp;c.</hi>
to ſeveral Patients, and among them, to my
own Daughter. It fell out, that the Water
which was brought from the Wells in Bottles,
did agree very well with them, and wrought
effectually without any violence; but when,
by the want of that, I was forced to make uſe
of that which they fell in Town, and keep
in Leaden Ciſterns, I found a contrary effect;
for it wrought ſo untowardly, that it fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me every time; which I could attribute
to nothing elſe, but to the poyſonous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lead, of which the Ciſterns were
made, and in which the Waters were kept.
By this we ſee what a neceſſary thing it is, in
ſuch caſes, and many others, That a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
ſhould be his own Apothecary; and
this I ſpeak meerly for the intereſt of the
truth, being not ignorant how many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed
perſons will contradict it.</p>
            <p>Having ſet down all theſe Notions, it is
alſo requiſite we ſhould ſet down the uſe of
our Tincture of <hi>Coral;</hi> therefore aſſoon as
one falleth into that Malignant or Peſtilential

            <p>Now, as I will not deny but that Plaiſter
may be uſeful in ſome caſes, if it be judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
applied; ſo I affirm, that it is of a
dangerous efficacy, if it be miſapplied, and
chiefly upon tender Bodies, extenuated by
Sickneſs, Faſting, Watching, and Pains;
the Reaſon is, That the <hi>Cantharides</hi> or <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Flies,</hi> which are the <hi>Baſis</hi> of it, are a
moſt deadly Poyſon, and a particular enemy
to the Bladder and Genital Parts, which is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30448:37"/>
ſo much the more prevalent, in that ſome
Apothecaries of their own accord to make the
Plaiſter of a more quick working, have aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the doſe of the <hi>Cantharides.</hi> So that
when this Plaiſter is applied to one ſick of a
Malignant Feaver, and already extenuated
with the diſeaſe of Faſting and Watching, he
hath good luck if he eſcape with life. Thoſe
that are for it, may chance to urge their own
experience, againſt which I ſhall oppoſe mine,
which is of forty years ſtanding; but becauſe
neither they or I ſhould be believed, as being
Partial, I ſhall cite here ſome memorable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
made by ſeveral learned, honeſt,
and famous Authors, to clear this point,
which is of ſo great a conſequence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpeak here of the dangers and
cruel Symptoms that follow the taking of
<hi>Cantharides</hi> inwardly, becauſe they are ſo
generally known, that no body can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
thereof, but thoſe that are altogether
ignorant of Phyſick, I ſhall only mention
the pernicious effects, and ſad conſequences
they cauſe, being applied outwardly. The
firſt Obſervation ſhall be taken out of <hi>Guiliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

A certain Gentleman of the Town of
<hi>Villeneuve,</hi> by the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> having a
cold Tumor in one of his Knees, cauſed by a
cold, and tough Humor, did ask a Barbers
advice, who without taking notice of the
Antecedent Cauſe, went about to cure him
only with Topical Remedies; therefore he
applied firſt Cupping Glaſſes, after that a
Cautery on the ſide of the Kneepan, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to empty the Matter that was gathered.
When theſe did not ſucceed, he applied a
Pulteſs made with <hi>Leaven</hi> and <hi>Cantharides,</hi>
and did exulcerate all the Knee, then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an exceſſive pain about the Knee, reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
a Feaver, and ſeveral other fearful
Symptoms; among which, was a grievous
pain of the Reins, and of all the Belly, and
preſently after ſuch a heat in his Urine, that
he could not make one drop (for it came only
drop by drop, and that Bloody) without the
greateſt torture imaginable. The Pulteſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
removed, he was ſomething the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it had drawn the moſt ſubtle part of the
Humor: Which when the Barber ſaw, he
applied again the ſame Pulteſs of <hi>Cantharides,</hi>
upon which all the ſaid Symptoms became
worſe than before, and chiefly the heat of
Urine, which the Patient feeling would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no more of the ſaid Pulteſs, but diſmiſt

decoction of <hi>Guaiacum, Saſſafraſs,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi>
cauſing him to ſweat gently, that the Matter
about the Knee might melt and evaporate,
after that I applied this Pulteſs of <hi>Vigo.</hi>

That one <hi>Vincentinus Grema,</hi> a famous Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
in his time, took once a Medicine,
the Powders of which had been ſtamped in
a Morter, where <hi>Cantharides,</hi> had been ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before: Whereupon, though he did not
actually eat any <hi>Cantharides,</hi> yet was he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriated
from the Mouth to the Fundament,
and could not get his health again in leſs then
eighteen Moneths ſpace; yet were there no
<hi>Cantharides</hi> in the caſe, but a kind of quality
proceeding from them that ſtuck about the
Morter.</p>
            <p>The fifth Obſervation is out of <hi>Bartholomeus
Montagnana,</hi> a famous Phyſician of <hi>Italy,</hi> who

            <p>The ſixth Obſervation is of a certain Man

did make Bloody Urine; and complaining to

them, no not ſo much as to touch them, or
carry them in his Pocket. Such another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
I was told by <hi>Helidaeus de Paduinis,</hi>

            <p>The ſeventh Obſervation is of a Noble Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who having her Face full of red, burning,
and ugly Pimples, was ſo deformed therewith,
that every Body avoided her as a Leper, and
the Magiſtrates were ready to ſequeſter her
from the common ſociety of Mankind. She
came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where having called for two
Doctors of Phyſick, to wit, <hi>Hollerius</hi> and
<hi>Grealmus,</hi> and two Chirurgeons Mr. <hi>Cabal,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:30448:39"/>
and my ſelf, ſhe inquired with great care and
diligence, if there was no remedy againſt
ſuch a deformity. Having conſidered dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
the diſeaſe, we unanimouſly concluded
that it was no Leproſie, but that it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that a Veſicatory made of <hi>Cantharides</hi>
ſhould be applied all the Face over, three or
four hours after her Bladder began to ake,
and to burn vehemently, and the Neck of the
Womb, to ſwell with gripings, a continual
vomiting, and making of water, a raving
carriage of all her Limbs, and a Burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
I called for the Phyſicians again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
the concluſion was, That we ſhould
give her much Milk to drink, and inject ſome
in the Guts by the Fundament, and into the
Womb and Bladder by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rethra;</hi> that ſhe
ſhould go into a lukewarm Bath, wherein
ſhould have been boiled <hi>Linſeeds,</hi> the Roots
and Leaves of <hi>Mallows</hi> and <hi>Marſh-Mallows,</hi>
of <hi>Violets, Hemlock, Purſleine,</hi> and <hi>Lettice;</hi>
and ſo to continue, from time to time, till the
pain was quite ceaſed. That the Reins and
Genital Parts ſhould be anointed with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum
Roſatum</hi> and <hi>Populeon,</hi> diſſolved
and mixed with <hi>Oxycrat.</hi> By theſe means all
the Symptomes vaniſhed away, in the mean
time the Face was full of Bliſters, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broke, a great deal of Matter iſſued out,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30448:40"/>
and the deformity was cured, inſomuch, that
a little while after ſhe was married, and had
many Children. <hi>Ambroſius Paraeus, Lib.</hi> 5.
<hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>For my own part I can certifie, that my
youngeſt Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being about
thirteen or fourteen years old, and very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſore eyes; after I had purged her, and
let her blood in the foot, I applied a Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> at the bottom of her
neck, thinking to make a diverſion of the
Humor, but within three or four hour after
ſhe fell ſtark lame of her right hip, ſo that I
was forced preſently to remove the Veſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and for all that, the lameneſs continued
three or four weeks after. By what I have
ſaid, it is apparent what a dangerous thing
<hi>Cantharides</hi> is, not only inwardly given, in
which caſe they are a deadly poyſon, but alſo
outwardly applied; as is ſeen by the ſeveral
Obſervations I have made here, and many
more may be taken out of <hi>Foreſtus, Cabrolius,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could alſo here relate ſome fatal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of my own, and of which, I have
been a ſad eye-witneſs; but that I do not
love to renew the grief of the living Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor to inſult on the miſcarriage of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
knowing that we are all faulty, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30448:40"/>
that againſt death we have no power but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs.</p>
            <p>From theſe things we may perceive the
truth of what <hi>Mathiolus</hi> ſaith upon the Sixth
Book of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> where he hath theſe
words.</p>
            <p>Cantharides <hi>are hurtful chiefly to the Bladder,
and to all the parts that ſerve for the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, not only being taken inwardly,
but alſo being applied outwardly where there is
occaſion to Bliſter, chiefly when they are mixed
with large Pulteſſes, and are applied to places
near the Bladder, to wit, the Hips, the Privy
Parts, the Kidneys, or the Stones.</hi> Thus far
<hi>Mathiolus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if any Body will make uſe of
them, it is neceſſary he ſhould do it prudently
and circumſpectly, chiefly let the young Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
take heed, leaſt in preſcribing Remedies
which admit of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> they do not
err in quantity; for becauſe <hi>Cantharides</hi> are
ſo light, that fifty of them weigh ſcarce one
drachm, the Error is eaſie to be committed.
Nay, the moſt ingenuous of the Apothecaries
have confeſſed to me, that in the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their <hi>Emplaſtrum Epiſpaſticon,</hi> they
double the doſe of <hi>Cantharides</hi> to make it of
a quicker working. Who ſhall be ſo bold after
this, to make uſe of ſo pernicious a Remedy,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30448:41"/>
and chiefly in Malignant Feavers, where the
Poyſon is inward, the Vitals dejected, the
Natural ſtrength abated, and no good can be
alledged to come out of this Remedy? All
the excuſe being, that it is a common practice
about the Town, that is, a common and a
pernicious Vulgar Error. Away then with
thoſe dangerous things, more peſtilent many
times then the diſeaſe it ſelf; and let us turn
our practiſe to a ſafer and nobler way, that is,
our Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> which without danger,
but rather with a great deal of pleaſure, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth

            <p>I am not here to expreſs the Nature of all
Feavers, which belongeth to the general
knowledge of Phyſick, and would ſwell
this little Treatiſe into a Volume, but to
touch as much of them as will ſerve our own
intention, and to ſhew how the Tincture of
<hi>Coral</hi> is, and may be a Sovereign Remedy for
them: Therefore leaving aſides their ſeveral
Definitions, Diviſions, and Controverſies,
we ſhall only mark the chief Grounds of their
Nature, and the Analogy that is between it
and their Remedy, to wit, The Tincture of
<hi>Coral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then let it be eſtabliſhed, that a Feaver
is a hot intempery proceeding from a Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
heat kindled in the Heart; and from
thence diſperſed into all the Body, by the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30448:42"/>
means of the Veins and Arteries, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Natural Actions. The chief Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the curing of them, is to take away
that Preternatural heat, and to reduce the
Body into its former temper, as we ſee, that
all things after they have left their boiling and
fermenting, and are cooled, become purer
then they were before. Wherein it is to be
obſerved, that the Natural heat, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural,
differ chiefly in this, That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
heat is a Subſtance, and the Preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
only a Quality. The ignorance of this
difference is the cauſe, that ſo many miſcarry
in Feavers; for when Phyſicians go about
that Preternatural heat (ſuppoſe by Bleeding)
they altogether quench the Natural one,
which by all means ought to be preſerved, and
ſo haſten the Diſſolution of the Patient, by
taking away the <hi>Baſis,</hi> upon which, Life is
founded: For what need is it, if one deſireth
to take away the Preternatural heat, and ſo
to cure a Feaver, that he ſhould alſo take
with it the Natural one, in which conſiſteth a
Mans life; for the Preternatural heat being
once removed, the other remaineth free for
the exerciſing harmonically the Functions of
the Body. The only eaſie, and ſure way
therefore to cure Feavers, is to extinguiſh the
Preternatural heat, without doing prejudice
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30448:42"/>
to the Natural one, but rather comforting and
ſtrengthning it.</p>
            <p>Now I affirm, that this cannot be done
ſafely but by ſeparating the Preternatural heat
from the Natural; and ſo expelling the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural,
while the Natural remaineth in
liberty, to perform the Functions of Nature;
which being helped by noble and harmleſs
Remedies, will quickly and ſafely disburden
her ſelf of what is noxious and ſpurious, as
we have ſhewed before in the example of
<hi>Anſelmus de Booth:</hi> And this by an Univerſal
Evacuation thorough the Pores, becauſe the
diſeaſe is univerſally diſperſed thorough the
whole Body; which by this means is not only
lightned of its burden, but comforted and
ſtrengthned by the virtue and efficacy of this
noble Remedy.</p>
            <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, That the Natural
heat is Celeſtial, as flowing from the Sun, <hi>Sol
&amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> and the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
is Elementary; and therefore eaſily
ſeparable from the other: But ſome Body
will object perhaps, that beſides the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
heat which makes a Feaver, there may
be mixed with it a Latent Malignity, and ask
what ſhall become of it? I anſwer, That the
Preternatural heat, and the Malignity go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
together in the Evacuation; for the way
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30448:43"/>
way through the Pores, being free and open,
and this Remedy being one of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Cordials in the World, driveth away from
the Heart, that is, from the Center to the
Circumference, whatſoever is an Enemy to
the Humane Body, and that with a great deal
of eaſe and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Now concerning thoſe Feavers called <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent,</hi>
or as the vulgar termeth them, <hi>Agues,</hi>
the Method and Remedy is the ſame, except
that the <hi>Salt of Coral</hi> muſt be mixed with
the Tincture, becauſe theſe Agues have their
foundation in a toughter matter then the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
to wit, in the Humors; as the Tertian
in Choler, the Quotidian in Phlegm, the
Quartan in Melancholy, wherein they harbor,
as in their proper Ferment, which they will
hardly forſake till it be deſtroyed. Now the
<hi>Tincture of Coral</hi> alone, being too Formal
and Spiritual to deſtroy and diſperſe thoſe
earthly droſſes, we in this caſe joyn with it
the <hi>Salt,</hi> which cutteth and inciſeth the tough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the matter and denſity, and prepareth
it to expulſion, when the <hi>Tincture</hi> cometh to
radiate upon it.</p>
            <p>I have thus a little inlarged my ſelf upon
this ſubject of Feavers, becauſe there is no
diſeaſe more vulgar and frequent; for ſeeing
that moſt of other diſeaſes do not ſeiſe upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30448:43"/>
Humane Bodies equally, but are more or leſs
familiar to ſome Ages, Regions, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of Bodies then others; there is no
Age, Region, and Conſtitution of Body, that
can promiſe to it ſelf a freedom from Feaver;
and, as it is a frequent diſeaſe, ſo is it moſt
dangerous, and not without cauſe: For it
occupieth the Storehouſe of the Natural and
Vivifying heat, waſteth and deſtroyeth it, and
unleſs that Fiery and Preternatural heat be
timely prevented, it ſcattereth and devoureth
the Natural one; which being the Treaſure
of Life, Death is preſently at the door, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that moſt people die of that diſeaſe;
or rather, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nemo ſine febre mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur,</hi>
No Body dies without a Feaver; which
is the reaſon, that the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> having
a mind to court it, and to render it propitious
unto themſelves, did build it a Temple and
Worſhipped it ſuperſtitiouſly as a Goddeſs;
as <hi>Plinius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Auguſt. de

               <head>Againſt Surfeitings.</head>
               <p>There are two kinds of Surfeits, one in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
the other in quality, but both many
times mortal. The Surfeit in quantity is, when
one eateth or drinketh more then his appetite
deſireth, and his ſtrength can bear. The Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
in quality is, when one eateth or drinketh
never ſo little of a thing that he hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
againſt; both are immediately cured by
the Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> mixed with our <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Water;</hi> not as the former Diſeaſes we
have made mention of, either by Specifick
qualities or Actinoboliſms, but by their grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and friendlineſs to our nature, which
when it lieth under the burden of a Surfeit,
and findeth the gratefulneſs of this Remedy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30448:49"/>
it graſpeth upon it, and lets fall the Matter of
the Surfeit, which being looſed it expelleth
by Vomiting, without leaving any Particle of
it behind, and ſo is immediately well, as I
have tried many times, even to the admiration
of the beholders.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="disease">
               <head>Againſt Vomitings.</head>
               <p>This is a pernicious Symptom which is
much in reign, when a Patient can retain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in his Stomach, but immediately bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it up all again, whether Meat, Drink, or
Phyſick. But this Tincture, and its Vehicle
are ſo friendly to Nature, and of ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Virtue, that it will immediately ſtay
the Vomiting; And if there be any Cauſe of
it, will bring it up, or if the Remedy ſtayeth
with the Cauſe of the Vomiting in the Body,
it will certainly conquer and deſtroy it.</p>

            <div type="commentary">
               <p>Many more other Diſeaſes could I mention,
in which the Tincture of <hi>Coral</hi> would effect
wonderful things. But I think theſe will be
ſufficient for any reaſonable and ingenuous
perſon: Thoſe that will know more, may
adviſe with the Author, who ſhall ingenuouſly
tell them if it be fit for their diſtemper or not,
and in what Vehicle it muſt be taken; advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them ſeriouſly, That if they receive no
benefit by this Remedy in thoſe Diſeaſes for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30448:50"/>
which it is properly adminiſtred, they can
hardly expect it from any other. The Author
having alſo a peculiar Talent to judge of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and the Remedies thereof, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
of Urines, deſireth thoſe that will
ſave charges or lives, afar of, to ſend their
Water; by the examination of which, they
ſhall receive all reaſonable ſatisfaction: And
for theſe purpoſes and others, he ſhall give
his conſtant attendance at his own Houſe, from
eight of the clock in the Morning, till eleven;
and from three in the Afternoon, till five.

            <head type="sub">How and in what Vehicles the Tincture
of <hi>Coral</hi> is to be administred.</head>
            <p>THis Tincture being ſo noble and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and working ſo powerfully in ſo
little a quantity, is to be uſed with all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
imaginable, that there be no waſte
in the quantity, nor impediment in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
There would be a great waſte in the
quantity, if it were taken alone, and by it
ſelf, conſidering, That one pound of <hi>Coral</hi>
will ſcarce yield above one drachm of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
therefore we give it in a little quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(ſuppoſe of about twenty drops) in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Vehicle, ſuppoſe of two or three ounces;
that by its diffuſion in it, it may go and enter
over all the noble parts of the Body; as you
ſee that a grain of <hi>Cochenille</hi> will die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times of its weight of Water; and that
<hi>Saffron</hi> will diffuſe its Tincture in a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
quantity of liquor. There would alſo
be a waſte in the quantity, if the Tincture
were given alone, and by it ſelf; for the
Natural heat would conſume it, before it could
diffuſe its virtue, and radiate thorough the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30448:51"/>
whole Body. Add alſo, that a Specifick Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
will make it work more effectually and
determinately upon the part aimed at. There
would be alſo an impediment in the quality,
if it were not given in a Vehicle that were
unfit, or contrary to the diſtemper that it is
given for; as if of two Horſes, the one ſhould
draw before, and the other back, they could
hardly reach home in a convenient time; or,
if it were given amongſt Meat, or upon a full
Stomach, it is evident, that its virtue ſhould
be drowned, and its Radiation hindered: As
when a thick cloud is interpoſed between the
Sun, and us. For the illuſtration of what we
have ſaid, it is viſible, and in a manner palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
That if the ſaid Tincture were given
againſt the Plague and Malignant Feavers in
<hi>Plantain Water,</hi> it would hardly work the
deſired effect, becauſe <hi>Plantain Water</hi> is cool
and aſtringent; and our intention in this, is
to expel the malignity of the Plague and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
by a moderate ſweat, which cannot be
conveniently procured, but by a hot Vehicle,
ſuch as is our Cordial Water, or that of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus,</hi>
and ſuch other-like. Contrariwiſe, if
in immoderate Fluxes of Women and Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies,
it be adminiſtred in hot Vehicles,
and not in cool and Aſtringent ones, ſuch as
<hi>Plantain Water</hi> is, little good can be expected
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30448:51"/>
of it, by reaſon of the contrariety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
that is between the Agent and the
Patient, that is, the Remedy and the Diſeaſe.
Let it therefore be concluded, That it muſt
be given in a proper Vehicle, that is, ſuch
a one, as is proper for the diſtemper,
and will forward the effect of the ſaid Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and hath a peculiar analogy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the Diſeaſe aimed at. As
for example, For the ſtopping of all immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Fluxes in Men and Women, it ought
to be given in <hi>Plantain Water,</hi> or the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Roots of <hi>Tormentil.</hi> For the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or renewing of the Blood, in <hi>Fumitory</hi>
or <hi>Cichory Water.</hi> For ſtrengthning the Heart
and the Vital Spirits, in <hi>Bugloſs,</hi> or <hi>Borrage
Water.</hi> For comforting and ſtrengthning the
Stomach, in <hi>Mint</hi> or <hi>Penniroyal Water.</hi> For
removing of obſtructions in <hi>Sorrel Water,
Little Centaury, Spleenwort, Liverwort.</hi> For
diſſolving congealed Blood, in Water of <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
or <hi>Daiſie.</hi> For the Fits of the Mother, in
the Water of <hi>Motherwort, Balm, Penniroyal.</hi>
For the Dropſie, Convulſion, Palſie, Falling-Sickneſs,
in <hi>Cinnamon Water,</hi> continuing for
a while, becauſe thoſe Diſeaſes are ſtubborn.
For the Stone and Gravel, in <hi>Saxifrage</hi> or
<hi>Reſtharrow Water.</hi> The doſe is from ſix grains
or ten, to a ſcruple or two, according to the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30448:52"/>
age and ſtrength of the Patient, and the
greatneſs of the diſtemper: And ſo it may
be ſaid of all the reſt of the diſtempers which
it is proper for. Upon which, the Author
will give his advice to thoſe that ſhall deſire
it; and for that purpoſe, ſhall give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
attendance at his own Houſe, from eight
of the clock in the Morning, till eleven; and
from three in the Afternoon, till five. The
ſame Author having alſo a ſpecial Talent to
judge of Diſeaſes, and the Remedies thereof,
by the Inſpection of Urines, may be adviſed
with at the ſaid time; therefore thoſe that
ſhall be minded to ſave the charges of Fees,
may at the ſaid time bring or ſend their Urine,
upon ſight whereof, they ſhall receive all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>As for the ſaid Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> with the
Vehicles proper for it, they are only to be had
and miniſtred by him, to prevent all ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
falſification, or miſtakes, the World,
at preſent, being ſo full of Envy, Backbiting,
and Deceitfulneſs, that he dares truſt no Body
with it; but is reſolved, as he is the ſole
Author of it, ſo to have all the praiſe of it,
and bear all the blame alone, if any be. He
alſo carrieth always ſome of the ſaid Tincture
about him, ready to be adminiſtred, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
occaſion ſhall require, that no time
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30448:52"/>
may be loſt, as moſt commonly it is, in acute
and exceeding haſty Diſeaſes. That ſhall not
hinder, but if any Body be ſatisfied with the
Virtues and Effects of the ſaid Tincture, he
may have of him what quantity he pleaſeth
to lie by him, againſt the time of need; and
this he doth to make good his Motto, which
alſo was that of <hi>Cardan. Io ſuon Medico non di
