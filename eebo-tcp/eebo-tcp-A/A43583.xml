         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Deſire after Happineſs is ſo ingraven in the Nature of Man, that it was never put to the debate, whether he would be happy or no? This needs no choice; all are agreed in this as the end of a rational Agent: And therefore at
<pb facs="tcp:32940:3"/>laſt Felicity was accounted a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells us, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> built her a Temple; only he wonders that the <hi>Romans</hi> that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of ſo many Gods, had not given Divine Honour to Felicity ſooner; which alone would have ſufficed in ſtead of all the reſt of their Deities, which he reckons up, and ſaith at laſt of <hi>Numa,</hi> that having choſen ſo many Gods and Goddeſſes, 'tis ſtrange he neglected this; <hi>[An eam forte in tanta tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bâ videre non potuit?]</hi> but though they at laſt had got a notion of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, yet having no true Piety, that veneration ended in the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and infelicity, nothing but Wars enſued. <hi>Vid. Aug. de civit. Dei, lib 4. cap. 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the caſe: All men would be happy, but few know the due object and true means leading to Happineſs; <hi>It is poſſible</hi> (as the
<pb facs="tcp:32940:3"/>ſame Father ſaith there) <hi>to find a man that is unwilling to be made King; [nullus autem invenitur, qui ſe nolit eſſe foelicem]</hi> that is, loath to be made happy: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt men blunder in the dark, and few find the thing they ſeek: The ſame Father tells us, <hi>(de civ. Dei, lib 19. c. 1.)</hi> that <hi>Varro</hi> in his Book of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that had diligently ſearched the various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men about the chiefeſt good, reduceth them to two hundred eighty eight Sects or Sentences; <hi>[non quae jam eſſent, ſed quae eſſe poſſent?]</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reduceth them to their ſeveral heads: But I paſs by Heathens that are bewildred in the dark, and know no better: Even profeſſing or pretended Chriſtians either do not underſtand, or will not embrace the way of Peace and Reſt. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to ſee if there were any
<pb facs="tcp:32940:4"/>that did underſtand and ſeek God. They are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one. Pſal. 14.2, 3.</hi> All mankind is degenerate; and few are regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: We ſet out for Hell as ſoon as we are born; and till converting Grace turn us Heaven-wards we go blindfold to the pit: <hi>The whole World lyeth in ignorance and wickedneſs. 1 Joh. 5.19.</hi> But no ſuch ignorance as that which is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather then light, becauſe their deeds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; Joh. 3.19.</hi> No man periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but by his own will. Men will ſin, and love death rather then life. <hi>You will not come to me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that you may have life. Joh. 5.40.</hi> He that rejecteth the means, rejecteth the end: <hi>All they that hate Chriſt, love death:
<pb facs="tcp:32940:4"/>Prov. 8.36.</hi> They do both, not directly, or deſignedly, but interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, and conſequentially. Moſt men <hi>obſerve lying vanities, and ſo forſake their own Mercies. Jon. 2.8.</hi> as he leaves the East that goes to the Weſt: <hi>My people,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have committed two evils,</hi> [Obſerve it; it's but one act, yet there's two evils in it, what are they?] <hi>they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that can hold no water. Jer. 2.13.</hi> Oh what evil is in the bowels of one ſin! But eſpecially in the ſin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief. The evil of ſin brings on the evil of puniſhment. Miſs of Heaven, and you purchaſe Hell. What mad man will refuſe this gift that is better then Gold? What beast will run into a pit or praecipice? But ſome men make a jeſt of Heaven; as that Biſhop, who, when one ſaid, <hi>I hope to ſee
<pb facs="tcp:32940:5"/>you at your Dioceſs ere long;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>I fear I ſhall be in Heaven before that time come:</hi> Others, like <hi>Martha,</hi> are ſo incumbred in the World, that they are ſtaked down to Terrene Objects; and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as he that being asked, if he ſaw the Eclipſe, anſwered, <hi>No, I have ſo much buſineſs on Earth, that I have no leiſure to look up to Heaven:</hi> This is moſt mens eaſe. Alas, the World eats out many mens Religion, as the Sun ſhining eats out the fire: So that men are as dead to Religion, as if Heaven were but a dream; and as hot upon ſin, as if Hell had no fire, or were all vaniſht into ſmoke: Nay, it's well, if ſome look not on Heaven and Hell, as if they were but a Fable or Romance, a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow to fright weak headed people, or the meer invention of deſigning Prieſts to keep men in awe: But they ſhall know one day to their coſt,
<pb facs="tcp:32940:5"/>that there is an Heaven by the loſs of it, and that there is an Hell by the torments of it: Let theſe ask the rich man in torment, whether there is an Hell or no? <hi>Targum</hi> ſaith, the diſpute betwixt <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> was, concerning a World to come: And indeed this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt the faithful and unbelievers: Though the wicked ſay the Creed, wherein they profeſs a belief of the Reſurrection, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Eternal Life; yet its but notional, not experimental, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical: They know nothing of it ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, inchoatively, by feeling the beginnings of it here, and living to the rates of it: It is to be feared that the greateſt part of Mankind will fall to the Devils ſhare: How little are men concerned about a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate! How many put away from them the evil day! Some have a fooliſh imagination that Heaven is every where; that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:32940:6"/>Heaven nor Hell but in a mans own Conſcience, and then they can ſhift well enough; for they can ſtop the mouth of a bawling Conſcience, and ſpeak Peace to themſelves: But how long will either of theſe laſt? When God arms a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himſelf, he ſhall be a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gormiſſabib,</hi> a fear round about: Witneſs <hi>Cain, Saul, Judas,</hi> that thought Hell was eaſier then his own Conſcience, and therefore deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leapt into it; to the cruſhing of his Body, and the damning of his Soul: They ſhall find that there is an Heaven and Hell after this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life is ended. It is recorded of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> that he lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Death-bed diſcourſed ſweetly of Heaven; <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſtanding by alleadged that in <hi>Phil. 3.20. Our Converſation is in Heaven:</hi> True, ſaid the ſick man, it is in Heaven, <hi>[ſed non in Coelo</hi> Brentii, <hi>quod nuſquam eſt,]</hi> not in the Heaven
<pb facs="tcp:32940:6"/>of <hi>Brentius;</hi> which is no where: There is doubtleſs a <hi>[Coelum Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreum,]</hi> called a <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Paradice,</hi> into which <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt in his Extacy, <hi>2 Cor. 12.2, 4.</hi> into which Christ was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body and Soul, <hi>Luke 24.51.</hi> The habitation of Gods Holineſs and Glory, <hi>Iſa. 63.15.</hi> Its true God himſelf is called Heaven, <hi>Dan. 4.26. The Heavens do rule.</hi> So <hi>Matth. 21.25.</hi> And its as true, <hi>God fills Heaven and Earth, Jer. 23.24.</hi> And its true, where the King is there is the Court: But yet God manifeſts himſelf far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently in all places; he is in Hell by the execution of his Juſtice, in Heaven by manifeſtation of his Grace, on Earth by diſplaying both, and his other Glorious Attributes, according to his infinite Wiſdom and Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But let vain Men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their fond conceits; or
<pb facs="tcp:32940:7"/>deſperately leap into the other World, let you and me duely weigh the vaſt difference betwixt Graceleſs and Gracious Souls in this and in the other World, and though men will not believe, becauſe they ſee not any ſuch difference; yet a time is coming, <hi>when they ſhall return and diſcern betwixt the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not. Mal. 3.18.</hi> Then all the World muſt be ranked into two Regiments, <hi>ſheep and goats; the one at Chriſts right hand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his left; to the one he will ſay, come ye bleſſed, to the other go ye curſed. Mat. 25.32—46.</hi> They that love not to hear diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Truths here, ſhall meet with diſcriminating Acts at that day: And can we think that there will be ſuch a difference at that day, and is there none in this World? Yes certainly: <hi>Though all things
<pb facs="tcp:32940:7"/>come alike to all,</hi> as to common Providences in this World, <hi>Eccleſ. 9.2.</hi> yet Grace makes a difference in Perſons diſpoſitions here, and there will be a vast difference in Divine Dispenſations hereafter, much greater then betwixt a Man and a Bruit; yea, like that which is betwixt an Angel and a Devil. Oh that men would ſtudy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this now! Grace makes the difference now, and Glory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In point of Aſſimilation: <hi>Gods Children are like their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, but ſhall be more like him at that day; 1 Joh. 3.2.</hi> Our former ſimilitude is from Faith, and ſo imperfect; but the latter is from immediate Viſion, and ſo perfect and compleat.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In point of Satisfaction: In this World the weary Soul is work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards its reſt, <hi>Pſal. 116.7.</hi> and doth by Faith enter into this
<pb facs="tcp:32940:8"/>reſt; <hi>Heb. 4.3.</hi> yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaining, <hi>ver. 9.</hi> Some ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is in Ordinances, <hi>Pſal. 36.8.</hi> but more in that Bleſſed Morning, when Gods Children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, <hi>Pſal. 17.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In point of Participation: For Gods Children are not tantali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, by beholding that they have no right to; no, they have Heaven by appropriation by Faith here, ſo <hi>Eph. 2.8.</hi> and by compleat poſſeſſion in the other World; abundant evidence of peculiar relation, <hi>Rev. 21.3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>O ye Children of men, prove your Fathers will, and your ſelves Children; make ſure of this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; make no reckoning of the ſtuff of this World; for the good of the upper Country above is before you; Heaven will pay for all your loſſes, and countervail all your croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here: No matter how your Names are written on Earth, in Duſt or Marble, if they be written in Heaven. Some ſay this World is but a ſhadow of that above; look you for the lineaments of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom above, to be pourtrayed on you. <hi>Baſil</hi> aſſerted One Hundred Sixty
<pb facs="tcp:32940:9"/>Five Heavens. You muſt paſs by all the fancyed Heavens of Men, <hi>and look for a City that hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe builder and maker is God. Heb. 11.10.</hi> Take this Kingdom of Heaven by violence. <hi>Matth. 11.12.</hi> Get a Copy of Grace in your hearts out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Records, the Court Rolls of Heaven; ſo you are ſure of it, <hi>and lay hold of Eternal Life. 1 Tim. 6.19.</hi> Heaven muſt be begun here, or never enjoyed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Holineſs of Heart and Life is like the Old Teſtament Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, an example and ſhadow of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. Happineſs is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of good, commenſurate to our deſires; and our deſires muſt be ſuited to that happineſs. Criticks obſerve, that the word [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] which ſignifies happineſs, is plural; not only denoting a confluence of many good things to make one happy, but becauſe there is an happineſs in
<pb facs="tcp:32940:9"/>this life, preparing for and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the happineſs in the other. They differ not in kind but degree; that above is the ſame ſtate, but in an higher ſtature; the ſame Book but in a more correct Edition, and a larger Character. The Saints above differ from us as Man from a Child, as Noon ſun from the Morning light; we are in the ſame houſe, only they are got into the upper room; at the ſame feaſt only they are at the upper end of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let us make haſt after them: They were once as you are, grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on this Dung-hill, but are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the Throne; aſpire you to the ſame preferment: It may be had, it must be had or you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: Study the way of God, how this Inheritance is made over to the Sons of Men, and that is, <hi>1.</hi> By <hi>Regeneration. Matth. 19.28.2.</hi> By <hi>Adoption. Romans 8.17.3.</hi> By <hi>Donation. Luke 12.32.

            <p>But this is not all; you are not only to get and clear up a title to this Inheritance, but to preſs after a due meetneſs for it; and this is the deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, which was (for the ſubſtance of it) Preached and Writ Thirty Five Years ago, and now reviſed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon theſe Conſiderations.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

What is man, what am I, the leaſt and worſt of the children of men, that the heart of God ſhould be working for me, and towards me, in infinite bowels of eternal love!

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32940:20"/>pleaſing to God; ſo a legal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not attainable; <hi>We have all ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23, 24. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.2, 3, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.13.</p>

Nor can Humane Sufferings purchaſe this Glory to be revealed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Diſt.</hi> There is [<hi>aptitudo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta &amp; progreſſiva,</hi>] a perfect, compleat meetneſs for Heaven:

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32940:23"/>himſelf hath contrived a way how to ſettle the beſt Inheritance on ſuch as he finds ſtrangers. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>But I ſaid, how ſhall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a pleaſant land, a goodly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage of the hoſts of Nations? Then I ſaid thou ſhalt call me, my Father, and ſhalt not turn away from me:</hi> Oh bleſſed contrivance! And will any think to croſs Gods contrivance! Shall Mens ſolly challenge infinite Wiſdom! Is not the Heavenly Inheritance Gods own to give? And doth not our Lord ſay, <hi>ſuch honour ſhall be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. Matth.</hi> 20.23. Can you think to wreſt Heaven out of Gods hands whether he will or not? And muſt he falſifie his word to gratifie you? Will he ſet the Crown on Rebels heads?

And have you the Spirit of his Son in your hearts to cry Abba Father? which elſewhere is called <hi>the ſpirit of Adoption. Rom.</hi> 8.15. Tell me not that all Men are the Sons of

See there the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge annexed: Obſerve it, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion makes Saints, and only Saints partake of this Inheritance: If all the Men on Earth, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, ſhould joyn their Forces together, they could not ſave one unconverted Soul: Truth it ſelf hath aſſerted it with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſeveration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> The like doth the ſame mouth aſſert with a fourfold aſſeveration; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, 5. I wonder often how careleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32940:25"/>ners that are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that never any ſuch work paſſed on them, can eat and drink, or ſleep quietly, and never ſo much as ask this queſtion; Am I converted or am I not? If I be, when or how did my Soul paſs through the pangs of the new birth? What tears, fears, what groans and agonies hath it coſt me? What fruits hath it brought forth in me? Where's this new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Divine Nature, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Seed of God working Heaven-wards? What ſtamp, what ſheep-mark can I ſhew, as the fruit of Gods being at work on my Soul, and an earneſt of this glorious Inheritance? But if there be no ſuch change, (as I doubt there is not) how can I be quiet? Sure my pillow is ſoft, or my heart hard, and my Conſcience ſeared, that hear or read my own doom in ſuch a Scripture, from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32940:26"/>the mouth of the Judge himſelf, ſtanding at Heaven-gates and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me out, as if he named me, ſaying, Be gone thou unconverted ſinner; I know thee not; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace never changed thy Heart or Life; though I often ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned thee, and knockt at thy door, yet thou hadſt no heart or deſire to turn from thy ſinful ways, nor ſo much as fall down on thy knees, and ask this grace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of me, or uſe the means for it, or ſo much as examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt it or no, but went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt on in a golden dream, and now I muſt tell thee roundly to thy coſt, depart, oh be gone from my preſence thou poor wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſinner: This ſtate, this place is for none but ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>

Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:32940:27"/>50.16. What ground haſt thou to own me? Or to claim any thing from me for this world or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Man as a creature can have no intercourſe with God, but in a Covenant-way; much leſs can a ſinner expect any good from God, but by vertue of Covenant: But what canſt thou ſay for this promiſed Inheritance, that haſt nothing to do with the promiſes? <hi>For all the promiſes of God in Chriſt are yea and amen;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. But thou haſt never ſpent one hour ſolemnly to review and renew thy Baptiſmal Covenant, and ingage thy Soul to God; and ſince thou art an Alien from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a ſtranger from the Covenant of Promiſe, by conſequence thou art without Chriſt, and without God in this world, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of a better ſtate in the other world: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.

Sinner think of this, thou that loveſt to be looſe, and ſcorneſt the ſetters of this Holy League; thou doſt in effect ſay, I will have none of God, Chriſt, Pardon, Heaven: If I muſt have them on no other terms, but under ſuch bonds and obligations, let them take this Heavenly Inheritance for me: And doſt thou think this golden chain of honour, worſe then the Devils iron fetters of ſin, and amazing reward of flames and torments? If you need not God and Heaven, be it known to you, God needs not you; but can ſtrain for the revenue of Glory to

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32940:30"/>every grace doth qualifie for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for grace is glory begun, and glory is grace conſummate: But there are ſome graces that have a direct tendency to, and whereby a Chriſtian doth (as it were) <hi>lay hold on eternal life,</hi> as the word is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12, 19. <hi>e. g.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The grace of Faith, which <hi>is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and evidence of things not ſeen. Heb.</hi> 11.1. It ventures all upon a promiſe; <hi>ſees him that is in viſible, ver.</hi> 27. and repreſents Heavenly Objects as cloſe at hand, <hi>and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth them, v.</hi> 13. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] drawing the Object to them, as the word ſignifies: Overlooking or overcoming all theſe worldly viſible Objects. Faith ſpyes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond Time or Clouds, of more worth then all the World, and hazards all for the obtaining of it: When Faith is upon the wing, it ſoars above the Sun, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32940:31"/>fetcheth down Heavenly objects and incomes into the Soul: It is like the ſpyes, and brings a cluſter of the grapes of <hi>Canaan;</hi> even <hi>Joy and peace in believing, Rom.</hi> 15.13. yea, <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Yea, the loweſt actings of the faith of adherence dare commit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul into his Creators hands, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <hi>God will keep that which he hath committed to him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And this compoſedneſs is an antedating of Heaven. Alas, faith the poor Chriſtian, I know not certainly how I ſtand for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; I dare not yet ſay my Faith will end in the ſaving of my Soul; but this I dare ſay, God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſouls; Chriſt dyed for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he is faithful that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; the Covenant is well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and ſure ſome Souls ſhall be ſaved, and why not I? I hang
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32940:31"/>on his Free-grace, I come with Tears in my Eyes, Confeſſion in my Mouth, Grief in my Heart for my ſins; I am weary of my burden and labour in my travels God-wards, who can tell but. I may find reſt? He hath ſaid, <hi>thoſe that thus come to him he will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> I will venture this way: I have tryed all other ways but they are in vain; its but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my labour, which I am ſure I ſhall not, if my Faith be but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: This Soul is in the confines of the promiſed Land; and is meet for this Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Hope. As Faith brought Heaven down to the Souls Eye, ſo Hope carries out the Soul to this future enjoyment. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor is caſt into the vaſt Ocean of Eternity, but finds ſure Anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, for it <hi>enters into that within the Vail, Heb.</hi> 6.19. and this centers the toſſing ſinner on the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32940:32"/>rock of Ages: It ſees Heaven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and it ſelf in Gods time advanced with <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Boſom, and is content at preſent to bear the roughneſs and affronts he meets with in his way, ſaying, theſe things will be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when I get home: Nay, the Text ſaith, <hi>we are ſaved by hope, Rom</hi> 8.24. Hope anticipates its revenues, and like a young heir takes up upon truſt, and lives at the rate of that Inheritance he is heir to. Thus the Chriſtian gets everlaſting Conſolation, becauſe <hi>he hath good hopes through Grace,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. O ſaith the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Divine Revelations have ſo fully demonſtrated the reality of future Glory, that my Faith no more doubts of it then of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bed at night, and why ſhould not <hi>my Fleſh</hi> (and Spirit) <hi>reſt in hope? Pſal.</hi> 16.9. Why ſhould not then my heart be glad?
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32940:32"/>Why may not my glory rejoyce? Yea, <hi>I will rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, for my hope will not make me aſhamed. Rom.</hi> 5.2, 5. I dare venture my hopes and my all in this bleſſed Covenant-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. <hi>My ſoul, hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, and that for ever. Pſal.</hi> 42.11.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Love: That's a grace that ſhines brighteſt in its proper Orb above; but the more it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed here below, the more of Heaven: Love reſembles the Soul moſt to God, and raiſeth the Soul to an Heavenly Life: <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. The Soul that is carried out to God in pure flames of holy love, hath mounted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the higheſt Region, and bathes it ſelf in thoſe pure ſtreams that raiſe and raviſh the Spirit in a continued extaſie: The more
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32940:33"/>Love, the more fittedneſs for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>If love be increaſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, our hearts are eſtabliſhed unblameable — at his coming,</hi> 1 <hi>Th.</hi> 3.12, 13. Yea, the more Love, the more of Heaven; for what is our love, but a reflexion of Gods love; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. Oh, ſaith the Chriſtian, I feel the ſweet beams of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs warming my heart; methinks thoſe Heavenly ſparks have ſet me in a flame, that when I am Muſing the fire burns; when I am Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Praiſing God, my Soul mounts up to my Lord as pillars of ſmoak; and I love to be near him, and to be acting for him. Oh how ſweet is every Love-letter that comes from him! How pleaſant are ſome tokens of love that come from the hand and heart of my beloved! Here is the ſoul that is meet for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Humility and Self-denyal.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32940:33"/>Will you believe it? The lower the Chriſtian caſts himſelf down, the nearer Heaven: But this is a truth; <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> God makes his court in the humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. Oh ſaith Chriſtian, this grace have I found in me, that duty is performed by me, this corruption have I mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; that burden have I born; what ſay I? That I have done this or that? O no, <hi>By the grace of God, I am what I am, — I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, yet not I, but the grace of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. I dare not ſay any thing is my own but ſin; and what's performed by me is mixt with ſin and imperfection: [<hi>Horreo quicquid de meo eſt,</hi>] I tremble for fear (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) at any thing that is of mine own: I muſt not depend on mine own Righteouſneſs; O that I may be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32940:34"/>found in Chriſt! I am nothing, can do nothing, deſerve nothing but Death and Hell: If ever I be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Heaven, it muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Chriſt; his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon the Croſs; his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven. That's an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready:</hi> But how is ſhe ready? Why, <hi>to her was graunted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white; for the ſine linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi> Indeed its no other then Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed: This is the upper garment that muſt not only cover our nakedneſs, but the tattered rags of our own Righteouſneſs, whether that relate to a glorious ſtate of the Church on Earth or in Heaven, I diſpute not: But I am
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32940:34"/>ſure its the braveſt ſuit that ſhe can put on, and ſhe will look trim in that only; and woe to them that appear in their beſt inherent Righteouſneſs: Let the proud ſelf-juſticiary ſay, [<hi>Coelum gratis non accipiam,</hi>] I will not have Heaven <hi>gratis,</hi> or for nothing, I will pay a proportionable rate for it; then thou art like to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, for its not ſaleable Ware; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31.

This is juſt the difference betwixt a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy Profeſſor that wants aſſurance, and an active Chriſtian in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to this bleſſed Haven.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32940:36"/>evidence of life: Activity for God, and tendency Heaven-ward will put you out of doubt: All duties tend to aſſurance, or ſpring from it: Striving, running, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be crowned with clear evidence: God loves to crown di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: To him that hath (<hi>i. e.</hi> uſeth and improveth well what he hath) ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance; (<hi>i. e.</hi> more grace and the comfort of it) as the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion of Flint and Steel, begets light; ſo the acting of grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this fruit, <hi>viz.</hi> Aſſurance: <hi>For the work of righteouſneſs is peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever. Iſa.</hi> 32.17. Now, now, the Soul is ready for glory, when he is in duty, above duty, with God in the lively actings of grace, which is a part of, and a prologue to glory. The Chriſtian is going from ſtrength to ſtrength, till he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32940:37"/>appear before God in <hi>Zion.</hi> Oh happy ſoul that is thus upon the wing!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reflection upon Heart and Life, and comparing both with the word of God. This is Gods way to get aſſurance: Have I the conditions of Goſpel-promiſes, Faith and Repentance? Do thoſe graces within me anſwer the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of ſuch in the Scriptures? Doth my Soul eccho to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of Saints in the word of God? Can I follow the Rules and preſcriptions that my Lord hath laid down; <hi>To deny my ſelf, take up his Croſs and follow him?</hi> Have I the eſſential characters of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? I dare not believe Satan and my own treacherous heart; I will examine and prove my ſelf; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. I will not ſpare my ſelf in any thing; I will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and deal faithfully by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive tryal now, as I would be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32940:37"/>found in the deciſive tryal at the laſt day: Its a matter of life and death: I will lay judgment to the line: I will go to the Law and to the Teſtimony: The word muſt judge me at the great day, it ſhall be my judge now: No matter what the World ſaith of me; nor muſt I be determined by the votes of the beſt Chriſtians, or Godly Miniſters: I muſt, and will, and do <hi>prove mine own work, and then I ſhall have rejoycing in my ſelf alone, and not in another, Gal.</hi> 6 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Appealing and approving the heart to God. Alas, the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is too apt to be partial in his own caſe, or blind at home; our Minds are as ill ſet as our Eyes, neither of them apt to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and when we do look, alas, we are apt to look through a falſe or flattering glaſs, or our Eye is vitiated with bad humours; and therefore muſt we with <hi>Job</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:32940:38"/>appeal to God, <hi>ch.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked:</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 23.10. <hi>He knoweth the way that I take:</hi> And though <hi>David had communed with his own heart, and his ſpirit had made diligent ſearch, Pſal.</hi> 77.6. yet he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth God to a further privy ſearch; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Ezamine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins, and my heart.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts:</hi> Not as though God were ignorant of them till he ſearcht; but its ſpoken after the manner of Men: And that God might further acquaint <hi>David,</hi> with the ſecrets of his heart. Thus the ſincere Chriſtian faith, Lord, I ſet my ſelf before thee as a glaſs in the Sun; look upon me, look through me; thou knoweſt all things; ſee how my heart is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards thee; diſcover to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32940:38"/>me the inmoſt working of my Soul; if there be any ſecret guile in folding it ſelf in the lurking-places of my heart, bring it to light; if there be any flaw in my evidences, let me ſee it before it be too late: I am too apt, through ſelf-love to judge the beſt, but do thou declare my ſtate and my frame as it is: Thou that muſt be my judge ſhalt be my witneſs. <hi>My witneſs is in Heaven, and my record is on high; Job</hi> 16.19. Here's a Soul uſually comforted in his integrity, and ſuch an one is meet for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Praying to God for the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſealings of his Spirit: For indeed let all theſe means be uſed, yet evidence will not come unleſs God be pleaſed to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own grace in the Soul: <hi>My Conſcience,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 9.1. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32940:39"/>it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit that we are the Children of God.</hi> This indeed is the Sun-light aſſurance. This alone ſcatters all miſts, anſwers all objections, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth all doubts and fears; and oh what an honour and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is it to a Child of God, that the Third Perſon of the Sacred Trinity ſhould come down and give in its infallibe Teſtimony at the Bar of a Believers Conſcience! This is like the Son of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into our nature, and dying for us. Oh tranſcendent condeſcention! Oh unparallell'd priviledge of Gods Children! Yet this is purchaſed by Chriſt, and promiſed to Believers, not only to be a Witneſs, but a Seal. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and 5.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. This is often, yea ordinarily given af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believing; and when it comes, it brings its own evidence along with it: So that the perplexed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32940:39"/>Child of God, after many fore conflicts, ſtruglings, ruggings, ſad thoughts of heart, comes at laſt to ſome conſiſtency, as to expel fears, cares, doubts, and now at laſt is brought to that, that he no more queſtions Gods love then his faithfulneſs; and this uſually comes in after ſome notable wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at the Throne of Grace in Prayer, according to that <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name:</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Very little comparatively, and as you ſhall do.) <hi>Ask and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your joy may be full.</hi> God will have his Child to beg when he deſigns to give, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our Obedience, and to honour his own Ordinance: Then he gives aſſurance, and the joy of his Salvation; and now the believing Soul is meet to be tranſlated into the joy of his Lord.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, is none meet
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32940:40"/>for Heaven but ſuch as have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Then what ſhall a poor doubting Soul ſay of it ſelf, that is dark, and much diſcouraged as many a good Soul is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A title to this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neceſſary, but knowledge of this title is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Many have dyed ſafely, though under clouds. Our Lord himſelf, cryed dying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> There was Relation, <hi>my God,</hi> yet in ſome ſenſe he was forſaken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's degrees of aſſurance; as he that ſaid, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief.</hi> Few enjoy a full plerophory, and thoſe that have it, yet have it not at all times. Mr. <hi>Pauls Bains</hi> ſaid dying, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation I have, but ſuavities ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual I do not feel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Its one thing what God doth in an arbitrary way of ſuſpending the comforts of his Spirit from the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32940:40"/>beſt of his Saints, (yea he with-held them from his own Son) and another thing, what may, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually is, the effect of Mans ſloth and negligence; which is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly our caſe; as Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him that complained of want of aſſurance, <hi>why Man, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be had, and what have you been doing all this while?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet this will hold good, that a clear evidence of our title is a great meetneſs and readineſs for Death: For though aſſurance be not neceſſary [<hi>ad eſſe</hi>] to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Chriſtian; yet its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary [<hi>ad bene eſſe</hi>] of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>i. e.</hi> to his well being, or comfortable paſſage through, or parting out of this World; for if we muſt draw near to God in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with full aſſurance of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. much more at death.</p>

               <p n="3">3. THE next thing wherein our meetneſs for this bleſſed Inheritance doth conſiſt, is in diſpatching our main work in the world, that God ſent us to do; whatever that is God expects we ſhould diſpatch it, and get it done; this we muſt all addreſs our ſelves chearfully to do, and be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in doing it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> meaſure is required of us, and the ſincere Chriſtian makes it his deſign. Thou knoweſt, Oh my dear Lord, what is that which hath lain higheſt in my heart ever ſince thou openedſt mine Eyes: The earneſt deſire of my Soul hath been to be nothing in mine own eyes, that God alone may have all the glory; I will confeſs and give glory to God; I will, and through grace have deſired, to make it my buſineſs to give glory to God by believing, repenting, obeying, fruit-bearing; yea in eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whatſoever I do in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, moral or civil actions. This, this is the mark I ſhoot at, my higheſt aim, <hi>that God in all things may be glorified, through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. And my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is in order thereto, to ſtudy how to pleaſe God, and to <hi>abound more and more,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.1. to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32940:43"/>obey Gods Commandments, and to do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22. and oh that my Perſon and Prayers might be accepted in Chriſt! The ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Soul is more dear and precious then this poor periſhing Carcaſe. My grand enquiry is, what muſt I do to be ſaved? This is the one thing needful; other things are upon the by. Oh that I could work out my own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! I appeal to thee Lord, how many griefs and groans, prayers and pains, fears and tears, this main concern hath coſt me: I know there's much of this work about my precious Soul yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; but thou knoweſt the main is diſpatcht: <hi>I have fought a good fight, finiſht my courſe, kept the faith.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. And now my Land-buſineſs is done, let me go to Sea, and launch out into that boundleſs ocean of eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:32940:44"/>
               <p n="2">2. Temporal work, the buſineſs of our Callings and particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. This alſo the dying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is drawing into a narrower compaſs, that he may voluntarily leave the world, before the world leave him; the Chriſtian having had his head and hands full of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in his younger days, when old age comes, is glad of a [<hi>quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt,</hi> or] writ of eaſe, that he may [<hi>vacare Deo</hi>] be at more leiſure for God in holy duties. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think, ſaith the good heart, I have had my ſhare, both of the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and injoyments of this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er world, and am well content to ſhake hands therewith: I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with pity the laborious Ants and Piſmires running upon this Mole-hill, and buſily ſcrambling for a little duſt; let them take it, God hath made my hands to be ſufficient for me; I have what will bear my charges to the grave; let
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32940:44"/>it go, I am glad I have ſo fairly parted with it; I would not be to enter again upon this buſie ſtage, or put forth to this tumultuous Sea; I have now other things to mind; I have now the great work to mind, of ſetting ſtreight my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for another world; my Peace to make with God; an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to provide for, which the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the world have thruſt out, or diſtracted me in: This, this ſhall be my imployment for the future; <hi>for what will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> I leave all theſe things to others that ſucceed me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Relative work. This alſo may be in ſome reſpects diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off our hands; and the doing of it maketh more meet for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is not to be ſlighted, for it is needful in its place. When King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick unto death God ſends him this Meſſage; <hi>Set
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32940:45"/>thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live, Iſa.</hi> 38.1. [<hi>i. e.</hi> Make thy Will, and diſpoſe of thy domeſtical concerns, ſo as may be a prevention of quarrels and contentions in thy Family af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy deceaſe:] And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Hezekiah wept ſore:</hi> Why ſo? Was not <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a Godly Man? Was not his Soul in a readineſs for death? Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for he dare appeal to God that he had walked before him in truth, and with a perfect heart: What then was the matter? Why <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had yet no Son, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> being not born till three years after this, <hi>q. d.</hi> Lord, if it may be thy will, ſpare my Life, and give me a Son, for if I dye at this time, I know not how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Crown, I am likely to leave the Church and State in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable diſtraction and confuſion, through the great uncertainty of a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32940:45"/>ſucceſſion, and the proneneſs of the people to backſlide to their falſe Worſhip. God heard his Prayer, gave him a leaſe of his Life for fifteen years: But this is a duty to all, though it be more neceſſary to ſome then to others: But however its uſeful to ſettle the Mind at eaſe, and prevent out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ill conſequences, and inward diſturbances of Spirit; but as that good Man was loath to go off the ſtage Heirleſs, ſo other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may call for the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Families by their laſt Will and Teſtament; eſpecially when Children are left young, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, and others alſo may ſay, now God hath lengthened out my days to ſee my Children brought up, and hopeful for Religion, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Callings and Families; there was but this Child, or that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that I deſired to ſee well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as to my Family-affairs:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32940:46"/>As <hi>Jacob</hi> cloſed up his Bleſſing of <hi>Dan, Gen.</hi> 19.48. <hi>I have waited for thy ſalvation, O Lord.</hi> Now at laſt, ſince God hath wrought on ſuch a Child, I will ſay with old <hi>Simeon; Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation. Luk.</hi> 2.29, 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another work to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht off our hands is publick work. This concerns men in a publick or private capacity; as when <hi>Moſes</hi> had led <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he had diſpatcht his work, and having been faithful in Gods houſe he was fit to dye. So when <hi>Joſhua</hi> had conquered many Kings in <hi>Canaan,</hi> divided the Land to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he got a diſcharge and fell aſleep. Thus <hi>David, after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, fell on ſleep, and was laid unto his Fathers; Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:32940:46"/>13.36. And ſo <hi>Aaron, Samuel,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, marcht off the Field by the order of our great Lord General, when they had diſpatcht their warfare, and delivered their meſſage: <hi>Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where are they? and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do they live for ever? Zech.</hi> 1.5. And indeed to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould they or we live, when our work is done? Eſpecially when Gods ſervants have not only diſpatcht that work that concerns preſent, but future Generations: For this is alſo the work of our preſent day. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> built God an houſe for future times: And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> lays in for after ages, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I will endeavour that you may be able after my deceaſe, to have theſe things alwayes in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance!</hi> Its the property of a good man to take care that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may live when he is dead.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32940:47"/>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> I loved the man exceedingly, that when he dyed he was more ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous for the Churches then his own danger. Then indeed is the Chriſtian meet for Heaven when he hath diſpatcht his work on Earth, and laid a foundation for good in after times; however bears his teſtimony againſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in future generations; as <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 31.26.-30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay how can any man be ſaid to diſpatch his work till his life be done? Surely the date of work and life run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Active; doing work may be oft at an end, when ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work is but a beginning; for God often reſerves ſuffering work to the laſt, that patience may have her perfect work; that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be perfect and entire wanting nothing: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32940:47"/>Chriſtian hath little to do, but lye in bed, and patiently wait Gods pleaſure; and this uſually follows on doing Gods will: See <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.36. This is indeed a great work to bear our burden patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, chearfully, thankfully and fruitfully; and ſay, well for the preſent, and will be better ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the greateſt part is then over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though ſomething be to be done or ſuffered, yet when the greateſt part of a Chriſtians work is done, it may be ſaid it is finiſhed. So it was with our Saviour; <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> But was not dying upon the Croſs for the ſins of Men a principal piece of Chriſts work? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was ſo nigh, that he ſpeaks of it as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done; ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>I am not in the world;</hi> for he was juſt a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it: Beſides he had done moſt of his work, and was ready
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32940:48"/>preſt to do the work fully, the reſt that was behind: <hi>And when our Lord had taſted the vinegar, he ſaid, it is finiſhed. Joh.</hi> 19.30. This is a cloſing word, as giving up the ghoſt was a cloſing work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes Divine Providence takes off Gods children from much of their work before their dayes be ended; this is obvious to a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional eye that then their work is done, as ſometimes by natural cauſes. Thus <hi>Iſaac, Jacob</hi> could preſage their own death by the certain prognoſtick of death, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, old age: Others by ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Conſumptions, which are uſually mortal: Others are taken off moſt of their work by Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, Priſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are taken off the ſtage of the World by violent death: As a dying Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaid on the Scaffold, <hi>Iſaac was old and knew not the day of his death, I am young, and know the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32940:48"/>day, manner, and inſtruments of my death: Its but a nodding the head, and death doth its office. Now my work is ended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet once more: Some god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters and Chriſtians have had a kind of inſtinct, that death was approaching even in their beſt health and younger days; and ſo conſequently of the diſpatch of their work; as ſome Creatures by natural inſtinct foreſee a falling houſe. So we find of Biſhop <hi>Juel,</hi> that long before his ſickneſs he foretold it approaching, and in his ſickneſs, the preciſe day of his death; he dyed in the fiftieth year of his age. The like we have of <hi>James Andreas,</hi> who foretold the year, yea, hour of his death. I ſhall but add one inſtance of that Holy Man of God, and my dear Friend Mr. <hi>Iſaac Ambroſe,</hi> his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Wife told me of his ſolemn farewel he gave to his Daughter,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32940:49"/>and ſome other Friends: Yea, the very day of his death ſeveral Friends from <hi>Garſtang</hi> viſited him at <hi>Preſton,</hi> with whom he diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed piouſly and chearfully, telling them he had finiſht his work, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the night before ſent his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Angels to the Preſs, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them to their Horſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, dyed that Evening in his Parlour, where he had ſhut up himſelf for Meditation. Thus Gods children are made meet for Heaven by diſpatching their work on earth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Meetneſs for Heaven, by being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to Sin, Time, and Earthly Objects, and being elevated to Heavenly Objects.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="4">4. THE laſt thing wherein meetneſs for Heaven doth conſiſt, is a being dead or being
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32940:49"/>mortified to all things below and alive, and lively to God and things above. It is true, converting grace deadens the heart to all ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and lifts it up to divine things: Yea, ſometimes the firſt convictions take off the ſinners Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more then is meet, and quite damps the affections to lawful comforts, and makes him think he muſt do nothing in worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but give himſelf to Reading, Praying and Hearing; but Gods grace in a little time diſcovers this to be a Temptation: Yet as grace gets the upper hand, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mellows and ripens for glory, ſo he is mortified and gradually transformed and advanced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By further victory over his corruptions; for as the Chriſtian perfects holineſs in the fear of God, ſo he doth by degrees cleanſe himſelf <hi>from all filthineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Sin
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32940:50"/>and grace being like two buckets at one chain, as the one comes up the other goes down: Or as the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, where it gaineth in one place it loſeth in another; the more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the leſs ſin. Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian grows ſtronger and ſtronger; <hi>The inward man is renewed day by day,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. So the body of ſin is weakened, till at laſt, his fleſhly luſts are laid at his feet, and ſpiritual ſins pay tribute to the grace of God in his Soul. Pride, hardneſs, unbelief and ſecurity, keep the Chriſtian humble and watchful, jealous of himſelf, and maintaining ſpiritual conflicts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, ſo occaſionally he is a gainer by his loſſes, a riſer by his falls; however the Chriſtian grows more in ſight of, and ſerves under the burden of ſin; as <hi>Paul</hi> he cryes out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32940:50"/>from the body of this death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. O ſaith the Chriſtian, what ſhall I do with this untoward heart? I am weary of theſe Daughters of <hi>Heth:</hi> Fain would I get rid of this indwelling corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Sin I hope hath not domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over me; but oh when ſhall the time come that it ſhall have no indwelling within me? But this is my grief and I muſt bear it, I am diſcontentedly contented with my burden: Diſcontent with ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Gods pleaſure: But there's nothing makes me weary of the World but ſin: Could I live without ſin, I ſhould live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow: The leſs ſin the more of Heaven: Lord ſet me at liberty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By looſening the affections from all worldly injoyments. Oh how ſapleſs and inſipid doth the World grow to the Soul that is a making meet for Heaven. <hi>He is crucified to the World, and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32940:51"/>World to him, Gal.</hi> 6.14. In vain doth this Harlot think to allure me by her laying out her two fair Breaſts of Profit and Pleaſure. <hi>Surely I have behaved and quieted my ſelf, as a Child that is weaned of his Mother: My Soul is even as a weaned Child; Pſal.</hi> 131.2. There's no more relliſh in theſe gaudy things to my pallate, then in the white of an Egg; every thing grows a burden to me, were it not duty to follow my calling, and be thankful for my injoyments. Methinks I injoy my Wife, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and deareſt Relations, as if I had none; I weep for outward loſſes, as if I wept not; rejoyce in comforts below as if I rejoyced not; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.—30. my thoughts are taken up with other objects: The men of the world ſlight me, many ſeem to be weary of me, and I am as weary of them: [<hi>Non eſt mortale quod opto</hi>]
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32940:51"/>Its none of theſe earthly things that my Heart is ſet upon; my Soul is ſet on things above, my treaſure is in Heaven, and I would have my Heart there alſo: I have ſent before me all my goods into another Country, and am ſhortly for flitting; and when I look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, I ſee a bare, empty houſe, and am ready to ſay with <hi>Monica, [quid hic facio?]</hi> what do I here? My Father, Husband, Mother, [<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above,] my Brethren, Siſter, beſt Friends are above: Methinks I grudge the World any thing of my Heart, and think not theſe temporal viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things worth a caſt of my Eye compared with things inviſible and eternal: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. I do not only ſay with afflicted <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 7.16. <hi>I loath it, I would not live alway;</hi> but even with <hi>Solomon</hi> in the top of all Earthly felicity, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>Therefore I hated
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32940:52"/>life, — yea I hated all my labour which I had taken under the Sun: i. e.</hi> In compariſon, or in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with Heavenly injoyments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By ſpiritualizing Worldly things, and uſing them as ſteps by which the Soul mounts Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The Believer conſiders theſe things were made not for themſelves but for higher ends: All things are as Talents to trade with for another World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.16. for an account muſt be given of them; not only Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Goſpel-priviledges, but Providences both ſweet and ſevere, yea, Creature-comfors, yea, all viſible objects. Thus our Lord [who had grace in perfection] made notable Spiritual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of outward Water, Bread, vines for holy ends; and the more Heavenly the Chriſtian is, the liker he is to his Head, and ſo meeter for Heaven. Whatever
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32940:52"/>this golden hand of Faith toucheth is turned into Gold. The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fetcheth honey thus out of the hard Rock: Out of the eater comes meat. O ſaith the believing Soul, if meat be ſo ſweet to an hungry ſtomach, how much more excellent is Gods loving kindneſs? If drink be ſo refreſhing to the thirſty ſoul, oh how ſweet are thoſe rivers of pleaſures? Surely his love is better then wine. If it be ſo pleaſant for the Eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Sun, how amiable is the Son of Righteouſneſs? How ſweet is home to the weary Traveller? And the Haven to the weather-beaten Mariner? But infinitely ſweet and contentful is Heaven to the tempted, burdened, tired Saint: Methinks all I ſee, and do, and have, minds me of my home; and ſaith, <hi>Ariſe, depart, this is not thy reſt.</hi> When I am abroad in a ſtorm, I haſt to a ſhelter: Oh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32940:53"/>think I then, that I were with my dear Lord, who is as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land! When I conſider my dim Eyes, my decrepit Feet, my palſie Hands, my panting Lungs; Oh think I, when ſhall this ſilver cord be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the bowl broken at the Ciſtern? That my Soul may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God. This is a pitiful ruinous Cottage, when ſhall I be brought into the Kings Pallace? In this my Earthly Tabernacle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I find now a pin looſened, and a ſtake taken down, then I ſay and ſigh with the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>We which are in this Tabernacle do groan being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> Here's the Soul taking wing to fly into another World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Chriſtian is made meet for Heaven by intimate familiarity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32940:53"/>with the God of Heaven: This indeed is the height of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans perfection on Earth. The fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for, and freer intercourſe with God, the fitter is that Soul for glory. VVhat is Heaven but the injoyment of God? The nearer God the nearer Heaven; for where the King is there is the Court: Truly, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.3. Communion with God, and aſſimilation to God is the life and perfection of our Religion; and the former leads on to the latter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image from glory to glory, as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> As grace increaſeth glory increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and the viſion of God (tho' but through a glaſs, mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth grace, and fitteth for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32940:54"/>glory. Now it is ſaid of ſome great perſons, that they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more with God then with Man. Oh faith the Chriſtian, I could not tell how to ſpend my time if my Soul had not ſometime free acceſs to, and intercourſe with my beſt friend above. Oh that it were oftner and longer; [<hi>ſed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra hora, brevis moka</hi>] it were a brave reſemblance of Heaven to have fixed communion with him; but however I write that day as black and loſt wherein God and my Soul are not together. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content in a publick ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance when I miſs my beloved: I follow him into my Cloſet, and there uſually I find him whom my Soul loveth: O then think I, that God would now ſtop this breath, and tranſlate my Soul into his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence! That as its ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> that he dyed at the mouth or kiſs of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.5.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32940:54"/>(ſo ſome read it) that he was kiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, or overpoured with divine embraces: VVould to God it were thus with me! Methinks I am loath to part with theſe firſt-fruits without a full harveſt; now let me go over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and ſee that goodly Mountain and <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi> Oh let me not return down into this tempting world, to be baniſht again from thee! O come thou down to me, or take me up to thee: Its pity my Soul ſhould be thus tantalized with the ſight of that which I cannot at preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; well, ſince it is thy pleaſure I am content to be diſmounted and deſcend down to take my lot with the riſing Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> only I will be ſtretching out Neck and Arms, and be looking for, and haſting to the coming of my dear Lord. Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly: Make haſt my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32940:55"/>young Hart upon the mountains of ſpices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, ſuch an height of meetneſs for the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance as you have deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not practicable or attainable in this life; if none be ſaved but ſuch as you have deſcribed, woe be to all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Moſt part of men are not capable of this actual meetneſs, not having the habitual; namely, a relation to God, and a principle of ſaving grace; and no wonder if unexperienced perſons call this Enthuſianiſm, and unintelligible nonſenſe, for wiſdom is too high for a fool; its not to be thought ſtrange if ſome ſpeak evil of that they know not, and turn real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments into a ridicule: Alas, they have no grace, how then can they exerciſe it? How can they evidence a title to Heaven that have none? How can they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32940:55"/>their work, that never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it to purpoſe? Or be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to things below, that have their portion in this preſent life, were never divorced from their luſts, and have no treaſure above? We may pity ſuch ſouls, for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is far from the wicked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi> Sanctified ſouls know what theſe things mean, and tho' the beſt complain of their low at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, yet the weakeſt ſincere Chriſtian can ſet to his ſeal, that ſomething of theſe things he hath found in his boſom as to ſincerity, and is aiming at further degrees, and is not content to ſit down ſhort of perfection, but is <hi>preſſing toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jeſus. Phil.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There's a great difference in Chriſtians attainments in this world. Some active vigorous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32940:56"/>ſouls get nearer to God then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſome are Children, others Fathers, others are young Men, that are ſtrong, and the word of God abides in them, and they have overcome the wicked one, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12, 13, 14. The meaneſt child God hath in his Family will own and follow his Father, tho' ſome dare not ſay, he is my Father: But ſome are grown up to great intimacy with God, as that choice man of God, Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> that ſaid on his Death-bed, <hi>Speak it when I am gone, and Preach it at my Funeral, that God deals fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet its every ones duty to endeavour after the higheſt pitch of meetneſs that is attainable in this life: For as it is the nature of true grace to become deeper and deeper, like the waters in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion, and aſcend higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the flame or riſing Sun; ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32940:56"/>the Chriſtian dare not but obey Gods command to grow in grace, and ſees it neceſſary to comply with our Lords command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.44. <hi>Therefore be ye alſo ready.</hi> And this is one reaſon (amongſt the reſt which I ſhall next add,) what a Godly dying Miniſter of my acquaintance ſaid, <hi>That the beſt preparation of the beſt man, is all little enough when we come to dye.</hi> But more of this anon. This is the former head, <hi>What is that meetneſs for Heaven that Chriſtians muſt have, or endeavour after.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſecond head in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part, is the Reaſons of this point, <hi>That all thoſe and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32940:57"/>only thoſe that ſhall eternally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Heavenly Inheritance in the other World, are made meet for it in this World:</hi> In handling this I ſhall endeavour not only to evince the truth of it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Conſcience of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, and perſwade the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to comply with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its fit perſons be made meet, becauſe no man by nature is meet for Heaven. Man is eſtranged from God, <hi>even from the Womb, Pſal.</hi> 58.3. and are theſe fit to live with God till brought nigh? Man is ſhapen and conceived in ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. and is this fit to dwell with an Holy God till ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified? Man is dead <hi>in treſpaſſes and ſins, Eph.</hi> 2.1. and is ſuch a dead block meet to converſe with the living God? Man <hi>is darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. and <hi>what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath, light.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32940:57"/>with darkneſs?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Man by nature is a <hi>child of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.3. and how can dryed ſtubble dwell with conſuming fire? Alas, we are all enemies to God in our minds, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. yea, <hi>enmity it ſelf, Rom.</hi> 8.7. and <hi>can two walk together except they be agreed? Amos</hi> 3.3. Can the ſin-revenging God and the guilty ſinner hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate correſpondence till they be reconciled? O no, it will never be: Heaven and Hell will as ſoon joyn as God and an unregenerate ſinner: Will the holy God take ſuch vipers into his boſom? Can you imagine God will deface or lay aſide his immaculate Holineſs, to take you from the Swine-ſty into his holy Sanctuary? What cleanly perſon can endure to have a filthy ſwine a bed and board with him in his Parlour or Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? <hi>Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with thee? Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:32940:58"/>94.20. No, no, <hi>God is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> with liking and delight. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. If God ſhould take men [<hi>a caeno ad coelum</hi>] from the dunghil into his Palace, others would conclude that God is reconciled to ſin, that its an harmleſs thing, and not that abominable thing which his Soul hates: No, it can never be; graceleſs ſinners, ſo remaining can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell with God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this is the divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and appointment, that there ſhould be a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt grace and glory, holineſs and happineſs: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. As Sin and Hell are joyned by divine commination, ſo Grace and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are knit together by divine promiſe. So ſaith the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 10. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, eternal life.</hi> This is a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32940:58"/>connexion of grace, not of merit; of promiſe, not of debt, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, for Gods Juſtice and Truth are ingaged in it. Its fit the infinite God ſhould diſtribute his Mercies to whom, and upon what termes he pleaſeth; now he hath ſaid peremptorily, <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord: Heb.</hi> 12.14. All things are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and wrought after the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his will; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. Firſt he chuſeth them <hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, that they ſhould be holy: Eph.</hi> 1.4. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed to be holy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. called with an holy calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. and therefore they are holy Brethren that are partakers of this Heavenly calling: <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. Let wicked ſcoffers mock on to their guilt and coſt: Such there are in the world, and ſuch muſt they be if they think to inherit Heaven: Its Gods ordination:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32940:59"/>you muſt be Saints in this world, or never Crowned as Saints in the other; tho' Canonized for Saints by Men, when gone. Conſider ſinner, whoſe word ſhall ſtand? Gods or thine? Thou hopeſt to go to Heaven without Saintſhip, or meetneſs for it; God ſaith it, yea ſwears it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18. that thou ſhalt never enter into his reſt. This is Gods councel, that men muſt be brought through Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Salvation, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. and can you think to overturn his appointed Will, or contradict his Councels? Muſt the Earth be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken for thee? Muſt the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God falſifie his word to ſave chee againſt his will, yea, againſt thy will? For thou wilſt not come to him for life: God will not be merciful to any wicked tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour: The eternal determination of Heaven is recorded in that chain of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32940:59"/>and all the Men on Earth and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell cannot break one link of it: Predeſtination, Vocation, Juſtification, Salvation or Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Go try the turning Day into Night, or Winter into Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or ſtop the courſe of the Sun, before thou think to divert the proceedings of grace in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls; but its vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt either; for his councel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is the deſign of God in all his Ordinances to make Souls meet for Heaven: <hi>It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Miniſters and Ordinances were given for perfecting of the Saints. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. This is the means of Converſion, <hi>the power of God to ſalvation; Rom.</hi> 1.16. the means of edification, of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of doubts, conſolation and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32940:60"/>confirmation; ſo are the Seals of the Covenant given to this end, to bring Souls onward to this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inheritance. Now, Sirs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſhall you receive this grace of God in vain? Shall all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances be loſt upon you? You muſt give account of Sabbaths, Sermons, Sacraments, ſhall they be the ſavour of death unto death to you, or the ſavour of life unto life? Alas, how do poor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters toyl and travel, pray and watch, weep and ſigh, to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Loyns, ſpending of their Spirits, to bring you to God and Heaven, and you pretend kindneſs to us, but have no real kindneſs to your own Souls, we dare not but warn you in the name of Chriſt, leſt you fail of the grace of God, and fall ſhort of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: <hi>We watch for your Souls as thoſe that muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: O let us do it with joy and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32940:60"/>not with grief. Heb.</hi> 13.17. If it be uncomfortable to us, it will be unprofitable to you? Muſt our ſweat and labour be in vain? But it will not be in vain to us, for our work is with the Lord, we ſhall not loſe our reward: God will pay the Nurſe, though the Child dye: Our Crown will be given us, if we be faithful, though we be not ſucceſsful, for that's in Gods hands: But woe be to thoſe ſouls that have ſitten under powerful Ordinances, and miſs of this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance! O woe, woe to you, you cannot miſs of Heaven, but be plunged into a deeper Hell: O eaſe our Hearts, and ſave your own Souls: Kill us, and damn your ſelves; nay, murder your ſelves, and you again Crucifie Chriſt, whoſe perſon we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Rather give us leave to eſpouſe you to one Husband, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I have fitted you, as

               <p n="4">4. This is the deſign of all Gods Providential diſpenſations: Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, afflictions, ſmiles, frowns, come upon this errand to make Souls meet for Heaven: Cords of love draw, rods of wrath drive the poor ſinner from Hell to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Sunſhine of Love comes to melt and thaw our frozen hearts that God may ſet a ſtamp upon us: The loving kindneſs of God leads to Repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Oh what an influence will Gods native goodneſs have upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Spirit. As the Sun at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts vapours from the Earth, ſo this Son of Righteouſneſs ſhould and will (if our ſturdy hearts hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not) raiſe our hearts Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32940:61"/>Its pity we ſhould ſtop here in the ſtreams, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould be led to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and follow the beams up to the Sun: May this long-ſuffering of the Lord be your ſalvation: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. May love conſtrain you to love God: May theſe load-ſtones ſo attract you, and theſe grapes of <hi>Canaan</hi> enamour you, that you may never reſt till you appear before God in <hi>Zion:</hi> And what are all Gods rods and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ſtrokes for, but to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you out of ſecurity? Peat your fingers off from the world? Weaken your corruptions, and purge and furbiſh your Souls, as veſſels for the high ſhelf of glory? <hi>For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. How is that? Surely by working the Soul into a fitneſs for that glory. This
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32940:62"/>furnace melts away the droſs of our Spirit. Sea-toſſings clear the liquor of grace; this dark night fits for the pleaſant morning; theſe pangs prepare us for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; theſe bluſtering ſtorms fit ſouls for the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, being ſanctified by the Spirit, and improved by Faith. Affliction is Gods Phyſick, which makes ſick, but prepares for ſweet health; and ſhall we fruſtrate Gods ends in this alſo? What, are you content with a Heaven here, and an Hell hereafter? Nay can you be content with an Hell in both worlds? Muſt theſe be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boilings for everlaſting burnings? God forbid. Look at the Lords end in theſe ſufferings, and let it be yours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The time of this life is the only time men have given them to be made meet for Heaven. This life is a <hi>praeludium</hi> to an eternal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32940:62"/>ſtate: Its a Seminary for another world. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. —<hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man ſoweth that ſhall be alſo reap: He that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> Seeding is a preparatory to reaping; yet men muſt expect only to reap that kind of grain that's ſown; none can think to reap Wheat that ſowed Oats; and you know there's more abundunce in the reaping then in the ſowing: So in this caſe, Hell torments will be more exquiſite and eternal, then the profit and pleaſure of the ſinner in ſinning: Heavens joys will infinitely furmount the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians labours and ſorrows in this world; and there is great equity in both, for the object ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt is infinite, and ſatisfaction can never be made by a finite Creature; and the grace, from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32940:63"/>whence flows Eternal Life, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and will have an endleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But the point I am upon is to demonſtrate the neceſſity of making meet for Heaven in this world, or it will never be done: Now or never. When the door is ſhut, the gulf fixt, and the Soul looſed from the Body, and launcht out into that vaſt ocean of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there's no returning back to get the oyl of grace, or be fiting the Soul for another world: <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. <hi>What ſoever thine hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> Time laſts not, but floats away apace; but what is everlaſting depends upon it. [<hi>Hic aut accepimus, aut amittimus vitam aeternam</hi>] In this world we either win or loſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: The great weight of Eternity hangs on the ſmall and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32940:63"/>twittered thread of time: <hi>Now is the accepted time; now is the day of ſalvation:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2 This is our working day, our market time; ſurely it becomes us to lay that Foundation well, that bears ſuch a Superſtructure: To caſt that Anchor ſafely that is entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Veſſel ſo richly laden; Oh Sirs, ſleep now, and awake in Eell, from whence is no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Suppoſe by miſdemeanour you had forfeited your Eſtate and Life, and upon much interceſſion, the King cauſeth an Hour-glaſs to be turned, and ſet you a work to do, or leſſon to learn; if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it you are pardoned and promoted, if not, tortured and executed: Oh how diligent would you be! What pains would you take? The caſe is your own, Sirs, Heaven and Hell are before you; according to your improvement or non-improvement of this hour of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32940:64"/>life, ſo muſt you fare; dream not of a Purgatory; <hi>as the Tree falls ſo it lyes:</hi> You enter by death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unchangeable ſtate, only the Body at the Reſurrection will be joyned to the Soul to be partner with it in weal or woe, bliſs or bane for ever. The ſtate here is [<hi>tempus operis</hi>] the time of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; hereafter [<hi>mercedis</hi>] of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Oh look, before you leap into another world. That's the fifth Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Chriſtian muſt be made meet here for the Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, becauſe he hath abundance of work to do, and priviledges to injoy, in order to the full poſſeſſion of this bleſſed Inheritance above: We have many graces to exerciſe, duties to perform, corruptions to ſubdue, temptations to reſiſt, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens to bear, mercies to improve, that will never be managed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe without a qualification for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32940:64"/>managing them: And obſerve it, the ſame diſpoſition is requiſite for making a Chriſtian meet for any duty, that's requiſite to make him meet for glory; the ſame habitual principle, and drawing it forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lively exerciſe: Not only muſt the man of God be perfect, <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed unto all good works;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. but every Chriſtian, that is a veſſel unto honour, muſt be ſanctified and ſo meet for his Maſters uſe, <hi>and prepared unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. Alas, an unſanctified heart is unfit for ſpiritual ſervice. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The legs of the lame are not equal,</hi> [he halts and goes limping] <hi>ſo is a parable in the mouth of fools: Prov.</hi> 26.7. How aukwardly and bunglingly doth he go to work in ſacred things; juſt as an unskilful perſon handles a Lute, a Viol, or Inſtrument of Muſick: or as the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> could not frame
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:32940:65"/>to pronounce <hi>Shibboleth</hi> aright: <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.6. There muſt be a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs betwixt the Agent and Acts: No carnal heart can do any one good work well; materially he may do what is good, but not formally as good; in a good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for a good end; acceptably to God, or profitably to himſelf: <hi>For they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God; and without faith its impoſſible to pleaſe God. Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. And can we think God will carry them to Heaven that never ſtruck a right ſtroke, or never did one hours work for God, that he would accept? A graceleſs ſinner is like the fruitleſs Vine tree, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.3, 4, 5. that is not meet for any work, but it is caſt into the fire for fuel; juſt ſo is that branch (that's profeſſionally) in Chriſt, that beareth not fruit, <hi>its taken away, — and caſt into the fire and burned. Joh.</hi> 15.2.-6.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32940:65"/>The Divine Wiſdom is ſeen in ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means to the end, object to the faculty, back to the burden: Now graceleſs ſinners are not fit for Gods work, and if they be not fit in this world, they will never be fit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Chriſtian hath many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to injoy which he muſt be meet for even in this world, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Juſtification, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Peace of Conſcience, Communion with God, Audience of Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe God hath promiſed, Chriſt hath purchaſed for his Children, and they are Childrens bread, and muſt not be given to dogs: God will not throw away his Mercies on ſuch as value them not, but ſcorn them; they ſet light by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious delicates of his Table, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22 5. The whole ſlight the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian: <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. The full ſoul loaths the honey comb: The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart will not thank God for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32940:66"/>pardon and grace; and can we think God will force his Bleſſings on ſuch ungrateful miſcreants, that ſcorn both him and his kindneſs? No ſurely, there are ſome that long for theſe Bleſſings, and will thankfully accept them: See <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 48. and 28.28. Yea, he will make you prize them, and part with all for them, or you ſhall never have them: What think you, doth not the great God take care to ſecure his own glory, as well as Mans felicity? And would it not be diſhonourable to God to beſtow his richeſt treaſures and pleaſures of grace on ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, and take more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in rooting in the ſordid dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil of ſenſual delights, then in ſeeking firſt the Kingdom of God, which conſiſts in <hi>righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Rom.</hi> 14.17. Alas, <hi>Honour is not ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a fool: Prov.</hi> 26.1. <hi>As a

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Another Reaſon drawn from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſiſtency of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans meetneſs for ſo glorious an Inheritance.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="7">7. THE laſt Reaſon why ſouls muſt be made meet for Heaven is, becauſe other wiſe there would be no conſiſtency or ſuitable harmony betwixt men and glory: If their natures be not changed, they will not have a ſuitableneſs of diſpoſition to the glorious ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. The truth of this I ſhall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32940:67"/>demonſtrate in theſe 4 particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. None but perſons made meet for Heaven will have any mind to leave the world, and go to God. A carnal unconverted ſoul is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unwilling to go hence; they fancy to themſelves an Eternity below: <hi>Their inward thought is, that their houſes ſhall endure for ever: Pſal.</hi> 49.11. Yea, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they put far from them the evil day, and ſing a <hi>requiem</hi> to themſelves, as the fool in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and no wonder, for they live by ſenſe, and know what they have here, but know not what they muſt have hereafter: As the old doting Monk, that ſhewed his brave accommodations, ſaying, <hi>Theſe things make us unwilling to dye.</hi> It was an uſual ſaying among the Heathens, [<hi>ſoli Chriſtiani ſunt mortis contemptores] that Chriſtians only are contemners of death:</hi> This is applicable to ſincere Chriſtians.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32940:67"/>Stoical apathy will not do it, but Faith will. <hi>Julius Palmer,</hi> the Martyr, ſaid, <hi>To them that have their Souls linked to the Eleſh, like a Rogues foot to a pair of ſtocks, it is indeed hard to dye; but for him who is able to ſeparate Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the help of Gods Spirit; it is no more maſtery for ſuch a one to dye, then for me to drink this cup of Beer:</hi> Nay, when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is upon good terms with God, he deſires to be looſed or diſſolved <hi>and to be with Christ, Phil.</hi> 1.23. Yea, this is the diſpoſition of a Soul meet for Heaven, that he loves and longs for Chriſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. but the ſincere Chriſtian that is not actually meet ſon Heaven (though through grace he be habitually meet) often ſhrugs at the approach of death, and is glad to chide himſelf out, and ſay as that holy man, <hi>[Egredere mea Arima, egredere,] Go out, my
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32940:68"/>Soul, go out, what art thou afraid of?</hi> And ſurely that man is more acceptable to God, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in death, that hath ſet all things ſtreight, and hath nothing to do, but ſurrender his Soul into Gods hands; this man will make his Lord welcome any hour of the day, or watch of the night; but the other is like a Maid undreſt and unready, though for the main ſhe love her Friend, and deſire his coming, yet in the preſent jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and under thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe is ſurprized and troubled that he ſhould find her in that piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pickle. This is the caſe of the unmeet Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None but Souls meet for Heaven are fit for death, through which all muſt paſs. Its true, the Apoſtle doth diſcover to us this miſtery, (which among the reſt he might receive in the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. <hi>We ſhall not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32940:68"/>all ſleep, but we ſhall all be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> but this change is a peculiar diſpenſation in the end of the world, and this change is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to death. This is certain, the fruit of the curſe, the ſting of death will faſten her fangs on the unconverted ſoul, that's under the covenant of works, and is not in Chriſt: Its only the ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that can ſing that [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] the <hi>Song of Triumph;</hi> or can make that brave challenge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 57. <hi>O death where is thy ſting! O grave where is thy victory?</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Captain Jeſus hath diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, and it is only for his members; others are left to its rage: <hi>Death feeds on them; Pſal.</hi> 49.14. it hath a full morſel of them. The firſt death kills the Body, and the ſecond death damns the Soul; but <hi>bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, on ſuch the ſecond death hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32940:69"/>no power. Rev.</hi> 20.6. Oh happy ſtate of real Saints! Chriſt, our <hi>David,</hi> hath conquered this <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah:</hi> The Ark of the Covenant hath driven back this ſwelling <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan: [Tollitur mors non ne ſit, ſed ne obſit;]</hi> This Serpent may hiſs and hit, not hurt; ſtrike down it may, not ſtrike home; it may thruſt Gods Children into the Grave, not into Hell: Nay, our Lord ſets his, not only above the danger by death, but fears of death, that are thus meet for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. that can ſay, as that gracious Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Martyr, written by me <hi>Anne Askew,</hi> that neither wiſheth for death, nor feareth his might, and as merry as one that's bound for Heaven: But oh the woful ſtate of a graceleſs ſinner! that is in Natures ſtate, and loves and lives in ſin, lyes and dyes in the old <hi>Adam.</hi> That's the ſadeſt word
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32940:69"/>in all the Bible, pronounced twice in a breath by our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.21, 24. <hi>Ye ſhall dye in your ſins, i. e.</hi> under the guilt of your ſins and ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: This is ſurprizing from what he adds in the firſt place, <hi>whither I go you cannot come;</hi> that is to Heaven, whither ſinners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter: You'l ſay, then no man can enter into Heaven, for all men are ſinners even to the laſt breath. When are men cleanſed, is it [<hi>in Articulo mortis</hi>] in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Soul out of the Body?

               <p n="2">2. I ſee not but the mighty God can perfectly expel ſin out of the Soul, and alſo perfect defective graces in the inſtant of the Souls ſeparation from the Body, as well as he did infuſe a principle of grace into the Soul in an inſtant at the Souls firſt converſion; for by death <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect; Heb.</hi> 12.23. Mind it, it is juſt men not wicked; God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32940:70"/>will not infuſe grace into men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in their paſſage out of the world; [<hi>qualis vita, finis ita;</hi>] as men live, ſo they dye; and if men imagine God will put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle into their hearts juſt as they paſs out of this World; as this is a daring preſumption, ſo they will be miſtaken; for how is a departing Soul capable of ſuch receptions or reflections as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the work of converſion? Alas, the Eyes being ſet, Lips quivering, Memory failing, and the Body in a cold ſweat, is unfit for any thing; their hopes giving up the ghoſt as their breaths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; and its a wonder that the Souls of wicked men go quietly out of their Bodies; its ſtrange they depart not as the Devils out of the Demonaicks rending, rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tearing, foming; but if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be aſleep, death will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake it; could you follow their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32940:71"/>departing Souls a minute out of their Bodies, you would hear howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and roarings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Heaven will not receive any Souls but ſuch as are made meet for it on Earth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither what ſoever worketh abomination, — for without are dogs.

They ſay <hi>Ireland</hi> will not brook a Toad, a Snake or venomous Creature to live and like in it: I am ſure Heaven will not admit, but caſt out an unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart. The Legions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Angels knew this, who abode not one moment in that holy place after they left their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. It is ſaid of the Halcyons neſt, that it will hold nothing but its own Bird: The ſame may be ſaid of Heaven; the Serpent could wind himſelf into the Earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, but none of the Serpentine brood ſhall once peep into this

O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poor ſinners conſider this, the holy God hates all the workers of iniquity; the holy Heaven is no ſanctuary for Rebels and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; God will not take ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers into his boſom; thou muſt either be renewed or never receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32940:72"/>into glory; it is an undefiled inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. a dirty ſinner muſt not enter; this would diſparage and contradict all Gods Attributes, as his Juſtice, then God ſhould give to the wicked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the work of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it would blemiſh his Holineſs, as though unclean were delighted in equally with the clean; it would contradict his Truth, as though God regarded not what he ſaid or ſwore, that no unclean thing ſhall enter there: Every Attribute would have dirt caſt upon it, if God ſhould ſave the unſanctified Soul: Nay, it contradicts the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of Jeſus Chriſt, who came to ſave his people from their ſins, not in their ſins: It expoſeth the office and operations of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe office it is to ſanctifie ſinners, and prepare Souls for Heaven; that ſinner muſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in a deſperate caſe that muſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32940:73"/>un God the infinite Jehovah, God bleſſed for ever, or elſe he cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The unſanctified ſinner would by no means like in Heaven. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would be an Hell to him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Nature were changed and renewed. Moſt Men miſtake the nature of Heaven; they only look upon it as a place of happineſs; it is ſo, but withal it is a ſtate of perfect holineſs: They are holy priviledges, injoyment of God, and what care wicked men for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? They ſay unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us; and their choice ſhall be their puniſhment: They are holy joys and delights; how will they like that who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſed but with ſenſual laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is madneſs? There's holy company above of Saints, but they cannot abide to be near them on Earth, how then can they like to be aſſociated to them in Heaven?
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32940:73"/>There is holy imployment above, but alas, they are not at all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, nor can they be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the work of loving, praiſing, or taking pleaſure in God. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> hath a ſaying, [<hi>Canticum novum &amp; vetus homo male concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.] That the new Song and old Man agree not well together: —No man could learn that new Song, but the hundred fourty four thouſand, which were redeemed from the earth. Rev.</hi> 14.3. Alas, they have not hearts nor harps tuned for it. Suppoſe it were poſſible that our Lord ſhould bring an unſanctified perſon to Heaven, ſaith one, he could take no more felicity there, then a beaſt, if you ſhould bring him into a beautiful room, to the ſociety of learned Men, or a well furniſht Table; when as the poor thing would much rather be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with his fellow bruits; thus a poor graceleſs ſinner would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32940:74"/>be with his Cups or Queans, at beſt in his Markets, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bags, but there's no ſuch things in Heaven; therefore if he were there, he would be quite out of his Element; [<hi>tanquam Piſcis in avido</hi>] as a Fiſh in the Air, or a Bird in the Water, or Fire? Can you charm a Beaſt with Muſick? Or can you bring him to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, or make him keep time with your skilful quire? So the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems of Heaven, ſaith one, fit not a carnal mans mouth, ſuit not his ear: Poor wretches, they now think Sermons long, Sabbaths long, Prayers and Praiſes long, and cry, what a wearineſs is it? When will it be over? And are theſe think you, fit for this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly imployment to all Eternity? where this noble company of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial inhabitants, <hi>ſerve God day and night in the Temple. Rev</hi> 7.15. Alas, the poor unregenerate ſinner
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32940:74"/>hath no faculties ſuited to ſuch a glorious ſtate and work, as that above is; the Mind, Will, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Conſcience, are like a full ſtomach that loaths the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb: Theſe old Bottles cannot hold the new Wine of glory: You may as well hew the Marble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tools, or draw a Picture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Colours, or build without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or Materials, as a Soul not qualified with Grace can do the work of God acceptably either on Earth or in Heaven Oh, Sirs, think of this, you muſt be prepar'd, fitted, qualified for Heaven here, or elſe Heaven will be no Heaven to you.</p>

               <p>I Now proceed to Application, and all the Uſes I ſhall make
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32940:75"/>of this point ſhall be of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Conviction, Humiliation, Lamentation. A man would think upon ſuch plain demonſtrations as are oft laid before ſinners in the miniſtry of the Word, they would once at laſt reflect upon themſelves and ſay, am I thus or thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Upon what terms ſtand I for another world? Am I an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted child of God? Am I juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Am I converted to God, and brought through the pangs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? Have I made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and taken God for my God, and given my ſelf to him? What ſaving work hath paſſed upon my heart? If I ſhould come to you one by one, and poſe you with this ſolemn queſtion, Friends whither bound? Whither are you going? Are you for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell? Oh no, you'l ſay, God forbid, but that we ſhall go
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32940:75"/>to Heaven! God is a merciful God; Chriſt dyed to ſave ſinners; we do not doubt but through the merits of Chriſt, we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well as others: Alas, Sirs, theſe are too general grounds, to build your hopes of Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God is merciful, but he is alſo juſt; Chriſt dyed for ſinners, but do you imagine all ſhall be ſaved by him? Let me ask you a few ſober queſtions, and anſwer them not according to your fancies, but according to Scripture rule: Do you believe that all men ſhall be ſaved? What is Hell then for, that's ſo oft mention'd in the Bible? Or do you think that the gates of Heaven are as wide as the gates of Hell, or that as many ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as damned? Dare you ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradict our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and give him the lye? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 13, 14. Can you imagine that our Lord Jeſus (who is the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32940:76"/>keeper of Heaven) will admit any but thoſe that he ſaith he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain? Or do you think he will admit thoſe that he ſaith he will keep out? What think you, can any ſecretly ſteal in unknown to him, or forcibly thruſt in againſt his will? Is the infinite all-ſeeing God grown ſo weak or blind that you can couzen or conquer him? Or can you bribe him to let you in with fair words or large gifts? Or dare you ſtand to plead in his face that you are qualified and meet for Heaven, when he tells you, that you are not? Do you think there is ſuch a thing as a groundleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or rotten hope that will give up the ghoſt? Is not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil a cheat? Are not your hearts treacherous? And are not they fools that truſt theſe, and will not try by the word what they affirm? And have you ſolemnly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tryed your title to Heaven?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32940:76"/>Have you not taken all for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a ſerious proving of your ſtate, meerly becauſe you would have it ſo? And are you content to do ſo in temporals? And will you madly venture your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls on ſuch grounds as you dare not try? And can you think to eſcape the ſtrict tryal of the omniſcient God? Sirs, the buſineſs is important; Heaven and Hell depend upon it: We Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that believe an Eternity, and certainly know upon what terms Souls are ſaved, dare not but be faithful to you, and declare the whole councel of God.</p>
               <p>I muſt, 1. Tell you who thoſe are that are far off Salvation, and are utterly unmeet for this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and can pretend no claim to it. 2. Such as pretend a claim, but its groundleſs, and but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended claim, and cannot be made out on Scripture grounds.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Their are a ſort of perſons within the pale of the viſible Church, (for I here meddle not with Heathens or Jews) that are [<hi>ipſo facto</hi>] point-blank excluded, in as plain terms as can be ſpoken. Theſe are a ſort of ſinners that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the black brand in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, of whom a man may ſay without breach of charity, theſe carry viſibly the doleful tokens of eternal death and damnation.

               <p n="2">(2.) Neither Fornicators ſhall

This ſin [as venial a ſin as its reckoned by ſome] is damning, and excludes men from Heaven. Do you think ſuch dirty dogs ſhall ever trample on this golden pavement? when God would not ſuffer even the price of a whore or dog to come into his houſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.18.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Nor Idolaters, groſs, or more refined; for God will not permit his children to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or familiarly converſe with ſuch on Earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and therefore ſhall not be aſſociated to them in the other world, and God is not well pleaſed with ſuch. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 7.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Nor Adulterers, nor effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, ſuch filthy <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi> ſhall rather have fire from
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32940:78"/>Heaven, then be admitted into that holy place. Theſe horrible acts of filthineſs are not fit to be named among Saints, and ſurely the committers of them cannot be entertained among Saints: See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 3, 4. <hi>They are given up. Rom.</hi> 1.24.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Nor Thieves. Not only open robbers by the high-way, or breakers of houſes, but gamſters that cheat others, or purloyning waſtful Servants, deceitful Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or wilful Bankrupts, that baſely get others Eſtates into their hands and never intend to pay their juſt debts: Theſe men, without reſtitution, ſhall have their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſilver and gold to torment them like burning mettal in their bowels. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Nor Covetous. Theſe are fitly joyned to Thieves, that run out with inordinate affection to the world, and ſuck her breaſts
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32940:78"/>with great delight; that inlarge their deſires as Hell: Theſe muſt be ſhut out of Heaven, for they have their portion in this preſent life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. and are real Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5.

               <p n="7">(7.) Nor Drunkards. Not only ſuch as bruitifie themſelves, and drink away their Reaſon, but ſuch as ſit long at it, continue till wine inflame them; yea though they be not intoxicated, yet they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a woe to themſelves, that are <hi>mighty to drink wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drink. Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 22.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) Nor Revilers. Theſe are properly annexed to drunkards; for the godly are uſually the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards ſong, that ſcoff and jear at ſerious godlineſs, and break their ſcurrilous jeſts upon the holieſt Saints; but there's no railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Angels or Saints in Heaven,

                  <hi>Jude</hi> 9. nor ſhall ſuch come there: And one would think they do not deſire to come there, with thoſe they ſo abuſe.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) I may add Backbiters, that love to take up and blaze abroad a falſe report againſt their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; theſe are excluded Gods Tabernacle, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1, 3. that fling all the dirt they can in the face of ſuch as do them no hurt, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſecretly with a privy ſtab, or behind their backs; God will hold the door of Heaven againſt ſuch.</p>

               <p n="12">(12.) Apoſtates, that once made a fair ſhew, but are renegadoes to the truth, way, people, worſhip of God; they bring a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on Religion; and our bleſſed Saviour pronounceth ſuch as put their <hi>hand to the plow and look back, to be unfit for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; Luk.</hi> 9.62. <hi>Gods ſoul will have no pleaſure in them.

               <p>Hearken, you ſinners, if any

Alas, you are daily filling up the meaſure of your ſins; the Ephah is well nigh full; t'other ſin, t'other neglect more, and next news you may hear, the talent of Lead may be caſt upon the mouth of the Ephah, and thy Soul carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into thine own place: <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.7, 9. One Oath more, one Lye more, one fit of Drunkenneſs more, and thy iniquity is full, thy Soul is gone. Who can tell but God may ſay to thee as to the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.29. <hi>This night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee:</hi> Or as the word [<gap reason="foreign">

Fiends watching for a commiſſion to break, thy neck in thy travelling, or to ſtrangle thee in thy bed, and hurry thee headlong into Hell with them! Thy iniquity is filling up; the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of proſperity ripens it apace; the ſweet rain of Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brings Weeds to perfection as well as Corn. As Gods children are making meet for Heaven, thou art making meet for Hell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering, the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction:</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32940:81"/>needs no more to a ſinners making meet for Hell, but a leaving him to himſelf; he will fall apace downwards to damnation with his own weight. Ah ſinner, thou little knoweſt how ſoon thy foot may ſlip off this ſlippery battlement on which thou ſtandeſt, into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice of eternal deſtruction. Little doſt thou know how ſoon that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword that hangs over thy head by the twine-thred of thy natural Life, may fall upon thee and ſeparate Soul and Body, and follow this ſtroke of vengeance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other world. Methinks thou ſhouldſt not eat nor drink, nor ſleep quietly in this ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, damnable eſtate. Every ſin thou committeſt is a <hi>treaſuring up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath. Rom.</hi> 2.5. Look to't, the Judge ſtandeth before the door; Death is ready to lay its cold hand of arreſt upon thee: There's but
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32940:81"/>a ſtep betwixt you and death; and that door that lets you out of time ſets you in eternal torments; and are you taking long ſtrides to Hell? Shall you not be there ſoon enough? Can you not ſink your ſelves low enough? Muſt you needs add drunkenneſs to thirſt? Impenitency to your ſin? Alas, you love to wander, you hate to be reformed; yea, you hate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and caſt his words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17. Miniſters follow you from the Lord with tears, intreaties, arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and means to direct, and willingneſs to aſſiſt you the beſt they can in your preparations for a future ſtate, but you are ſhy of converſing with them; you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal your ſtate from them; they ſpend their time in ſtudying to do you good; they ſpend their Lungs in ſpeaking to you, in ſpeaking to God for you, but all doth no good,

               <p>Oh how many poor ſinners are going on in a golden dream, and fear no danger, till they be paſt hopes of recovery!

He is worſe then a Devil that trembles not under divine wrath. What if it have not ſiezed on you, as on Devils! The flame is at next door; wrath hangs over your heads; the only reaſon you ſee it not, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are blind: The Lord open your eyes, and I need not preach terrour to you, your hearts will meditate terror: Fearfulneſs will ſurprize you hypocrites, and make you ſay, <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire, with everlaſting burnings?

               <p>Alas, I am afraid; 1. Some are ignorant ſots that know not what is neceſſary to a meetneſs for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Moſt think if they have but time to ſay at death, [<hi>Lord have mercy upon me; God forgive me my ſins; Lord Jeſus receive my Soul,</hi>] they think they have made their peace with God, eſpecially if they can ſay they forgive all the world, and dye in charity with all, and ſend for the Miniſter to pray with them, and receive ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and the Sacrament, when (perhaps) they are little fit for ſuch a ſolemn Ordinance; then the

               <p n="2">2. THE latter Uſe is Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; 1. To Sinners. 2. To Saints to get meet for this Heavenly Inheritance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by an habitual, the latter by actual meetneſs for this glorious ſtate.</p>
               <p>I ſhall need to ſay the leſs to move you to it; having urged practical Reaſons from our natural unmeetneſs, divine ordination, the deſign of ordinances, providences, the ſeaſon of life for it, the work and priviledges here require it, the inconſiſtency of a contrary-frame to that glorious inheritance: Moſt of theſe are levelled to the ſtate of unſanctified, graceleſs Souls, therefore I ſhall ſay the leſs to that branch. Oh that I had here
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:32940:90"/>the Tongue or Pen of an Angel! The Bowels of bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> to perſwade ſinners to look after a meetneſs for Heaven. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What elſe have you to do in the world? Your very Children will tell you that Mans chief end is to glorifie God and injoy him for ever: If you attain not theſe ends you live in the world to no purpoſe, you are unprofitable cumber-grounds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You fruſtrate Chriſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings in the world, and do what you can to render all his merits uſeleſs; you tread under foot the Son of God, count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and deſpiſe, if not deſpight the ſpirit of grace; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. you ſay plainly I like not the purchaſe, I will have none of it; you call Heaven <hi>cabul,</hi> a dirty thing; as <hi>Hiram</hi> called <hi>Solomons</hi> twenty Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he gave him: And can you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:32940:90"/>think much to be dealt without Heaven, that thus <hi>judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life? Acts</hi> 13.46.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every day ſets you nearer Heaven or Hell. Its reported of the Pious Lady <hi>Falkland,</hi> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed at night, ſhe uſually ſaid, <hi>Now am I nearer Heaven by one day then never I was.</hi> One day added to your time is a day taken away from your life. Oh think when you have heard a Sermon, or ſpent a Sabbath, I am now near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Heaven or Hell; this word hath been to me <hi>the ſavour of life unto life, or of death unto death:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. It ſets me forward ſome way; if I bring forth meet and ſuitable fruit, I ſhall receive a bleſſing from God; if bryars and thorns, I am rejected, <hi>nigh to a curſe, whoſe end is to be burned. Heb.</hi> 6.7, 8. The word either hardens or ſoftens. Woe be to me,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:32940:91"/>if all that God doth doth further my more dreadful condemnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Eternity brings up the rear of time. If it were but a making fit for a days pageantry, there would be no ſuch great need of curioſity to get matters ready; though its ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Can a Maid forget her ornaments, or a Bride her attire;</hi> though oft it is for the ſhort ſhew of a Marriage day: Oh but this is for Eternity. That curious Painter being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why he beſtowed ſo much labour on his Picture, anſwered, [<hi>Pingo Eternitati.] I paint for Eternity.</hi> Indeed there's nothing of value but what relates to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Eternity gives an accent and emphaſis to all created beings. The Apoſtle thought all viſible ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not worth a caſt of his eye in compariſon of this Eternity. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. See a Book called [<hi>Glimpſe of Eternity,</hi> on that Text.] Alas,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:32940:91"/>Sirs, is Eternity nothing with you? Oh my Friends, this (if any thing) is worth preparing for, to be for ever with the Lord, to injoy God ten thouſands of millions of years, or to be baniſhed from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and be tormented with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and damned Souls for ever. Oh this word for ever is amazing, A godly man in company ſate in a deep muſe, and being demanded what he was thinking of? Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only with repeating [<hi>for ever, for ever, for ever,</hi>] for a quarter of an hour together: This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a confounding conſideration. Oh that you would ſolemnly lay upon your hearts the great things of another world! On the one hand the injoyment of God, Chriſt, the company of Saints, Angels, the perfection of your natures, a crown of glory, fulneſs of joy and pleaſures at Gods right-hand for evermore, through the perpetual
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:32940:92"/>Ages of a boundleſs Eternity: This were worth praying, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obeying, ſuffering for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, to get read, for, and poſſeſſions of at laſt. On the other hand, to think of the ſting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the company of Devils and damned Souls, the loſs of God, Chriſt, Heaven, your precious Souls, the burning Lake, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, the ſcorching Flames, and this for ever and ever, an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs duration. Oh Sirs, if you ſhould but look down into that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious gulf, what a change would it work in your hearts? You would baniſh your vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, lay aſide your worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, caſt off your ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and mind nothing elſe till your Souls be ſecured to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This would be as the cry at midnight, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him. Matth.</hi> 25.6. As ſleepy as they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32940:92"/>were this ſtartled them; ſo it would you, as if you heard a voice as out of the Clouds; Sinner thou art now ſummoned to appear before the dreadful tribunal of the all ſeeing Judge, to receive thy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſentence, and to be ſent to an everlaſting ſtate of weal or woe; ſtay not one moment in thy ſtate of unregeneracy; haſt, haſt, yea make poſt haſt out of it; fall to the work of Faith and Repentance as for thy life; defer not one day; now or never.</p>
               <p>You'l ſay, can I make my ſelf meet for Heaven? What can I do? The work is Gods. I anſwer, God is the efficient, but he will make you inſtruments in this work. Gods grace and Mans duty are very conſiſtent. Study <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. Up and be doing, and God will be with you. Though God muſt turn, yet you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to turn your ſelves. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:32940:93"/>18.30, 31. Though God make you a new heart, yet he will have you make you a new heart. Oh Sirs, fall cloſe to the work, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, prove, try your ſtates by the rule of the Word; attend the moſt piercing, powerful Miniſtry; ſearch out all your iniquities, and confeſs them before the Lord with grief, hatred and ſhame; beg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace as for your lives; plead with God for pardon through the Blood of Chriſt; ſolemnly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your Paptiſmal Covenant in taking God for your God, and giving up your ſelves to him, and then read, meditate, watch and pray, mortifie your beloved luſts, obey the commands of God, and do theſe things ſpeedily, ſeriouſly and conſtantly, and ſee what the effect will be. If you will fall to it, well and good, if not, you are guilty of ſelf-murder; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are this day warned.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:32940:93"/>
               <p n="2">2. I turn me to truly gracious Souls that are in a ſafe ſtate for the main, as to habitual meetneſs, but I fear are far ſhort of that actual meetneſs that is requiſite, as to a lively exerciſe of ſuitable graces; clear evidence of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate; diſpatching work off their hands; being mortified to time, and longing for Heaven. Alas, the wiſe Virgins ſlumbered and ſlept. I fear few of us are in that readineſs we ought to be in, might have been in, or that others have attained to; nay, its well if now our Souls be in that frame that ſometimes we have been in: What decays of love, zeal, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; what backſlidings, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hardneſs, worldlineſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality do Gods Children fall into? What ſtaggerings in our Faith of the reality of unſeen things? How uncertain about our Title to this Inheritance? Doth not our ſlaviſh
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:32940:94"/>fear of death ſhew thee? Our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability and variable motions in Religion; our diſtractions in holy duties; our frequent cloſing with temptations, and too oft ſtepping aſide into ſin; our intermitting duties of Gods worſhip, and ſtrangeneſs growing betwixt God and our Souls; our unreadineſs in our accounts; our unwillingneſs to go to God: All theſe too ſadly demonſtrate our unmeetneſs for Heaven. Alas Friends, are we not yet meet! Let us be aſhamed of our ſlackneſs; what have we been doing with all that time, theſe helps and priviledges we have had? Have not many young ones and others out-ſtript us, and are got to Heaven, that ſet out after us? Are we not aſhamed of our loytering and lagging behind? What's become of the many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we have had in our ſelves and others? Have we any greater
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:32940:94"/>matters to mind? Do we not bring diſhonour to God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to our Religion by our backwardneſs? And can we have that comfort and confidence in meeting the Bridegroom of our Souls as is fit? Alas, our Lord will be leſs welcome if he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us unawares, as I have told you. Ah Sirs, you little know how near death is, and therefore ſhould be always ready to meet our Lord. It is matter of great lamentation that ſo few of Gods Children are meet for their home; and like wayward Children are loath to go to bed, though God hath taken a courſe to weary us out of the world. The Lord help us to lament and lay to heart our great unmeetneſs for Heaven. When ſin, ſecurity, ſenſeleſneſs, ſteals in upon thy Spirit, ſearch it out, mourn for it, confeſs it, beg a pardon of it,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:32940:95"/>and recover thy ſelf quickly out of it; be not ſatisfied with any diſtance from God; recover thy wonted familiarity with thy beſt friend, and mend thy pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, as a man in his journey that hath been hindered, hies the faſter, to recover his way, loſt by his ſtay; breath after more likeneſs to God, fitneſs for every diſpenſation, and long to be with God in Heaven. Alas Sirs, you little know how near you are to Eternity. You ſee the ſands that are run to the nether end of the glaſs, but the upper part (as one ſaith) is covered with a mantle, you know not how few ſands are yet to run. God forbid that you ſhould have your Evidences to procure, when you ſhould have them to produce. If you be not ſure of Heaven, you are ſure of nothing, all worldly things muſt leave you, or you muſt leave
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32940:95"/>them. Diſpatch all, but this, off your hands, and be as the bird on her wings to her neſt, or the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, whoſe mind is ſtill on home, home, nothing will pleaſe him but home. Say with <hi>Calvin, [<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſquequo Domine?] How long Lord, ſhall my Soul be at a diſtance from thee? Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

Spiritual Mercies are of moſt worth, and deſerve moſt thanks from us to God: But this is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt.</hi> It is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] and ſo may ſignifie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things as well as places; <hi>i. e.</hi> Graces, Priviledges, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32940:96"/>or whatever hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the good of the Soul, or eternal Salvation in Heaven: Theſe indeed are a <hi>Benjamins</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a goodly heritage, the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence and marrow of all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. If God ſhould give you the whole World, and put you off therewith, you are curſed and wretched; if he give you Grace and Glory, you are happy, if you had nothing elſe. Our Lord thought that a plenary Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (with which he begins his firſt Sermon) <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.</hi> There's the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy promiſed, and the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, both choice Bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is the purchaſe of Chriſt is worth our thanking God for; but this is the fruit of Chriſts purchaſe: Its not only a purchaſed inheritance, nor did Chriſt only purchaſe us to be heirs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32940:97"/>of this inheritance, but he hath purchaſed a meetneſs in Believers for that Inheritance. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> How do men thankfully celebrate Chriſts Nativity? But that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſts being born into the world, (though tranſcendently great) will never advantage you, unleſs <hi>Chriſt be in you, the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1.27. his dwelling in your hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. intitles you to the inheritance he hath purchaſed. Look within thee Man, as well as without thee, and above thee, for the fruits of Chriſts purchaſe, and occaſions of thankfulneſs to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The operations and fruits of the Spirit are ſurely worth thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for; but this is one of the moſt glorious fruits of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32940:97"/>Spirit, to fit Souls for Heaven. Our Lord promiſeth to ſend the Holy Ghoſt to ſupply the want of his Bodily preſence, and it is the richeſt gift that ever proceeded from Father and Son; ſuch as have it, <hi>out of their Belly flow Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water, Job.</hi> 7.38, 39. God is to be admired in all the ſaving works and actings of the Spirit, the convincing, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſanctifying, ſupporting, ſatisfying, ſealing, comforting, quickening, inlarging, confirming, witneſſing, and reviving operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Alas, we had never lookt after God, had not the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt knockt at our doors; we had been blind in the things of God, but that the Spirit inlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; dead but that the Spirit enlivened us; we had wandered for ever, but that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reduced us, our hearts had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:32940:98"/>been for ever hardened from Gods fear, had not Gods Spirits ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; we ſhould have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like God, but that the Holy Ghoſt ſtampt Gods Image upon us; whatever hath been done upon our Spirits to fit us for Heaven, the Holy Ghoſt hath been the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; yea, that Spirit that we have quenched, grieved, reſiſted, vexed; what cauſe then have we to be very thankful? This is the golden Oyl, that runs through the golden pipes of Ordinances into the candleſtick of the Church. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Goſpel-diſpenſation is great matter and ground of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: <hi>It is a miſtery which in other ages was not made known to the ſons of mon: Eph.</hi> 3.4, 5. But what is the marrow and main deſign of this Goſpel-revelation? Why, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>That the Gentiles
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:32940:98"/>ſhould be fellow heirs, and of the ſame body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt by the Goſpel.</hi> Oh glorious deſign! Oh bleſſed Charter! But what are we better unleſs we be partners of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge? Therefore <hi>chap.</hi> 2.19. ſaith, <hi>Chriſtians are fellow-vitizens with the Saints.</hi> This is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way of infranchiſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating poor ſtrangers in the Immunities of Heaven, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is worth thanking God for. The Charters of ſome Cities coſt them dear, and the Chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaid to <hi>Paul, with a great ſumme obtained I this freedom; Paul</hi> ſaid, [and ſo may Believers ſay in this ſenſe,] <hi>but I was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. Acts</hi> 22.28. Though it coſt Chriſt dear, yet it coſts us nothing, but reception. This new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is built all of Free-ſtone, and ſhall not our ſhoutings echo,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32940:99"/>grace, grace to the Head-ſtone, Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.7. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince our freedom reſcues us from Helliſh tortures, as <hi>Pauls</hi> did him from ſcourging; and makes us heirs of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Peculiar advantages not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to all, gives grounds of thankfulneſs; ſuch is this. Our Lord ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of He aven and Earth, becauſe thou hast hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> Alas what have any of us, but what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Diſcriminating kindneſſes call for the greateſt gratitude: What did God ſee in any of us that might procure for us Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Or within us what prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Heaven? You and I are of the ſame polluted lump of Mankind as others: Moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:32940:99"/>to become heirs of ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance as Heaven is. What could God ſee in us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his heart to us? Nay, what did he not ſee in us to turn his ſtomach againſt us? It was the kindneſs and love of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: <hi>Not by works ef Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we had done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Mercy he ſaved us. Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4. Alas, what loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could God ſee or foreſee in us to make us Children, then heirs of God, joynt-heirs with Chriſt? We may ſay with honeſt <hi>Judas, Job.</hi> 14.22. <hi>How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world?</hi> It muſt be anſwered, <hi>Even ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> When thouſands are left, why art thou taken? How came it to paſs that when Philoſophers and wiſe Sages of the World,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:32940:100"/>bewildred ſo in the dark about fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, that God ſhould ſhew you the right way to true happineſs, and lead you into it, and in it? Surely all is of free grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fittedneſs to any duty or diſpenſation is a Mercy worth thanking God for: Such is the Chriſtian frame that makes meet for Heaven; ſuch a perſon is fit to do Gods will, or ſuffer Gods will; he is ſuited to a proſperous and adverſe condition; his foot ſtandeth in an even place; like a Watch in a Mans pocket, turn it this way or that way, it keeps its motion; ſo the Chriſtian in all conditions, his ſtation and motion Heaven-wards. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger. Job</hi> 17.9. He is [<hi>utrin<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> paratus</hi>] ready for any thing that God calls him to: Like the man
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32940:100"/>of God mentioned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That is perfect, throughly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all good works.</hi> Oh what a bleſſed thing is it to be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to embrace a motion to pray, read, conſer, meditate, receive the Lords Supper upon an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Men, or ſummons from God! The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. found the want of this, when ſhe ſaith, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh; i. e.</hi> I have the principle, but want the exerciſe of grace; and alas, how unready was ſhe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her beloved, though ſhe had given him a call; and the ſad conſequences of this unfit frame are obvious, both as to her ſin and ſuffering: But oh what a mercy is it to have an heart ready preſſed for Gods ſervice! Give God the glory of it, and its worth ſomething to be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for Mercy, Affliction,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32940:101"/>Death, Judgment, as thoſe are that are meet for Heaven. It was a noble Speech of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when <hi>Modeſtus</hi> the Praefect threatened Confiſcation, Torments, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he anſwered, <hi>He need not fear Confiſcation that hath nothing to loſe; nor Baniſhment to whom Heaven only is a Countrey; nor Torments, when his Body would be daſht with one blow; nor Death, which is the only way to ſet him at liberty. Polycarp</hi> was ready for Beaſts, or any kind of death, for he was ready for Heaven: For as this Chriſtian is delivered from danger by death, ſo from the fear of death. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. Death it ſelf is the day break of eternal brightneſs to the Child of God; and is not this worth thanking God for?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Heaven is ſurely worth thanking God for. Could we get
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32940:101"/>a glimpſe of that ſtate and place of glory, and this inheritance of the Saints in light, together with our title to it; Oh how would it dazzle and tranſport us! its ſaid that the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> was ſo bright, that the Door-keeper ſtill cryed to ſuch as entered, <hi>Take heed to your Eyes:</hi> Much more may we ſay ſo of the ſurprizing glory of the Heaven of Heavens; and therefore our Lord ſaith, <hi>None can ſee his face and live:</hi> But death blows duſt out of the Eyes of glorified Saints, and the Morning-Star at the Reſurrection doth ſo fortifie the ſight, that it can behold this inacceſſible light with admiration; even as all the Stars look upon the Sun. <hi>Fear not little flock,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>for it is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> Is not a Kingdom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32940:102"/>worth thanks, and ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to have this freely of gift, not to wade to it through Wars and Blood, and all this by hereditary right, which is the cleareſt title. Oh Sirs, do you know what Heaven is? It is the immediate injoyment of God, an immunity from all evils, a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all good, the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our natures, the maturity of our graces, the deſtruction of all ſin, the baniſhment of Satan and his temptations, the fulneſs of joy, and total death of all grief. Indeed it is ſuch a ſtate as can neither be expreſſed nor conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How vile and contemptible would all things below appear to one that with <hi>Paul,</hi> is rapt up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Paradice! I read of one <hi>Adrianus</hi> an Heathen, that was preſent when Martyrs were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tormented, he asked,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:32940:102"/>
                  <hi>What was the Reaſon they ſuffered ſuch Tortures;</hi> it was anſwered in the words of that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> The very rehearſal of which words converted this <hi>Adrianus,</hi> and he became a Martyr alſo. Oh what a tranſcendent reward is there in theſe Manſions above! And God doth not grudge us the knowledge of theſe glorious things. He is not like ſome rich men that will not let their heirs know, what they will do for them, till they dye; no, the Text ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that <hi>God revealeth them to us by his Spirit;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>that we may know the things freely given to us of God.</hi> We may know them perceptively, not comprehenſively; by Faith tho'
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:32940:103"/>not by Senſe. We know but yet in part, [<hi>non rem ſed aliquid rei</hi>] but then we ſhall know as we are known; [not as God knoweth us; for our knowledge and Gods muſt not be ſo comparatively likened, but] as holy Spirits know us both now and for ever, we ſhall both know and be known by immediate intuition; yet in this world God gives his Children (though differently) ſome glimpſes and dark repreſentations, [<hi>per Species,</hi> as through a glaſs] by Metaphors or Parables, and this diſcovery is to raiſe up our hearts in thankfulneſs, admiration and longing deſires to be above with God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Some practical Inferences from this Doctrine.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>USE of all this briefly is in four conſectaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is undoubtedly ſuch a future ſtate as bliſs and bleſſedneſs for Gods' Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life. <hi>There remaineth a reſt to the people of God. Heb.</hi> 4.9. I need not go about to prove this, its ſufficiently and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly confirmed by abler hands; not only from Scripture, but Nature, Reaſon, Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the world, and the grace of God in the hearts of his people. Enough is ſaid to ſilence Atheiſm in our Spirits, and to ſtop the mouths of all Atheiſts on Earth. Can any rationally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God ſhould endow Man
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:32940:104"/>with ſuch a noble Soul, and endue that Soul with ſuch noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mind, Will, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Affections, capable of knowing, loving, injoying God, with fears and hopes of a future ſtate, and all this in vain? Can we think the holy, juſt, good, wiſe, righteous God will always promote the wicked and puniſh the godly, and not right theſe things in the next world? Hath Chriſt come into the world to no purpoſe? What would become of his Birth, Life, Doctrine, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, Interceſſion, coming to Judgment if there were no life of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution? What would become of the precepts, promiſes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, motives, means, helps to an holy life here, and to attain eternal life hereafter, if there were no ſuch thing? Can we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:32940:104"/>imagine that the great God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world by a lye. Are Heaven and Hell bug-bears, or meer imaginations of brain-ſick fools? Is there not a reality in Satans temptations, to draw or drive us from God and future happineſs? Or are there no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils or Spirits, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence no God? Away with theſe wild conceits, contrary to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of all Mankind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then it follows that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is attainable; not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective aſſurance, that there is a glorious inheritance, and that God will give it to ſome; but ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive alſo, that this is mine, that its for me; I have a title to it; elſe how could perſons thank God for making meet for this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This aſſurance ariſeth from actings of Faith, and produceth rejoycing in hope of this glory of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:32940:105"/>God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. The goſpel is a goſpel of peace, not of fears and doubts. Aſſurance may be had, not only by divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the uſe of ordinary means. <hi>I know in whom I have believed.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. Read on, and you'l find not only his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his preſent ſtate, but his perſeverance and future felicity; and its not his peculiar priviledge, but common to other Believers. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. Its true God is a free Agent, and may beſtow it on whom, and when he pleaſeth: Some have it moſt clearly at firſt Converſion; as <hi>Bernard</hi> for a time after his Converſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, as it were, deprived of his Senſes, by the exceſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations he had from God. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ſaith, <hi>He thought before his Converſion, it was impoſſible to find ſuch raptures and raviſhments
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:32940:105"/>as now he found in a Chriſtian courſe.</hi> Many a cloſe walking Chriſtian can ſet his ſeal to this truth; only it ordinarily comes in after hard conflicts, with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wreſtlings with God, much experience, and exact walking with God: There is Salvation and there is the joy of Gods Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Latimer) is the ſweet-meats of the feaſt of a good Conſcience.</hi> There are many other dainty diſhes at the feaſt, but this is the banquet: This is better felt then expreſſed; but muſt be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after, prayed for: <hi>Ask,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that your joy may be full. Joh.</hi> 16.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the work of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the great duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. This, this is the proper character and imployment of a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:32940:106"/>Chriſtian. God commands it, priviledges call for it, gracious Souls have been much in it; it is comprehenſive of mans whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> entitles the practical part of his Carechiſm [<hi>de Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine] of Gratitude.</hi> Oh that Chriſtians were more in it! Praiſe is comely for the upright. This is the Epitome of Religion, the Emblem of Heaven, the proper Air in which a Chriſtian breaths: Its moſt acceptable to God, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable to Religion, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Chriſtian. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us, the City <hi>Zurick</hi> ingrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Year of their deliverance from Popery upon Pillars, in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold, for a laſting Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial: And have not Chriſtians cauſe to thank God for grace and glory? The Heathens could ſay, <hi>Call a Man ingrateful, and you cannot call him worſe. Hezekiah</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:32940:106"/>brought wrath on himſelf, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for not rendring to the Lord according to benefits done to him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. Oh Sirs, you little know what an evil ingratitude is; you fill your Souls with guilt; you too much reſemble wicked men whoſe character is unthankful: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. That ſin makes hard times; yea, it makes you like the worſt of Heathen, for which ſin God gave them up; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 24. you act diſingenuouſly, as thoſe that have ſerved their turns of God, and then diſown him. How can you own God in the next ſtrait, that are ſo much in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears? Will not your mouth be ſtopt, and Conſcience fly in your face? Do you not daily depend on God for new Mercies? And is not thankfulneſs a natural duty? Is not gratitude for Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:32940:107"/>a great evidence of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them? And is not every Mercy ſweetened by thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Nay is not this a mean to continue them? The more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful any have been the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent they have been: Their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have ſhined and gliſtered like Pearls and Diamonds. Yea once more, the more thankful you are, and the more cauſe of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you will both have and ſee. Thankfulneſs for what you are ſure you have, will produce a fuller evidence of that you are doubtful of. The Lord humble us for our groſs ingratitude; which is (as one ſaith) a Monſter in Nature, a Solaeciſm in Manners, a Paradox in Divinity, and a parching Wind to damme up the Fountain of Divine Favours.</p>
               <p>You'l ſay, Oh Sir, I could be thankful with all my heart, if I
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:32940:107"/>knew I were fit for Heaven, and that my Soul ſhall at death enter into peace; but alas, as long as I am doubtful and at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how can I be thankful? Conſcience would check and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me; and indeed I have more cauſe to be humbled and aſhamed for my unmeetneſs, then thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any meetneſs I find in me for Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There may be grounds both of humiliation and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſame ſoul and ſubject. Let the beſt Saints do the beſt they can, and attain to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch imaginable, they ſhall have cauſe of humiliation for their defects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Holy jealouſie, fears, cares, do well in Gods Children, to keep them humble; and indeed, as grace increaſeth, fight of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections increaſeth, and ſenſe of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:32940:108"/>ſhort-coming; the more diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods holineſs, the viler will the Chriſtian be in his own eyes; as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah, Job</hi> 42. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. and the humbler the Soul is the fitter for God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. and 66.2. Thank God for that humility.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may and muſt be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Mercies which you have, and cannot deny but God hath vouchſafed: You have your lives for a prey; are out of Hell, which is more then you deſerve; you have abundant outward Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, do not theſe deſerve thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? Yea, Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed grace and glory for ſome; nay further, he hath put thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands into poſſeſſion of this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſhould not this make you thankful? Yea further, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is offered to you, and you are under the means of grace,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:32940:108"/>and in a poſſibility of obtaining this happineſs, which Devils and damned Souls are not; and is not this ground of thankfulneſs?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſure you keep in mind the diſtinction of habitual and actual meetneſs for Heaven: If you have not the former, either relative or real, be not adopted or juſtified, are neither convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor covenanted with God, I ſay, the Lord have mercy on you, your caſe is doleful; you have great cauſe of lamentation. Oh man, I am not now ſpeaking to thee; <hi>Be afflicted and mourn, let your laughter be turned into mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your joy to heavineſs. Jam.</hi> 4.9. Yea, you graceleſs <hi>rich men, weep and houl, for your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that ſhall come upon you. Jam.</hi> 5.1. I have not a word of comfort from the Lord to you. Your eatthly inheritances ſhall be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:32940:109"/>taken from you, and you ſhall be thruſt into the dungeon of Hell. You may for a while kindle a fire, and walk warm in the ſparks you have kindled, but, faith God, <hi>this ſhall you have of mine hand, ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow, Iſa.</hi> 50.11. Stand you by while the Saints take comfort in their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>It is to you the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to whom I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bear you this in mind, that its one thing to have right to this inheritance, another to know you have right. Many a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul is much in the dark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its relation, yet its ſtate ſafe for the main. What ſayeſt thou? Haſt thou not the things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. Hath not God been dealing with thy heart, as he uſeth to deal with ſuch as he deſigns for Heaven?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:32940:109"/>Haſt thou not ſeen thy woful ſtate by Nature? The neceſſity of Chriſt and grace? Haſt thou not experienced a change from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Grace, from Death to Life? Hath not this new birth coſt thee griefs and groans, prayers and tears? Doſt thou not delight now in what thou didſt diſdain? Is not thy principle, rule, end, otherwiſe then formerly? Haſt thou not changed thy company, courſes, manner of life? Speak out man, belye not thy ſelf, deny not Gods grace; ſomething like grace thou ſeeſt in thy ſelf, and to be ſure Satan and World op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and man and thy ſelf could not work it. It is of God, a ſeed ſown by the hand of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. <hi>And he that hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:32940:110"/>
               <p>As to actual meetneſs for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I refer you to what hath been laid down before; look it over, deal impartially; ſee if your experience do not anſwer thoſe heads; hath not God help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in the exerciſe of the graces of Faith, Hope, Love, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? Hath not God given you ſome grounded evidence of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, by diligence in duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on your ſtate, appealing to God, and pleading with God for the Spirits ſealings? Hath not God helpt you to be diſpatching your work off your hands, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Temporal, Relative and Publick? Are you not much mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to corruption, worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and have you not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized earthly things, and got more intimate familiarity with God? What ſay you to theſe things? Do not your hearts eccho
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32940:110"/>back, with your [<hi>probatum eſt</hi>] ſetting your ſeal to theſe things? I have not time nor room to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large further; but I would have you diligently compare your ſelves now with what you were ſome years ago. Is not your Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance more Evangelical? Doth not the ſenſe of divine love extort from you more tears of godly ſorrow, and more vehement ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all ſin, purely it is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to God? Hath not your Faith been more vigorous in its actings upon your dear Lord? In cloſing more fully with promiſes? Have you not been more frequent and ſerious in renewing your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God? And have not ſuch dayes and duties been ſolemn heart-melting opportunities? Have you not been more conſtant and inlarged in the duty of ſecret Prayer, with ſhorter intermiſſions<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32940:111"/>and more favourineſs? Do you ſpend your time better then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly? Do you fill up every va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy with ſome uſeful buſineſs for Earth or Heaven? Have you not more incomes of grace and aſſiſtance in duties both as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner? To knit your minds, and raiſe your affections to God, and ſometimes ſuggeſt words to you? Do you not more concern your ſelves for the Souls of Relations and others in Prayer and Diſcourſe? being more weight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the neceſſity of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? Are you not more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to Saints as Saints, though poor, or diſobliging, and of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſwaſion? Have you not got power over your Paſſions, to regulate them? And if you feel unruly motions, can you pray them down, and through grace calm them? Can you not put up
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:32940:111"/>injuries and affronts, and not only ſo as not to revenge and forgive, but pray more heartily for the repentance and remiſſion of ſuch as are moſt malicious againſt you? Is it not more the grief of thy heart when God is diſhonoured, his Spirit grieved, his Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the ſins of profane or profeſſours? If thou think any body is offended by thee, is it not more a real trouble to thee then formerly? And thou canſt not be quiet till thou ſeekeſt Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And if thou be conſcious of giving them juſt occaſion, thou confeſſeſt thy fault and humbleſt thy ſelf to them? Haſt thou not learned more faithfully and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly to manage the duty of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admonition of an offending Chriſtian? Drawing out bowels of compaſſion for and to ſuch as are fallen? Do not publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:32940:112"/>of Church or Nation lye nearer thy heart daily? Canſt thou not more rejoyce in the gifts, graces, holineſs, uſefulneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though it obſcure thine? Art thou not more glad when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are mortified then grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? When occaſions of ſinning are removed, rather then afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though it coſt thee dear? Doſt thou not more ſenſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſweet life of faith in temporals? Committing all to God, thou findeſt proviſions have been ſtrangely made? Are not thy affections more ſpiritualized to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deareſt Relations? Doſt thou not love them in the Lord, and the Lord in them, and canſt freely part with them upon Gods call? Art thou not more taken up with Gods Mercies, to give him the glory of them, then any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal content thou haſt in them?
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:32940:112"/>Is not thy heart daily more weary of the world, and longing for Heaven? Yet after all this canſt thou not ſay, thou art nothing, deſerveſt nothing but Hell? And if God glorifie his Juſtice in thy confuſion, thy mouth is ſtopped, and thou muſt juſtifie him for ever with flames about thine Eares? Doſt thou not account thy ſelf the greateſt of Sinners, leaſt of Saints, and by the grace of God thou art what thou art? And this thou canſt truly ſay, that God is more thy exceeding joy, and Chriſt more precious to thy Soul then ever?</p>
               <p>Canſt thou in thy ſober, ſolid, ſetled frame, anſwer theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thy ſtate is ſafe and ſweet, and thou art meet for Heaven; yet not ſo meet, but ſtill breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after more meetneſs, till thy laſt gaſp of breath; for no man
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:32940:113"/>on this ſide death was ever meet enough, and all muſt be aſcribed to grace, grace in the foundation, grace in the topſtone: I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with a part of a Poem in Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> called <hi>Grace;</hi> p. 52.</p>
