            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter, beloved we finde the bleſſed Apoſtle opening and applying the Doctrine of Faith, having firſt aſſured them, that he and the reſt of Chriſts Diſciples
<pb facs="tcp:108229:4"/>were in the number of thoſe who did believe to the ſaving of their ſouls. Having told them in the 38. verſe of the foregoing Chapter that <hi>the juſt ſhall live by ſaith;</hi> he comes here in this Chapter largely to declare and ſhew unto them what ſaving Faith is: and this is laid down in the fire firſt verſes of this Chapter. As, firſt, <hi>It is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen; a means to obtain a good report.</hi> Through Faith the imbrace the truth of God contained in the word, as the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world by the word of God. By faith; and by faith alone, our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, our ſervices, our duties, our perſons, and performances are acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted in Ieſus Chriſt. By faith we receive whatſoever we ask of God in prayer, <hi>Matthew 21.22. And without ſaith</hi> (in the ſixth verſe you ſee) <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And from the ſeventh verſe to the end of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter he ſets down the ſeveral fruits and effects of faith in all ages, by the moſt eminent examples of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108229:4"/>I ſhall not now trouble you with the ſeveral particular examples of faith recorded in the Chapter, but ſhall leave them to your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meditation as you finde them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Chapter, and conſider what is there ſaid, <hi>and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things, 2 Tim. 2.3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which I intend briefly to inſiſt upon, is that eminent example of the faith of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, in that he choſe <hi>rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, than all the honors of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the Obſervations which ſlow from hence, give me leave a little to look back into the two forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes, wherein we have firſt the example of the eminent faith of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> parents, who contrary to the Kings command refuſed to deſtroy him; the King he commanded all the males to be ſlain, but they being ſtrong in faith, by hiding of him did
<pb facs="tcp:108229:5"/>preſerve him; and when they could hide him no longer, they choſe rather to truſt him to the mercy of God, by caſting him upon the water, rather than to endanger his life by the hands of mercileſs and bloody men. And this they did as the Apoſtle here ſaith, <hi>not fearing the Kings commandment.</hi> There are ſeveral uſeful and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtructions which may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from hence, I ſhall onely name them, and ſo procéed.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is this, that God takes ſpecial notice of his peoples faith, he records it to all poſterity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I obſerve from hence, that its a very great mercy to be born of faithful and bolieving parents: had not <hi>Moſes</hi> parents been faithful and believing, <hi>Moſes</hi> might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed as well as others were.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I note from hence, that God can and will preſerve his people, maugre all the rage and malice of the Devil and all his inſtruments. The enemies of Gods people may deſign evil againſt them, but the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them: when men are as it
<pb facs="tcp:108229:5"/>were at their wits end, and know not which may to fly for <hi>ſuccour,</hi> then doth God know how to deliver them. Though the afflictions of Gods people are many, yet out of them all will God deliver them, <hi>Pſam. 34.</hi> and the <hi>19</hi> verſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I note from hence, that it is lawful to diſobey the wicked and unlawful commands of lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If Kings command that which God (who is King of Kings) forbids, we ought rather to obey God than men: inſtances of this truth we have many in Scripture. Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is that unparallel'd example of the three Children, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> in the third Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King commanded all to fall down and worſhip his golden Image, or elſe to be caſt into the fiery furnace, they ſtoutly reſiſted, knowing that God was able to deliver them. <hi>Be it known to thee, O King, we will not ſerve thy gods.</hi> If they obeyed not the King, then they muſt expect nothing but to be caſt into the burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:
<pb facs="tcp:108229:6"/>but this they feared not, they took no care to anſwer the King in this matter, they knew God was able to deliver them; however, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved whether deliverance came or not, they would rather ſuffer than ſin. <hi>If it be ſo that we muſt be caſt into the furnace, we know our God is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us: but if not, though we be not delivered, yet be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the golden Image that thou haſt ſet up.</hi> The King he threatens a burning fiery turnace, alas, thats very dreadful, very terrible to fleſh and blood, but whats the fire of men to the everlaſting fire of God: mens fire that can onely conſume a poor rotten carkaſs, but the fire of God that is unquenchable, and will deſtroy both body and ſoul. Men can onely kill the body, and after that they can do no more; but God can deſtroy both body and ſoul, and that for evermore.</p>
            <p>Excellent was that holy ſaying of that holy man of God, the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Polycarp,</hi> St. <hi>Johns</hi> diſciple, when the Emperour threatned him with fire if he would not forſake Chriſt: Alas, ſaith he, you threaten me with your fire, alas, what a poor inconſiderable thing is your fire! You do not, ſaith he, conſider that ever laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire which God threatens. Do likewiſe the holy Apoſtles of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, in the <hi>4.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>18.</hi> and <hi>19.</hi> Verſes, when the Rulers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them not to preach in the name of Ieſus, they anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, judge ye.</hi> God commands Miniſters to preach the Goſpel, and Miniſters ought to preach the Goſpel, notwithſtanding the commands of men to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the <hi>25.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> Verſ. <hi>29,</hi> when the Apoſtles were brought before the High Prieſts and Councel, and by them queſtioned for doing their duty, namely for preaching the Goſpel; you will finde in the <hi>29.</hi> ver that St. <hi>Peter and the other Apoſtles anſwered and ſaid, We ought to obey God rather than men.</hi> And after that
<pb facs="tcp:108229:7"/>when they were beaten, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to preach any more in the name of Ieſus, what did the Apoſtles do, did they obey? no. <hi>They rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt.</hi> And as you may ſee in the laſt verſe of that Chapter, <hi>That daily in the Temple, and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and to preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other inſtances I might give you, but I proceed. In the next place, the next thing conſiderable is the eminency of <hi>Moſes</hi> faith, in the <hi>24, 25, 26.</hi> verſes. <hi>By faith Moſes when he was come to years refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter;</hi> where by the way obſerve, that it is more honour to be a Chriſtian, than to be a Courtier. It is more honourable to be the ſon of God by grace and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, than to be the ſon of the greateſt Monarch or Emperour in the World. There is none ſo nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in all the world as the people of God, they are of the Blood Royal of Heaven: others they may take their pedegree from Kings, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
<pb facs="tcp:108229:7"/>and the great ones of the world; but the people of God are all deſcended from him <hi>who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> the bleſſed and onely potentate, <hi>1 Timothy 6.15.</hi> Yea the people of God are all of them <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions 1.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here likewiſe we might obſerve what low thoughts Chriſtians ought to have of every thing, be it never ſo honourable, in compariſon of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It had been an honour, yes an exceeding great honour, if we may account worldly greatneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been reputed the ſon of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, but how inconſiderable a thing was this in the eyes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was more nobly deſcended, being born of God, a choſen ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt, to go in and out before his people Iſrael: but I proceed.</p>
            <p>Now the eminency of <hi>Moſes</hi> faith you may ſee in theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſees the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious difficulties and dangers which were then like to fall upon him for his
<pb facs="tcp:108229:8"/>faith. Will <hi>Moſes</hi> forſake <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and embrace Ieſus Chriſt, then <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> muſt ſuffer affliction: this <hi>Moſes</hi> foreſees, and this makes his <hi>faith</hi> more glorious. As the people of God are by faith aſſured of Chriſt, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe being once in Chriſt, they are ſure to bear the Croſſe of Chriſt: Chriſt and his Croſs are inſeparable: <hi>All taht will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution, 2 Timothy 3.11.</hi> See what our bleſſed Saviour ſaith in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Luke, If any man will come after me,</hi> that is, if any man will be a good Chriſtian, <hi>let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me, Luke 9.23.</hi> He that will follow Chriſt muſt bear the Croſs as the bleſſed Apoſtles did, they <hi>rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi> And truly the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of God may well rejoyce in their ſufferings; for why, Chriſt hath born the brunt of all, he hath made our burthen light: although Chriſt by his ſufferings hath not fréed the people of God from ſufferings, yet he hath made their ſufferings to become eaſie.
<pb facs="tcp:108229:8"/>Iuſt as it is with a man carrying a great trée on his back, and you may ſée little children to bear up the ſmall twigs of the trée; alas, there is no weight in them, the weight of all the whole but then lies on the mans ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: ſo, beloved, it is with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chriſt carries the load, the weight of all their afflictions, they do but bear up the little end, the ſmall twigs of it; therefore the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently calls his afflictions light: <hi>Our light affliction,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 2 Cor. 4.17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the eminency of <hi>Moſes</hi> faith appcars alſo in this, namely, the great willingneſs and forwardneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that it is ſaid, <hi>He choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer affliction with the people;</hi> which intimates unto us, the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> to become the ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt. Certainly this was a very great at of faith in <hi>Moſes,</hi> a carnal eye would rather have choſen to have béen the ſon of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, an eye of ſenſe which ſées
<pb facs="tcp:108229:9"/>no better, would rather have choſen greatneſs and eminency in the world; then the meanneſs and poverty of Gods people: rather to have béen <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Grandchilde, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at Court, then to have béen the poor afflicted ſons of Gad. Carnal men, men whoſe God is their wealth, and whoſe hearts are ſet upon their riches, would rather chuſe to be rich with <hi>Dives,</hi> than to be poor with <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> but a gracious Soul had rather want bread with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> than to want grace with <hi>Dives.</hi> It is not all the riches in the world that can content and ſatisfie the ſoul of a Saint; a few will ſée it better for him, if God ſées it good for him to beg his bread with poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> on earth, than to beg his water with rich <hi>Dives</hi> in hell.</p>
            <p>A godly man by faith ſées that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is to come, they know <hi>that when this earthly tabernacle of theirs ſhall be diſſolved, that they have a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in heaven, an inheritance which is uncorruptible and undefiled, which paſſeth not away, reſerved in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them who do believe:</hi> but a
<pb facs="tcp:108229:9"/>wicked man he ſees onely by an eye of ſenſe, he ſees no farther than his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; he thinks if he may be great and honourable here in the world, he eſteems this the onely happineſs, and he thinks nothing better than to be rich; and indeed he may well think ſo, for he knows of no better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The world with the honours and pleaſures of it are even a heaven to the men of this world; I, and indeed it is all the heaven they ſhall have. <hi>Son, remember</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives</hi> in the <hi>16.</hi> of. St. <hi>Luke) that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> would very fain have enjoyed heaven after his death, and yet he would live upon earth in ſuch a ſumptuous delicious manner, as if this would had been his onely heaven: And true it is; the postion of a wicked man is in this life. God gives wicked men their portion in this life, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a portion for his Saints in the life to come. Wicked men are very like to ſome prodigal ſpendthrifts, who ſpend all their portion before they come to years; but the portion of
<pb facs="tcp:108229:10"/>Gods people is reſerved for them till they come to age. God ſees it good, yea beſt for his Children to have their portions reſerved for them till they come to years, and that is till they come to heaven. He gives his people as much of the world as may ſerve to bear their charges to heaven; but their full portion he reſerves for them till they come to heaven: and truly the portion of a Child of God is very great.</p>
            <p>God is the portion of his people, and believe it God will never ſee his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple want ſo long as he hath it; and Gods treaſure is inexhauſtible, it can never be drawn dry: <hi>All things are yours</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 3.21.</hi>) peaking to the believing Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſns) <hi>whether Paul, or Apollo, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahas, or the world, or life, or death, or phings preſent, or things to come, all tre yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt as Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly run over the words, I come now to give the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Obſervations which flow from hence for our edification:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108229:10"/>And firſt of all, I obſerve from henc the tranſcendent excellency of ſavin faith, by faith <hi>Moſes</hi> did thus and thus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I <hi>note</hi> from hence, tha the condition of Gods Children in this life, is an afflicted condition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I obſerve likewiſe from hence, that the people of God ſhould rather ſuffer any affliction, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt ſin; it is better to ſuffer than ſin.</p>
            <p>And then fourthly, I obſerve hence, the great vanity of ſinful pleaſures, they are but for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I obſerve, that the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt are better, yea, as the Text ſweetly expreſſes if; <hi>are greater riches than all the honours of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then laſtly, I obſerve from hence, that God hath a recompence of reward for his people, he will make them amends for all their loſſes at the laſt: he that loſeth any thing for Chriſt, ſhall be no loſer by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <hi>Every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands.
<pb facs="tcp:108229:11"/>for my Name ſake, ſhall receive an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life, Mat. 19.29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to Application, I ſhall a little open and confirm theſe ſeveral truths by way of Doctrinal Explication: And to begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> What faith is a moſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, excellent, and ſaving grace; and this you may ſee all along this whole Chapter. Firſt, it brings the people of God into a good report. By faith our ſervices become acceptable in the ſight of God. <hi>And without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; For whatſoever is not of faith is ſin. By faith, Noah being warned of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Ark, to the ſaving of his houſe, and thereby became an heir of righteouſneſs. By faith Abraham for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his Countrey,</hi> for by faith he ſaw the heavenly City which God had prepared for him. And all along the whole Chapter you may ſee the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of faith in the ſeveral effects of it in the faithful Saints and ſervants of God, who of all others, beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of Worthies: <hi>Who
<pb facs="tcp:108229:11"/>through faith ſubdued Kingdomes, wrought righteouſneſſe, obtained promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the Sword. And others had trial of cruel mockings and ſcourgings; yea, moreover, bonds and impriſonments. They were ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, were tempted, ſlain with the ſword: They wandred about in ſheepskins and goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins being deſtitute, afflicted, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> Theſe all obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through faith, By faith the ſick are healed, <hi>Luke 7.50.</hi> Dy faith the people of God are purified, juſtified; and by faith they are ſaved, <hi>Rom. 5.1. Epheſ. 2.8.</hi> By faith we have acceſs to God by prayer, <hi>Rom. 5.2.</hi> By faith we believe the word of God, and they that by faith do believe in God, ſhall at the laſt receive the end of their faith, even the ſalvation of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls, <hi>1 Pet. 1.9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place to come to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, which is this, That the condition of Gods children in this life is an afflicted condition: God had but one Son without ſin, but God hath
<pb facs="tcp:108229:12"/>never a ſon without affliction. Our bleſſed Saviour himſelf was not free from afflictions; nay, <hi>he was deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief; he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and he was afflicted, Iſa. 53.3, 7.</hi> The Prophets they were afflicted and impriſoned, and ſlain, Likewiſe the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as you may ſee at large in this Chapter where my Text is, <hi>Heb. 11. They were ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, cruelly ſcourged and impriſoned:</hi> yea, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Many are the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all, Pſal, 34.19.</hi> Our Saviour tells his Diſciples what they muſt look for in the world at his departure from them: <hi>If the world hate you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John 17.18, 19) ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the world, that I have choſen you out of the world; therefore the world hateth you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the word that I ſaid unto you, the ſervants is not greater than their
<pb facs="tcp:108229:12"/>Lord: if they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you; and all theſe things will they do unto you for my names ſake.</hi> Yea, ſaith the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Paul;</hi> reckoning up his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold perſecutions in <hi>2 Tim. 3.12. All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecutions.</hi> Many more Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures I might give you for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this excellent truth, but theſe I hope may ſuffice, this being a truth which the people of God in all ages have born teſtimony unto with their blood. Nay, this truth is ſo clear, that it even may be read by the light of theſe fires in which the Saints of God ſuffered death, thoſe glorious fires which ever burneth freſh in the memory of Gods people, even thoſe fiery chariots which carried out heavenly <hi>Elijahs,</hi> our bleſſed Martyrs to heaven.</p>
            <p>In the third place, the third Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be conſidered is this; That the people of God ſhould rather ſuffer any affliction than ſin. This you may ſee in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who rather than he would commit folly with his Miſtriſs,
<pb facs="tcp:108229:13"/>rather then ſin againſt God, he would run the hazard of all afflictions. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, aad ſin againſt God, Gen. 39.9.</hi> And this truth is moſt eminently confirmed by holy <hi>Job,</hi> who rather than he would curſe God and dye, would willingly with patience undergo all his afflictions. <hi>Job</hi> underwent all afflictions, and it is ſaid of him, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not.</hi> Let God afflict ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> I will ſuffer with patience; it is the Lord, let him do what he pleaſes, my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhall never move me to forſake my God. Though God afflict me all the dayes of my life, yet will I wait with patience till my change come. And in the thirteenth Chayter he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves <hi>though God ſhould kill him, yet he would truſt in him.</hi> So likewiſe we finde an eminent example for this in holy <hi>Daniel,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Dan. 6.14, 15, 16. Daniel</hi> rather than he would ſin againſt God in ceaſing to call upon God by prayer, would ſuffer himſelf to be caſt into the Lions den. So likewiſe the three children in the third Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> rather than
<pb facs="tcp:108229:13"/>they would ſin againſt God, by worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>of Nebuchadnezzars</hi> golden Image, would undergo the furious flames of his burning fiery furnace, So the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles, as you heard before, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then than they would obey the wicked commands of men, in not preaching the Goſpel, willingly rejoyced in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering affliction for ſo doing. Many more examples I might give you, but theſe I hope may ſuffice: and if there had been no other example than what is ſet down in the words of the Text, this heavenly truth had been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, I come to prove the vanity of all ſinful pleaſures, and that may appear, firſt from the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them; and ſecondly from the bitterneſſe of their end. They are but for a ſeaſon, they come to an end; nay, they ſhall end in endleſs woe and miſery. Though ſin be ſweet for the preſent, yet its bitter, yea, bitterneſſe it ſelf in the latter end. Though ſin may be pleaſant for a ſeaſon, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. I beſeech you, it will be painful to eternity. The pleaſures of
<pb facs="tcp:108229:14"/>ſin they have an end, but the pains and torments which ſin procures, they have no end. When ſinners have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the wrath of God ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand millions of years, yet then are their torments as far off from having an end, as they were at firſt. The torments for ſin are eternal, and I beſeech you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber enternity hath no end: what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then can there be in that which brings eternal pains with it? Sinners even when they delight themſelves in their ſins, even then are they pulling deſtruction upon themſelves, even eternal deſtruction. Every ſtep in ſin how ſweet, how delightful ſoever it be in the eyes of the ſinner, is a ſtop to miſery, enternal miſery. They that haſten to ſin, haſten to ſorrow; yea, they run to hell. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>They love death;</hi> he doth not mean that ſinners love death, as death; there is no beauty, or amiableneſs at all in death ſimply conſidered in it ſelf; but yet they may be truly ſaid to love death who love ſin, and delight in ſin, and live in ſin. The wages of
<pb facs="tcp:108229:14"/>ſin ye know is death, <hi>Rom. 6.23.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſin is a haſting into the armes of death. Sinners by their delight in ſin do as it were woe death, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite death and the grave, even hell and deſtruction: ſo that even ſinners themſelves, though now for a while Satan blindes their eyes, yet at laſt when it is too too late they ſhall be forced to confeſs and ſay, that there is neither pleaſure nor profit in ſin. The Devil makes the ſinner believe that there is a great deal of pleaſure and profit in ſin; you ſhall get by it, ſaith the Devil: but let ſinners once truly caſt up their accounts, how that eternal damnation will be their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and then let them ſee what they have gotten by ſin. It is poſſible I confeſſ, that ſome may ſay they have gotten hundreds and thouſands by it; they have gotten Houſes, and Lands, Honour Eſteem among men, pleaſure and profit in the world: but what a miſerable gain is that which is gotten with the loſs of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Read that dreadful Scripture in
<pb facs="tcp:108229:15"/>St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, <hi>Mat. 16.26.</hi> and then ſee if there be any thing gotten by ſin: <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Will thy Riches which thou haſt gotten by ſin, by oppreſſing the poor, and defrauding thy neighbour; redeem thy ſoul from death, ſurely no. Thou mayeſt delight thy ſelf in enlarging thy barns, as that rich Fool did: <hi>But thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, then whoſe ſhall they be.</hi> There is no loſs like the loſs of the ſoul. There is nothing to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſin; thou mayeſt loſe thy ſoul by ſin, and loſe heaven by thy ſin, and loſe the love and favour of God by ſin. Sin may pretend pleaſure and profit, but ſurely it brings ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Thoſe rich men which Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>James 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> Verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they thought that gain which they got by defrauding their labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their wages to be very ſweet: they lived in pleaſures, they inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves by the ſweat of other mens labours: but what have they any
<pb facs="tcp:108229:15"/>cauſe to rejoyce in this? No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Go too now ye rich men, weep and howl, for your miſery which ſhall come upon you.</hi> They thought to heap up riches by their injuſtice and cruelty, but they heaped up onely a little fuel for the eternal fire. <hi>Dives</hi> he thought himſelf altogether happy when he enjoyed the world at will, <hi>when he fared deliciouſly every day;</hi> but what did this profit <hi>Dives?</hi> death robs him of all, and he himſelf is taken away from his ſinful pleaſures, and thrown headlong into eternal torments: he would enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſin while he lived, and now he muſt undergo the torments of ſin for ever.</p>
            <p>O conſider this you that delight in ſin; canſt thou endure to dwell for ever in the everlaſting burning: if thou canſt endure the wrath of God for ever, if thou art able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the day of his fierce anger, then take pleaſure in ſin: if thou canſt prevent God from bringing thee to judgement, then let thy heat rejoyce in ſin: but if after all thou
<pb facs="tcp:108229:16"/>muſt come to judgement, then take heed of ſin. Do not conceit that ſin to be pleaſant whoſe pains will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: in vain do men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they may ſin and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; did ever any man rebel and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy peace; can any offend God and have his bleſſing, ſurely no: ſin ſhall not go unpuniſhed; if men will ſin they ſhall ſuffer. <hi>The ſoul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhall dye.</hi> Sin deſtroyed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, thoſe holy Spirits, ſin made them unholy devils. Sin caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice. Sin deſtroyed the old World. Sin conſumed <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Sin brings Wars, Plagues, Famine, &amp; Deſtruction upon Nations. Sin ruins our names, ſears our Conſciences: and in a word, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys body and ſoul for ever.</p>
            <p>And then fifthly, I obſerved, That the reproaches of Chriſt are greater riches than all the honours of the world. The beſt of Gods Saints have been reproached, as holy <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was not onely reproached, but was a reproach both to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and to his neighbours: He was
<pb facs="tcp:108229:16"/>
               <hi>made the ſong of the Drunkards.</hi> The Apoſtles they were alſo reproached, but here is that which ſweetens all, Chriſt hath born the brunt of all: Chriſt accounts all our reproaches to be his. The greateſt part of Chriſts ſuffering for us was to bear our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: ſo the greateſt part of our ſufferings is to bear the reproach of Chriſt. Hence the Apoſtle in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, exhorts us to go forth unto him, bearing his reproach, Heb. 13.13.</hi> And Indeed reproach in it ſelf is ſo great a burthen, that were it not for his that Chriſt accounts it his, we ſhould never be able to bear it. Hence <hi>Moſes</hi> looked on his reproach as the reproach of Chriſt; and believe me, though there may be a great deal of weight in the reproaches of Chriſt, to preſs us down, yet there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of worth in them to inrich us: though they may be as thorns here, yet they ſhall be as a crown of glory to us hereafter.</p>
            <p>See what our Saviour ſaith in <hi>Matth. 5.11, 12. Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, foe
<pb facs="tcp:108229:17"/>theirs is the kingdome of heaven. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, if ye be rich and honourable in the world you ſhall be bleſſed: but Chriſt ſaith, if thou art reproached thou ſhalt be bleſſed. Thou mayeſt be rich and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world, and yet be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miſerable: but if thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for Chriſt, thou ſhalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Chriſt, <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him, 2 Tim. 2.12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, I obſerve from hence, That God hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward for his people. If we ſuffer for Chriſt, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reign with Chriſt: If we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with Chriſt here, we ſhall be rewarded with Chriſt hereafter. See what our bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth. 19.29. Every one that hath forſaken houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb facs="tcp:108229:17"/>or friends, for my ſake, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might be longer on this point but I procéed to the Vſes which ſhall flow from hence for our edification. And the firſt Vſe is this, Is it ſo then, that Faith is ſuch an excellent grace, then let me exhort you all, in the name of Chriſt, to believe, to get Faith. Beloved, Faith is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent in it ſelf, but it will alſo make you excellent: <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour, Prov. 15.26.</hi> Believers were the onely excellent perſons in whom <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, <hi>Pſalm. 16.3. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb. 11.6. For whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> and God cannot be pleaſed with ſin. In a word, if ever you would be ſaved, get faith, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith there is no ſalvation: it is unbelief which is the ſoul-damning ſin. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> The Sentence of damnation is already paſt againſt all unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<pb facs="tcp:108229:18"/>
               <hi>He that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, John 3.18. He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, John 3.36.</hi> For the Lords ſake ſinners believe, if you have any regard to your own good believe; if you have any love or pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to your precious ſouls believe; if you would not be eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, believe in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be eternally bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it ſo that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods Children in this life is an afflicted condition, what then ſhall the condition of wicked men be in the life to come? <hi>If judgment thus begin at the houſe of God, what then ſhall be the end of ſinners? If the righteous be thus ſcarcely ſaved, where then ſhall the ſinner and ungodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?</hi> If God be thus ſevere to his Children, how terrible will he then be to his enemies: If through ſo many tribulations the people of God enter into heaven, then into
<pb facs="tcp:108229:18"/>what woeful miſeries doe ſinners plunge themſelves into for a few ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures; for a few ſéeming ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures they heap to themſelves eternal torments. O conſider this you that forget God. In this life the people of God are afflicted, but in the life to coure they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. <hi>Lazarus</hi> he was afflicted with hunger and ſores, yea ſcorned and contemned by <hi>Dives;</hi> but in the life to come <hi>Lazarus</hi> is rewarded, but <hi>Dives</hi> is tormented. The time will come when Gods people ſhall have pleaſures, everlaſting pleaſures, when <hi>the wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God, Pſalm 9.17. The Lord tryeth the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, (ſaith David) but the wicked and him that loveth violence his ſoul hateth. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup, Pſalm 11.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is it better to ſuffer than to ſin, then this may inform us of the great evil of apoſtacy; they that will turn from the truth rather than
<pb facs="tcp:108229:19"/>ſuffer for the truth, ſuch I ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did imbrace the truth in the love of it; they went out from us, but they were not of us. Many will own Chriſt and the word of Chriſt when they may do it without fear, but when trouble and perſecutions come, then they fall away. But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are that in this caſe go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſave their lives ſhall loſe them: they that deny Chriſt for fear of perſecution, Chriſt will deny him before his Father. Apoſtacy was the ſin of the Devil, and they that apoſtatize from Chriſt for fear of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſhall have the Devils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thou wilt not ſuffer for Chriſt, but Chriſt will make thée ſuffer eternally. Thou thinkeſt life is ſwéet, and indéed ſo it is, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member eternal life is much more ſweeter, and the ſoul is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than life. Chriſt laid down his life to ſave ſouls, therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould lay down ten thouſand lives, if it were poſſible to have ſo many, rather than loſe their ſouls. By apoſtacy from the truth thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb facs="tcp:108229:19"/>ſave thy life, but in ſo doing thou loſeſt thy ſoul, which is of more value than ten thouſand lives. Did Chriſt lay down his life for us, and ſhall not we much more lay down our lives for him. Did Chriſt who, is the prince of life become obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe for us, then let nothing ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould ſhew themſelves to be the ſervants of Chriſt by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, perſecutions; be the way what it will, fair or foul, thick or thin, Chriſtians ſhould perſevere. The Apoſtles loved not their lives unto the death in the cauſe of Chriſt: and he that is afraid of his life in the cauſe of Chriſt, is ſurely afraid of heaven. If he that endures to the end ſhall be ſaved, then certainly he that falls away ſhall be damned. If we fear them who can onely kill the body, more than God who is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell, what will become of us. In a word, let me encourage you all in the words of the holy Ghoſt, as you may finde
<pb facs="tcp:108229:20"/>it, <hi>Revel. 3.10.</hi> what ſaith God there, <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer, behold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon that you may be tryed, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten dayes: But be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is it ſo, that all ſinful pleaſures are ſhort and vain, are they but for a ſeaſon, then I note from hence by way of Vſe, the great folly of ſinners in neglecting eternal life for a few momentary pleaſures. Sinners ſpend their time in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pebbles, and yet they trample upon pearls: How many grievous ſinners are there, who with that wretched Cardinal are ready to ſay, they will not loſe their part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for their parts in Paradice. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had rather loſe heaven than part with their ſins; as if they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the pleaſure of ſin for ever, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidering how ſoon death may come upon them, and turn all their pleaſures into pains. Sinners are apt to flatter themſelves in their own
<pb facs="tcp:108229:20"/>folly, and to fancy that they ſhall live for ever, or at leaſtwiſe that they may enjoy their pleaſures till death come, and yet go to heaven: it is true, God ſuffers many to go on in their ſins, and never awakes their ſouls at all; but this he doth in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sinners deſpiſe Chriſt now, but Chriſt will hereafter deſpiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: They who ſay unto God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part now, we will have none of the fear of the Lord, God will ſay unto them depart ye curſed hereafter. When death comes, ſinners muſt bid farewel to all their pleaſures; they rejoyce in their worldly pleaſures here, but when death comes, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well pleaſures: not one laughter more, then never another jovial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then no more ranting and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then all pleaſures will be turned into pains.</p>
            <p>Conſider, I beſeech you ſinners, will your pleaſures profit you in the day of wrath, ſurely no; they may torment you as they did <hi>Dives.</hi> How many are there now in hell, who had as much pleaſure as thou canſt have.
<pb facs="tcp:108229:21"/>who had as many merry méetings, as much drinking, and ſporting, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinful partimes as thou haſt had: Oh, but what pleaſure is it now to them to think of thoſe things for which they are now tormented? The Lord awaken every ſecure ſinner: for the Lords ſake be not ſuch fools as to damn your ſouls for ſuch trifles as theſe are, which are not only vanity, but vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit alſo, even horrour and dread to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is it ſo, that the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt are greater riches than all the honours in the world, then I obſerve from hence, that a Crown of life is more worth than all the Crowns and Kingdomes in the world. <hi>Moſes</hi> he looked upon <hi>Pharaohs</hi> crown, and he ſées that to be fading and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; but <hi>Moſes</hi> he looks upon the crown of life, and ſees that to be everlaſting. Kings by the permiſſion of God, for the ſins of a Nation, may be deprived of their earthly Crowns, as by ſad experience we have found in this Kingdome; but the Crown of life which God ſhall give
<pb facs="tcp:108229:21"/>his people is beyond the reach either of men or devils to deprive them of: God ſhall give it them, and none ſhall be able to take it from them. There ſhall be no Vſurpers in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to rob Gods people of their Crowns: there ſhall be no petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor remonſtrating againſt the Saints in heaven: the Devil who is now their accuſer ſhall then be thrown down into the bottomleſſe pit. The Saints Crowns ſhall not be voted uſeleſſe and dangerous in heaven. God may for our ſins ſuffer high Courts of Injuſtice here to take away the lives of Kings, but it is beyond the power and policy, either of them or devils, to take away eternal life from the people of God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>they are kept by the mighty power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> Men may take away the life of a Saint, but this now takes not away their Crown. <hi>Your joy no man tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from you, ſaith our</hi> Saviour, <hi>John 16.22.</hi> Men cannot deprive the people of God of their joy here, and certainly therefore neither men nor
<pb facs="tcp:108229:22"/>devils can take away their eternal joy, which ſhall be without ſorrow, and without ceaſing, even for ever to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Is it ſo, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt are ſuch great riches yea, greater riches than all the honors of the world; how great then are the rewards of Chriſt? If Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be ſo lovely, how unſpeakable lovely then is Chriſt in Glory? If the Saints be ſo glorious here under reproaches, how glorious than ſhall they be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when Chriſt himſelf ſhall put his glory unto them. If the people of God are ſo glorious here, what ſhall they be when they come to their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where they ſhall be clothed with the glorious white robes of Chriſt? <hi>For when Chriſt who is our life ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we ſhall alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> At the day of judgement, O how glorious ſhall the people of God then appear; they ſhall have Crowns upon their heads, yea, they ſhall be clothed with glory, and honour, immortality, and life eternal for ever, <hi>Rom. 2.7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108229:22"/>Seventhly, Is it ſo then that God hath a recompence of reward for his people hereafter, then let me exhort you all to make choice of the Lord for your God: they that make choice of the Lord for their God here, ſhall be ſure to have him for their reward hereafter. It was a good reſolution that of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Joſhua 24.15. As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Let the men of the world run after Idols, and inventions of their own fancies, a child of God, a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> he will worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth. And if ever we would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Chriſt, the let us chuſe Chriſt, and the wayes of Chriſt. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to grow in grace, and to abound in holineſs, for godlineſs is the way to glory. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is great gain. Godlineſſe hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not onely of this life, but of the life to come.</hi> Were the wades of God never ſo hard and difficult, yet they have a glorious reward: Godlineſſe brings the beſt gain, eternal life and glory. Wouldſt thou in the day of Iudgement chuſe heaven rather than
<pb facs="tcp:108229:23"/>hell, then chuſe God and walk in his ways; imbrace holineſs although it be never ſo much deſpiſed by profane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if ever thou wouldſt be imbraced by Chriſt in heaven.</p>
            <p>Eightly, is it ſo, that there is ſuch a glorious reward for the people of God, then let us live and dye as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the heirs of Glory: <hi>Let us then walk worthy of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>1 Theſ. 2.12.) that hath called us to his Kingdom and glory.</hi> Is it ſo that the Saints of God ſhall ſhine as the ſtars in heaven, then let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God labour to ſhine as lights in the world: If thy inheritance be in heaven, then let thy converſation be in heaven: if your reward, your treaſure be there, then let your hearts be there alſo. Is thy name written in heaven, let the world ſée it then in the legible Character of Holineſſe. Think of that Crown of Glory which thou ſhalt everlaſtingly enjoy in heaven, and then ſo live that thou mayeſt be in a readineſſe to receive it. Get oyl in your lamps, grace in your ſouls, <hi>that when Chriſt who is your life
<pb facs="tcp:108229:23"/>ſhall appear, ye alſo may appear with him in glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the ſalvation of your ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, is there ſuch a reward for the people of God hereafter, than be content with what God gives thée in this life: be thy portion what it will, if heaven be thine, thou haſt that which is better than all the world; they that have Chriſt for their portion have no want. <hi>The Lord is my portion</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm 23.1.) therefore I ſhall not want.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul accounted all things but droſs and dung in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſt.</hi> Remember, it is better to be poor and godly, than rich and miſerable: Riches never made one ſoul happy, they have made many a ſoul miſerable. Let the people of God then take off their affections from the world: it becomes not the heirs of glory to look after ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, it is enough for Swine to be routing in the earth; Children who are fed at their fathers table will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regard the bones that are thrown to the dogs; they that are daily fed
<pb facs="tcp:108229:24"/>
               <hi>with the fat things of grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould never regard the vain and tranſitory things of the world. The glory of this world is but the portion of a reprobate; take them at the beſt they are but uncertain, here to day and gone to morrow; they may be deſtroyed by fire, they may be ſtoln away by thieves: thou mayeſt lay up treaſures here, and when thou haſt done all, they may be couſumed by ruſt and moths. Therefore take Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>counſel, and</hi> ſet your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things that are above, and not on things below: Let your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation then be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have, <hi>for God hath ſaid,</hi> I will never leave you nor forſake you. Heb. 13.5. <hi>So to conclude, I beſéech you</hi> fear the Lord all ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.</p>
