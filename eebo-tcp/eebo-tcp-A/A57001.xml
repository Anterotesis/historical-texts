            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Maillezais</hi> in <hi>Poitou.</hi> But after that,
to the great scandal of the Church,
he left the regular habit, for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
in which he wandred thorough ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places of the world; he went to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier</hi>

merry report runs of him: he lived
a pretty while in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
contracted friendship with many Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
as appears by his letters: And at the
same time he obtained absolution from
the same <hi>Pope,</hi> having incurr'd the
Ecclesiastical censures, partly by his
dissolute and debauch'd life, as by his
free and drolling humor, mocking and
jesting at all persons, and of all sorts at
<hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this most generous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
took him off from his profession of
Physick, to make use of him in his most
secret negotiations, and made him Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
of the Collegiate Church of St.
<hi>Maur,</hi> and Curate of the Church of
<hi>Meudon</hi> near <hi>Paris;</hi> here he did not
(as 'twas believed) compose his <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruellism,</hi>
but rather at another place
called the Deanry, near the Abbey of
our Lady's of <hi>Seville</hi> near <hi>Chinon,</hi> which
furnisht matter for this famous Satyre.
The Conversation <hi>Rabelais</hi> had with
the Monks of the house, who at that
time lived not in the austerity of their
order, makes him make use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christain,
the Vigneard of <hi>Seville,
Lernans, Bacheos,</hi> and of the <hi>Sibill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he makes mention of.</p>
            <p>This Piece of work was not sooner
publisht but he begot the blame and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of the world, which occasion'd him
in the year 1552. to write a condoling
letter unto his friend <hi>Odet</hi> Cardinal
<hi>Chattillon,</hi> giving the reason that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to compose it, which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the disquiet and tediousness from
sick and languishing persons, who were
diverted and consolated by this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
mirth, deploring the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umnious
envy of some Cannibals so animated
against him, as to say the Book was
stuft with heresies; which <hi>Francis</hi> the
first being made acquainted with, and
having the curiosity to read the Book,
found it unblameable.</p>
            <p>This satyrick work, by the single
approbation of the President <hi>de Thou,</hi>
is no contemptable piece, nor takes
off our Author from other works more
serious and learned; as are <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
his <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> which he purely &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put into Latin, and several letters,
both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> which he writ
with a neat stile unto the Cardinal <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon,</hi>

the Bishop of <hi>Maillezais,</hi> to
<hi>Andrew Tiragneau,</hi> and to other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of great learning: he publisht also
the <hi>Sciomachia</hi> and feasts made at <hi>Rome</hi>
in Cardinal <hi>du Bellay</hi>'s Pallace at the
Birth of the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> and 'tis
observed by his letters, that he was
a man of great business, having begot the
friendship of many Prelats and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is not certain when he
dyed, yet some say in the year 1553. as

               <head>Particulars of the life and humor
of Francis Rabelais.</head>
               <p>HE was born in <hi>Chinon</hi> a little
Town in <hi>Touraine,</hi> his Father
was an Apothecary called <hi>Thomas Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi>
and owner of the Deanry; he
was placed young amongst the Monks
<pb facs="tcp:41088:6"/>
of the Abbey of <hi>Seville,</hi> of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the Deanry, where proffiting
little, his Father sent him to <hi>Angiers</hi>
to study his humanities in the Convent
of <hi>Bamette,</hi> where he did not much
more than beget the acquaintance of
the <hi>du Bellay's,</hi> one of which was since
Cardinal, where 'tis said for some ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry
he was soundly beaten and
wounded.</p>
               <p>He lived under the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi>
the first, and 'tis said that the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
<hi>Du Prat,</hi> having a pick against the
Town of <hi>Mont-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ellier,</hi> caused an arrest
to be publisht, for the abolishing of the
priviledges of the faculty of Physick in
that Town, <hi>Rabelais</hi> was thought fit
and capable, being known to Cardinal
<hi>Bellay,</hi> to be deputed to Court, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the revocation of this arrest
by the mediation and favour of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Du Bellay,</hi> who was a favorite of
<hi>Francis</hi> the first; being in <hi>Paris</hi> and
finding no access to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
he counterfeited himself mad,
and put on a green Gown and a long
gray beard, and thus he walkt a good
while before the Chancellors house,
which was then near the great Convent
<pb facs="tcp:41088:7"/>
of the <hi>Augustins;</hi> many people, and
amongst the rest some of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
<hi>domesticks</hi> inquiring of him what he
was? he answered, he was the fleaer
of Calves, and that they that would be
first flead must make hast.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor made acquainted
with this discourse, commanded he
should be brought in at dinner time;
<hi>Rabelais</hi> being enter'd, made a Speech
so learned and full of authority, that
the Chancellor set him at his feet, and
promis'd him the confirming of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of <hi>Mont-pellier,</hi> which since
was performed, in memory of which
all Doctors upon their reception wear
<hi>Rabelais</hi>'s green gown, which is with
them in great esteem, as 'tis well known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cardinal Du Bellay</hi> deputed Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
to <hi>Rome,</hi> took with him <hi>Rabelais</hi>
in quality of his Physitian: 'tis usual for
Ambassadors to kiss the <hi>Pope's</hi> toe, the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> himself, and the rest of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
having performed the ceremonie,
<hi>Rabelais</hi> refused it with a jest.</p>
               <p>Another time the <hi>Cardinal</hi> with the
rest of his family went to beg a largess
of the <hi>Pope, Rabelais</hi> requested to make
his demand, desired his holiness to
<pb facs="tcp:41088:7"/>
excommunicate him.</p>
               <p>The demand being thought imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
was ill relisht, but being ask'd
the reason why he made it? he gave in
answer, that he was born in a little
Town called <hi>Chinon,</hi> very subject to
fire, and that there had already been
burnt many honest men, and some of
his kindred, and if your holiness ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
me I should never
burn.</p>
               <p>My reason is, said he, that passing
thorough <hi>Tarrant</hi> in the Cardinals
Train, where the cold was great, and
coming to a little Cabin where inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
a poor old woman, we desired her
to kindle us a faggot, which endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to do, she burnt almost all her
straw bed, and could not light the fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
which made her curse and swear
that the fagot was excommunicated by
the <hi>Popes</hi> own mouth, since it would
not burn.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Railleries</hi> and freedom he
took at <hi>Rome,</hi> forced him to flye into
<hi>France</hi> in a sad equipage, without any
money and a foot.</p>
               <p>Having reacht to <hi>Liens,</hi> he bethought
himself of a stratagem wherein a man
<pb facs="tcp:41088:8"/>
less known would have found more
danger, at the town's end he fill'd a
Portmantle with several rags of several
colors, and coming to an Inn, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
a good Chamber, telling his Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess,
that though she saw him in so bad
an equipage and a foot, yet he was able
to pay her the best shot she ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
he desired a Chamber remote
from company, some Boy that could
read &amp; write, and some bread and wine;
this being granted, in the little boy's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
he made up several little bundles
or parcels of the Ashes he found in the
Chimney, the boy being come with pen
and ink, he made him write upon one,
<hi>poyson for to kill the King;</hi> upon the
second, <hi>poyson for to kill the Queen;</hi>
and upon the third, <hi>poyson for to kill the
Duke of Orleans,</hi> and so of the rest
of the sons of <hi>France,</hi> fastned the bills
upon each of the little bundles, and told
the boy, Child take a care you speak
not of this to your Mother or to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else, for both your life and mine is
concern'd, then put up all in his Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle,
and called for dinner, which
was brought up.</p>
               <p>Whilst he dined the Child told all to
<pb facs="tcp:41088:8"/>
his Mother, who transported with fear,
thought she was obliged to acquaint
the Provost therewith, by reason of the
Pilgrims ill garb and equipage.</p>
               <p>This hapned presently after the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
was poison'd, which afflicted all
<hi>France</hi> very much: The Provost is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised,
he makes slight informations,
enters <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s Chamber, seizes him
and his Portmantle: his ill Garb, the
weariness of his journey, and the cross
answers he made increas'd the suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he said little else than Take a care
of my Portmantle, bring me before the
King for I have strange things to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
unto him.</p>
               <p>He is presently set on horse-back and
dispatch'd for <hi>Paris,</hi> is well entertained
by the way, and in few dayes he arrives
there, is brought before the King who
knew him, the Provost accuses him,
shewes the Portmantle, the several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Ashes; <hi>Rabelais</hi> relates his story,
takes of the several Ashes before the
King, all ended in laughter and mirth.</p>
               <p>His Brother or Nephew born like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at <hi>Chinon</hi> was an <hi>Apothecary,</hi> and
lived at the same Deanry in good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
and plenty, he dyed about the
<pb facs="tcp:41088:9"/>
year 1518. left but one Son not witty,
who dyed in an Hospital after he had
spent 20000 liures which he had of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
near the Deanry, where grows
the best Grape of <hi>Chinon,</hi> and near the
Abbey of <hi>Seville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His death was not unlike his life, for
he dyed as he lived, aged 70 years,
Cardinal <hi>Bellay</hi> sent a Page to enquire
of his health, here was his answer, tell
thy Lord in what condition thou see'st
me in; I am going in quest of a great
perhaps. He is in the Magpies nest,
there let him keep himself, thou wilt
alwayes be a fool, draw the curtain, the
farce is plaid.</p>

(for to you, and none else do
I dedicate my writings) <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi>
in that Dialogue
of <hi>Plato's,</hi> which is entituled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>The Banquet,</hi>
whil'st he was setting forth the praises of his
Schoolmaster <hi>Socrates</hi> (without all question
the Prince of Philosophers) amongst other
discourses to that purpose said, that he resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the <hi>Silenes. Silenes</hi> of old were little
boxes, like those we now may see in the shops
of Apothecaries, painted on the outside with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41088:14"/>
wanton toyish figures, as <hi>Harpyes, Satyrs,
bridled Geese, horned Hares, saddled Ducks,
flying Goats, Thiller Harts,</hi> and other such
like counterfeted pictures at discretion, to excite
people unto laughter, as <hi>Silenus</hi> himself, who
was the foster-father of good <hi>Bacchus,</hi> was wont
to do; but within those capricious caskets were
carefully preserved and kept many rich jewels,
and fine drugs, such us <hi>Balme, Ambergreece,
Amamon, Musk, Civet,</hi> with several kindes
of <hi>precious stones,</hi> and other things of great
price. Iust such another thing was <hi>Socrates,</hi>
for to have eyed his outside, and esteemed of
him by his exterior appearance, you would not
have given the peel of an Oinion for him, so
deformed he was in body, and ridiculous in his
gesture: he had a sharp pointed nose, with the
look of a Bull, and countenance of a foole: he
was in his carriage simple, boorish in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
in fortune poore, unhappy in his wives,
unfit for all offices in the Common-wealth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
laughing, tipling, and merrily carousing
to every one, with continual gybes and jeeres,
the better by those meanes to conceale his divine
knowledge: now opening this boxe you would
have found within it a heavenly and inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
drug, a more then humane understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an admirable vertue, matchlesse learning,
invincible courage, unimitable sobriety, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
contentment of minde, perfect assurance,
and an incredible misregard of all that, for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41088:14"/>
which men commonly do so much watch, run,
saile, fight, travel, toyle and turmoile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto (in your opinion) doth this little
flourish of a preamble tend? For so much as
you, my good disciples, and some other jolly
fooles of ease and leasure, reading the pleasant
titles of some books of our invention, as <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fessepinet</note>
                     <hi>Pantagruel, Whippot,</hi> the dignity
of Cod-peeces, of Pease and Bacon with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
&amp;c. are too ready to judge, that there
is nothing in them but jests, mockeries, lascivious
discourse, and recreative lies; because the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
(which is the Title) is usually (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther enquiry) entertained with scoffing
and derision: but truly it is very unbeseeming
to make so slight account of the works of men,
seeing your selves avouch that it is not the
habit makes the Monk, many being Monasteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accoutred, who inwardly are nothing lesse
then monachal, and that there are of those that
weare <hi>Spanish</hi> caps, who have but little of the
valour of <hi>Spaniards</hi> in them. Therefore is it,
that you must open the book, and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the matter treated in it, then shall you
finde that it containeth things of farre higher
value then the boxe did promise; that is to
say, that the subject thereof is not so foolish,
as by the Title at the first sight it would appear
to be.</p>
                  <p>And put the case that in the literal sense, you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41088:15"/>
meet with purposes merry and solacious enough,
and consequently very correspondent to their
inscriptions, yet must not you stop there as at the
melody of the charming Syrens, but endeavour to
interpret that in a sublimer sense, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
you intended to have spoken in the jollitie
of your heart; did you ever pick the lock of
a cupboard to steale a bottle of wine out of it?
Tell me truly, and if you did call to minde
the countenance which then you had? or did
you ever see a Dog with a marrow-bone in his
mouth (the beast of all other, saies <hi>Plato, lib.
2. de Republica,</hi> the most Philosophical) if
you have seene him, you might have remarked
with what devotion and circumspectnesse he
wards and watcheth it; with what care he
keeps it: how fervently he holds it: how
prudently he gobbets it: with what affection
he breaks it: and with what diligence he
sucks it: to what end all this? what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
him to take all these paines? what
are the hopes of his labour? what doth he
expect to reap thereby? nothing but a little
marrow: True it is, that this little is more
savoury and delicious then the great quantities
of other sorts of meat, because the marrow
<hi>(as</hi> Galen <hi>testifieth, 5. facult. nat. &amp; 11. de
usu partium)</hi> is a nourishment most perfectly
elaboured by nature.</p>
                  <p>In imitation of this Dog, it becomes you to
be wise, to smell, feele and have in estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41088:15"/>
these faire goodly books, stuffed with high
conceptions, which though seemingly easie in
the pursuit, are in the cope and encounter
somewhat difficult; and then like him you
must, by a sedulous Lecture, and frequent
meditation, break the bone, and suck out the
marrow; that is, my allegorical sense, or the
things I to my self propose to be signified by
these <hi>Pythagorical</hi> Symbols, with assured hope,
that in so doing, you will at last attaine to
be both well-advised and valiant by the
reading of them; for in the perusal of this
Treatise, you shall finde another kinde
of taste, and a doctrine of a more profound
and abstruse consideration, which will disclose
unto you the most glorious Sacraments, and
dreadful mysteries, as well in what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
your Religion, as matters of the publike
State, and Life oeconomical.</p>
                  <p>Do you beleeve upon your conscience, that
<hi>Homer</hi> whil'st he was a couching his <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads</hi>
and <hi>Odysses,</hi> had any thought upon
those Allegories, which <hi>Plutarch, Heraclides,
Ponticus, Fristatius, Cornutus</hi> squeesed out
of him, and which <hi>Politian</hi> filched againe
from them: if you trust it, with neither hand
nor foot do you come neare to my opinion,
which judgeth them to have beene as little
dreamed of by <hi>Homer,</hi>

as himself (and as the Proverb saies) <hi>a lid
worthy of such a kettle;</hi> if you give no
credit thereto, why do not you the same in
these jovial new chronicles of mine; albeit
when I did dictate them, I thought upon no
more then you, who possibly were drinking
(the whil'st) as I was; for in the composing
of this lordly book, I never lost nor bestowed
any more, nor any other time then what was
appointed to serve me for taking of my bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refection, that is, whil'st I was eating and
drinking. And indeed that is the fittest,
and most proper hour, wherein to write these
high matters and deep Sciences: as <hi>Homer</hi>
knew very well, the Paragon of all Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
and <hi>Ennius,</hi> the father of the Latine
Poets (as <hi>Horace</hi> calls him) although a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sneaking jobernol alledged that his Verses
smelled more of the wine then oile.</p>
                  <p>So saith a <hi>Turlupin</hi> or a new start-up
grub of my books, but a turd for him. The
fragrant odour of the wine; O how much
more dainty, pleasant, laughing,<note n="*" place="margin">Riant, priant, friand.</note> celestial and
delicious it is, then that smell of oile! and
I will glory as much when it is said of me,
that I have spent more on wine then oile,
as did <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> when it was told him,
that his expense on oile was greater then on
wine; I truly held it for an honour and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41088:16"/>
praise to be called and reputed a frolick <hi>Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and a <hi>Robin</hi> goodfellow; for under this
name am I welcome in all choise companies of
<hi>Pantagruelists:</hi> it was upbraided to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi>
by an envious surly knave, that his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
did smell like the sarpler or wrapper
of a foul and filthy oile-vessel; for this cause
interpret you all my deeds &amp; sayings in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
sense; reverence the cheese-like brain
that feeds you with these faire billevezees,
and trifling jollities, and do what lies in you
to keep me alwayes merry. Be frolick now my
lads, cheer up your hearts, and joyfully read the
rest, with all the ease of your body and profit of
your reines; but hearken joltheads, you vieda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
or dickens take ye, remember to drink a
health to me for the like favour again, and I
will pledge you instantly, <hi>Tout ares metys.</hi>

by a direct line issued <hi>Gargantua</hi> the father of
<hi>Pantagruel:</hi> and do not take it ill, if for this
time I passe by it, although the subject be
such, that the oftener it were remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the more it would please your worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Seniorias;</hi> according to which you have
the authority of <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Philebo</hi> and <hi>Gorgias;</hi>
and of <hi>Flaccus,</hi> who saies that there are some
kindes of purposes (such as these are without
doubt) which the frequentlier they be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
still prove the more delectable.</p>
                  <p>Would to God every one had as certaine
knowledge of his Genealogy since the time
of the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> untill this age. I think
many are at this day Emperours, Kings,
Dukes, Princes, and Popes on the earth,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41088:18"/>
whose extraction is from some porters, and
pardon-pedlars, as on the contrary, many are
now poor wandring beggars, wretched and
miserable, who are descended of the blood
and lineage of great Kings and Emperours,
occasioned (as I conceive it) by the transport
and revolution of Kingdomes and Empires
from the <hi>Assyrians</hi> to the <hi>Medes,</hi> from the
<hi>Medes</hi> to the <hi>Persians,</hi> from the <hi>Persians</hi> to the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> from the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> from the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from
the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>French, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to give you some hint concerning
my self, who speaks unto you, I cannot think
but I am come of the race of some rich King
or Prince in former times, for never yet saw
you any man that had a greater desire to be
a King, and to be rich, then I have; and that
onely that I may make good chear, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor care forany thing, and plentifully
enrich my friends, and all honest and learned
men: but herein do I comfort my self, that
in the other world I shall be so, yea and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
too then at this present I dare wish: as for
you, with the same or a better conceit conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
your selves in your distresses, and drink
fresh if you can come by it.</p>
                  <p>To returne to our weathers, I say, that by
the sovereign gift of heaven, the Antiquity
and Genealogy of <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for our use more full and perfect then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41088:18"/>
any other except that of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whereof
I mean not to speak; for it belongs not unto
my purpose, and the Devils (that is to say)
the false accusers, and dissembled gospellers
will therein oppose me. This Genealogy
was found by <hi>Iohn Andrew</hi> in a meadow,
which he had near the Pole-arch, under the
Olive-tree, as you go to <hi>Marsay:</hi> where, as he
was making cast up some ditches, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
with their mattocks struck against a
great brazen tomb, and unmeasurably long,
for they could never finde the end thereof,
by reason that it entered too farre within the
Sluces of <hi>Vienne;</hi> opening this Tomb in a
certain place thereof, sealed on the top with
the mark of a goblet, about which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Hetrurian</hi> letters HIC BIBI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUR;
They found nine Flaggons set in
such order as they use to ranke their kyles
in <hi>Gasconie,</hi> of which that which was placed
in the middle, had under it a big, fat, great,
gray, pretty, small, mouldy, little pamphlet,
smelling stronger, but no better then Roses.
In that book the said Genealogy was found
written all at length, in a Chancery hand, not
in paper, not in parchment, nor in wax, but in
the bark of an elme-tree, yet so worne with
the long tract of time, that hardly could
three letters together be there perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>I (though unworthy) was sent for thither,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41088:19"/>
and with much help of those Spectacles,
whereby the art of reading dim writings,
and letters that do not clearly appear to the
sight, is practised, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth it,
did translate the book as you may see in
your <hi>pantagruelising,</hi> that is to say, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stifly to your own hearts desire; and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dreadful and horrifick acts of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi>
at the end of the book there was a
little Treatise entituled the <hi>Antidoted Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freluches,</hi>
or a <hi>Galimatia</hi> of extravagant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.
The rats and mothes, or (that I may
not lie) other wicked beasts, had nibled off
the beginning, the rest I have hereto sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
for the reverence I beare to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How Gargantua was carried eleven moneths
in his mothers belly.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GRangousier</hi> was a good fellow in his
time, and notable jester; he loved to
drink neat, as much as any man that then was
in the world, and would willingly eate salt
meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well
furnished with gammons of Bacon, both of
<hi>Westphalia, Mayence</hi> and <hi>Bayone;</hi> with store
of dried Neats tongues, plenty of Links,
Chitterlings and Puddings in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
together with salt Beef and mustard, a
good deale of hard rows of powdered
mullet called <hi>Botargos,</hi> great provision
of Sauciges, not of <hi>Bolonia</hi> (for he feared
the <hi>Lombard boccone)</hi> but of <hi>Bigorre, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaulnay,
Brene,</hi> and <hi>Rouargue.</hi> In the vigor
of his age he married <hi>Gargamelle,</hi> daughter to
the King of the <hi>Parpaillons,</hi> a jolly pug, and
well mouthed wench. These two did often
times do the two backed beast together, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
rubbing &amp; frotting their Bacon 'gainst
one another, insofarre, that at last she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
great with childe of a faire sonne, and
went with him unto the eleventh moneth,
for so long, yea longer may a woman carry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41088:22"/>
her great belly, especially when it is some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece
of nature, and a person predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the performance, in his due time, of
great exploits, as <hi>Homer</hi> saies, that the childe
which <hi>Neptune</hi> begot upon the <hi>Nymph,</hi> was
borne a whole year after the conception, that
is, in the twelfth moneth; for as <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
saith, <hi>libr.</hi> 3. this long time was suitable
to the majesty of <hi>Neptune,</hi> that in it the
childe might receive his perfect forme: for
the like reason <hi>Iupiter</hi> made the night,
wherein he lay with <hi>Alcmena,</hi> last fourty
eight houres, a shorter time not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the forging of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who
cleansed the world of the Monstres and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
wherewith it was supprest. <hi>My masters,</hi>
the ancient pantagruelists have confirmed
that which I say, and withall declared it to
be not onely possible, but also maintained
the lawful birth and legitimation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

I pray you, my good lusty springal lads,
if you finde any of these females, that are
worth the paines of untying the cod-peece-point,
get up, ride upon them, and bring
them to me; for if they happen within the

heire to the deceased, <hi>if before he died he had
no other children, and the mother shall passe
for an honest woman.</hi>

                  <p>When she is known to have conceived,
thrust forward boldly, spare her not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ever betide you, seeing the paunch is full;
as <hi>Iulia</hi> the daughter of the Emperour <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
never prostituted her self to her belly-bumpers,
but when she found her self with
childe, after the manner of Ships that receive
not their steers-man, till they have their
ballast and lading; and if any blame them
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41088:23"/>
for this their rataconniculation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
lechery upon their pregnancy
and big-belliednesse, seeing beasts in the like
exigent of their fulnesse, will never suffer
the male-masculant to incroach them: their
answer will be, that those are beasts, but they
are women, very well skilled in the pretty
vales, and small fees of the pleasant trade
and mysteries of superfetation, as <hi>Populius</hi>
heretofore answered, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

                  <p>They had abundance of tripes as you have

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41088:24"/>
this, that for all men could do, there was no
possibility to keep them long in that relish;
for in a very short while they would have
stunk, which had been an undecent thing: it
was therefore concluded, that they should
be all of them gulched up, without losing
any thing; to this effect they invited all the

the <hi>Boudray, Monpensier,</hi> the <hi>Guedevede,</hi> and
other their neighbours, all stiffe drinkers,
brave fellows, and good players at the kyles.
The good man <hi>Grangousier</hi> took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in their company, and commanded there
should be no want nor pinching for any
thing: neverthelesse he bade his wife eate
sparingly, because she was near her time, and
that these tripes were no very commendable
meat: they would faine (said he) be at the
chewing of ordure, that would eat the case
wherein it was. Notwithstanding these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
she did eate sixteen quarters, two
bushels, three pecks and a pipkin full: O the

of such shitten stuffe; after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they all went out in a hurle, to the grove

it was a sweet and heavenly sport to see them

to sit down upon the grasse under the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
because she was like very shortly to see
young feet, and that therefore it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
she should pluck up her spirits, and take
a good heart of new at the fresh arrival of her
baby, saying to her withal, that although
the paine was somewhat grievous to her, it
would be but of short continuance, and that
the succeeding joy would quickly remove
that sorrow, in such sort that she should not
so much as remember it. On with a sheeps
courage (quoth he) dispatch this boy, and we

binding medicine, and whereby all her <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
arse-pipes and conduits were so opilated,
stopped, obstructed, and contracted, that
you could hardly have opened and enlarged
them with your teeth, which is a terrible
thing to think upon; seeing the Devill at
the Masse at Saint <hi>Martins</hi> was puzled with
the like task, when with his teeth he had
lengthened out the parchment whereon he
wrote the tittle tattle of two young mangy
whoores; by this inconvenient the <hi>cotyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi>
of her matrix, were presently loosed,
through which the childe sprung up and
leapt, and so entering into the hollow veine,
did climbe by the diaphragm even above her
shoulders, where that veine divides it self into
two, and from thence taking his way towards
the left side, issued forth at her left eare; as
soone as he was borne, he cried not as other
babes use to do, <hi>miez, miez, miez, miez,</hi>
but with a high, sturdy and big voice shouted
a loud, some drink, some drink, some drink,

Immediately thereafter were appointed
for him seventeen thousand, nine hundred,
and thirteen Cowes of the towns of <hi>Pautil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>
and <hi>Breemond</hi> to furnish him with milk in
ordinary, for it was impossible to finde a
Nurse sufficient for him in all the Countrey,
considering the great quantity of milk that
was requisite for his nourishment; although
there were not wanting some Doctors of
the opinion of <hi>Scotus,</hi> who affirmed that his
own mother gave him suck, and that she
could draw out of her breasts one thousand,
four hundred, two pipes, and nine pailes of
milk at every time.</p>
                  <p>Which indeed is not probable, and this
point hath been found duggishly scandalous
and offensive to tender eares, for that it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
a little of Heresie; thus was he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for one yeare and ten moneths, after
which time by the advice of Physicians they
began to carry him, and then was made for
him a fine little cart drawn with Oxen, of
the invention of <hi>Ian Denio,</hi> wherein they
led him hither and thither with great joy, and
he was worth the seeing; for he was a fine
boy, had a burly physnomie, and almost ten
chins; he cried very little, but beshit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
every hour: for to speak truly of him,
he was wonderfully flegmatick in his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
both by reason of his natural comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
and the accidental disposition which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41088:31"/>
had befallen him by his too much quaffing of
the septembral juyce. Yet without a cause
did not he sup one drop; for if he happened
to be vexed, angry, displeased or sorry; if
he did fret, if he did weep, if he did cry, and
what grievous quarter soever he kept in
bringing him some drink, he would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
pacified, reseated in his own temper,
in a good humour againe, and as still and
quiet as ever. One of his governesses told
me (swearing by her fig) how he was so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to this kinde of way, that, at the
sound of pintes and flaggons he would on a
sudden fall into an extasie, as if he had then
tasted of the joyes of Paradise: so that they
upon consideration of this his divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
would every morning to cheare him
up, play with a knife upon the glasses, on
the bottles with their stopples, and on the
pottle-pots with their lids and covers, at the
sound whereof he became gay, did leap for
joy, would loll and rock himself in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
then nod with his head, monocor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his fingers, and barytonising with his
taile.</p>

                  <p>BEing of this age, his father ordained to
have clothes made to him in his owne
livery, which was white and blew. To work
then went the Tailors, and with great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
were those clothes made, cut, and
sewed, according to the fashion that was then
in request. I finde by the ancient Records
or Pancarts, to be seene in the chamber of
accounts, or Count of the Exchequer at
<hi>Montforeo,</hi> that he was accoutred in manner
as followeth. To make him every shirt of
his were taken up nine hundred ells of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telero</hi>
linnen, and two hundred for the guis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
in manner of cushions, which they put
under his arm-pits; his shirt was not gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor plaited,<note place="margin">Besogner du cul, <hi>English'd,</hi> The eye of the needle.</note> for the plaiting of shirts was
not found out, till the Seamsters (vvhen the
point of their needles vvas broken) began to
vvork and occupie vvith the taile; there
vvere taken up for his doublet, eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirteen ells of white Satin, and for
his points fifteen hundred and nine dogs skins
and a half. Then vvas it that men began
to tie their breeches to their doublets, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41088:32"/>
not their doublets to their breeches: for it
is against nature, as hath most amply been
shewed. <hi>Ockam</hi> upon the explonibles of
Master <hi>Hautechaussade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his breeches were taken up eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and five ells, and a third of white broad
cloth; They were cut in forme of pillars,
chamfered, channel'd and pinked behinde,
that they might not over-heat his reines:
and were within the panes, puffed out with
the lining of as much blew damask as was
needful: and remark, that he had very good
Leg-harnish, proportionable to the rest of
his stature.</p>
                  <p>For his Codpeece were used sixteen ells,
and a quarter of the same cloth, and it was
fashioned on the top like unto a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Arch, most gallantly fastened with
two enamell'd Clasps, in each of which was
set a great Emerauld, as big as an Orange;
for, as sayes <hi>Orpheus lib. de lapidibus,</hi> and
<hi>Plinius libr. ultimo,</hi> it hath an erective vertue
and comfortative of the natural member.
The extiture, out-jecting or out-standing
of his Codpiece, was of the length of a yard,
jagged and pinked, and withal bagging, and
strouting out with the blew damask lining,
after the manner of his breeches: but had
you seen the faire Embroyderie of the small
needle-work purle, and the curiously inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
knots, by the Goldsmiths Art, set out
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41088:32"/>
and trimmed with rich Diamonds, precious
Rubies, fine Turquoises, costly Emeraulds,
and <hi>Persian</hi> pearles; you would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
it to a faire <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> or Horne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
such as you see in Anticks, or as
<hi>Rhea</hi> gave to the two Nymphs, <hi>Amalthea</hi>
and <hi>Ida,</hi> the Nurses of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And like to that Horn of abundance, it was
still gallant, succulent, droppie, sappie, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
lively, alwayes flourishing, alwayes
fructifying, full of juice, full of flower, full
of fruit, and all manner of delight. I avow
God, it would have done one good to have
seen him, but I will tell you more of him
in the book which I have made of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Codpieces: One thing I will tell
you, that as it was both long and large, so
was it well furnished and victualled within,
nothing like unto the hypocritical Codpie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of some fond Wooers, and Wench-courters,
which are stuffed only with wind,
to the great prejudice of the female sexe.</p>
                  <p>For his shoes, were taken up foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and six elles of blew Crimson-velvet,
and were very neatly cut by parallel lines,
joyned in uniforme cylindres: for the soling
of them were made use of eleven hundred
Hides of brown Cowes, shapen like the taile
of a Keeling.</p>
                  <p>For his coat were taken up eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
elles of blew velvet, died in grain, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41088:33"/>
in its borders with faire Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in the middle decked with silver purle,
intermixed with plates of gold, and store of
pearles, hereby shewing, that in his time he
would prove an especial good fellow, and
singular whip-can.</p>
                  <p>His girdle was made of three hundred
elles and a halfe of silken serge, halfe white
and half blew, if I mistake it not. His sword
was not of <hi>Valentia,</hi> nor his dagger of <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosa,</hi>
for his father could not endure these
<hi>hidalgos borrachos maranisados como dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blos:</hi>
but he had a faire sword made of wood,
and the dagger of borled leather, as well
painted and guilded as any man could
wish.</p>
                  <p>His purse was made of the cod of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
which was given him by <hi>Herre Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contal,</hi>
Proconsul of <hi>Lybia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his Gown were employed nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
six hundred elles, wanting two thirds,
of blew velvet, as before, all so diagonally
purled, that by true perspective issued
thence an unnamed colour, like that you see
in the necks of Turtle-doves or Turkie-cocks,
which wonderfully rejoyceth the eyes
of the beholders. For his Bonnet or Cap
were taken up three hundred two elles, and
a quarter of white velvet, and the forme
thereof was wide and round, of the bignesse
of his Head; for his father said, that the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41088:33"/>
Caps of the <hi>Mirabaise</hi> fashion, made like the
Cover of a Pastie, would one time or other
bring a mischief on those that wore them.
For his Plume, he wore a faire great blew
feather, plucked from an <hi>Onocrotal</hi> of the
countrey of <hi>Hircania</hi> the wilde, very pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hanging down over his right eare: For the
Jewel or broach which in his Cap he carried;
he had in a Cake of gold, weighing three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and eight marks, a faire piece ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell'd,
wherein was portrayed a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with two heads, looking towards one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
foure armes, foure feet, two arses,
such as <hi>Plato in Symposio</hi> sayes, was the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
beginning of mans nature; and about
it was written in Ionick letters, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
that is, <hi>Vir &amp; Mulier junctim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priissimè
homo.</hi> To wear about his neck, he
had a golden chaine, weighing twenty five
thousand and sixty three marks of gold, the
links thereof being made after the manner
of great berries, amongst which were set in
work green Jaspers ingraven, and cut Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-like,
all invironed with beams and
sparks, as King <hi>Nicepsos</hi> of old was wont to
weare them, and it reached down to the
very bust of the rising of his belly, whereby
he reaped great benefit all his life long, as the
Greek Physicians knew well enough. For
his Gloves were put in work sixteen Otters
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41088:34"/>
skins, and three of <hi>lougarous</hi> or men-eating
wolves, for the bordering of them: and of
this stuffe were they made, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Cabalists of <hi>Sanlono.</hi> As for the
Rings which his father would have him to
weare to renew the ancient mark of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
He had on the forefinger of his left
hand a Carbuncle as big as an Ostrige's Egge,
inchased very daintily in gold of the finenesse
of a <hi>Turkie Seraph.</hi> Upon the middle finger
of the same hand, he had a Ring made of
foure metals together, of the strongest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
that ever was seen; so that the steel
did not crash against the gold, nor the silver
crush the copper. All this was made by
Captain <hi>Chappins,</hi> and <hi>Alcofribas</hi> his good
Agent. On the medical finger of his right
hand, he had a Ring made Spire wayes,
wherein was set a perfect baleu rubie,
a pointed Diamond, and a Physon Emerald
of an inestimable value; for <hi>Hans-carvel</hi> the
King of <hi>Melinda</hi>'s Jeweller, esteemed them
at the rate of threescore nine millions, eight
hundred ninety foure thousand and elgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
French Crowns of <hi>Berrie,</hi> and at so
much did the foucres of <hi>Auspurg</hi> prize
them.</p>

                     <hi>GArgantua</hi>'s colours were white and
blew, as I have shewed you before, by
which his father would give us to understand,
that his sonne to him was a heavenly joy,
for the white did signifie gladnesse, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
delight and rejoycing, and the blew,
celestial things, I know well enough, that
in reading this you laugh at the old drinker,
and hold this exposition of colours to be
very extravagant, and utterly disagreeable
to reason, because white is said to signifie
faith, and blew constancy. But without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
vexing, heating or putting you in a
chafe, (for the weather is dangerous) answer
me if it please you; for no other compulso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way of arguing will I use towards you, or
any else; only now and then I will mention
a word or two of my bottle. What is it that
induceth you? what stirs you up to believe,
or who told you that white signifieth faith;
and blew, constancy? An old paultry book,
say you, sold by the hawking Pedlars and
Balladmongers, entituled <hi>The Blason of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:</hi>
Who made it? whoever it was,
he was wise in that he did not set his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41088:35"/>
to it; but besides, I know not what I should
rather admire in him, his presumption or his
sottishnesse: his presumption and overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for that he should without reason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, or without any appearance of
truth, have dared to prescribe by his private
authority, what things should be denotated
and signified by the colour: which is the
custome of Tyrants, who will have their will
to bear sway in stead of equity; and not of
the wise and learned, who with the evidence
of reason satisfie their Readers: His sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of spirit, in that he thought,
that without any other demonstration or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
argument, the world would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make his blockish, and ridiculous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
the rule of their devices. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
(according to the Proverb, <hi>To a shitten
taile failes never ordurre,)</hi> he hath found (it
seems) some simple Ninnie in those rude
times of old, when the wearing of high
round Bonnets was in fashion, who gave
some trust to his writings, according to which
they carved and ingraved their apophthegms
and motto's, trapped and caparisoned their
Mules and Sumpter-horses, apparelled their
Pages, quartered their breeches, bordered
their gloves, fring'd the courtains and vallens
of their beds, painted their ensignes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
songs, and which is worse, placed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deceitful juglings, and unworthy base
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41088:35"/>
tricks undiscoveredly, amongst the very

In the like darknesse and mist of

Courtiers, and name-transposers,
who going about in their impresa's, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

foxes taile should be fastened to the neck-piece
of, and a Vizard made of a Cowsheard,
given to every one that henceforth should
offer, after the restitution of learning, to make
use of any such fopperies in <hi>France,</hi> by the
same reasons (if reasons I should call them,
and not ravings rather, and idle triflings about
words,) might I cause paint a panier,
to signifie that I am in peine: a Mustard-pot,
that my heart tarries much for't: one pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

but upon just and very good grounds:
which you may perceive to be true, if laying
aside all prejudicate affections, you will but
give eare to what presently I shall expound
unto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that supposing two things
contrary in their kinde, as good and evill,
vertue and vice, heat and cold, white and
black, pleasure and pain, joy and grief: And
so of others, if you couple them in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the contrary of one kinde may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in reason with the contrary of the other,
it must follow by consequence, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary must answer to the remanent
opposite to that wherewith it is conferred;
as for example, vertue and vice are contrary
in one kinde, so are good and evil: if one of
the contraries of the first kinde, be consonant
to one of those of the second, as vertue and
good nesse, for it is clear that vertue is good,
so shall the other two contraries, (which are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41088:37"/>
evil and vice) have the same connexion, for
vice is evil.</p>
                  <p>This Logical rule being understood, take
these two contraries, joy and sadnesse: then
these other two, white and black, for they
are Physically contrary; if so be then that
black do signifie grief, by good reason then
should white import joy. Nor is this signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
instituted by humane imposition, but
by the universal consent of the world recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which Philosophers call <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi>
the Law of Nations, or an uncontrolable
right of force in all countreyes whatsoever:
for you know well enough, that all people,
and all languages and nations, (except the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Syracusans,</hi> and certain <hi>Argives,</hi> who
had crosse and thwarting soules) when they
mean outwardly to give evidence of their
sorrow, go in black; and all mourning is
done with black, which general consent is
not without some argument, and reason in
nature, the which every man may by himself
very suddenly comprehend, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of any; and this we call the Law of
nature: By vertue of the same natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
we know that by white all the world
hath understood joy, gladnesse, mirth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight. In former times, the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
and <hi>Crecians</hi> did mark their good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious,
and fortunate dayes with white
stones: and their sad, dismal and unfortunate
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41088:37"/>
ones with black; is not the night mournful,
sad and melancholick? it is black and dark
by the privation of light; doth not the
light comfort all the world? and it is more
white then any thing else, which to prove, I
could direct you to the book of <hi>Laurentius
Valla</hi> against <hi>Bartolus,</hi> but an Evangelical
testimony I hope will content you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.
it is said, that at the transfiguration of our
Lord, <hi>Vestimenta ejus facta sunt alba sicut
lux,</hi> his apparel was made white like the
light, by which lightsome whitenesse he gave
his three Apostles to understand the <hi>Idea</hi> and
figure of the eternal joyes; for by the light
are all men comforted, according to the
word of the old woman, who although she
had never a tooth in her head, was wont to
say, <hi>Bona lux:</hi> and <hi>Tobit, chap.</hi> 5. after he
had lost his sight, when <hi>Raphael</hi> saluted him,
answered, <hi>What joy can I have, that do not
see the light of Heaven?</hi> In that colour did
the Angels testifie the joy of the whole
world, at the Resurrection of our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 20. and at his Ascension, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. with
the like colour of vesture did St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Evangelist, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4. 7. see the faithful clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in the heavenly and blissed <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reade the ancient both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>
histories, and you shall finde that the town
of <hi>Alba,</hi> (the first patern of <hi>Rome,)</hi> was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41088:38"/>
founded, and so named by reason of a white
sow that was seen there: You shall likewise
finde in those stories, that when any man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had vanquished his enemies, was by
decree of the Senate to enter into <hi>Rome</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly,
he usually rode in a chariot
drawn by white horses: which in the Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
triumph was also the custome; for by
no signe or colour would they so significant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expresse the joy of their coming, as by
the white: You shall there also finde, how
<hi>Pericles,</hi> the General of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> would
needs have that part of his Army, unto
whose lot befel the white beanes, to spend
the whole day in mirth, pleasure and ease,
whilest the rest were a fighting. A thousand
other examples and places could I alledge to
this purpose, but that it is not here where
I should do it.</p>
                  <p>By understanding hereof, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
one Problem, which <hi>Alexander Aphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diseus</hi>
hath accounted unanswerable, why the
Lion, who with his only cry and roaring
affrights all beasts, dreads and feareth only a
white cock? for (as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith, <hi>libro de
Sacrificio &amp; Magia)</hi> it is because the presence
of the vertue of the Sunne, which is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
and Promptuarie of all terrestrial and
<hi>syderial</hi> light, doth more symbolize and agree
with a white cock, as well in regard of that
colour, as of his property and specifical qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41088:38"/>
then with a Lion. He saith further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
that Devils have been often seen in
the shape of Lions, which at the sight of a
white cock have presently vanished. This is
the cause, why <hi>Galli</hi> or <hi>Gallices,</hi> (so are
the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> called, because they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
white as milk, which the Greeks call
<hi>Gala,)</hi> do willingly weare in their Caps
white feathers, for by nature they are of a
candid disposition, merrie, kinde, gracious
and well-beloved, and for their cognizance
and armes have the whitest flower of any,
the <hi>Flower de luce</hi> or <hi>Lilie.</hi> If you demand,
how by white, nature would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
joy and gladnesse? I answer, that the
analogy and uniformity is thus, for as the
white doth outwardly disperse and scatter
the rayes of the fight, whereby the optick
spirits are manifestly dissolved, according to
the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Problemes
and perspective Treatises; as you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
perceive by experience, when you pass-over
mountains covered with snow, how
you will complain that you cannot see well:
as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes to have hapned to his
men, and as <hi>Galen</hi> very largely declareth,
<hi>lib. 10. de usu partium:</hi> Just so the heart
with excessive joy is inwardly dilated, and
suffereth a manifest resolution of the vital
spirits, which may go so farre on, that it
may thereby be deprived of its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41088:39"/>
and by consequence of life it self.
By this <hi>Pericharie</hi> or extremity of gladnesse,
as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, <hi>lib. 12. method. lib. 5. de lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
affectis &amp; lib. 2. de symptomatum causis.</hi>
And as it hath come to passe in former times,

But what? it seems I am entred further into

                  <head type="sub">Of the youthful age of Gargantua.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GArgantua</hi> from three yeares upwards
unto five, was brought up and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all convenient discipline, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of his father; and spent that
time like the other little children of the
countrey, that is, in drinking, eating and
sleeping: in eating, sleeping and drinking:
and in sleeping, drinking and eating: still
he wallowed and rowled up and down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the mire and dirt: he blurred and sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
his nose with filth: he blotted and
smutch't his face with any kinde of scurvie
stuffe, he trode down his shoes in the heele:
At the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and
ran very heartily after the Butterflies, the
Empire whereof belonged to his father. He
pissed in his shoes, shit in his shirt, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
his nose on his sleeve: He did let his snot
and snivel fall in his pottage, and dabled,
padled and slabbered every where: He
would drink in his slipper, and ordinarily
rub his belly against a Panier: He sharpened
his teeth with a top, washed his hands with
his broth, and combed his head with a bole:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41088:40"/>
He would sit down betwixt two stooles,
and his arse to the ground, would cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a wet sack, and drink in eating of
his soupe: He did eate his Cake sometimes
without bread, would bite in laughing, and
laugh in biting; Oftentimes did he spit in
the basin, and fart for fatnesse; pisse against
the Sunne, and hide himself in the water for
fear of raine. He would strike out of the
cold iron, be often in the dumps, and frig
and wriggle it. He would flay the Fox, say
the Apes Paternoster, return to his sheep, and
turn the Hogs to the Hay: He would beat
the Dogs before the Lion, put the Plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Oxen, and claw where it did not itch:
He would pump one to draw somewhat
out of him, by griping all would hold fast
nothing, and alwayes eat his white bread first.
He shoo'd the Geese, kept a self-tickling to
make himself laugh, and was very stedable in
the Kitchin: made a mock at the gods, would
cause sing <hi>Magnificat</hi> at <hi>Matines,</hi> and found
it very connenient so to do: He would eat
cabbage, and shite beets; knew flies in a
dish of milk, and would make them lose their
feet: He would scrape paper, blur parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then run away as hard as he could: He
would pul at the Kids leather, or vomit up his
dinner, then reckon without his Host: He
would beat the bushes without catching the
birds, thought the Moon was made of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41088:40"/>
green cheese, and that bladders are lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes:
out of one sack he would take two
moutures or fees for grinding; would act the
Asses part to get some bran, and of his fist
would make a Mallet: He took the cranes at
the first leap, and would have the Mail-coats
to be made link after link: He alwayes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a given horse in the mouth, leaped from
the cock to the asse, and put one ripe between
two green: By robbing <hi>Peter</hi> he payed <hi>Paul,</hi>
he kept the Moon from the wolves, and
hoped to catch Larks if ever the Heavens
should fall: He did make of necessity vertue,
of such bread such pottage, and cared as
little for the peeled as for the shaven: Every
morning he did cast up his gorge, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
little dogs eat out of the dish with him,
and he with them: He would bite their eares
and they would scratch his nose: he would
blow in their arses, and they would lick his
chaps. But hearken good fellows, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
ill betake you, and whirle round your
braines, if you do not give eare: This little
Lecher was alwayes groping his Nurses and
Governesses, upside down, arswerzie, top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siturvie,
<hi>harribourt quet,</hi> with a <hi>Yacco haick,
hyck gio,</hi> handling them very rudely in jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and tumbling them to keep them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for he had already begun to exercise the
tooles, and put his Codpiece in practice;
which Codpiece or <hi>Braguette,</hi> his Governes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41088:41"/>
did every day deck up and adorn with
faire nosegayes, curious rubies, sweet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and fine silken tufts, and very pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would passe their time, in taking you
know what between their fingers, and dand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it, till it did revive and creep up to the
bulk and stiffenesse of a suppository, or <hi>streat
magdaleon,</hi> which is a hard rowled up
salve, spread upon leather. Then did they
burst out in laughing, when they saw it lift
up its eares, as if the sport had liked them;
one of them would call it her little dille, her
staffe of love, her quillety, her faucetin, her
dandilollie: Another her peen, her jolly kyle,
her bableret, her membretoon, her quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
Imp: Another again, her branch of coral,
her female adamant, her placket-racket, her
cyprian scepter, her jewel for Ladies: and
some of the other women would give it these
names, my bunguetee, my stopple too, my
busherusher, my gallant wimble, my pretty
boarer, my coney-borow ferret, my little
piercer, my augretine, my dangling hangers,
down right to it, stiffe and stout, in &amp; to, my
pusher, dresser, pouting stick, my hony pipe,
my pretty pillicock, linkie pinkie, futilletie,
my lustie andouille, and crimson chitterlin:
my little couille bredouille, my pretty rogue,
and so forth: It belongs to me said one: it is
mine said the other: What, quoth a third,
shall I have no share in it? by my faith I will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41088:41"/>
cut it then: Ha, to cut it (said the other,)
would hurt him; <hi>Madam,</hi> do you cut little
childrens things? were his cut off, he would
be then <hi>Monsieur sans queue,</hi> the curtail'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
And that he might play and sport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
after the manner of the other little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the countrey, they made him a faire
weather whirljack, of the wings of the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil
of <hi>Myrebalais.</hi>

                  <p>AFterwards, that he might be all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a good Rider, they made to him
a faire great horse of wood, which he did
make leap, curvete, yerk out behinde, and
skip forward, all at a time: to pace, trot,
rack, gallop, amble, to play the hobbie, the
hackney-guelding: go the gate of the camel
&amp; of the wild asse. He made him also change
his colour of hair, as the Monks of <hi>Coultibo,</hi>
(according to the variety of their holy-days)
use to do their clothes, from bay, brown, to
sorrel, daple-gray, mouse-dun, deer-colour,
roan, cow-colour, gingioline, skued colour,
pybal'd, and the colour of the savage elk.</p>
                  <p>Himself of an huge big post made a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nag: and another for daily service, of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41088:42"/>
beam of a Vine-presse: and of a great Oak,
made up a mule, with a foot-cloth for his
chamber. Besides this, he had ten or twelve
spare horses, and seven horses for post; and
all these were lodged in his own chamber,
close by his bed-side. One day the Lord of
<hi>Breadinbag</hi> came to visit his father in great
bravery,<note place="margin">Painen sac Franc. repas mouille vent.</note> and with a gallant traine: and at
the same time to see him came likewise the
Duke of <hi>Free-meale,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gullet.</hi>
The house truly for so many guests
at once was somewhat narrow, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the stables; whereupon the steward and
harbinger of the said Lord <hi>Breadinbag,</hi> to
know if there were any other empty stables
in the house, came to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> a little
young lad, and secretly asked him where
the stables of the great horses were, thinking
that children would be ready to tell all? Then
he led them up along the stairs of the Castle,
passing by the second Hall unto a broad great
Gallery, by which they entred into a large
Tower, and as they were going up at another
paire of staires, said the harbinger to the
steward, this childe deceives us, for the stables
are never on the top of the house: You may
be mistaken (said the steward,) for I know
some places at <hi>Lyons,</hi> at the <hi>Basmette,</hi> at
<hi>Chaunon,</hi> and elsewhere, which have their
stables at the very tops of the houses, so it
may be, that behinde the house there is a way
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41088:42"/>
to come to this ascent, but I will question
with him further. Then said he to <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi>
My pretty little boy, whither do you
lead us? To the stable (said he) of my great
horses, we are almost come to it, we have but
these staires to go up at, then leading them
alongst another great Hall, he brought them
into his chamber, and opening the door said
unto them, This is the stable that you ask
for: this is my gennet, this is my gelding,
this my courser, and this my hackney, and
laid on them with a great Leaver: I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon you (said he) this <hi>Frizeland</hi> horse,
I had him from <hi>Francfort,</hi> yet will I give
him you; for he is a pretty little nagge, and
will go very well, with a tessel of goosehawk,
halfe a dosen of spaniels, and a brace of grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds,
thus are you King of the hares and
partridges for all this winter. By St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
(said they) now we are payed, he hath gleek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to some purpose, bobbed we are now
for ever: I deny it (said he) he was not here
above three dayes, judge you now, whether
they had most cause, either to hide their
heads for shame, or to laugh at the jest: as
they were going down again thus amazed,
he asked them,<note place="margin">Aubeliere.</note> Will you have a <hi>whimwham?</hi>
What is that, said they? It is (said he) five turds
to make you a muzzel: To day (said the
steward,) though we happen to be rosted, we
shall not be burnt, for we are pretty well
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41088:43"/>
quipped and larded in my opinion. O my
jolly daper boy, thou hast given us a gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I hope to see thee Pope before I die:
I think so (said he) my self: and then shall
you be a <hi>puppie,</hi> and this gentle <hi>popinjeay</hi> a
perfect <hi>papelard,</hi> that is, dissembler: Well,
well, (said the harbinger,) But (said <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua;)</hi>
guesse how many stitches there are in
my mothers smock: Sixteen (quoth the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger,)
You do not speak Gospel (said <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua)</hi>
for there is sent before, and sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
and you did reckon them ill, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the <hi>two under holes:</hi> When (said the
harbinger?) Even then (said <hi>Gargantua,)</hi> when
they made a shovel of your nose to take up a
quarter of dirt, and of your throat a funnel,
wherewith to put it into another vessel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the bottom of the old one was out.
<hi>Cocksbod</hi> (said the steward) we have met with
a Prater. Farewel (Master tatler) God keep
you, so goodly are the words which you
come out with, and so fresh in your mouth,
that it had need to be salted.</p>
                  <p>Thus going down in great haste, under the
arch of the staires, they let fall the great Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which he had put upon their backs,
whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> said, what a deedle,
you are (it seems) but bad horsemen, that
suffer your bilder to faile you, when you
need him most, if you were to go from hence
to <hi>Chausas,</hi> whether had you rather ride on a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41088:43"/>
gesling, or lead a sow in a Leash? I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
drink (said the harbinger,) with this
they entered into the lower Hall, where the
company was, and relating to them this new
story, they made them laugh like a swarm of
flies.</p>

returning from the Conquest of

sight of such a childe of his: and whilest he
kist him and embrac'd him, he asked many
childish questions of him about divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and drank very freely with him and
with his governesses, of whom in great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
he asked amongst other things, whether
they had been careful to keep him clean and
sweet? To this <hi>Gargantua</hi> answered, that he
had taken such a course for that himself, that
in al the country there was not to be found a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41088:44"/>
cleanlier boy then he. How is that (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier?)</hi>
I have (answered <hi>Gargantua)</hi> by a
long and curious experience found out a
meanes to wipe my bum, the most lordly,
the most excellent, and the most convenient
that ever was seen? What is that. (said
<hi>Grangousier,)</hi> how is it? I will tell you by
and by (said <hi>Gargantua,)</hi> once I did wipe me
with a Gentlewomans Velvet-mask, and
found it to be good; for the softnesse of the
silk was very voluptuous and pleasant to
my fundament. Another time with one of
their Hoods, and in like manner that was
comfortable: At another time with a Ladies
Neck-kerchief, and after that I wiped me
with some ear-pieces of hers made of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sattin, but there was such a number of
golden spangles in them (turdie round things,
a pox take them) that they fetched away all
the skin of my taile with a vengeance. Now
I wish St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire burn the bum-gut
of the Goldsmith that made them, and of
her that wore them: This hurt I cured by
wiping my self with a Pages cap, garnished
with a feather after the <hi>Suitsers</hi> fashion.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, in dunging behinde a bush,
I found a March-Cat, and with it wiped my
breech, but her clawes were so sharp that they
scratched and exulcerated all my perinee;
Of this I recovered the next morning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
by wiping my self with my mothers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41088:44"/>
gloves, of a most excellent perfume and
sent of the <hi>Arabian Benin.</hi> After that I wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
me with sage, with fennil, with anet
with marjoram, with roses, with gourd-leavs,
with beets, with colewort, with leaves of the
vine-tree, with mallowes, wool-blade, (which
is a tail-scarlet) with latice and with spinage
leaves. All this did very great good to my
leg. Then with Mercurie, with pursley, with
nettles, with comfrey, but that gave me the
bloody flux of <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> which I healed by
wiping me with my braguette; then I wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
my taile in the sheets, in the coverlet, in
the curtains, with a cushion, with Arras
hangings, with a green carpet, with a table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
with a napkin, with a handkerchief,
with a combing cloth, in all which I found
more pleasure then do the mangie dogs
when you rub them. Yea, but (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier)</hi>
which torchecul didst thou finde to be

and by and by shall you heare the <hi>tu autem,</hi>

heard them of this good old grandam, that

them in the budget of my memory.</p>
                  <p>Let us return to our purpose (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier,)</hi>
What (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> to skite?
No (said <hi>Grangousier)</hi> but to wipe our taile;
But (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> will not you be content
to pay a punchion of Britton-wine, if I do
not blank and gravel you in this matter, and
put you to a <hi>non-plus?</hi> Yes truly (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no need of wiping ones taile
(said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> but when it is foule; foule
it cannot be unlesse one have been a skiting;
skite then we must before we wipe our
tailes. O my pretty little waggish boy (said
<hi>Grangousier,)</hi> what an excellent wit thou
hast? I will make thee very shortly proceed
Doctor in the jovial quirks of gay learning,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41088:46"/>
and that by G—, for thou hast more wit then
age; now I prethie go on in this torchecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ife,
orw ipe-bummatory discourse, and by
my beard I swear, for one punche on thou
shalt have threescore pipes, I mean of the
good <hi>Breton</hi> wine, not that which growes in
<hi>Britain,</hi> but in the good countrey of <hi>Verron.</hi>
Afterwards I wiped my bum (said <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,)</hi>
with a kerchief, with a <hi>pillow,</hi> with a
<hi>pantoufle,</hi> with a pouch, with a pannier, but
that was a wicked and unpleasant torchecul;
then with a hat, of hats note that some are
shorne, and others shaggie, some velveted,
others covered with taffitie's, and others with
sattin, the best of all these is the shaggie hat,
for it makes a very neat abstersion of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
matter.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards I wiped my taile with a hen,
with a cock, with a pullet, with a calves
skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant,
with an Atturneyes bag, with a
montero, with a coife, with a faulconers lure;
but to conclude, I say and maintain, that of
all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins,
bunghole-cleansers and wipe-breeches,
there is none in the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the neck of a goose, that is well
douned, if you hold her head betwixt your
legs: and beleeve me therein upon mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for you will thereby feele in your
nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41088:46"/>
in regard of the softnesse of the said doune,
and of the temperate heat of the goose,
which is easily communicated to the bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut,
and the rest of the inwards, insofarre
as to come even to the regions of the heart
and braines; and think not, that the felicity
of the <hi>heroes</hi> and <hi>demigods</hi> in the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields,
consisteth either in their <hi>Asphodele, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosia,</hi>
or <hi>Nectar,</hi> as our old women here use
to say; but in this, (according to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
that they wipe their tailes with the
neck of a goose, holding her head betwixt
their legs, and such is the opinion of <hi>Master
Iohn</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> alias <hi>Scotus.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">How Gargantua was taught Latine by
a Sophister.</head>
                  <p>THe good man <hi>Grangousier,</hi> having
heard this discourse, was ravished with
admiration, considering the high reach, and
marvellous understanding of his sonne <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua,</hi>
and said to his governesses, <hi>Philip</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon</hi> knew the great wit of his
sonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> by his skilful managing
of a horse; for his horse <hi>Bucephalus</hi> was so
fierce and unruly, that none durst adventure
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41088:47"/>
to ride him, after that he had given to his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
such devillish falls, breaking the neck of
this man, the other mans leg, braining one,
and putting another out of his jaw-bone.
This by <hi>Alexander</hi> being considered, one
day in the <hi>hippodrome,</hi> (which was a place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the breaking and managing of
great horses,) he perceived that the fury of
the horse proceeded meerly from the feare
he had of his own shadow, whereupon get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on his back, he run him against the Sun,
so that the shadow fell behinde, and by that
meanes tamed the horse, and brought him to
his hand: whereby his father, knowing the
divine judgement that was in him, caused him
most carefully to be instructed by <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who at that time was highly renowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the Philosophers of <hi>Greece:</hi> after the
same manner I tell you, that by this only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which now I have here had before
you with my sonne <hi>Gargantua;</hi> I know that
his understanding doth participate of some
divinity, and that if he be well taught, and
have that education which is fitting, he will
attain to a supreme degree of wisdome.
Therefore will I commit him to some learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, to have him indoctrinated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his capacity, and will spare no cost
Presently they appointed him a great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister-Doctor,
called Master <hi>Tubal Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes,</hi>
who taught him his A B C, so well,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41088:47"/>
that he could say it by heart backwards; and
about this he was five yeares and three
moneths. Then read he to him, <hi>Donat, facet,
theodolet,</hi> and <hi>Alanus in parabolis:</hi> About
this he was thirteen years, six moneths, and
two weeks; but you must remark, that in
the mean time he did learn to write in <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
characters, and that he wrote all his
books, for the Art of printing was not then
in use, and did ordinarily carry a great pen
and inkhorne, weighing above seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
quintals, (that is, 700000 pound
weight,) the penner whereof was as big and
as long, as the great pillar of <hi>Enay,</hi> and the
horne was hanged to it in great iron chaines,
it being of the widenesse of a tun of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chand
ware. After that he read unto him
the book <hi>de modis significandi,</hi> with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of <hi>Hurtbise,</hi> of <hi>Fasquin,</hi> of <hi>Tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feu,</hi>
of <hi>Gualhaut,</hi> of <hi>Ihon Calf,</hi> of <hi>Billonio,</hi> of
<hi>Berlinguandus,</hi> and a rabble of others, and
herein he spent more then eighteen yeares
and eleven monethes, and was so well versed
in it, that to try masteries in School-disputes
with his condisciples, he would recite it by
heart backwards: and did sometimes prove
on his fingers ends to his mother, <hi>quod de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
significandi non erat scientia.</hi> Then did he
reade to him the compost, for knowing the
age of the Moon, the seasons of the year, and
tides of the sea, on which he spent sixteen
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41088:48"/>
yeares and two moneths, and that justly at
the time that his said <hi>Praeceptor</hi> died of the
<hi>French</hi> Pox, which was in the yeare one
thousand foure hundred and twenty. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he got an old coughing fellow to teach
him, named Master <hi>Iobelin Bride,</hi> or muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Grecisme,</hi> the <hi>doctrinal,</hi> the <hi>parts,</hi> the

                  <p>AT the last his father perceived, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he studied hard, and that although
he spent all his time in it, did neverthelesse
profit nothing, but which is worse, grew
thereby foolish, simple, doted and blockish,
whereof making a heavie regret to <hi>Don Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
of <hi>Marays,</hi> Viceroy or deputie-King of
<hi>Papeligosse,</hi> he found that it were better for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41088:48"/>
him to learne nothing at all, then to be
taught such like books, under such School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,
because their knowledge was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but brutishnesse, and their wisdome
but blunt foppish toyes, serving only to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardize
good and noble spirits, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
all the flower of youth. That it is so,
take (said he) any young boy of this time,
who hath only studied two yeares, if he have
not a better judgement, a better discourse,
and that expressed in better termes then your
sonne, with a compleater carriage and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility

for ever hereafter a very clounch, and bacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slicer

very well, and he commanded that it should
be done. At night at supper, the said <hi>Des
Marays</hi> brought in a young page of his, of
<hi>Ville-gouges,</hi> called <hi>Eudemon,</hi> so neat, so
trim, so handsom in his apparel, so spruce,
with his haire in so good order, and so sweet
and comely in his behaviour, that he had the
resemblance of a little Angel more then of a
humane creature. Then he said to <hi>Grangou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
Do you see this young boy? he is not as
yet full twelve yeares old; let us try (if it
please you) what difference there is betwixt
the knowledge of the doting <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

old time, and the young lads that are now.
The trial pleased <hi>Grangousier,</hi> and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Page to begin. Then <hi>Eudemon,</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41088:49"/>
asking leave of the Vice-King his Master so

standing up streight on his feet, began very
gracefully to commend him; first for his
vertue and good manners; secondly for his
knowledge; thirdly for his nobility; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his bodily accomplishments: and in
the fifth place most sweetly exhorted him to
reverence his father with all due observancy,
who was so careful to have him well brought
up; in the end he prayed him, that he would
vouchsafe to admit of him amongst the least
of his servants; for other favour at that time
desired he none of heaven, but that he might
do him some grateful and acceptable service:
all this was by him delivered with such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
gestures, such distinct pronunciation, so
pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine
termes, and so good <hi>Latine,</hi> that he seemed
rather a <hi>Gracchus,</hi> a <hi>Cicero,</hi> an <hi>Aemilius</hi> of the
time past, then a youth of this age: but all the
countenance that <hi>Gargantua</hi> kept was, that
he fell to crying like a Cow, and cast down
his face, hiding it with his cap, nor could they
possibly draw one word from him, no more
then a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

marays</hi> withheld him from it by faire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions,
so that at length he pacified his
wrath. Then <hi>Grangousier</hi> commanded he
should be payed his wages, that they should
whittle him up soundly, like a Sophister
with good drink, and then give him leave to
go to all the devils in hell: at least (said he)
to day, shall it not cost his hoste much, if
by chance he should die as drunk as a <hi>Suitser.</hi>
Master <hi>Iobelin</hi> being gone out of the house,
<hi>Grangousier</hi> consulted with the <hi>Viceroy</hi> what
Schoolmaster they should choose for him,
and it was betwixt them resolved, that <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
the Tutor of <hi>Eudemon</hi> should have
the charge, and that they should go altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41088:50"/>
how it is said, that <hi>Africk</hi> alwayes is
productive of some new thing: she was as
big as six elephants, and had her feet cloven
into fingers, like <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> horse, with
slouch-hanging eares, like the goats in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
and a little horne on her buttock,
she was of a burnt sorel hue, with a little
mixture of daple gray spots, but above all
she had a horrible taile; for it was little more
or lesse, then every whit as great as the
Steeple-pillar of St. <hi>Mark</hi> beside <hi>Langes:</hi>
and squared as that is, with tuffs and <hi>enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croches,</hi>
or haire-plaits wrought within one
another, no otherwise then as the beards are

                  <p>If you wonder at this, wonder rather at
the tails of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Rams, which weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above thirty pounds each, and of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
sheep, who need (if <hi>Tenaud</hi> say true,) a
little cart at their heeles to beare up their
taile, it is so long and heavy. You female
Lechers in the plaine countreys have no
such tailes. And she was brought by sea in
three Carricks and a Brigantine unto the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of <hi>Olone</hi> in <hi>Thalmondois.</hi> When <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>

carry my sonne to <hi>Paris.</hi> So now, in the
name of God, all will be well, he will in
times coming be a great Scholar, if it were
not (my masters) for the beasts, we should live
like Clerks: The next morning (after they

their journey; <hi>Gargantua,</hi> his Pedagogue
<hi>Ponocrates,</hi> and his traine, and with them <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi>
the young Page, and because the
weather was faire and temperate, his father
caused to be made for him a paire of dun
boots, <hi>Babin</hi> calls them buskins: Thus did
they merrily passe their time in travelling on
their high way, alwayes making good chear,
and were very pleasant till they came a little
above <hi>Orleans,</hi> in which place there was a
forrest of five and thirty leagues long, and
seventeen in breadth, or thereabouts. This
forrest was most horribly fertile and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in dorflies, hornets and wasps, so that it
was a very Purgatory for the poor mares,
asses and horses: But <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s mare did
avenge her self handsomly of all the out-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
therein committed upon beasts of her
kinde, and that by a trick whereof they had
no suspicion; for assoon as ever they were
entred into the said forest, and that the wasps
had given the assault, she drew out and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheathed
her taile, and therewith skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did so sweep them, that she overthrew
all the wood alongst and athwart, here and
there, this way and that way, longwise and

left them behinde very honestly, not for that
they were too hot, but that they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too heavy for his carriage. This was not
he of <hi>Bourg,</hi> for he was too good a friend of
mine. All the city was risen up in sedition,

that forreign nations wonder at the patience

seeing them so disguised, and thought they

which moved him to enquire of one of the

this mummery meant? it was answered him,
that they desired to have their bells resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

They were all of opinion that they should
bring them unto the goblet-office, which is
the Buttery, and there make them drink like
Roysters, and line their jackets soundly: and
that this cougher might not be puft up with
vain-glory, by thinking the bells were resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

chopining and plying the pot) for the Major

                  <p>THe Sophister had no sooner ended,
but <hi>Ponocrates</hi> and <hi>Eudemon</hi> burst out
in a laughing so heartily, that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
split with it, and given up the ghost,
in rendering their souls to God: even just as
<hi>Crassus</hi> did, seeing a lubberly Asse eate
thistles; and as <hi>Philemon,</hi> who for seeing an
Asse eate those figs which were provided for
his own dinner, died with force of laughing:
together with them Master <hi>Ionatus</hi> fell a

When they had done laughing, <hi>Gargantua</hi>
consulted with the prime of his retinue, what
should be done. There <hi>Ponocrates</hi> was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41088:56"/>
of opinion, that they should make this faire
Orator drink again, and seeing he had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them more pastime, and made them
laugh more then a natural soule could have
done, that they should give him ten baskets
full of sauciges, mentioned in his pleasant
speech, with a paire of hose, three hundred
great billets of log-wood, five and twenty
hogsheads of wine, a good large down-bed,
and a deep capacious dish, which he said were
necessary for his old age; All this was done
as they did appoint: only <hi>Gargantua</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they could not quickly finde out
breeches fit for his wearing, because he
knew not what fashion would best become
the said Orator, whether the martingal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of breeches, wherein is a spunghole
with a draw-bridge, for the more easie ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing:
or the fashion of the Marriners, for

or that of the <hi>Switsers,</hi> which keeps

round breeches with streat cannions, having
in the seat a piece like a Cods taile; all which
considered, for feare of over-heating his
reines, he caused to be given him seven elles
of white cloth for the linings. The wood
was carried by the Porters, the Masters of
Arts carried the sauciges and the dishes, and
Master <hi>Ianotus</hi> himself would carry the
cloth. One of the said Masters, (called <hi>Iesse

he carry it away very close and covertly, as

was, that when this cougher in a full act or

this, it was answered him, that
he should be content with reason, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of any other bribe there. Reason?
(said <hi>Ianotus,)</hi> we use none of it here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie

against him: he on the other side
warned them to appear: In summe, the
Processe was retained by the Court, and is
there as yet. Hereupon the <hi>Magisters</hi> made
a vow, never to <hi>decrott</hi> themselvs in rubbing
off the dirt of either their shoes or clothes:
Master <hi>Ianotus</hi> with his Adherents, vowed
never to blow or snuffe their noses, until

by these vows do they continue unto

But these thick mist-swallowers make the

                  <p>THe first day being thus spent, and the

the Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> in acknowledgement

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41088:58"/>
what meanes, in so long time, his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
had made him so sottish and ignorant.
He disposed therefore of his time in such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
that ordinarily he did awake betwixt
eight and nine a clock, whether it was day or
not, (for so had his ancient governours or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,)
alledging that which <hi>David</hi> saith,
<hi>Vanum est vobis ante lucem surgere.</hi> Then did
he tumble and tosse, wag his legs, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the bed sometime, the better to stirre
up, and rouse his vital spirits, and apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself according to the season: but
willingly he would weare a great long gown
of thick freeze, furred with fox-skins, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he combed his head with an <hi>Alman</hi>
combe, which is the foure fingers and the
thumb: for his <hi>Praeceptor</hi> said, that to comb
himself otherwayes, to wash and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
neat, was to lose time in this world.
Then he dung'd, pist, spued, belched, crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yawned, spitted, coughed, yexed, sneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and snotted himself like an <hi>Arch-deacon:</hi>
and to suppresse the dew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bad aire, went
to breakfast, having some good fried tripes,
faire rashers on the coales, excellent ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of bacon, store of fine minced meat,
and a great deal of sippet brewis, made up
of the fat of the beef-pot, laid upon bread,
cheese and chop't pursley strewed together.
<hi>Ponocrates</hi> shewed him, that he ought not
to eat so soon after rising out of his bed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41088:58"/>
he had performed some exercise before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand:
<hi>Gargantua</hi> answered, What have not I
sufficiently well exercised my self? I have
wallowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rolled my self six or seven
turnes in my bed, before I rose: is not that
enough? Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> did so, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of a Jew his Physician, and lived till his
dying day in despite of his enemies. My first
Masters have used me to it, saying that to
breakfast made a good memory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they drank first. I am very well after it,
and dine but the better: and Master <hi>Tubal,</hi>
(who was the first Licenciat at <hi>Paris,)</hi> told
me that it was not enough to run apace, but
to set forth betimes; so doth not the total
welfare of our humanity depend upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
drinking in a rible rable, like ducks,
but on drinking early in the morning: <hi>unde

                  </p>
                  <p>After that he had throughly broke his

him in a great basket, a huge <hi>impantoufled</hi> or
thick-covered breviary, weighing what in
grease, clasps, parchment and cover, little
more or lesse then eleven hundred and six
pounds. There he heard six and twenty or
thirty Masses: This while, to the same place
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41088:59"/>
came his orison-mutterer <hi>impaletocked,</hi> or
lap't up about the chin, like a tufted whoop,
and his breath pretty well antidoted with
store of the Vine-tree-sirrup: with him he
mumbled all his <hi>Kiriele,</hi> and dunsical brebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions,
which he so curiously thumbed and
fingered, that there fell not so much as
one graine to the ground; as he went from
the Church, they brought him upon a Dray
drawn with oxen, a confused heap of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres</hi>
and <hi>Aves</hi> of <hi>Sante Claude,</hi> every
one of them being of the bignesse of a hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block;
and thus walking through the cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
galleries or garden, he said more in
turning them over, then sixteen Hermites
would have done. Then did he study some
paltry half-houre with his eyes fixed upon
his book; but (as the Comick saith,) his
minde was in the Kitchin. Pissing then a
full Urinal, he sate down at table: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was naturally flegmatick, he began
his meale with some dozens of gammons,
dried neats tongues, hard rowes of mullet,
called <hi>Botargos, Andouilles</hi> or sauciges, and
such other forerunners of wine; in the mean
while, foure of his folks did cast into his
mouth one after another continually mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
by whole shovels full. Immediately
after that, he drank a horrible draught of
white-wine for the ease of his kidneys.
When that was done, he ate according to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41088:59"/>
the season meat agreeable to his appetite,
and then left off eating when his belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to strout, and was like to crack for ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
as for his drinking, he had in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end nor rule; for he was wont to say,
that the limits and bounds of drinking
were, when the cork of the shoes of him that
drinketh, swelleth up half a foot high.</p>

gamons of bacon. Then began he to
study a little, and out came the <hi>patenotres</hi> or
rosary of beads: which the better and more
formally to dispatch, he got up on an old
mule, which had served nine Kings, and so
mumbling with his mouth, nodding and
dodling his head, would go see a coney fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retted
or caught in a grinne; At his return
he went into the Kitchin, to know what roste
meat was on the spit, and what otherwayes
was to be drest for supper: and supped very
well upon my conscience: and commonly
did invite some of his neighbours that were
good drinkers, with whom carousing and
drinking merrily, they told stories of all sorts
from the old to the new. Amongst others,
he had for domesticks the Lords of <hi>Fou,</hi> of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41088:62"/>
                     <hi>Gourville,</hi> of <hi>Griniot,</hi> and of <hi>Marigny.</hi> After
supper were brought in upon the place the
faire wooden Gospels, and the books of
the foure Kings, that is to say, many paires
of tables and cardes: or the faire flusse, one,
two, three: or at all to make short work: or
else they went to see the wenches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
with little small banquets, intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with collations and reer-Suppers. Then
did he sleep without unbrideling, until eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head type="sub">How Gargantua was instructed by Ponocrates,
and in such sort disciplinated, that he
lost not one houre of the day.</head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Ponocrates</hi> knew <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s
vicious manner of living, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to bring him up in another kinde; but
for a while he bore with him, considering
that nature cannot endure a sudden change,
without great violence. Therefore to begin
his work the better, he requested a learned
Physician of that time, called Master <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi>
seriously to perpend (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,)
how to bring <hi>Gargantua</hi> unto a better
course; the said Physician purged him cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41088:63"/>
with <hi>Anticyrian ellebore,</hi> by which
medicine he cleansed all the alteration, and
perverse habitude of his braine. By this
meanes also <hi>Ponocrates</hi> made him forget all
that he had learned under his ancient <hi>Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors,</hi>
as <hi>Timothie</hi> did to his disciples, who had
been instructed under other Musicians. To
do this the better, they brought him into
the company of learned men, which were
there, in whose imitation he had a great
desire and affection to study otherwayes, and
to improve his parts. Afterwards he put
himself into such a road and way of studying,
that he lost not any one houre in the day,
but employed all his time in learning, and
honest knowledge. <hi>Gargantua</hi> awaked them
about foure a clock in the morning; whilest
they were in rubbing of him, there was read
unto him some chapter of the holy Scripture
aloud and clearly, with a pronunciation fit
for the matter, and hereunto was appointed
a young page borne in <hi>Basche,</hi> named <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostes,</hi>
according to the purpose and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that lesson, he oftentimes gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to worship, adore, pray, and send up his
supplications to that good God, whose
Word did shew his majesty and marvellous
judgement. Then went he unto the secret
places to make excretion of his natural dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions:
there his Master repeated what had
been read, expounding unto him the most
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41088:63"/>
obscure and difficult points; in returning,
they considered the face of the sky, if it was
such as they had observed it the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and into what signes the Sun was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
as also the Moon for that day. This
done, he was apparelled, combed, curled,
trimmed and perfumed, during which time
they repeated to him the lessons of the day
before: he himself said them by heart, and
upon them would ground some practical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
concerning the estate of man, which he
would prosecute sometimes two or three
houres, but ordinarily they ceased assoon as
he was fully clothed. Then for three good
houres he had a lecture read unto him. This
done, they went forth, still conferring of
the substance of the lecture, either unto a
field near the University called the <hi>Brack,</hi> or
unto the medowes where they played at the
ball, the long-tennis, and at the <hi>Pïletrigone,
(which is a play wherein we throw a triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
piece of iron at a ring, to passe it,)</hi> most
gallantly exercising their bodies, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had done their mindes. All their play
was but in liberty, for they left off when
they pleased, and that was commonly when
they did sweat over all their body, or were
otherwayes weary. Then were they very
well wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts,
and walking soberly, went to see if dinner
were ready. Whilest they stayed for that,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41088:64"/>
they did clearly and eloquently pronounce
some sentences that they had retained of the
lecture, in the mean time Master Appetite
came, and then very orderly sate they down
at table; at the beginning of the meale,
there was read some pleasant history of the
warlike actions of former times, until he had
taken a glasse of wine. Then (if they thought
good) they continued reading, or began to
discourse merrily together; speaking first
of the vertue, propriety, efficacy and nature
of all that was served in at the table: of
bread, of wine, of water, of salt, of fleshes,
fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
by meanes whereof, he learned in a
little time all the passages competent for
this that were to be found in <hi>Plinie, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,
Dioscorides, Iulius Pollux, Galen, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirie,
Oppian, Polybius, Heliodore, Aristotle,
Elian,</hi> and others. Whilest they talked of
these things, many times to be the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they caused the very books to be
brought to the table, and so well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
did he in his memory retain the things
abovesaid, that in that time there was not a
Physician that knew half so much as he did.
Afterwards they conferred of the lessons read
in the morning, and ending their repast with
some conserve or marmelade of quinces: he
pick't his teeth with mastick tooth-pickers;
wash't his hands and eyes with faire fresh
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41088:64"/>
water, and gave thanks unto God in some
fine Canticks, made in praise of the divine
bounty and munificence. This done, they
brought in cards, not to play, but to learn a
thousand pretty tricks, and new inventions,
which were all grounded upon <hi>Arithmetick:</hi>
by this meanes he fell in love with that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
science, and every day after dinner
and supper he past his time in it as pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he was wont to do at cardes and dice:
so that at last he understood so well both the
Theory and Practical part thereof; that <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal</hi>
the <hi>Englishman,</hi> who had written very
largely of that purpose, confessed that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in comparison of him he had no skill at
all. And not only in that, but in the other
<hi>Mathematical</hi> Sciences, as <hi>Geometrie, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,
Musick, &amp;c.</hi> for in waiting on the
concoction, and attending the digestion of
his food, they made a thousand pretty instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and <hi>Geometrical</hi> figures, &amp; did in some
measure practise the <hi>Astronomical</hi> canons.</p>
                  <p>After this, they recreated themselves with
singing <hi>musically,</hi> in foure or five parts, or
upon a set theme or ground at random, as it
best pleased them; in matter of <hi>musical</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
he learned to play upon the Lute,
the Virginals, the Harp, the Allman Flute
with nine holes, the Viol, and the Sackbut.
This houre thus spent, and digestion finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he did purge his body of natural excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41088:65"/>
then betook himself to his principal
study for three houres together, or more,
as well to repeat his matu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inal lectures, as to
proceed in the book wherein he was, as also
to write handsomly, to draw and forme the
<hi>Antick</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> letters. This being done,
they went out of their house, and with them
a young Gentleman of <hi>Touraine,</hi> named the
Esquire <hi>Gymnast,</hi> who taught him the Art
of riding; changing then his clothes, he
rode a <hi>Naples</hi> courser, a <hi>Dutch</hi> roussin, a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
gennet, a barded or trapped steed, then
a light fleet horse, unto whom he gave a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
carieres, made him go the high saults,
bounding in the aire, free the ditch with a
skip, leap over a stile or pale, turne short in
a ring both to the right and left hand. There
he broke not his lance; for it is the greatest
foolery in the world, to say, I have broken
ten lances at tilt, or in fight, a Carpenter
can do even as much: but it is a glorious and
praise-worthy action, with one lance to break
and overthrow ten enemies: therefore with
a sharp, stiffe, strong and well-steeled lance,
would he usually force up a door, pierce a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
beat down a tree, carry away the ring,
lift up a cuirasier saddle, with the male-coat
and gantlet; all this he did in compleat armes
from head to foot. As for the prancing flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and smacking popismes, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cherishing of the horse, commonly used
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41088:65"/>
in riding, none did them better then he. The
cavallerize of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was but as an Ape
compared to him. He was singularly skilful
in leapiug nimbly from one horse to another,
without putting foot to ground, and these
horses were called <hi>desultories:</hi> he could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
from either side, with a lance in his
hand, leap on horseback without stirrups,
and rule the horse at his pleasure without a
bridle, for such things are useful in military
engagements. Another day he exercised the
battel-axe, which he so dextrously wield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both in the nimble, strong and smooth
management of that weapon, and that in
all the feats practiseable by it, that he past
Knight of Armes in the field, and at all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes.
Then tost he the pike, played with the
two-handed sword, with the backsword, with
the spanish tuck, the dagger, poiniard, armed,
unarmed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with
a targuet. Then would he hunt the Hart, the
Roe-buck, the Beare, the fallow Deer, the
wilde Boare, the Hare, the Phesant, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge
and the Bustard. He played at the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon,
and made it bound in the aire, both
with fist and foot. He wrestled, ran, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not at three steps and a leap <hi>(called the
hops,)</hi> nor at <hi>clochepied, (called the Hares leap,)</hi>
nor yet at the <hi>Almanes;</hi> for (said <hi>Gymnast,)</hi>
these jumps are for the warres altogether
unprofitable, and of no use: but at one leap
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41088:66"/>
he would skip over a ditch, spring over a
hedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp
and grapple after this fashion up against a
window, of the full height of a lance. He
did swim in deep waters on his belly, on his
back, sidewise, with all his body, with his feet
only, with one hand in the air, wherin he held
a book, crossing thus the bredth of the river of
<hi>Seine,</hi> without wetting it, and dragged along
his cloak with his teeth, as did <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi>
then with the help of one hand, he entred
forcibly into a boat, from whence he cast
himself again headlong into the water, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the depths, hollowed the rocks, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the pits and gulphs. Then turned
he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly
or slowly with the stream and against the
stream, stopped it in its course, guided it
with one hand, and with the other laid hard
about him with a huge great Oare, hoised the
saile, hied up along the mast by the shrouds,
ran upon the edge of the decks, set the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
in order, tackled the boulins, and
steer'd the helme. Coming out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he ran furiously up against a hill, and
with the same alacrity and swiftnesse ran
down again; he climbed up at trees like a
cat; and leaped from the one to the other
like a squirrel; he did pull down the great
boughes and branches, like another <hi>Milo;</hi>
then with two sharp well-steeled daggers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41088:66"/>
and two tried bodkins, would he run up by
the wall to the very top of a house like a cat;
then suddenly came down from the top to
the bottom, with such an even composition
of members, that by the fall he would catch
no harme.</p>
                  <p>He did cast the dart, throw the barre, put
the stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear
or partisan, and the halbard; he broke the
strongest bowes in drawing, bended against
his breast the greatest crosse-bowes of steele,
took his aime by the eye with the hand-gun,
and shot well, traversed and planted the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
shot a but-marks, at the papgay from
below upwards, <hi>or to a height;</hi> from above
downwards, <hi>or to adescent,</hi> then before him,
sidewise, and behinde him, like the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
They tied a cable-rope to the top of a
high Tower, by one end whereof hanging
near the ground, he wrought himself with
his hands to the very top: Then upon the
same tract came down so sturdily and firme
that you could not on a plaine meadow have
run with more assurance. They set up a
great pole fixed upon two trees, there would
he hang by his hands, and with them alone,
his feet touching at nothing, would go back
and sore along the foresaid rope with so
great swiftnesse, that hardly could one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him with running; and then to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his breast and lungs, he would shout like
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41088:67"/>
all the Devils in hell; I heard him once call
<hi>Eudemon</hi> from St. <hi>Victors</hi> gate to <hi>Monmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre:
Stentor</hi> had never such a voyce at the
siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> Then for the strengthening
of his nerves or sinewes, they made him
two great sows of lead, each of them weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eight thousand and seven hundred
kintals, which they called <hi>Alteres;</hi> those he
took up from the ground in each hand one,
then lifted them up over his head, and held
them so without stirring three quarters of an
hour and more, which was an inimitable
force; he fought at Barriers with the stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most vigorous Champions: and
when it came to the cope he stood so sturdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on his feet, that he abandoned himself
unto the strongest, in case they could remove
him from his place, as <hi>Milo</hi> was wont to do
of old; in whose imitation likewise he held
a Pomgranat in his hand, to give it unto him
that could take it from him: The time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus bestowed, and himself rubbed,
cleansed, wiped, and refresht with other
clothes, he returned fair and softly; and
passing through certain meadows, or other
grassie places, beheld the trees and plants,
comparing them with what is written of
them in the books of the Ancients, such as
<hi>Theophrast, Dioscorides, Marinus, Plinie,
Nicander, Macer,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and carried
home to the house great handfuls of them,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41088:67"/>
whereof a young Page called <hi>Rizotomos</hi> had
charge; together with little Mattocks, Pick-axes,
Grubbing-hooks, Cabbies, Pruning-knives,
and other instruments requisite for
herborising. Being come to their lodging,
whilest supper was making ready, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
certain passages of that which hath
been read, and sate down at table. Here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that his dinner was sober and thrifty,
for he did then eat only to prevent the
gnawings of his stomack, but his supper was
copious and large; for he took then as much
as was fit to maintaine and nourish him
which indeed is the true diet prescribed by
the Art of good and sound <hi>Physick.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a rabble of loggerheaded Physicians,
nuzzeled in the brabling shop of <hi>Sophisters,</hi>
counsel the contrary; during that repast was
continued the lesson read at dinner as long
as they thought good: the rest was spent in
good discourse, learned and profitable. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they had given thanks, he set himself
to sing vocally, and play upon harmonious
instruments, or otherwayes passed his time
at some pretty sports, made with cards or
dice; or in practising the feats of <hi>Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
with cups and balls. There they stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some nights in frolicking thus, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselves merrie till it was time to go
to bed; and on other nights they would go
make visits unto learned men, or to such as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41088:68"/>
had been travellers in strange and remote
countreys. When it was full night before
they retired themselves, they went unto the
most open place of the house to see the face
of the sky, and there beheld the comets, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were, as likewise the figures, situations,
aspects, oppositions and conjunctions of the
both fixed starres and planets.</p>
                  <p>Then with his Master did he briefely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate
after the manner of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that which he had read, seen, learned,
done and understood in the whole course of
that day.</p>
                  <p>Then prayed they unto <hi>God</hi> the Creator,
in falling down before him, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
their faith towards him, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
him for his boundlesse bounty, and
giving thanks unto him for the time that
was past, they recommended themselves to
his divine clemency for the future, which
being done, they went to bed, and
betook themselves to their repose and
rest.</p>

weather.</head>
                  <p>IF it happened that the weather were any
thing cloudie, foul &amp; rainie, all the forenoon
was employed, as before specified, according
to custom, with this difference only, that they
had a good clear fire lighted, to correct the
distempers of the aire: but after dinner, in
stead of their wonted exercitations they did
abide within, and by way of <hi>Apotherapie,</hi>
(that is, <hi>a making the body healthful by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,)</hi>
did recreate themselves in botteling up
of hay, in cleaving and sawing of wood, and
in threshingsheaves of corn at the Barn. Then
they studied the Art of painting or carving;
or brought into use the antick play of tables,
as <hi>Leonicus</hi> hath written of it, and as our
good friend <hi>Lascaris</hi> playeth at it. In play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they examined the passages of ancient
Authors, wherein the said play is mentioned,
or any metaphore drawn from it. They
went likewise to see the drawing of mettals,
or the casting of great ordnance: how the
Lapidaries did work, as also the Goldsmiths
and Cutters of precious stones: nor did they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41088:69"/>
omit to visit the Alchymists, money-coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Upholsters, Weavers, Velvet-workers,
Watchmakers, Looking-glasse-framers,
Printers, Organists, and other such kinde of
Artificers, and every where giving them
somewhat to drink, did learne and consider
the industry and invention of the trades.
They went also to heare the publick le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
the solemn commencements, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
the acclamations, the pleadings
of the gentle Lawyers, and Sermons of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Preachers. He went through the
Halls and places appointed for fencing, and
there played against the Masters themselves
at all weapons, and shewed them by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he knew as much in it as (yea more
then) they. And in stead of herborising, they
visited the shops of Druggists, Herbalists and
Apothecaries, and diligently considered the
fruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds, the grease
and ointments of some forreign parts, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
how they did adulterate them. He went
to see the Juglers, Tumblers, Mountebanks
and Quacksalvers; and considered their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
their shifts, their summer-saults and
smooth tongue, especially of those of <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
in <hi>Picardie,</hi> who are naturally great pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and brave givers of fibs in matter of
green apes. At their return they did eate
more soberly at supper then at other times,
and meats more desiccative and extenuating;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41088:69"/>
to the end that the intemperate moisture of
the aire, communicated to the body by a
necessary confinitie, might by this means be
corrected, and that they might not receive
any prejudice for want of their ordinary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
exercise. Thus was <hi>Gargantua</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and kept on in this course of education,
from day to day profiting, as you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
such a young man of his age may
of a pregnant judgement with good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
well continued. Which although at
the beginning it seemed difficult, became a
little after so sweet, so easie, and so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that it seemed rather the recreation of a
King, then the study of a Scholar. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
<hi>Ponocrates,</hi> to divert him from this
vehement intension of the spirits, thought
fit once in a month, upon some fair and clear
day to go out of the City betimes in the
morning, either towards <hi>Gentilly,</hi> or <hi>Boulogne,</hi>
or to <hi>Montrouge,</hi> or <hi>Charantou-bridge,</hi> or
to <hi>Vanures,</hi> or St. <hi>Clou,</hi> and there spent all the
day long in making the greatest chear that
could be devised, sporting, making merry,
drinking healths, playing, singing, dancing,
tumbling in some faire medow, unnestling
of sparrowes, taking of quailes, and fishing
for frogs and crabs; but although that day
was past without books or lecture, yet was
it not spent without profit; for in the said
medowes they usually repeated certain
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41088:70"/>
pleasant verses of <hi>Virgils</hi> Agriculture, of
<hi>Hesiod</hi> and of <hi>Politians</hi> husbandrie, would
set a broach some wittie Latine Epigrams,
then immediately turned them into round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
and songs for dancing in the French
language. In their feasting, they would som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
separate the water from the wine that
was therewith mixed, as <hi>Cato</hi> teacheth <hi>de re
rustica,</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> with an ivie cup: would
wash the wine in a basin full of water, then
take it out again with a funnel as pure as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
They made the water go from one

ten or twelve horses loaded with cakes, the
said shepherds courteously intreated them
to give them some for their money, as the
price then ruled in the market; for here it is
to be remarked, that it is a celestial food to
eate for breakfast hot fresh cakes with grapes,
especially the frail clusters, the great red
grapes, the muscadine, the verjuice grape
and the luskard, for those that are costive in
their belly; because it will make them gush
out, and squirt the length of a Hunters
staffe, like the very tap of a barrel; and
often-times thinking to let a squib, they did
all-to-besquatter and conskite themselves,
whereupon they are commonly called the
Vintage-thinkers. The Bunsellers or Cake-bakers
were in nothing inclinable to their
request; but (which was worse) did injure
them most outragiously, calling them prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gablers, lickorous gluttons, freckled bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
mangie rascals, shiteabed scoundrels,
drunken roysters, slie knaves, drowsie loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,

Turdie gut, shitten shepherds, and other
such like defamatory epithetes, saying fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it was not for them to eate of these
dainty cakes, but might very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with the course unraung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bread, or to eat of the great brown
houshold loaf. To which provoking words,
one amongst them, called <hi>Forgier,</hi> (an honest
fellow of his person, and a notable springal,)
made answer very calmly thus: How long is
it since you have got hornes, that you are
become so proud? indeed formerly you were
wont to give us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome freely, and will you
not now let us have any for our money?
This is not the part of good neighbours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we serve you thus when you come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to buy our good corn, wherof you make
your cakes and buns: besides that, we would
have given you to the bargain some of our
grapes, but <hi>by his Zounds,</hi> you may chance to
repent it, and possibly have need of us at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time, when we shall use you after the
like manner, and therefore remember it.
Then <hi>Marquet,</hi> a prime man in the confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41088:71"/>
of the cake-bakers, said unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yea Sir, thou art pretty well crest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

morning, thou didst ear yesternight too
much millet and bolymoug, come hither
<hi>Sirrah,</hi> come hither, I will give thee some
cakes: whereupon <hi>Forgier</hi> dreading no
harm, in all simplicity went towards him,
and drew a sixpence out of his leather sach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
thinking that <hi>Market</hi> would have sold
him some of his cakes; but in stead of cakes,
he gave him with his whip such a rude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sh
overthwart the legs, that the marks of the
whipcord knots were apparent in them; then
would have fled away, but <hi>Forgier</hi> cried out
as loud as he could, O murther, murther,
help, help, help, and in the mean time threw
a great cudgel after him, which he carried
under his arme, wherewith he hit him in the
<hi>coronal</hi> joynt of his head, upon the <hi>crotaphick</hi>
arterie of the right side thereof, so forcibly,
that <hi>Marquet</hi> fell down from his mare, more
like a dead then living man. Mean-while
the farmers and countrey-swaines that
were watching their walnuts near to that
place, came running with their great poles
and long staves, and laid such load on these
cake-bakers, as if they had been to thresh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
green rie. The other shepherds and
shepherdesses hearing the lamentable shout
of <hi>Forgier,</hi> came with their slings and slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies
following them, and throwing great
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41088:72"/>
stones at them, as thick as if it had been haile.
At last they overtook them, and took from
them about foure or five dosen of their cakes:
neverthelesse they payed for them the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
price, and gave them over and above
one hundred egges, and three baskets full of
mulberries. Then did the cake-bakers help
to get up to his mare-<hi>Marquet,</hi> who was most
shrewdly wounded, and forthwith returned
to <hi>Lerne,</hi> changing the resolution they had
to go to <hi>Pareille,</hi> threatning very sharp and
boistrously the cowherds, shepherds and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of <hi>Sevile</hi> and <hi>Sinays.</hi> This done, the
shepherds and shepherdesses made merry
with these cakes and fine grapes, and sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves together at the sound of the
pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at
those vain-glorious cake-bakers, who had
that day met with a mischief for want of
crossing themselves with a good hand in the
morning. Nor did they forget to apply to
<hi>Forgiers</hi> leg some faire great red medicinal
grapes, and so handsomly drest it and bound
it up, that he was quickly cured.</p>

his designe, he caused the drum to be beat
about the town. Himself, whilest his dinner
was making ready, went to see his artillery
mounted upon the carriage, to display his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and set up the great royal standard, and
loaded waines with store of ammunition
both for the field and the belly, armes and
victuals: at dinner he dispatch't his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
and by his expresse Edict my Lord
<hi>Shagrag</hi> was appointed to command the
Vanguard, wherein were numbered sixteen
thousand and fourteen harquebusiers or fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,
together with thirty thousand and
eleven Voluntier-adventurers. The great

charge of the Ordnance, wherein were
reckoned nine hundred and fourteen bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

<hi>serpentines, culverins,</hi> bombards or
murtherers, falcons, <hi>bases</hi> or <hi>passevolans,
spiroles</hi> and other sorts of great guns. The
Reerguard was committed to the <hi>Duke of
Scrapegood:</hi> In the maine battel was the
King, and the Princes of his Kingdome.
Thus being hastily furnished, before they
would set forward, they sent three hundred
light horsemen under the conduct of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Swillwind,</hi> to discover the countrey,
clear the avenues, and see whether there was
any ambush laid for them: but after they
had made diligent search, they found all the

that every one should march speedily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

they took the fields one amongst another,
wasting, spoiling, destroying and making

committing such incomparable abuses, that
the like abomination was never heard of.
Neverthelesse, they met with none to resist

                  <head type="sub">How a Monk of Sevile saved the Closse of
the Abbey from being ransacked
by the enemie.</head>
                  <p>SO much they did, and so farre they went
pillaging and stealing, that at last they
came to <hi>Sevile,</hi> where they robbed both men
and women, and took all they could catch:
nothing was either too hot or too heavie for
them. Although the plague was there in the
most part of all the houses, they neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
entered every where; then plundered
and carried away all that was within; and yet
for all this not one of them took any hurt,
which is a most wonderful case. For the
Curates, Vicars, Preachers, Physicians,
Chirurgions and Apothecaries, who went to
visit, to dresse, to cure, to heale, to preach
unto, and admonish those that were sick
were all dead of the infection; and these
devillish robbers and murtherers caught ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any harme at all. Whence comes this
to passe, (my masters) I beseech you think
upon it? the town being thus pillaged, they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41088:74"/>
went unto the Abbey with a horrible noise
and tumult, but they found it shut and made
fast against them; whereupon the body of
the army marched forward towards a passe
or ford called the <hi>Sue de vede,</hi> except seven
companies of foot, and two hundred lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers,
who staying there, broke down the
walls of the Closse, to waste, spoile and make
havock of all the Vines and Vintage within
that place. The Monks (poor devils) knew
not in that extremity to which of all their
Sancts they should vow themselves; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
at all adventures they rang the bells
<hi>ad capitulum capitulantes:</hi> there it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that they should make a faire Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
stnssed with good lectures, prayers and
letanies, <hi>contra hostium insidias,</hi> and jollie
responses <hi>pro pace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was then in the Abbey a claustral
Monk, called <hi>Freer Ihon</hi> of the funnels and
gobbets, in French <hi>des entoumeures,</hi> young,
gallant, frisk, lustie, nimble, <hi>quick, active,</hi>
bold, adventurous, resolute, tall, lean, wide-mouthed,
long-nosed, a faire dispatcher of
morning prayers, unbridler of masses, and
runner over of vigils: and to conclude sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
in a word, a right Monk, if ever there
was any, since the Monking world monked
a Monkerie: for the rest a Clerk, even to
the teeth in matter of breviary. This Monk
hearing the noise that the enemy made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41088:75"/>
the inclosure of the Vineyard, went out to
see what they were doing; and perceiving
that they were cutting and gathering the
grapes, whereon was grounded the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all their next yeares wine, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the quire of the Church where the
other Monks were, all amazed and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like so many Bell-melters, whom when
he heard sing, <hi>im, nim, pe, ne, ne, ne, ne, nene,
tum, ne, num, num, ini, i mi, co, o, no, o, o,
neno, ne, no, no, no, rum, nenum, num.</hi> It is
well shit, well sung, (said he) by the vertue
of God, why do not you sing Paniers fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Vintage is done; The devil snatch me,
if they be not already within the middle of
our Closse, and cut so well both Vines and
Grapes, that <hi>by cods body</hi> there will not be
found for these four yeares to come so much
as a gleaning in it. <hi>By the belly of Sanct
Iames,</hi> what shall we <hi>(poor devils)</hi> drink the
while? Lord God! <hi>da mihi potum.</hi> Then said
the Prior of the Covent, What should this
drunken fellow do here, let him be carried to
prison for troubling the divine service: Nay,
said the Monk, the wine service, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
our selves so, that it be not troubled;
for you your self, <hi>my Lord Prior,</hi> love to drink
of the best, and so doth every honest man.
Never yet did a man of worth dislike good
wine, it is a monastical apophthegme. But
these responses that you chant here by G.—
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41088:75"/>
are not in season: wherefore is it that our
devotions were instituted to be short in the
time of Harvest and Vintage, and long in
the Advent, and all the winter? The late
Friar, <hi>Massepelosse</hi> of good memory, a true
zealous man, (or else I give my self to the
devil) of our religion, told me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it well, how the reason was, that in
this season we might presse and make the
wine, and in Winter whiffe it up. Heark
you, my masters, you that love the wine,
<hi>Cops body</hi> follow me, for <hi>Sanct Antonie</hi> burn
me as freely as a fagot, if they get leave to
taste one drop of the liquour, that will not
now come and fight for relief of the Vine.
Hogs belly, the goods of the Church! Ha,
no, no: what the devil, <hi>Sanct Thomas</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was well content to die for them; if I
died in the same cause, should not I be a
<hi>Sanct</hi> likewise? Yes: yet shall not I die there
for all this, for it is I that must do it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and send them a packing. As he spake
this, he threw off his great Monks habit, and
laid hold upon the staffe of the crosse, which
was made of the heart of a sorbaple-tree, it
being of the length of a lance, round, of a full
gripe, and a little poudred with lilies called
<hi>flower de luce,</hi> the workmanship whereof was
almost all defaced and worn out. Thus went
he out in a faire long-skirted jacket, putting
his frock scarfewayes athwart his breast, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41088:76"/>
in this equipage, with his staffe, shaft or
truncheon of the crosse, laid on so lustily,
brisk and fiercely upon his enemies, who
without any order, or ensigne, or trumpet,
or drum, were busied in gathering the grapes
of the Vineyard; for the Cornets, Guidons
and Ensigne-bearers, had laid down their
standards, banners, and colours by the wall-sides:
the Drummers had knock't out the
heads of their Drums on one end, to fill
them with grapes: The Trumpeters were
loaded with great bundles of bunches, and
huge knots of clusters: In summe, every
one of them was out of aray, and all in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.
He hurried therefore upon them so
rudely, without crying <hi>gare</hi> or beware, that
he overthrew them like hogs, tumbled them
over like swine, striking athwart and alongst,
and by one means or other laid so about him,
after the old fashion of fencing, that to some
he beat out their braines, to others he crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their armes, battered their legs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwacked
their sides till their ribs cracked
with it; to others again he unjoynted the
spondyles <hi>or knuckles of the neck,</hi> disfigured
their chaps, gashed their faces, made their
cheeks hang flapping on their chin, and so
swinged and belammed them, that they fell
down before him like hay before a Mower:
to some others he spoiled the frame of their
kidneys, marred their backs, broke their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41088:76"/>
thigh-bones, pash't in their noses, poached
out their eyes, cleft their mandibules, tore
their jaws, dung in their teeth into their
throat, shook asunder their omoplates or
shoulder-blade, <hi>sphacelated</hi> their shins, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
their shanks, inflamed their ankles, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
off of the hinges their ishies, their <hi>scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica</hi>
or hip-gout, dislocated the joints of the
knees, squattered into pieces the boughts
or pestles of their thighs, and so thumped,
mawled and belaboured them every where,
that never was corne so thick and threefold
thresh't upon by Plowmens flailes, as were
the pitifully disjoynted members of their
mangled bodies, under the mercilesse baton
of the crosse. If any offered to hide himself
amongst the thickest of the Vines, he laid
him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge of
his back, and dash't his reines like a dog. If
any thought by flight to escape, he made his
head to flie in pieces by the <hi>Lambdoidal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missure,
which is a seame in the hinder part of
the scull.</hi> If any one did scramble up into a
tree, thinking there to be safe, he rent up
his perinee, and impaled him in at the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If any of his old acquaintance happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cry out, Ha <hi>Fryar Ihon</hi> my friend,
<hi>Fryar Ihon,</hi> quarter, quarter, I yield my self
to you, to you I render my self: So thou
shalt (said he) and must whether thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
or no, and withal render and yield up thy
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41088:77"/>
soul to all the devils in hell, then sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave them <hi>Dronos,</hi> that is, so many
knocks, thumps, raps, dints, thwacks and
bangs, as sufficed to warne <hi>Pluto</hi> of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and dispatch them a going: if any was so
rash and full of temerity as to resist him to his
face, then was it he did shew the strength of
his muscles, for without more ado he did
transpierce him, by running him in at the
breast, through the mediastine and the heart.
Others again he so quashed and bebumped,
that with a sound bounce under the hollow
of their short ribs, he overturned their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs
so that they died immediately: to
some with a smart souse on the <hi>Epigaster,</hi> he
would make their midrif swag, then redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the blow; gave them such a home-push
on the navel, that he made their puddings to
gush out. To others through their ballocks
he pierced their bum-gut, and left not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
tripe nor intral in their body, that had
not felt the impetuosity, fiercenesse and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his violence. Beleeve that it was the
most horrible spectacle that ever one saw:
some cried unto <hi>Sanct Barbe,</hi> others to <hi>St.
George;</hi> O the holy <hi>Lady Nytouch,</hi> said one,
the good Sanctesse; <hi>O our Lady of Succours,</hi>
said another, help, help: others cried, Our
Lady of <hi>Cunaut,</hi> of <hi>Loretta,</hi> of good tidings
on the other side of the water St. <hi>Mary over:</hi>
some vowed a pilgrimage to St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41088:77"/>
others to the holy handkerchief at <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrie,</hi>
which three moneths after that burnt
so well in the fire, that they could not get
one thread of it saved: others sent up their
vowes to St. <hi>Cadouin,</hi> others to St. <hi>Ihon
d' Angelie,</hi> and to St. <hi>Eutropius</hi> of <hi>Xaintes:</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
again invoked St. <hi>Mesmes</hi> of <hi>Chinon,</hi> St.
<hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Candes,</hi> S. <hi>Clouod</hi> of <hi>Sinays,</hi> the holy
relicks of <hi>Laurezay,</hi> with a thousand other
jolly little Sancts and Santrels: Some died
without speaking, others spoke without dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
some died in speaking, others spoke in
dying. Others shouted as loud as they could,
Confession, Confession, <hi>Confiteor, miserere,
in manus;</hi> so great was the cry of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the <hi>Prior</hi> of the Abbey with all his
<hi>Monks</hi> came forth, who when they saw
these poor wretches so slain amongst the
Vines, and wounded to death, confessed
some of them: but whilest the Priests were
busied in confessing them, the little <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies</hi>
ran all to the place where <hi>Friar Ihon</hi> was,
and asked him, wherein he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to require their assistance? To which he
answered, that they should cut the throats of
those he had thrown down upon the ground.
They presently leaving their outer habits
and cowles upon the railes, began to throttle
and make an end of those whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
crushed: Can you tell with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
they did it? with faire <hi>gulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:41088:78"/>
which are little hulchback't demi-knives, the
iron toole whereof is two inches long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the wooden-handle one inch thick, and three
inches in length, wherewith the little boyes
in our countrey cut ripe walnuts in two,
(while they are yet in the shell,) and pick out
the kernel, and they found them very fit for
the expediting of that wezand-slitting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit.
In the mean time <hi>Friar Ihon</hi> with his
formidable baton of the Crosse, got to the
breach which the enemies had made, and
there stood to snatch up those that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to escape: Some of the <hi>Monkito's</hi>
carried the standards, banners, ensignes, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
and colours into their cells and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to make garters of them. But when
those that had been shriven, would have gone
out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy
<hi>Monk</hi> quash't and fell'd them down with
blowes, saying, These men have had confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and are penitent soules, they have got
their absolution, and gained the pardons:
they go into Paradise as streight as a sickle,
or as the way is to <hi>Faye, (like Crooked-Lane at
Eastcheap.)</hi> Thus by his prowesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
were discomfited all those of the army

                  <p>WHilest the Monk did thus skirmish,
as we have said, against those which
were entred within the Closse; <hi>Piorochole</hi>
in great haste passed the ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> (a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
especial passe) with all his souldierie, and
set upon the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> where there
was made him no resistance at all: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was already night, he resolved to
quarter himself and his army in that town,
and to refresh himself of his pugnative cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
In the morning he stormed and took
the Bulwarks and Castle, which afterwards
he fortified with rampiers, and furnished
with all ammunition requisite, intending to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41088:79"/>
make his retreat there, if he should happen
to be otherwise worsted; for it was a strong
place, both by Art and Nature, in regard of
the stance and situation of it. But let us
leave them there, and return to our good
<hi>Gargantua,</hi> who is at <hi>Paris</hi> very assiduous and
earnest at the study of good letters, and ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letical
exercitations, and to the good old
man <hi>Grangousier</hi> his father, who after supper
warmeth his ballocks by a good, clear, great
fire, and waiting upon the broyling of some
chestnuts, is very serious in drawing
scratches on the hearth, with a stick burnt at
the one end, wherewith they did stirre up
the fire, telling to his wife and the rest of the
family pleasant old stories and tales of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. Whilest he was thus employed,
one of the shepherds which did keep the
Vines, (named <hi>Pillot)</hi> came towards him, and
to the full related the enormous abuses which
were committed, and the excessive spoil that
was made by <hi>Picrochole</hi> King of <hi>Lerne,</hi> upon
his lands and territories, and how he had
pillaged, wasted and ransacked all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
except the inclosure at <hi>Sevile,</hi> which
Friar <hi>Ihon des entoumeures</hi> to his great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had preserved: and that at the same
present time the said King was in the rock
<hi>Clermond:</hi> and there with great industry and
circumspection, was strengthening himself
and his whole army. <hi>Halas, halas, alas,</hi> (said
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41088:79"/>
                     <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> what is this good people? do I
dream, or is it true that they tell me? <hi>Picro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chole</hi>
my ancient friend of old time, of my
own kinred and alliance, comes he to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
me? what moves him? what provokes
him? what sets him on? what drives him to
it? who hath given him this counsel? <hi>Ho,
ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> my God, my Saviour, help me,
inspire me, and advise me what I shall do.
I protest, I swear before thee, so be thou fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to me, if ever I did him or his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
any damage or displeasure, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any the least robbery in his countrey;
but on the contrary I have succoured and
supplied him with men, money, friendship
and counsel upon any occasion, wherein I
could be steadable for the improvement
of his good; that he hath therefore at this
nick of time so outraged and wronged me,
it cannot be but by the malevolent and
wicked spirit. Good God, thou knowest my
courage, for nothing can be hidden from
thee; if perhaps he be grown mad, and that
thou hast sent him hither to me for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
recovery &amp; re-establishment of his brain:
grant me power and wisdome to bring him
to the yoke of thy holy will by good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
<hi>Ho, ho, ho, ho,</hi> my good people, my
friends and my faithful servants, must I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you from helping me? alas, my old age
required henceforward nothing else but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41088:80"/>
rest, and all the dayes of my life I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
for nothing so much as peace: but
now I must (I see it well) load with armes my
poor, weary and feeble shoulders; and take
in my trembling hand the lance and horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
mace, to succour and protect my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
subjects: reason will have it so; for by
their labour am I entertained, and with their
sweat am I nourished, I, my children and
my family. This notwithstanding, I will
not undertake warre, until I have first tried
all the wayes and meanes of peace, that I
resolve upon. Then assembled he his
counsel, and proposed the matter as it was
indeed, whereupon it was concluded, that
they should send some discreet man unto
<hi>Picrochole,</hi> to know wherefore he had thus
suddenly broken the Peace, and invaded
those lands unto which he had no right nor
title. Furthermore, that they should send for
<hi>Gargantua,</hi> and those under his command,
for the preservation of the countrey, and
defence thereof now at need. All this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Grangousier</hi> very well, and commanded
that so it should be done. Presently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sent the <hi>Basque</hi> his Lackey, to fetch

him as followeth.</p>

that I should not in a long time recall
thee from that Philosophical rest thou now
enjoyest: if the confidence reposed in our

old age: But seeing such is my fatal destiny,
that I should be now disquieted by those in

thee back to help the people and goods,
which by the right of nature belong unto
thee; for even as armes are weak abroad if

not to assault, but to defend: not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,

pursueth his furious enterprise with that

all that which I thought might give him sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:

wronged? but of him could I obtain no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer, but a meer defiance, and that
in my lands he did pretend only to the right
of a civil correspondency and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
whereby I knew that the eternal God
hath left him to the disposure of his own
free will and sensual appetite, which cannot
chuse but be wicked, if by divine grace it
be not continually guided: and to contain
him within his duty, and bring him to know
himself, hath sent him hither to me by a
grievous token. Therefore, my beloved son,
as soon as thou canst, upon sight of these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
repaire hither with all diligence, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
not me so much (which neverthelesse

be done with as little effusion of blood as

and that he would not advise him to go any

were enormously furious; which he easily
beleeved, and therefore lodged that night

with the Miller. The next morning he went
with a Trumpeter to the gate of the Castle,
and required the guards he might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to speak with the King of somewhat that
concerned him. These words being told un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, he would by no means consent

receive hurt and damage, where they may
justly expect for favour and good will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
not without cause, (though without reason,)
have many, after they had fallen into such a

lesse supportable then the losse of their

been able by force of armes, nor any other
means, by reach of wit or subtilty, to stop
them in their course, and restrain their fury,
they have fallen into desparation, and utterly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41088:82"/>
deprived themselves of this light. It is
therefore no wonder if King <hi>Grangousier</hi> my
Master be full of high displeasure, and much
disquieted in minde upon thy out ragious and
hostile coming: but truly it would be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
if he were not sensible of, and moved
with the incomparable abuses and injuries
perpetrated by thee and thine upon those of
his countrey, towards whom there hath been
no example of inhumanity omitted; which
in it self is to him so grievous for the cordial
affection, wherewith he hath alwayes che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
his subjects, that more it cannot be to
any mortal man; yet in this (above humane
apprehension) is it to him the more grievous,
that these wrongs and sad offences have been
committed by thee and thine, who time out
of minde from all antiquity, thou and thy
Predecessors have been in a continual league
and amity with him, and all his Ancestors;
which, even until this time, you have as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
together inviolably preserved, kept and
entertained, so well, that not he and his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but the very barbarous Nations of the
<hi>Poictevins, Bretons, Manceaux,</hi> and those that
dwell beyond the isles of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and
that of <hi>Isabella,</hi> have thought it as easie to
pull down the firmament, and to set up the
depths above the clouds, as to make a breach
in your alliance; and have been so afraid of
it in their enterprises, that they have never
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41088:83"/>
dared to provoke, incense or indamage the
one for feare of the other. Nay, which is
more, this sacred league hath so filled the
world, that there are few Nations at this day
inhabiting throughout all the continent and
isles of the Ocean, who have not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
aspired to be received into it, upon
your own covenants and conditions, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your joynt confederacie in as high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
as their own territories and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in such sort, that from the memory of
man, there hath not been either Prince or
league so wilde and proud, that durst have
offered to invade, I say not your countreys,
but not so much as those of your confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates:
and if by rash and headie counsel they
have attempted any new designe against
them, assoon as they heard the name and
title of your alliance, they have suddenly
desisted from their enterprises. What rage
and madnesse therefore doth now incite
thee, all old alliance infringed, all amity
trod under foot, and all right violated, thus in
a hostil manner to invade his countrey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having been by him or his in any thing
prejudiced, wronged or provoked? where
is faith? where is law? where is reason?
where is humanity? where is the feare of
God? dost thou think that these atrocious
abuses are hidden from the eternal spirits,
and the supreme God, who is the just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41088:83"/>
of all our undertakings? if thou so
think, thou deceivest thy self; for all things
shall come to passe, as in his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
judgement he hath appointed. Is it thy
fatal destiny, or influences of the stars that
would put an end to thy so long enjoyed
ease and rest? for that all things have their
end and period, so as that when they are
come to the superlative point of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
height, they are in a trice tumbled down
again, as not being able to abide long in that
state. This is the conclusion and end of
those who cannot by reason and temperance
moderate their fortunes and prosperities.
But if it be predestinated that thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and ease must now come to an end,
must it needs be by wronging my King?
him by whom thou wert established? If thy
house must come to ruine, should it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in its fall crush the heels of him that
set it up? The matter is so unreasonable, and
so dissonant from common sense, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can it be conceived by humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and altogether incredible unto
strangers, till by the certain and undoubted
effects thereof it be made apparent, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>WIth that the good man <hi>Gallet</hi> held

unto God, that he would vouchsafe to
asswage the choler of <hi>Picrochole,</hi> and bring
him to the rule of reason without proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by force. When the good man came
back, he asked him, Ha, my friend, my

is neither hope nor remedy, (said <hi>Gallet)</hi> the

God. Yea but (said <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> my friend,
what cause doth he pretend for his outrages?
He did not shew me any cause at all (said

some words of cakes. I cannot tell if they
have done any wrong to his Cake-bakers.
I will know (said <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> the matter
throughly, before I resolve any more upon
what is to be done; then sent he to learn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that businesse, and found by true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that his men had taken violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some cakes from <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that <hi>Marquets</hi> head was broken with a <hi>slackie</hi>

well paid, and that the said <hi>Marquet</hi> had first
hurt <hi>Forgier</hi> with a stroke of his whip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
the legs; and it seemed good to his
whole counsel, that he should defend himself
with all his might. Notwithstanding all this
(said <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> seeing the question is but
about a few cakes, I will labour to content
him; for I am very unwilling to wage warre
against him. He enquired then what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of cakes they had taken away, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
that it was but some foure or five
dozen, he commanded five cart-loads of
them to be baked that same night: and that
there should be one full of cakes made with
fine butter, fine yolks of egges, fine saffron
and fine spice, to be bestowed upon <hi>Marquet,</hi>
unto whom likewise he directed to be given

seven hundred thousand and three <hi>Philips,</hi>
(that is, at three shillings the piece, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
five thousand pounds and nine shillings
of <hi>English</hi> money) for reparation of his losses
and hinderances, and for satisfaction of the

<hi>La Pomardiere;</hi> for the conveyance and

the willow-trees great store of boughs,
canes and reeds, wherewith all the Cariers
were injoyned to garnish and deck their carts,
and each of them tocarry one in his hand,
as himself likewise did, thereby to give all
men to understand that they demanded
but Peace, and that they came to buy it.</p>
                  <p>Being come to the gate, they required to
speak with <hi>Picrochole</hi> from <hi>Grangousier. Picro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chole</hi>
would not so much as let them in, nor
go to speak with them, but sent them word
that he was busie, and that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their minde to Captain <hi>Touquedillon,</hi>

Gods sake let us live henceforward in Peace,
and withdraw your selves merrily into your

which you have no right at all, as your selves
must needs confesse, and let us be good
friends as before. <hi>Touquedillon</hi> related all
this to <hi>Picrochole,</hi> and more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
his courage, saying to him, These
clowns are afraid to some purpose: by G—

I am of opinion that it is fit we send back
the carts and the money; and for the rest,
that very speedily we fortifie our selves here,
then prosecute our fortune. But what do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41088:86"/>
they think to have to do with a <hi>ninnie-whoop,</hi>
to feed you thus with cakes? You may see
what it is; the good usage, and great famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
which you have had with them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hath made you contemptible in their
eyes. <hi>Anoint a villain, he will prick you:
prick a villain, and he will anoint you:</hi> Sa, sa,
sa,<note place="margin">Ungentem pungit, pungentem rusticus ungit.</note> (said <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> by St. <hi>Iames</hi> you have
given a true character of them. One thing
I will advise you (said <hi>Touquedillon,)</hi> we are
here but badly victualled, and furnished
with mouth-harnasse very slenderly: if <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>
should come to besiege us, I would
go presently, and pluck out of all your soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
heads and mine own all the teeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
three to each of us, and with them alone
we should make an end of our provision, but
too soon we shall have (said <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> but
too much sustenance and feeding-stuffe:
came we hither to eat or to fight? To fight
indeed (said <hi>Touquedillon,)</hi> yet from the
panch comes the dance, and where famine
rules force is exiled. Leave off your prating
(said <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> and forthwith seize upon
what they have brought. Then took they
money and cakes, oxen and carts, and sent
them away without speaking one word, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they would come no more so near,
for a reason that they would give them the
morrow after. Thus without doing any
thing, returned they to <hi>Grangousier,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41088:87"/>
the whole matter unto him, subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there was no hope left to draw
them to Peace, but by sharp and fierce
warres.</p>

him, because a noble and generous Prince
hath never a penny, and that to hoard up
treasure is but a clownish trick. The other
part of the Army in the mean time shall
draw towards <hi>Onys, Xaintouge, Angoulesme</hi>

By my faith (said he) we have played the

<hi>Iulian Augustus,</hi> with his whole Army died
there for thirst, as they say. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

the <hi>Sterlins,</hi> even unto the frozen sea;

From thence sailing through the sandie sea,

Turquieland,</hi> and are now at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
Come (said <hi>Picrochole,)</hi> let us go joyn
with them quickly, for I will be Emperour
of <hi>Trebezonde</hi> also: shall we not kill all these
dogs, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans?</hi> What a devil
should we do else, said they: and you shall
give their goods and lands to such as shall

have served you honestly: Reason (said he)
will have it so, that is but just, I give unto
you the <hi>Caramania, Surie,</hi> and all the <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi>
Ha, Sir, (said they) it is out of your
goodnesse; Grammercie, we thank you,
God grant you may alwayes prosper. There
was there present at that time an old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
well experienced in the warres, a sterne
souldier, and who had been in many great
hazards, named <hi>Echephron,</hi> who hearing this
discourse, said, I do greatly doubt that all
this enterprise will be like the tale or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
of the pitcher full of milk, wherewith a
Shoemaker made himself rich in conceit:
but when the pitcher was broken, he had
not whereupon to dine: what do you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by these large Conquests? what shall
be the end of so many labours and crosses?
Thus it shall be (said <hi>Picrochole)</hi> that when
we are returned, we shall sit down, rest and
be merry: But (said <hi>Echephron,)</hi> if by chance
you should never come back, for the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is long and dangerous, were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for us to take our rest now, then unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to expose our selves to so many
dangers? O (said Swashbuckler,) by G—
here is a good dotard, come let us go hide
our selves in the corner of a chimney, and
there spend the whole time of our life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Ladies, in threading of pearles, or
spinning like <hi>Sardanapalus:</hi> He that nothing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41088:90"/>
ventures, hath neither horse nor mule,
(sayes <hi>Salomon:)</hi> He who adventureth too
much (said <hi>Echephron)</hi> loseth both horse
and mule, answered <hi>Malchon.</hi> Enough (said
<hi>Picrochole,)</hi> go forward: I feare nothing,
but that these devillish legions of <hi>Grangou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
whilest we are in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> will
come on our backs, and charge up our
reer, what course shall we then take? what
shall be our remedy? A very good one; (said
<hi>Durtaille)</hi> a pretty little commission, which
you must send unto the <hi>Muscoviters,</hi> shall
bring you into the field in an instant
foure hundred and fifty thousand choise
men of warre; O that you would but make
me your Lieutenant General, I should
for the lightest faults of any inflict great
punishments. I fret, I charge, I strike, I
take, I kill, I slay, I play the devil.
On, on, (said <hi>Picrochole)</hi> make haste, my
lads, and let him that loves me, follow
me.</p>

who all three, the better to inable
them to go along with him took Post-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
the rest of his traine came after him by
even journeys at a slower pace, bringing
with them all his books and Philosophical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
assoon as he had alighted at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rille,</hi>
he was informed by a farmer of <hi>Gouget,</hi>
how <hi>Picrochole</hi> had fortified himself within
the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> and had sent Captain
<hi>Tripet</hi> with a great army to set upon the
wood of <hi>Vede</hi> and <hi>Vaugaudry,</hi> and that they
had already plundered the whole countrey,
not leaving cock nor hen, even as farre as to
the wine-presse of <hi>Billiard.</hi> These strange
and almost incredible newes of the enormous
abuses, thus committed over all the land, so
affrighted <hi>Gargantua,</hi> that he knew not what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41088:91"/>
to say nor do: but <hi>Ponocrates</hi> counselled him
to go unto the Lord of <hi>Vauguyon,</hi> who at
all times had been their friend and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and that by him they should be better
advised in their businesse: which they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently,
and found him very willing,
and fully resolved to assist them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was of opinion, that they should send
some one of his company, to scout along
and discover the countrey, to learn in what
condition and posture the enemy was, that
they might take counsel, and proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the present occasion. <hi>Gymnast</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to go; whereupon it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that for his safety, and the better expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he should have with him some one
that knew the wayes, avenues, turnings,
windings and rivers thereabout. Then away
went he and <hi>Prelingot,</hi> (the Querry or
Gentleman of <hi>Vauguyons</hi> horse,) who scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and espied as narrowly as they could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all quarters without any feare. In the
mean time <hi>Gargantua</hi> took a little refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ate somewhat himself, the like did
those who were with him, and caused to give
to his mare a <hi>Picotine</hi> of Oats, that is, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and fourteen quarters and three bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
<hi>Gymnast</hi> and his Camerade rode so long,
that at last they met with the enemies forces,
all scattered and out of order, plundering,
stealing, robbing and pillaging all they could
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41088:91"/>
lay their hands on: and as far off as they could
perceive him, they ran thronging upon the
back of one another in all haste towards him,
to unload him of his money, and untrusse his
Portmantles. Then cried he out unto them,
(My Masters,) I am a poor devil, I desire
you to spare me, I have yet one Crown left,
come, we must drink it; for it is <hi>aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi>
and this horse here shall be sold to pay
my welcome: afterwards take me for one
of your own; for never yet was there any
man that knew better how to take, lard, rost
and dresse, yea by G—to teare asunder
and devoure a hen, then I that am here: and
for my <hi>Proficiat</hi> I drink to all good fellowes.
With that he unscrued his <hi>Borracho,</hi> (which
was a great <hi>dutch</hi> leathern bottle,) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putting in his nose drank very honestly:
the <hi>marousle</hi> Rogues looked upon him, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their throats a foot wide, and putting
out their tongues like Greyhounds, in hopes
to drink after him: but Captain <hi>Tripet,</hi> in
the very nick of that their expectation, came
running to him to see who it was. To him
<hi>Gymnast</hi> offered his bottle, saying, Hold,
Captain, drink boldly and spare not; I have
been thy taster, it is wine of <hi>La fay monjau.</hi>
What? (said <hi>Tripet)</hi> this fellow gybes and
flowts us; Who art thou? (said <hi>Tripet)</hi> I am

Ha, (said <hi>Tripet)</hi> seeing thou art a poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,

it is reason that thou shouldest be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

killed Captain Tripet, and others of
Picrocholes men.</head>
                  <p>WHen they heard these words, some
amongst them began to be afraid,
and blest themselves with both hands, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed that he had been a devil disguised:
insomuch that one of them, named <hi>good
Ihon,</hi> Captain of the trained bands of the
Countrey bumpkins, took his Psalter out of
his Codpiece, and cried out aloud, <hi>Hagios ho
theos.</hi> If thou be of God speak: if thou be
of the other spirit avoid hence, and get thee
going: yet he went not away; which words
being heard by all the souldiers that were
there, divers of them being a little inwardly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41088:92"/>
terrified, departed from the place: all this
did <hi>Gymnast</hi> very well remark and consider,
and therefore making as if he would have
alighted from off his horse, as he was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself on the mounting side, he most
nimbly (with his short sword by his thigh,)
shifting his feet in the stirrup, performed the
stirrup-leather feat, whereby after the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his body downwards, he forthwith
lanch't himself aloft in the aire, and placed
both his feet together on the saddle, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upright with his back turned towards the
horses head; Now (said he) my case goes
backward. Then suddenly in the same ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
posture wherein he was, he fetched a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
upon one foot, and turning to the left
hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly
round, just into its former stance, without
misfing one jot. Ha (said <hi>Tripet,)</hi> I will not
do that at this time, and not without cause.
Well, (said <hi>Gymnast)</hi> I have failed, I will
undo this leap: then with a marvellous
strength and agility, turning towards the
right hand he fetch't another frisking
gambole, as before, which done, he set his
right hand thumb upon the hinde bowe of
the saddle, raised himself up, and sprung in
the aire, poysing and upholding his whole
body, upon the muscle and nerve of the
said thumb: and so turned and whirled
himself about three times: at the fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41088:93"/>
his body, and overturning it upside
down, and foreside back, without touching
any thing he brought himself betwixt the
horses two eares, springing with all his body
into the aire, upon the thumb of his left
hand; and in that posture turning like a
windmill, did most actively do that trick
which is called the Millers Passe. After this,
clapping his right hand flat upon the middle
of the saddle, he gave himself such a jerking
swing, that he thereby seated himself upon
the crupper, after the manner of Gentle-womens
sitting on horseback: this done, he
easily past his right leg over the saddle, and
placed himself like one that rides in croup:
But, said he, it were better for me to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the saddle; then putting the thumbs of
both hands upon the crupper before him,
and thereupon leaning himself, as upon the
only supporters of his body, he incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turned heels over head in the aire, and
streight found himself betwixt the bowe of
the saddle in a good settlement. Then with
a <hi>summer-sault</hi> springing into the aire again,
he fell to stand with both his feet close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the saddle, and there made above
a hundred frisks, turnes and demi-pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mads,
with his armes held out acrosse, and
in so doing, cried out aloud, I rage, I rage,
devils, I am stark mad; devils, I am mad, hold
me, devils, hold me, hold, devils, hold, hold.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41088:93"/>
Whilest he was thus vaulting, the Rogues
in great astonishment said to one another, By
cocks death he is a goblin or a devil thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised,
<hi>Ab hoste maligno libera nos, Domine,</hi>
and ran away in a ful flight, as if they had been
routed, looking now and then behinde them
like a dog that carrieth away a goose-wing
in his mouth. Then <hi>Gymnast</hi> spying his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
alighted from his horse, drew his
sword, &amp; laid on great blows upon the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and highest-crested amongst them, and
overthrew them in great heaps, hurt, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and bruised, being resisted by no body,
they thinking he had been a starved devil,
as well in regard of his wonderful feats in
vaulting, which they had seen, as for the talk
<hi>Tripet</hi> had with him, calling him poor devil:
only <hi>Tripet</hi> would have traiterously cleft his
head with his horsemans sword, or lanse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knight
fauchion; but he was well armed,

of the stroke; whereupon turning suddenly
about, he gave <hi>Tripet</hi> a home-thrust, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the back of that, whilest he was about to
ward his head from a slash, he in ran him at the
breast with a hit, which at once cut his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
the fifth gut called the <hi>Colon,</hi> and the
half of his liver, wherewith he fell to the

foure pottles of pottage, and his soule ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

This done, <hi>Gymnast</hi> withdrew himself,

                  <p>AS soon as he came, he related the estate
and condition wherein they had found
the enemie, and the stratagem which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
had used against all their multitude, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that they were but rascally rogues,
plunderers, thieves and robbers, ignorant of
all military discipline, and that they might
boldly set forward unto the field; it being
an easie matter to fell and strike them down
like beasts. Then <hi>Gargantua</hi> mounted his
great Mare, accompanied as we have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and finding in his way a high and great
tree, (which commonly was called by the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41088:94"/>
name of St. <hi>Martins</hi> tree, because heretofore
St. <hi>Martin</hi> planted a Pilgrims staffe there,
which in tract of time grew to that height and
greatnesse,) said, This is that which I lacked;
this tree shall serve me both for a staffe and
lance: with that he pulled it up easily, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off the boughs, and trimmed it at his
pleasure: in the mean time his Mare pissed
to ease her belly, but it was in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
that it did overflow the countrey
seven leagues, and all the pisse of that Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
flood, ran glib away towards the Ford of
<hi>Vede,</hi> wherewith the water was so swollen,
that all the Forces the enemy had there, were
with great horrour drowned, except some
who had taken the way on the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the hills. <hi>Gargantua</hi> being come to
the place of the wood of <hi>Vede,</hi> was informed
by <hi>Eudemon,</hi> that there was some remainder
of the enemy within the Castle, which to
know, <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out as loud as he was
able, Are you there, or are you not there? if
you be there, be there no more; and if you
be not there, I have no more to say. But a
ruffian gunner, whose charge was to attend
the Portcullis over the gate, let flie a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ball
at him, and hit him with that shot
most furiously on the right temple of his
head, yet did him no more hurt, then if he
had but cast a prune or kernel of a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grape
at him: What is this? (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:41088:95"/>
do you throw at us grape-kernels here? the
Vintage shall cost you dear, thinking indeed
that the bullet had been the kernel of a
grape, or raisin-kernel.</p>
                  <p>Those who were within the Castle, being
till then busie at the pillage, when they
heard this noise, ran to the towers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses,
from whence they shot at him above
nine thousand and five and twenty falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
and harcabusades, aiming all at his head,
and so thick did they shoot at him, that he
cried out, <hi>Ponocrates</hi> my friend, these flies
here are like to put out mine eyes, give me a
branch of those willow-trees to drive them
away, thinking that the bullets and stones
shot out of the great ordnance had been but
dunflies. <hi>Ponocrates</hi> looked and saw that
there were no other flies, but great shot
which they had shot from the Castle. Then
was it that he, rusht with his great tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Castle, and with mighty blowes
overthrew both towers and fortresses, and
laid all level with the ground, by which
meanes all that were within were slaine and
broken in pieces. Going from thence, they
came to the bridge at the Mill, where they
found all the Ford covered with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
so thick, that they had choaked up the
Mill, and stopped the current of its water,
and these were those that were destroyed in
the Urinal deluge of the Mare. There they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41088:95"/>
were at a stand, consulting how they might
passe without hinderance by these dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses.
But <hi>Gymnast</hi> said, If the devils have
past there, I will passe well enough. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
have past there (said <hi>Eudemon,)</hi> to carry
away the damned soules. By St. <hi>Rhenian</hi>
(said <hi>Ponocrates,)</hi> then by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
he shall passe there: Yes, yes, (said
<hi>Gymnastes)</hi> or I shall stick in the way: then set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
spurs to his horse, he past through free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his horse not fearing, nor being any
thing affrighted at the sight of the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for he had accustomed him (according
to the doctrine of <hi>Aelian)</hi> not to feare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
nor the carcasses of dead men; and
that not by killing men as <hi>Diomedes</hi> did the
<hi>Thracians,</hi> or as <hi>Ulysses</hi> did in throwing the
Corpses of his enemies at his horses feet, as
<hi>Homer</hi> saith, but by putting a Jack-a-lent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his hay, &amp; making him go over it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
when he gave him his oates. The
other three followed him very close, except
<hi>Eudemon</hi> only, whose horses foreright or
far forefoot, sank up to the knee in the
paunch of a great fat chuffe, who lay there
upon his back drowned, and could not get
it out: there was he pestered, until <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>
with the end of his staffe thrust down the
rest of the Villains tripes into the water,
whilest the horse pulled out his foot; and

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:41088:96"/>
the said horse was throughly cured of a

this touch of the burst guts of that great

a sallet.</head>
                  <p>THe story requireth, that we relate that
which happened unto six Pilgrims,
who came from <hi>Sebastian</hi> near to <hi>Nantes:</hi>
and who for shelter that night, being afraid
of the enemy, had hid themselves in the
garden upon the chichling pease, among the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41088:98"/>
cabbages and lettices. <hi>Gargantua</hi> finding
himself somewhat dry, asked whether they
could get any lettice to make him a sallet;
and hearing that there were the greatest
and fairest in the countrey (for they were
as great as plum-trees, or as walnut-trees) he
would go thither himself, and brought
thence in his hand what he thought good,
and withal carried away the six Pilgrims,
who were in so great feare, that they did not
dare to speak nor cough.</p>
                  <p>Washing them therefore first at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the Pilgrims said one to another soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
What shall we do? we are almost drowned
here amongst these lettice, shall we speak? but
if we speak, he will kill us for spies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as
they were thus deliberating what to do, <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi>
put them with the lettice into a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the house, as large as the huge tun of
the <hi>white Friars</hi> of the <hi>Cistertian</hi> order,
which done, with oile, vineger and salt he
ate them up, to refresh himself a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
supper: and had already swallowed up
five of the Pilgrims, the sixth being in the
platter, totally hid under a lettice, except
his <hi>bourdon</hi> or <hi>staffe</hi> that appeared, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else. Which <hi>Grangousier</hi> seeing, said
to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> I think that is the horne of a
shell-snail, do not eat it. Why not, (said <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua)</hi>
they are good all this moneth, which
he no sooner said, but drawing up the staffe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41088:98"/>
and therewith taking up the Pilgrim, he ate
him very well, then drank a terrible draught
of excellent white wine. The Pilgrims thus
devoured, made shift to save themselvs as wel
as they could, by withdrawing their bodies
out of the reach of the grinders of his teeth,
but could not escape from thinking they had
been put in the lowest dungeon of a prison.
And when <hi>Gargantua</hi> whiffed the great
draught, they thought to have been drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his mouth, and the flood of wine had
almost carried them away into the gulf of
his stomack. Neverthelesse skipping with
their bourdons, as St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Palmers use to
do, they sheltered themselves from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of that inundation, under the banks of
his teeth. But one of them by chance, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
or sounding the countrey with his
staffe, to try whether they were in safety or
no, struck hard against the cleft of a hollow
tooth, and hit the mandibulary sinew, or
nerve of the jaw, which put <hi>Gargantua</hi> to
very great pain, so that he began to cry for
the rage that he felt; to ease himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of his smarting ache, he called for his
tooth-picker, and rubbing towards a young
walnut-tree, where they lay skulking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestled
you my Gentlemen Pilgrims.</p>
                  <p>For he caught one by the legs, another
by the scrip, another by the pocket, another
by the scarf, another by the band of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41088:99"/>
breeches, and the poor fellow that had hurt
him with the bourdon, him he hooked to him
by the Codpiece, which snatch neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
did him a great deal of good, for it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto him a pockie botch he had in the
groine, which grievously tormented him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since they were past <hi>Ancenis.</hi> The
Pilgrims thus dislodged ran away athwart
the Plain a pretty fast pace, and the paine
ceased, even just at the time when by <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
he was called to supper, for all was ready.
I will go then (said he) and pisse away my
misfortune, which he did do in such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
measure, that the urine, taking away
the feet from the Pilgrims, they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
along with the stream unto the bank of a
tuft of trees: upon which, assoon as they
had taken footing, and that for their self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation
they had run a little out of the
road, they on a sudden fell all six, except
<hi>Fourniller,</hi> into a trap that had been made to
take wolves by a train: out of which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
they escaped by the industry of the
said <hi>Fourniller,</hi> who broke all the snares and
ropes. Being gone from thence, they lay all
the rest of that night in a lodge near unto
<hi>Coudry,</hi> where they were comforted in their
miseries, by the gracious words of one
of their company, called <hi>Sweertogo,</hi> who
shewed them that this adventure had been
foretold by the Prophet <hi>David, Psalm. Quum

let me clip thee (my heart) about the

the Porter of our Abbey then hath not his
head well-boyled, for his eyes are as red as
a mazer made of an elder-tree. The thigh of
this lerevet, is good for those that have the
gout. To the purpose of the truel, what
is the reason that the thighs of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
are alwayes fresh and coole: This
Probleme (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> is neither in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
in <hi>Alexander Aphrodiseus,</hi> nor in
<hi>Plutarch.</hi> There are three causes (said the
Monk) by which that place is naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed.
<hi>Primò,</hi> because the water runs all
along by it. <hi>Secundo,</hi> because it is a shadie
place, obscure and dark, upon which the Sun
never shines. And thirdly, because it is
continually flabbell'd, blown upon and aired
by the northwindes of the <hi>hole arstick,</hi> the
fan of the <hi>smock,</hi> and <hi>flipflap</hi> of the Codpiece.
And lustie my lads, some bousing liquour,
Page; so: <hi>Crack, crack, crack.</hi> O how good
is God that gives us of this excellent juice!
I call him to witnesse, if I had been in the
time of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> I would have kept him
from being taken by the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the garden

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41088:101"/>
have failed to cut off the hams of these
Gentlemen Apostles, who ran away so base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after they had well supped, and left their
good Master in the lurch. I hate that man
worse then poison that offers to run away,
when he should fight and lay stoutly about
him. Oh that I were but King of <hi>France</hi> for
fourescore or a hundred yeares! by G—I
should whip like curtail-dogs these run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes
of <hi>Pavie:</hi> A plague take them,
why did not they chuse rather to die there,
then to leave their good Prince in that pinch

and good fellowship of this Monk; for
he makes us here all merry. How is it then
that they exclude the <hi>Monks</hi> from all good

(said <hi>Maro) à praesepibus arcent.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
answered <hi>Gargantua,</hi> There is nothing
so true, as that the frock and cowle draw
unto it self the opprobries, injuries and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions
of the world, just as the winde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Cecias</hi> attracts the clouds: the perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41088:103"/>
to say, the sins of the people, and like dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewers
and excrementitious eaters, they are
cast into the privies and secessive places;
that is, the Covents and Abbeys separated
from Political conversation, as the jakes and
retreats of a house are: but if you conceive
how an Ape in a family is alwayes mocked,
and provokingly incensed, you shall easily
apprehend how Monks are shunned of all
men, both young and old. The Ape keeps
not the house as a dog doth: He drawes not
in the plow as the oxe: He yields neither
milk nor wooll as the sheep: He carrieth no
burthen as a horse doth; that which he doth,
is only to conskite, spoil and defile all, which
is the cause wherefore he hath of all men
mocks, frumperies and bastonadoes.</p>
                  <p>After the same manner a Monk (I mean
those lither, idle, lazie Monks) doth not labour
and work, as do the Peasant and Artificer:
doth not ward and defend the countrey, as
doth the man of warre: cureth not the sick
and diseased, as the Physician doth: doth
neither preach nor teach, as do the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doctors and Schoolmasters: doth not
import commodities and things necessary
for the Common-wealth, as the Merchant
doth: therefore is it, that by and of all men
they are hooted at, hated and abhorred.
Yea, but (said <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> they pray to
God for us. Nothing lesse, (answered <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentua.)</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:41088:103"/>
True it is, that with a tingle tangle
jangling of bells they trouble and disquiet
all their neighbours about them: Right, (said
the Monk,) a masse, a matine, a vespre well
rung are half said. They mumble out great
store of Legends and Psalmes, by them
not at all understood: they say many <hi>pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres,</hi>
interlarded with <hi>ave-maries,</hi> without
thinking upon, or apprehending the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what it is they say, which truly I call
mocking of God, and not prayers. But so
help them God, as they pray for us, and not
for being afraid to lose their victuals, their
manchots, and good fat pottage. All true
<hi>Christians,</hi> of all estates and conditions,
in all places and at all times send up their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God, and the Mediatour prayeth
and intercedeth for them, and God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to them. Now such a one is our good
<hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> therefore every man desireth to
have him in his company, he is no <hi>bigot</hi> or
hypocrite, he is not torne and divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
reality and appearance, no wretch of
a rugged and peevish disposition, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
jovial, resolute and a good fellow: he
travels, he labours, he defends the oppressed,
comforts the afflicted, helps the needie, and
keeps the close of the Abbey: Nay (said the
Monk) I do a great deal more then that; for
whilest we are in dispatching our matines
and anniversaries in the quire; I make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41088:104"/>
some crossebowe-strings, polish glasse-bottles
and boults; I twist lines and weave
purse-nets, wherein to catch coneys; I am
never idle; but now hither come, some
drink, some drink here, bring the fruit.
These chestnuts are of the wood of <hi>Estrox,</hi>
and with good new wine are able to make
you a fine cracker and composer of bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnets.
You are not as yet (it seems) well
moistened in this house with the sweet wine
and must, by G—I drink to all men
freely, and at all Fords like a Proctor or
Promoters horse. <hi>Friar Ihon,</hi> (said <hi>Gymnast)</hi>
take away the snot that hangs at your nose.
Ha, ha, (said the Monk,) am not I in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of drowning, seeing I am in water even
to the nose? No, no, <hi>quare? quia,</hi> though
some water come out from thence, there
never goes in any; for it is well antidoted
with pot-proof-armour, and sirrup of the
Vine-leaf.</p>
                  <p>O my friend, he that hath winter-boots
made of such leather, may boldly fish for
oysters, for they will never take water. What
is the cause (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> that <hi>Friar Ihon</hi>
hath such a faire nose? Because (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier)</hi>
that God would have it so, who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
us in such forme, and for such end, as
is most agreeable with his divine Will, even
as a Potter fashioneth his vessels. Because
(said <hi>Ponocrates)</hi> he came with the first to the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41088:104"/>
faire of noses, and therefore made choice
of the fairest and the greatest. Pish, (said
the Monk) that is not the reason of it, but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the true Monastical Philosophy,
it is because my Nurse had soft teats, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof, whilest she gave me suck, my
nose did sink in as in so much butter. The
hard breasts of Nurses make children short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosed.

                  <p>SUpper being ended, they consulted of
the businesse in hand, and concluded that
about midnight they should fall unawares
upon the enemie, to know what manner of
watch and ward they kept, and that in the
mean while they should take a little rest, the
better to refresh themselves. But <hi>Gargantua</hi>
could not sleep by any meanes, on which
side soever he turned him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf. Whereupon
the Monk said to him, I never sleep soundly,
but when I am at Sermon or Prayers; Let
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41088:105"/>
us therefore begin, you and I, the seven pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential
<hi>Psalmes,</hi> to try whether you shall
not quickly fall asleep. The conceit pleased
<hi>Gargantua</hi> very well, and beginning the first
of these <hi>Psalmes,</hi> assoon as they came to the
words <hi>Beati quorum,</hi> they fell asleep both
the one and the other. But the Monk for his
being formerly accustomed to the houre of
Claustral matines, failed not to awake a little
before midnight, and being up himself awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
all the rest, in singing aloud, and with a
full clear voice, the song,
<q>
                        <l>Awake, O <hi>Reinian;</hi> Ho, awake;</l>
                        <l>Awake, O <hi>Reinian,</hi> Ho:</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>When they were all rowsed and up, he
said, <hi>My Masters,</hi> it is a usual saying, that

                     </gap>ugh as
hard as we can. What? (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> to
drink so soon after sleep, this is not to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diet and prescript rule of the
Physicians, for you ought first to scoure and
cleanse your stomack of all its superfluities
and excrements. O well physicked, (said the
<hi>Monk)</hi> a hundred devils leap into my body,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41088:105"/>
if there be not more old drunkards, then
old Physicians: I have made this paction and
covenant with my appetite, that it alwayes

then the next morning it also riseth

so by taking this merry little breviary,
in the morning I scoure all my lungs, and

                  <p>After what manner (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> do

said the Monk, by three Psalmes, and three

for they are made for the man, and
not the man for them; therefore is it that I
make my Prayers in fashion of stirrup-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
I shorten or lengthen them when I

Then made they ready store of <hi>Carbonadoes,</hi>

what he pleased. Some kept him company,
and the rest did forbear, <hi>for their stomachs

man began to arme and befit himself for the
field; and they armed the <hi>Monk</hi> against his
will; for he desired no other armour for

weapon in his hand, but the staffe of the

                  <p>THus went out those valiant champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

to know what enterprise they should

horrible battel. And the <hi>Monk</hi> encouraged
them, saying, My children, do not feare nor
doubt, I will conduct you safely; God and
Sanct <hi>Benedict</hi> be with us. If I had strength
answerable to my courage, <hi>by Sdeath</hi> I would
plume them for you like ducks. I feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

a charm by way of Prayer, which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sexton
of our Abbey taught me, that will
preserve a man from the violence of guns,

but it will do me no good, because I
do not believe it. Neverthelesse, I hope my

pranks amongst them; by G—whoever

shrink when blowes are a dealing, I give my
self to the devil, if I do not make a Monk
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41088:107"/>
of him in my stead, and hamper him within
my frock, which is a sovereign cure against
cowardise. Did you never heare of my
Lord <hi>Meurles</hi> his grey-hound, which was
not worth a straw in the fields; he put a
frock about his neck, by the body of G—
there was neither hare nor fox that could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
him, and which is more, he lined all
the bitches in the countrey, though before
that he was feeble-reined, and <hi>ex frigidis &amp;
maleficiatis.</hi> The Monk uttering these
words in choler, as he past under a walnut-tree,
in his way towards the Causey, he
broached the vizor of his helmet, on the
stump of a great branch of the said tree: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse,
he set his spurres so fiercely to
the horse, who was full of mettal, and quick
on the spurre, that he bounded forwards, and
the Monk going about to ungrapple his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,
let go his hold of the bridle, and so
hanged by his hand upon the bough, whilest
his horse stole away from under him. By
this meanes was the Monk left, hanging on
the walnut-tree, and crying for help, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
murther, swearing also that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed:
<hi>Eudemon</hi> perceived him first, and
calling <hi>Gargantua,</hi> said, <hi>Sir,</hi> come and see

considered the countenance of the Monk,
and in what posture he hanged; wherefore he

him to <hi>Absalom;</hi> for <hi>Absalom</hi> hung

by the eares. Help me (said the Monk)
in the devils name, is this a time for you to
prate? you seem to me to be like the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talist
Preachers, who say, that whosoever
shall see his neighbour in the danger of
death, ought upon paine of trisulk excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
rather choose to admonish him
to make his Confession to a Priest, and put
his conscience in the state of Peace, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to help and relieve him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when I shall see them fallen
into a river, and ready to be drowned, I
shall make them a faire long sermon <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu
mundi, &amp; fuga seculi;</hi> and when
they are stark dead, shall then go to their
aide and succour in fishing after them: Be
quiet (said <hi>Gymnast,)</hi> and stirre not my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
I am now coming to unhang thee,
and to set thee at freedome, for thou art
a pretty little gentle <hi>Monachus; Monachus
in claustro non valet ova duo; sed quando est

five hundred hanged, but I never saw any
have a better countenance in his dangling

good a one, I would willingly hang thus all
my life-time; What? (said the Monk) have

with the other undid his vizor from the

                  <p>
                     <hi>PIcrochole</hi> at the relation of those who had
escaped out of the broile and defeat,

concluded his power to be such, that he
was able to defeat all the devils of hell, if
they should come to justle with his forces.
This <hi>Picrochole</hi> did not fully beleeve, though
he doubted not much of it: Therefore sent
he under the command and conduct of the
Count <hi>Draw-forth,</hi> for discovering of the
countrey, the number of sixteen hundred
horsemen, all well-mounted upon light hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for skirmish, and throughly besprinkled
with holy water; and every one for their
field-mark or cognizance had the signe of a
starre in his scarf, to serve at all adventures,
in case they should happen to incounter with
devils; that by the vertue, as well of that
<hi>Gregorian</hi> water, as of the starres which they
wore, they might make them disappear and
evanish.</p>
                  <p>In this equipage, they made an excursion
upon the countrey, till they came near to
the <hi>Vauguyon, (which is the valley of</hi> Guyon)
and to the spittle, but could never finde any
body to speak unto; whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
a little back, and took occasion to
passe above the aforesaid hospital, to try
what intelligence they could come by in
those parts, in which resolution riding on,
and by chance in a pastoral lodge, or shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41088:109"/>
cottage near to <hi>Coudray,</hi> hitting upon
the five Pilgrims, they carried them way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
and manacled, as if they had been
spies, for all the exclamations, adjurations
and requests that they could make. Being
come down from thence towards <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
they were heard by <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who
said then unto those that were with him,
Camerades and fellow souldiers, we have
here met with an encounter, and they are
ten times in number more then we: shall we
charge them or no? What a devil (said the
<hi>Monk)</hi> shall we do else? Do you esteem men
by their number, rather then by their valour
and prowes? With this he cried out, Charge,
<hi>devils,</hi> charge; which when the enemies
heard, they thought certainly that they had
been very devils, and therefore even then
began all of them to run away as hard as
they could drive, <hi>Draw-forth</hi> only excepted,
who immediately setled his lance on its
rest, and therewith hit the <hi>Monk</hi> with all
his force on the very middle of his breast, but
coming against his horrifick frock, the point
of the iron, being with the blow either broke
off or blunted, it was in matter of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if you had struck against an Anvil with
a little wax-candle.</p>
                  <p>Then did the <hi>Monk</hi> with his staffe of the
Crosse, give him such a sturdie thump and
whirret betwixt his neck and shoulders,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41088:109"/>
upon the <hi>Acromion</hi> bone, that he made him
lose both sense and motion, and fall down
stone dead at his horses feet; and seeing the
signe of the starre which he wore scarfwayes,
he said unto <hi>Gargantua,</hi> these men are but
Priests, which is but the beginning of a
Monk; by St. <hi>Ihon</hi> I am a perfect Monk,
I will kill them to you like flies: Then ran
he after them at a swift and full gallop, till
he overtook the reere, and felled them down
like tree-leaves, striking athwart and alongst
and every way. <hi>Gymnast</hi> presently asked
<hi>Gargantua</hi> if they should pursue them? To
whom <hi>Gargantua</hi> answered, by no means;
for, according to right military discipline,
you must never drive your enemy unto
despair, for that such a strait doth multiply
his force, and increase his courage, which
was before broken and cast down; neither
is there any better help, or outgate of relief
for men that are amazed, out of heart, toiled
and spent, then to hope for no favour at all.
How many victories have been taken out of
the hands of the Victors by the vanquished,
when they would not rest satisfied with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but attempt to put all to the sword, and
totally to destroy their enemies, without
leaving so much as one to carry home newes
of the defeat of his fellowes? Open there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unto your enemies all the gates and
wayes, and make to them a bridge of silver
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41088:110"/>
rather then faile, that you may be rid of
them. Yea, but (said <hi>Gymnast)</hi> they have the
<hi>Monk:</hi> Have they the <hi>Monk?</hi> (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi>
Upon mine honour then it will prove to their
cost: but to prevent all dangers, let us not yet
retreat, but halt here quietly, as in an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush;
for I think I do already understand
the policie and judgement of our enemies,
they are truly more directed by chance and
meer fortune, then by good advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
In the mean while, whilest these made
a stop under the walnut-trees, the <hi>Monk</hi>
pursued on the chase, charging all he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
and giving quarter to none, until he
met with a trouper, who carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him one of the poor Pilgrims, and
there would have rifled him. The Pilgrim,
in hope of relief at the sight of the <hi>Monk,</hi>
cried out, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my good
friend, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> save me, I beseech you,
save me; which words being heard by those
that rode in the van, they instantly faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and seeing there was no body but the
<hi>Monk</hi> that made this great havock &amp; slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
among them, they loded him with blows
as thick as they use to do an Asse with wood:
but of all this he felt nothing, especially
when they struck upon his frock, his skin was
so hard. Then they committed him to two
of the Marshals men to keep, and looking
about, saw no body coming against them,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41088:110"/>
whereupon they thought that <hi>Gergantua</hi> and
his Party were fled: then was it that they
rode as hard as they could towards the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees
to meet with them, and left the
<hi>Monk</hi> there all alone, with his two foresaid
men to guard him. <hi>Gargantua</hi> heard the
noise and neighing of the horses, and said to
his men, <hi>Camerades,</hi> I hear the track and
beating of the enemies horse-feet, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
perceive that some of them come in a
troupe and full body against us; let us rallie
and close here, then set forward in order,
and by this means we shall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their charge, to their losse and our
honour.</p>

                  <p>THe Monk seeing them break off thus
without order, conjectured that they
were to set upon <hi>Gargantua</hi> and those that
were with him, and was wonderfully grieved
that he could not succour them; then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
he the countenance of the two

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41088:111"/>
have willingly runne after the troops to get
some booty and plunder, and were alwayes
looking towards the valley unto which they
were going; farther, he syllogized, saying,
These men are but badly skilled in matters of
warre, for they have not required my paroll,
neither have they taken my sword from me;
suddenly hereafter he drew his brackmard or
horsemans sword, wherewith he gave the
keeper which held him, on the right side such
a sound slash, that he cut clean thorough the
<hi>jugularie</hi> veins, and the <hi>sphagitid</hi> or transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
arteries of the neck, with the fore-part
of the throat called the <hi>gargareon,</hi> even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the two <hi>Adenes,</hi> which are throat-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels;
and redoubling the blow, he opened
the <hi>spinal</hi> marrow betwixt the second and
third <hi>vertebrae;</hi> there fell down that keeper
stark dead to the ground. Then the <hi>Monk</hi>
reining, his horse to the left ranne upon the
other, who seeing his fellow dead, and the
<hi>Monk</hi> to have the advantage of him, cried
with a loud voice, Ha, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> quarter,
I yeeld, my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> quarter, quarter, my
good friend, my Lord <hi>Prior:</hi> and the <hi>Monk</hi>
cried likewise, My Lord <hi>Posterior,</hi> my friend,
my Lord <hi>Posterior,</hi> you shall have it upon
your <hi>posteriorums:</hi> Ha, said the keeper,
my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my Minion, my Gentile,

By the habit (said the <hi>Monk)</hi> which I weare, I

will here make you a Cardinal; what do you
use to pay ransomes to religious men? you
shall therefore have by and by a red hat of

ha, hes,</hi> no my Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> my good little
Lord the <hi>Prior,</hi> I yeeld, render and deliver
my self up to you: and I deliver thee (said
the <hi>Monk)</hi> to all the Devils in hell; then at
one stroak he struck off his head, cutting his
<hi>scalp</hi> upon the <hi>temple</hi>-bones, and lifting up
in the upper part of the <hi>scul</hi> the two triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie
bones called <hi>sincipital,</hi> or the two
bones <hi>bregmatis,</hi> together with the <hi>sagittal</hi>
commissure or dart-like seame which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
the right side of the head from the
left, as also a great part of the coronal or
forehead-bone, by which terrible blow like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he cut the two meninges or filmes which
inwrap the braine, and made a deep wound
in the braines two posterior ventricles, and
the <hi>cranium</hi> or <hi>skull</hi> abode hanging upon his
shoulders, by the skin of the <hi>pericranium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
in forme of a Doctors bonnet, black
without and red within. Thus fell he down
also to the ground stark dead.</p>
                  <p>And presently the Monk gave his horse
the spurre, and kept the way that the enemy
held, who had met with <hi>Gargantua</hi> and his
companions in the broad high-way, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41088:112"/>
were so diminished of their number, for the
enormous slaughter that <hi>Gargantua</hi> had made
with his great tree amongst them, as also
<hi>Gymnast, Ponocrates, Eudemon,</hi> and the rest,
that they began to retreat disorderly and in
great haste, as men altogether affrighted and
troubled in both sense and understanding;
and as if they had seen the very proper <hi>speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
and forme of death before their eyes; or
rather as when you see an Asse with a <hi>brizze</hi>
or gad-bee under his taile, or flie that stings
him, run hither and thither without keeping
any path or way, throwing down his load to
the ground, breaking his bridle and reines,
and taking no breath nor rest, and no man
can tell what ailes him, for they see not any
thing touch him: so fled these people desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of wit, without knowing any cause of
flying, onely pursued by a <hi>panick</hi> terror,
which in their mindes they had conceived.
The <hi>Monk</hi> perceiving that their whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to betake themselves to their heels,
alighted from his horse, and got upon a big
large rock, which was in the way, and with
his great <hi>Brackmard</hi> sword laid such load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those runawayes, and with maine strength
fetching a compasse with his arme without
feigning or sparing, flew and overthrew so
many, that his sword broke in two peces, then
thought he within himself that he had slaine
and killed sufficiently, and that the rest
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41088:112"/>
should escape to carry newes; therefore he
took up a battle-axe of those that lay there
dead, and got upon the rock againe, passing
his time to see the enemy thus flying, and
to tumble himself amongst the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
only that he suffered none to carry
Pike, Sword, Lance nor Gun with him, and
those who carried the Pilgrims bound, he
made to alight, and gave their horses unto
the said Pilgrims, keeping them there with
him under the hedge, and also <hi>Touchefaucet,</hi>
who was then his prisoner.</p>

for their refreshment: when all was

agrieved that the <hi>Monk</hi> was not to be heard
of, that he would neither eate nor drink: in

the gate of the outer Court cries out aloud,
<hi>Fresh wine, fresh wine Gymnast</hi> my friend. <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nast</hi>
went out and saw that it was Frier <hi>Ihon,</hi>
who brought along with him five Pilgrims
and <hi>Touch-faucet</hi> prisoners; whereupon <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi>
likewise went forth to meet him, and
all of them made him the best welcome that
possibly they could, and brought him before
<hi>Grangousier,</hi> who asked him of all his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
the <hi>Monk</hi> told him all, both how he was
taken, how he rid himself of his keepers, of
the slaughter he had made by the way, and
how he had rescued the Pilgrims, and

Then did they altogether fall to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
most merrily; in the meane time
<hi>Grangousier</hi> asked the Pilgrims what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
they were, whence they came, and

Yea, but said <hi>Grangousier,</hi> what went you to
do at Saint <hi>Sebastian?</hi> We went (said <hi>Sweer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togo)</hi>
to offer up unto that Sanct our vowes
against the Plague. Ah poor men (said <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier)</hi>
do you think that the Plague comes
from Saint <hi>Sebastian?</hi> Yes truly, (answered
<hi>Sweertogo)</hi> our Preachers tell us so indeed.
But is it so? (said <hi>Grangousier)</hi> do the false
Prophets teach you such abuses? do they
thus blaspheme the Sancts and holy men of
God, as to make them like unto the Devils,
who do nothing but hurt unto mankinde, as
<hi>Homer</hi> writeth, that the Plague was sent into
the camp of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Apollo,</hi> and as the

that Saint <hi>Antonie</hi> sent the fire into

(said they;) And how (said the <hi>Monk)</hi> doth

now you have hit it, let her be as ugly as ever

G—be over-turned, and get her skin-coat
shaken, if there dwell any Monks near to her,
for a good Carpenter will make use of any

(said the <hi>Monk)</hi> in their bullets of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
their habits and their bodies?</p>
                  <p>Then (said <hi>Grangousier,)</hi> Go your wayes,
poor men in the name of God the Creatour,
to whom I pray to guide you perpetually,
and henceforward be not so ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
these idle and unprofitable journeys;
Look to your families, labour every man in
his vocation, instruct your children, and
live as the good Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth
you: in doing whereof, God, his Angels
and Sancts will guard and protect you, and
no evil or plague at any time shall befal you.
Then <hi>Gargantua</hi> led them into the hall to
take their refection: but the Pilgrims did
nothing but sigh, and said to <hi>Gargantua,</hi> O
how happy is that land which hath such a
man for their Lord! we have been more
edified and instructed by the talk which he
hath had with us, then by all the Sermons
that ever were preached in our town. This
is (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> that which <hi>Plato</hi> saith,
<hi>lib. 5. de republ.</hi> That <hi>those Common-wealths
are happy, whose Rulers philosophate, and
whose Philosophers rule.</hi> Then caused he
their wallets to be filled with victuals, and
their bottles with wine, and gave unto each

together with some pence to live by.</p>

would have been more commendable in him
to have contained himself within the bounds

for these quarrelsome persons deserve rather
to be contemned then mentioned, especially
seeing I offered them satisfaction according
to the wrong. God shall be the just Judge
of our variances, whom I beseech by death
rather to take me out of this life, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my goods to perish and be destroyed
before mine eyes, then that by me or mine
he should in any sort be wronged. These
words uttered, he called the <hi>Monk,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all spoke thus unto him: <hi>Friar
Ihon,</hi> my good friend, is it you that took
prisoner the Captain <hi>Touchfaucet</hi> here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
Sir (said the Monk) seeing himself is
here, and that he is of the yeares of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I had rather you should know it by his
confession then by any words of mine. Then
said <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> My sovereign Lord, it is
he indeed that took me, and I do therefore
most freely yield my self his prisoner. Have
you put him to any ransom, said <hi>Grangousier</hi>
to the <hi>Monk?</hi> No, (said the <hi>Monk,)</hi> of that
I take no care: How much would you have
for having taken him? nothing, nothing,
(said the <hi>Monk,)</hi> I am not swayed by that,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41088:116"/>
nor do I regard it; Then <hi>Grangousier</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that in presence of <hi>Touchefaucet,</hi>
should be delivered to the Monk for taking
him, the summe of threescore and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
faults <hi>(in</hi> English <hi>money fifteen thousand
and five hundred pounds)</hi> which was done,
whilest they made a collation or little ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
to the said <hi>Touchfaucet,</hi> of whom <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gousier</hi>
asked, if he would stay with him, or
if he loved rather to return to his King?
<hi>Touchfaucet</hi> answered, that he was content
to take whatever course he would advise
him to; Then (said <hi>Grangousier)</hi> return
unto your King, and God be with you.</p>
                  <p>Then he gave him an excellent sword of
<hi>Avienue</hi> blade, with a golden scabbard
wrought with Vine-branch-like flourishes,
of faire Goldsmiths work, and a coller or
neck-chain of gold, weighing seven hundred
and two thousand marks <hi>(at eight ounces
each,)</hi> garnished with precious stones of the
finest sort, esteemed at a hundred and sixty
thousand ducats, and ten thousand crownes
more, as an honourable donative, by way of
present.</p>
                  <p>After this talk, <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> got to his
horse, and <hi>Gargantua</hi> for his safety allowed
him the guard of thirty men at armes, and
six score archers to attend him under the
conduct of <hi>Gymnast,</hi> to bring him even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the gate of the rock <hi>Clermond,</hi> if there
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41088:117"/>
were need. Assoon as he was gone, the
<hi>Monk</hi> restored unto <hi>Grangousier</hi> the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and two thousand saluts, which he had
received, saying, Sir it is not as yet the time
for you to give such gifts, stay till this warre
be at an end, for none can tell what accidents
may occurre, and war begun without good
provision of money before-hand for going
through with it, is but as a breathing of
strength, and blast that will quickly passe
away; coine is the sinews of warre. Well
then (said <hi>Grangousier)</hi> at the end I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you by some honest recompence, as
also all those who shall do me good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

for warre; The money, which by
the joynt agreement of them all was sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that they seemed rather to be a consort

                  <p>
                     <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> immediately after his return,

unto him at large all that he had done

him with strong and forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to capitulate and make an agreement
with <hi>Grangousier,</hi> whom he found to be the
honestest man in the world, saying further,
that it was neither right nor reason thus to
trouble his neighbours, of whom they had
never received any thing but good: and in
regard of the main point, that they should
never be able to go through stitch with that
warre, but to their great damage and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
for the forces of <hi>Picrochole</hi> were not
so considerable, but that <hi>Grangousier</hi> could
easily overthrow them.</p>
                  <p>He had not well done speaking, when <hi>Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calf</hi>
said out aloud, Unhappy is that Prince,
which is by such men served, who are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
corrupted, as I know <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> is; for
I see his courage so changed, that he had
willingly joyned with our enemies to fight
against us and betray us, if they would have
received him; but as vertue is of all, both
friends and foes, praised and esteemed, so is
wickednes soon known and suspected, and
although it happen the enemies to make use
thereof for their profit, yet have they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the wicked, and the traitors in abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Touchefaucet</hi> being at these words very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
drew out his sword, and therewith
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41088:119"/>
ran <hi>Rashcalf</hi> through the body, a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the nipple of his left side, whereof he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
presently, and pulling back his sword
out of his body, said boldly, <hi>So let him perish,
that shall a faithful servant blame. Picrochole</hi>
incontinently grew furious, and seeing
<hi>Touchefaucets</hi> new sword and his scabbard so
richly diapred with flourishes of most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
workmanship, said, Did they give thee
this weapon, so felloniously therewith to
kill before my face my so good friend <hi>Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calf?</hi>
then immediately commanded he his
guard to hew him in pieces, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
done, and that so cruelly, that the
chamber was all died with blood: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he appointed the corps of <hi>Rashcalf</hi> to
be honourably buried, and that of <hi>Touche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faucet,</hi>
to be cast over the walls into the
ditches.</p>
                  <p>The newes of these excessive violences
were quickly spread through all the Army;
wherupon many began to murmure against
<hi>Picrochole,</hi> insofarre that <hi>Pinchpennie</hi> said
to him, My sovereign Lord, I know not
what the issue of this enterprise will be;
I see your men much dejected, and not well
resolved in their mindes, by considering
that we are here very ill provided of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and that our number is already much
diminished by three or foure sallies. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
great supplies and recruits come

daily in to your enemies: but so moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <head type="sub">How Gargantua set upon Picrochole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the rock Clermond, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defeated the Army of the
said Picrochole.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GArgantua</hi> had the charge of the whole
Army, and his father <hi>Grangousier</hi> stayed
in his Castle, who encouraging them with
good words, promised great rewards unto
those that should do any notable service.
Having thus set forward, assoon as they had
gained the Passe at the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> with
boats and bridges speedily made, they past
over in a trice, then considering the situation
of the town, which was on a high and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
place, <hi>Gargantua</hi> thought fit to
call his counsel, and passe that night in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
upon what was to be done: But
<hi>Gymnast</hi> said unto him, My sovereign Lord,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:41088:120"/>
such is the nature and complexion of the
<hi>frenches,</hi> that they are worth nothing, but at
the first push, then are they more fierce then
devils; but if they linger a little, and be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with delays, they'l prove more faint and
remisse then women: my opinion is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that now presently after your men
have taken breath, and some small refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you give order for a resolute assault,
and that we storme them instantly. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was found very good, and for effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereof, he brought forth his army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the plain field, and placed the reserves on
the skirt or rising of a little hill. The <hi>Monk</hi>
took along with him six companies of foot,
and two hundred horsemen well armed, and
with great diligence crossed the marish, and
valiantly got up on the top of the green hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
even unto the high-way which leads to
<hi>Loudin.</hi> Whilest the assault was thus begun,
<hi>Picrocholes</hi> men could not tell well what was
best, to issue out and receive the Assailants, or
keep within the town and not to stirre: Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the mean time, without deliberation,
sallied forth in a rage with the cavalry of his
guard, who were forthwith received, and
royally entertained with great cannon-shot,
that fell upon them like haile from the high
grounds, on which the Artillery was plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
whereupon the <hi>Gargantuists</hi> betook
themselves unto the valleys, to give the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41088:120"/>
leave to play, and range with the
larger scope.</p>
                  <p>Those of the town defended themselves
as well as they could, but their shot past o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, without doing us any hurt at all;
Some of <hi>Picrocholes</hi> men that had escaped
our Artillery, set most fiercely upon our
souldiers, but prevailed little; for they were
all let in betwixt the files, and there knock't
down to the ground, which their fellow-souldiers
seeing, they would have retreated,
but the <hi>Monk</hi> having seised upon the Passe,
by the which they were to return, they run
away and fled in all the disorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that could be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Some would have pursued after them, and
followed the chase, but the <hi>Monk</hi> withheld
them, apprehending that in their pursuit the
Pursuers might lose their ranks, and so give
occasion to the besieged to sallie out of the
town upon them. Then staying there some
space, and none coming against him, he sent
the Duke <hi>Phrontist,</hi> to advise <hi>Gargantua</hi> to
advance towards the hill up on the left hand,
to hinder <hi>Picrocholes</hi> retreat at that gate,
which <hi>Gargantua</hi> did with all expedition, and
sent thither foure brigades under the conduct
of <hi>Sebast,</hi> which had no sooner reach't the top
of the hill, but they met <hi>Picrochole</hi> in the
teeth, and those that were with him scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:41088:121"/>
Then charged they upon them stoutly,
yet were they much indamaged by those
that were upon the walles, who galled them
with all manner of shot, both from the great
ordnance, small guns and bowes. Which
<hi>Gargantua</hi> perceiving, he went with a strong
Partie to their relief, and with his Artillery
began to thunder so terribly upon that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of the wall, and so long, that all the
strength within the town, to maintain and
fill up the breach, was drawn thither. The
<hi>Monk</hi> seeing that quarter which he kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
void of men and competent guards,
and in a manner altogether naked and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
did most magnanimously on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
lead up his men towards the Fort, and
never left it till he had got up upon it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that such as come to the reserve in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
bring with them alwayes more feare
and terrour, then those that deal about them
with their hands in the fight.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse he gave no alarm till all
his souldiers had got within the wall, except
the two hundred horsemen, who he left
without to secure his entry. Then did he give
a most horrible shout, so did all these who
were with him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d immediately thereafter
without resistance, putting to the edge of the
sword the guard that was at that gate, they
opened it to the horsemen, with whom most
furiously they altogether ran towards the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41088:121"/>
East-gate, where all the hurlie burlie was, and
coming close upon them in the reer, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
all their forces. The besieged see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>Gargantuists</hi> had won the town
upon them, and that they were like to be
secure in no corner of it, submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto the mercy of the <hi>Monk,</hi> and
asked for quarter, which the <hi>Monk</hi> very
nobly granted to them yet made them lay
down their armes; then shutting them up
within Churches, gave order to seise upon
all the staves of the Crosses, and placed men
at the doores to keep them from coming
forth; then opening that East-gate, he issued
out to succour and assist <hi>Gargantua:</hi> but <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochole,</hi>
thinking it had been some relief co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to him from the towne, adventured
more forwardly then before, and was upon
the giving of a most desperate home-charge,
when <hi>Gargantua</hi> cried out, Ha, Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi>
my friend, Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> you are come in a
good houre; which unexpected accident so
affrighted <hi>Picrochole</hi> and his men, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all for lost, they betook themselves to
their heels, and fled on all hands. <hi>Gargantua</hi>
chased them till they came near to <hi>Vaugau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,</hi>
killing and slaying all the way, and then
sounded the retreat.</p>

the <hi>Bouchard</hi> island, and in the way to

whereat he on a sudden was so incensed, that
he with his sword without more ado killed
him in his choler; then not finding any that
would remount him, he was about to have
taken an Asse at the Mill that was thereby:
but the Millers men did so baste his bones,
and so soundly bethwack him, that they
made him both black and blew with
strokes; then stripping him of all his
clothes, gave him ascurvie old canvas jacket
wherewith to cover his nakednesse. Thus
went along this poor cholerick wretch, who
passing the water at <hi>Porthuaux,</hi> and relating
his misadventurous disasters, was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by an old <hi>Lourpidon</hi> hag, that his
Kingdome should be restored to him at the
coming of the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> which she called
<hi>Coquecigrues.</hi> What is become of him since
we cannot certainly tell, yet was I told that

he is now a porter at <hi>Lyons,</hi> as testie and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

would be alwayes with great lamentation

the <hi>Cocklicranes,</hi> expecting assuredly, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old womans prophecie, that
at their coming he shall be re-established in
his Kingdom. The first thing <hi>Gargantua</hi>
did after his return into the town, was to
call the Muster-roll of his men, which when
he had done, he found that there were very
few either killed or wounded, only some few
foot of Captain <hi>Tolmeres</hi> company, and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi>
who was shot with a musket-ball
through the doublet. Then he caused them
all at and in their several posts and divisions
to take a little refreshment, which was very
plenteously provided for them in the best
drink and victuals that could be had for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and gave order to the Treasurers and
Commissaries of the Army, to pay for and
defray that repast, and that there should be
no outrage at all, nor abuse committed in the
town, seeing it was his own. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
commanded, that immediately after
the souldiers had done with eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that time sufficiently, and to their
own hearts desire, a gathering should be
beaten for bringing them altogether, to be
drawn up on the <hi>Piazza</hi> before the Castle,
there to receive six moneths pay compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41088:123"/>
all which was done. After this by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,

                  <p>Our forefathers and Ancestors of all

disposition, that upon the winning of a

and memorial of their triumphs and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to erect trophies and monuments in the
hearts of the vanquished by clemencie, then
by architecture in the lands which they had
conquered; for they did hold in greater esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

purchased by liberality, then the dumb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of arches, pillars and pyramides,
subject to the injury of stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,

yet was he in a set naval fight justly taken
and vanquished by my father, whom God
preserve and protect. But what? whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings and Emperours, yea those who
entitle themselves Catholiques, would have
dealt roughly with him, kept him a close pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and put him to an extream high ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som:
he intreated him very courteously,
lodged him kindly with himself in his own
Palace, and out of his incredible mildnesse
and gentle disposition sent him back with
a safe conduct, loaden with gifts, loaden
with favours, loaden with all offices of
friendship: what fell out upon it? Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into his countrey, he called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where all the Princes and States of
his Kingdom being assembled, he shewed
them the humanity which he had found in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41088:124"/>
us, and therefore wished them to take such
course by way of compensation therin, as that
the whole world might be edified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
as well of their honest graciousnesse
to us, as of our gracious honesty towards
them. The result hereof was, that it was
voted and decreed by an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that they should offer up entirely their
Lands, Dominions and Kingdomes, to be
disposed of by us according to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alpharbal</hi> in his own person, presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with nine thousand and thirty eight
great ships of burden, bringing with him the
treasures, not only of his house and royal
linage, but almost of all the countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
for he imbarking himself, to set saile
with a <hi>West-North-East</hi> winde, every one in
heaps did cast into the ship gold, silver, rings,
jewels, spices, drugs, and aromatical parfumes,
parrets, pelicans, monkies, civet-cats, black-spotted
weesils, porcupines, &amp;c. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
no good Mothers son, that did not
cast in all the rare and precious things he
had.</p>
                  <p>Being safely arrived, he came to my said
father, and would have kist his feet: that
action was found too submissively low, and
therefore was not permitted, but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
he was most cordially embraced: he
offfered his presents, they were not received,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41088:124"/>
because they were too excessive: he yielded
himself voluntarily a servant and vassal, and
was content his whole posterity should be
liable to the same bondage; this was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepred
of, because it seemed not equitable:
he surrendered by vertue of the decree of
his great Parliamentarie councel, his whole
Countreys and Kingdomes to him, offering
the Deed and Conveyance, signed, sealed
and ratified by all those that were concerned
in it; this was altogether refused, and the
parchments cast into the fire. In end, this
free good will, and simple meaning of the
<hi>Canarriens,</hi> wrought such tendernesse in my
fathers heart, that he could not abstain from
shedding teares, and wept most profusely:
then by choise words very congruously
adapted, strove in what he could to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the estimation of the good offices which
he had done them, saying, that any cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
he had conferred upon them, was not
worth a rush, and what favour soever he had
shewed them, he was bound to do it. But so
much the more did <hi>Alpharbal</hi> augment the
repute thereof. What was the issue? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
for his ransom in the greatest extremity of
rigour, and most tyrannical dealing, could
not have been exacted above twenty times
a hundred thousand crownes, and his eldest
sons detained as hostages, till that summe
had been payed, they made themselves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:41088:125"/>
tributaries, and obliged to give us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
year two millions of gold at foure and
twenty carats fine: The first year we received
the whole sum of two millions: the second
yeare of their own accord they payed freely
to us three and twenty hundred thousand
crowns: the third year six and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand; the fourth year three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and do so increase it alwayes out of their
own good will, that we shall be constrained
to forbid them to bring us any more. This
is the nature of gratitude and true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.
For time which gnawes and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
all things else, augments and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
benefits; because a noble action of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
done to a man of reason, doth gnaw
continually, by his generous thinking of it,
and remembring it.</p>
                  <p>Being unwilling therefore any way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
from the hereditary mildnesse and
clemency of my Parents; I do now forgive
you, deliver you from all fines and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments,

him to understand, that this warre was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
against my will, and without any
hope to increase either my goods or renown:
but seeing he is lost, and that no man can tell
where nor how he went away, it is my will
that his Kingdom remain entire to his sonne;
who because he is too young, (he not being
yet full five yeares old) shall be brought up
and instructed by the ancient Princes, and
learned men of the Kingdom. And because
a Realm thus desolate, may easily come to
ruine; if the covetousnesse and avarice of
those, who by their places are obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
justice in it, be not curbed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained:
I ordain and will have it so, that <hi>Pono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>

alwayes save and pardon every man: He
notwithstanding all this, did in certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
most rigorously punish the authors of

                  <p>THere was left onely the Monk to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for, whom <hi>Gargantua</hi> would have
made Abbot of <hi>Seville,</hi> but he refused it; he
would have given him the Abby of <hi>Bourgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eil,</hi>
or of Sanct <hi>Florent</hi> which was better, or
both, if it pleased him; but the Monk gave
him a very peremptory answer, that he
would never take upon him the charge nor
government of Monks; For how shall I be
able (said he) to rule over others, that have
not full power and command of my self: if
you think I have done you, or may hereafter
do any acceptable service, give me leave to
found an Abby after my owne minde and
fancie; the motion pleased <hi>Gargantua</hi> very
well, who thereupon offered him all the
Countrey of <hi>Tholem</hi> by the river of <hi>Loire,</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:41088:128"/>
till within two leagues of the great forrest of
<hi>Port-huaut:</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> then requested <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantua</hi>
to institute his religious order contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all others. First then (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi>
you must not build a wall about your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
for all other Abbies are strongly wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and mured about: See (said the <hi>Monk)</hi>
and not without cause <hi>(seeing wall and mure
signifie but one and the same thing;)</hi> where
there is <hi>Mur</hi> before, and <hi>Mur</hi> behinde, there
is store of <hi>Murmur,</hi> envie, and mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie.
Moreover, seeing there are certain
convents in the world, whereof the custome
is, if any woman come in (I mean chaste and
honest women) they immediately sweep the
ground which they have trod upon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it ordained that if any man or
woman entered into religious orders, should
by chance come within this new Abbey, all
the roomes should be throughly washed and
cleansed through which they had passed;
and because in all other Monasteries and
Nunneries all is compassed, limited, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by houres, it was decreed that in this
new structure there should be neither Clock
nor Dial, but that according to the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and incident occasions, all their hours
should be disposed of; for (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi>
The greatest losse of time that I know, is to
count the hours, what good comes of it? nor
can there be any greater dotage in the world,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41088:128"/>
then for one to guide and direct his courses
by the sound of a Bell, and not by his owne
judgement and discretion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> Because at that time they put no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into Nunneries, but such as were either
purblinde, blinkards, lame, crooked, ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
mis-shapen, fooles, senselesse, spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or corrupt; nor encloystered any men, but
those that were either sickly, subject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions,
ill-bred lowts, simple sots, or pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
trouble-houses: but to the purpose; (said
the <hi>Monk)</hi> A woman that is neither faire nor
good, to what use serves she? To make a
Nunne of, said <hi>Gargantua:</hi> Yea said the
<hi>Monk)</hi> and to make shirts and smocks; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it ordained that into this religious
order should be admitted no women that
were not faire, well featur'd, and of a sweet
disposition; nor men that were not comely,
personable and well conditioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> Because in the convents of women
men come not but under-hand, privily, and
by stealth; it was therefore enacted that in
this house there shall be no women in case
there be not men, nor men in case there be
not women.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> Because both men and women that are
received into religious orders after the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their noviciat or probation-year, were
constrained and forced perpetually to stay
there all the days of their life; it was therfore
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41088:129"/>
ordered, that all whatever, men or women,
admitted within this Abbey, should have full
leave to depart with peace and contentment,
whensoever it should seem good to them so
to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> for that the religious men and women
did ordinarily make three Vows, to wit, those
of chastity, poverty &amp; obedience, it was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
constituted and appointed, that in this
Convent they might be honourably marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they might be rich, and live at liberty.
In regard of the legitimat time of the persons
to be initiated, and years under and above,
which they were not capable of reception,
the women were to be admitted from ten till
fifteen, and the men from twelve til eighteen.</p>

<hi>Gargantua</hi> caused to be delivered
out in ready money seven and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand, eight hundred and one and
thirty of those golden rams of <hi>Berrie,</hi> which
have a sheep stamped on the one side, and a
flowred crosse on the other; and for every
yeare, until the whole work were compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he allotted threescore nine thousand
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41088:129"/>
crowns of the Sunne, and as many of the
seven starres, to be charged all upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit

maintenance thereof for ever, he setled a
perpetual fee-farm-rent of three and twenty
hundred, threescore and nine thousand, five
hundred and fourteen rose nobles, exempted
from all homage, fealty, service or burden
whatsoever, and payable every yeare at the
gate of the Abbey; and of this by letters pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
passed a very good grant. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
was in a figure hexagonal, and in
such a fashion, that in every one of the six
corners there was built a great round tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of threescore foot in diameter, and were
all of alike forme and bignesse. Upon the
north-side ran along the river of <hi>Loire,</hi> on
the bank whereof was situated the tower
called <hi>Arctick:</hi> going towards the East,
there was another called <hi>Calaer,</hi> the next
following <hi>Anatole;</hi> the next <hi>Mesembrine:</hi>
the next <hi>Hesperia,</hi> and the last <hi>Criere.</hi> Every
tower was distant from other the space of
three hundred and twelve paces. The whole
Aedifice was every where six stories high,
reckoning the Cellars under ground for
one: the second was arched after the fashion
of a basket-handle; the rest were seeled with
pure wainscot, flourished with <hi>Flanders</hi> fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
in the forme of the foot of a lamp:
and covered above with fine slates, with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41088:130"/>
an indorsement of lead, carrying the antick
figures of little puppets, and animals of all
sorts, notably well suited to one another,
and guilt, together with the gutters, which
jetting without the walls, from betwixt the
crosse barres in a diagonal figure, painted
with gold and azur, reach'd to the very
ground, where they ended into great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-pipes,
which carried all away unto the
river from under the house.</p>
                  <p>This same building was a hundred times
more sumptuous and magnificent then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was <hi>Bonnivet, Chambourg</hi> or <hi>Chantillie;</hi>
for there were in it nine thousand, three
hundred and two and thirty chambers, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one whereof had a withdrawing room,
a handsom closet, a wardrobe, an oratory,
and neat passage, leading into a great and
spacious hall. Between every tower, in the
midst of the said body of building, there
was a paire of winding <hi>(such as we now call
lantern)</hi> staires, whereof the steps were part
of Porphyrie, <hi>(which is a dark red marble,
spotted with white,)</hi> part of <hi>Numidian</hi> stone,
<hi>(which is a kinde of yellowishly streaked marble
upon various colours,)</hi> and part of <hi>Serpentine</hi>
marble, <hi>(with light spots on a dark green

twenty foot in length, and three fingers thick,
and the just number of twelve betwixt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rest, or (as we now terme it) landing

antick arches where the light came in: and
by those they went into a Cabinet, made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with and of the bredth of the said wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the re-ascending above the roofs
of the house, ended <hi>conically</hi> in a pavillion:
By that vize or winding, they entered on
every side into a great hall, and from the
halls into the chambers; from the <hi>Arctick</hi>
tower unto the <hi>Criere,</hi> were the faire great
libraries in <hi>Greek, Latine, Hebrew, French, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi>
and <hi>Spanish,</hi> respectively distributed
in their several cantons, according to the
diversity of these languages. In the midst
there was a wonderful scalier or winding-staire,
the entry whereof was without the
house, in a vault or arch six fathom broad.
It was made in such symmetrie and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that six men at armes with their lances
in their rests, might together in a breast ride
all up to the very top of all the Palace; from
the tower <hi>Anatole</hi> to the <hi>Mesembrine</hi> were
faire spacious galleries, all coloured over and
painted with the ancient prowesses, histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and descriptions of the world. In the

                  <head type="sub">What manner of dwelling the Thele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
had.</head>
                  <p>IN the middle of the lower Court there
was a stately fountain of faire Alabaster;
upon the top thereof stood the three Graces,
with their <hi>cornucopias,</hi> or hornes of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and did jert out the water at their
breasts, mouth, eares, eyes, and other open
passages of the body; the inside of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in this lower Court stood upon great
pillars of <hi>Cassydonie</hi> stone, and <hi>Porphyrie</hi>
marble, made arch-wayes after a goodly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
fashion. Within those were spacious
galleries, long and large, adorned with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
pictures, the hornes of Bucks and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41088:133"/>
with <hi>Rhinoceroses,</hi> water-horses cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hippopotames,</hi> the teeth and tusks of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and other things well worth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding.
The lodging of the Ladies <hi>(for so
we may call those gallant women)</hi> took up all
from the tower <hi>Arctick</hi> unto the gate <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembrine:</hi>
the men possessed the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the said lodging of the Ladies, that they
might have their recreation between the
two first towers. On the out-side were
placed the tilt-yard, the barriers or lists for
turnements, the <hi>hippodrome</hi> or riding Court,
the <hi>theater</hi> or publike play-house, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorie</hi>
or place to swim in, with most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
bathes in three stages, situated above
one another, well furnished with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
accommodation, and store of myrtle-water.
By the river-side was the faire garden
of pleasure: and in the midst of that the
glorious labyrinth. Between the two other
towers were the Courts for the tennis and
the baloon. Towards the tower <hi>Criere</hi> stood
the Orchard full of all fruit-trees, set and
ranged in a <hi>quincuncial</hi> order. At the end
of that was the great Park, abounding with
all sort of Venison. Betwixt the third
couple of towers were the buts and marks
for shooting with a snap work-gun, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
bowe for common archery, or with a
Crosse-bowe. The office-houses were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the tower <hi>Hesperie,</hi> of one story high.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41088:134"/>
The stables were beyond the offices, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them stood the falconrie, managed by
Ostridge-keepers and Falconers, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
in the Art, and it was yearly supplied
and furnished by the <hi>Candians, Venetians,
Sarmates</hi> (now called <hi>Moscoviters)</hi> with all
sorts of most excellent hawks, <hi>eagles, gerfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
gosehawkes, sacres, lanners, falcons,
sparrowhawks, Marlins,</hi> and other kindes of
them, so gentle and perfectly well manned,
that flying of themselves sometimes from
the Castle for their own disport, they would
not faile to catch whatever they encountred.
The Venerie where the Beagles and Hounds
were kept, was a little farther off drawing
towards the Park.</p>
                  <p>All the halls, chambers, and closets or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,
were richly hung with tapestrie, and
hangings of divers sorts, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the seasons of the year. All the
pavements and floors were covered with
green cloth: the beds were all embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:
in every back-chamber or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
room there was a looking-glasse
of pure crystal set in a frame of fine gold,
garnished all about with pearles, and was of
such greatnesse, that it would represent to
the full the whole lineaments and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the person that stood before it. At
the going out of the halls, which belong to
the Ladies lodgings, were the perfumers and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41088:134"/>
trimmers, through whose hands the gallants
past when they were to visit the Ladies;
those sweet Artificers did every morning
furnish the Ladies chambers with the spirit
of roses, orange-flower-water and <hi>Angelica;</hi>
and to each of them gave a little precious
casket vapouring forth the most odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
exhalations of the choicest aromatical
sents.</p>

crimson, or ingrained purple die, which
reached just three inches above the knee,
having a list beautified with exquisite em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries,
and rare incisions of the Cutters

their bracelets, and circled the knee a little,
both over and under. Their shoes, pumps

                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:41088:135"/>
Next to their smock they put on the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
kirtle or vasquin of pure silk chamlet:
above that went the taffatie or tabie vardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,
of white, red, tawnie, gray, or of any
other colour; Above this taffatie petticoat
they had another of cloth of tissue or broca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
embroidered with fine gold, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
with needle-work, or as they thought
good, and according to the temperature and
disposition of the weather, had their upper
coats of sattin, damask or velvet, and those
either orange, tawnie, green, ash-coloured,
blew, yelow, bright, red, crimson or white, and
so forth; or had them of cloth of gold, cloth
of silver, or some other choise stuffe, inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with purle, or embroidered according to
the dignity of the festival dayes and times
wherein they wore them.</p>
                  <p>Their gownes being still correspondent to
the season, were either of cloth of gold friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a silver-raised work; of red sattin,

white, blew, black, tawnie, &amp;c. of silk

overcast with golden threads, in divers vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

                  <p>In summer some dayes in stead of gowns

of the stuffe of the aforesaid attire, or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41088:135"/>
like <hi>Moresco</hi> rugs, of violet, velvet frizled,
with a raised work of gold upon silver purle:
or with a knotted cord-work of gold em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderie,
every where garnished with little
<hi>Indian</hi> pearles. They alwayes carried a faire
<hi>Pannache,</hi> or plume of feathers, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of their muffe, bravely adorned and
tricked out with glistering spangles of gold,
In the winter-time they had their taffatie
gownes of all colours, as above-named: and
those lined with the rich furrings of hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolves,
or speckled linxes, black-spotted
weesils, martlet-skins of <hi>Calabria,</hi> sables,
and other costly furres of an inestimable
value. Their beads, rings, bracelets, collars,
carcanets and neck-chaines were all of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, such as carbuncles, rubies, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,
diamonds, saphirs, emeralds, turkoises,
garnets, agates, berilles, and excellent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garits.
Their head-dressing also varied with
the season of the yeare, according to which
they decked themselves. In winter it was of
the <hi>French</hi> fashion, in the spring of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish:</hi>
in summer of the fashion of <hi>Tuscanie,</hi>
except only upon the holy dayes and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
at which times they were accoutred in
the <hi>French</hi> mode, because they accounted it
more honourable, and better befitting the
garb of a matronal pudicity.</p>
                  <p>The men were apparelled after their fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
their stockins were of tamine or of cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serge,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41088:136"/>
of white, black, scarlet, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ingrained colour: their breeches were
of velvet, of the same colour with their
stockins, or very near, embroidered and cut
according to their fancy: their doublet was
of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of velvet,
sattin, damask, taffaties, &amp;c. of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
cut, embroidered, and suitably trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

silk of the same colours; the tags were of
gold well enameled: their coats and jerkins
were of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, gold,
tissue or velvet embroidered, as they
thought fit: their gownes were every whit
as costly as those of the Ladies: their girdles
were of silk, of the colour of their doublets:
every one had a gallant sword by his side,
the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and
the scabbard of velvet, of the colour of his
breeches, with a chape of gold, and pure
Goldsmiths work: the dagger was of the
same: their caps or bonnets were of black
velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of
gold: upon that they wore a white plume,
most prettily aud minion-like, parted by so
many rowes of gold spangles, at the end
whereof hung dangling in a more sparkling
resplendencie faire rubies, emeralds, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
&amp;c. but there was such a sympathy
betwixt the gallants &amp; the Ladies, that every
day they were apparelled in the same livery:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41088:136"/>
and that they might not misse, there were
certain Gentlemen appointed to tell the
youths every morning what vestments the
Ladies would on that day weare; for all
was done according to the pleasure of the
Ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliaments
so rich, think not that either one
or other of either sexe did waste any time
at all; for the Masters of the wardrobes had
all their raiments and apparel so ready for
every morning, and the chamber-Ladies so
well skilled, that in a trice they would be
dressed, and compleatly in their clothes
from head to foot. And to have those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements
with the more conveniency;
there was about the wood of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>leme</hi> a row
of houses of the extent of half a league, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the
Goldsmiths, Lapidaries, Jewellers, Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
Tailors, Gold-drawers, Velvet-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Tapestrie-makers and Upholsters, who
wrought there every one in his own trade,
and all for the aforesaid jollie Friars and
Nuns of the new stamp; they were furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with matter and stuffe from the hands of
the Lord <hi>Nausiclete,</hi> who every year brought
them seven ships from the <hi>Perlas</hi> &amp; <hi>Cannibal</hi>-islands,
laden with ingots of gold, with raw
silk, with pearles and precious stones. And if
any <hi>margarites</hi> (called <hi>unions)</hi> began to grow
old, and lose somewhat of their natural
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41088:137"/>
whitenesse and lustre, those with their Art
they did renew, by tendering them to eat
to some pretty cocks, as they use to give
casting unto hawkes.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How the Thelemites were governed, and of
their manner of living.</head>
                  <p>ALL their life was spent not in lawes, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
or rules, but according to their
own free will and pleasure. They rose out
of their beds, when they thought good:
they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they
had a minde to it, and were disposed for it.
None did awake them, none did offer to
constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any
other thing; for so had <hi>Gargantua</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. In all their rule, and strictest tie of
their order, there was but this one clause to
be observed.</p>
                  <q>Do what thou wilt.</q>
                  <p>Because men that are free, well-borne,
well-bred, and conversant in honest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
have naturally an instinct and spurre
that prompteth them unto vertuous actions,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41088:137"/>
and withdraws them from vice, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>honour.</hi> Those same men, when by base
subjection and constraint they are brought
under and kept down, turn aside from that
noble disposition, by which they formerly
were inclined to vertue, to shake off and
break that bond of servitude, wherein they
are so tyrannously inslaved; for it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the nature of man to long after
things forbidden, and to desire what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us.</p>
                  <p>By this liberty they entered into a very
laudable emulation, to do all of them what
they saw did please one; if any of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
or Ladies should say, <hi>Let us drink,</hi>
they would all drink: if any one of them
said, <hi>Let us play,</hi> they all played; if one
said, <hi>Let us go a walking into the fields,</hi> they
went all: if it were to go a hawking or a
hunting, the Ladies mounted upon dainty
well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey
saddle, carried on their lovely fists miniard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begloved every one of them, either a
Sparhawk, or a Laneret, or a Marlin, and
the young gallants carried the other kinds of
Hawkes: so nobly were they taught, that
there was neither he nor she amongst them,
but could read, write, sing, play upon several
musical instruments, speak five or sixe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
languages, and compose in them all very
quaintly, both in Verse and Prose: never
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41088:138"/>
were seene so valiant Knights, so noble and
worthy, so dextrous and skilful both on foot
and a horseback, more brisk and lively, more
nimble and quick, or better handling all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of weapons then were there. Never were
seene Ladies so proper and handsome, so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
and dainty, lesse froward, or more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with their hand, and with their needle, in
every honest and free action belonging to
that sexe then were there: for this reason
when the time came, that any man of the said
Abbey, either at the request of his parents,
or for some other cause, had a minde to go
out of it, he carried along with him one of the
Ladies, namely her whom he had before
that chosen for his Mistris, and were married
together: and if they had formerly in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme</hi>
lived in good devotion and amity, they
did continue therein and increase it to a
greater height in their state of matrimony:
and did entertaine that mutual love till the
very last day of their life, in no lesse vigour
and fervency, then at the very day of their
wedding: here must not I forget to set down
unto you a riddle, which was found under the
ground, as they were laying the foundation
of the Abbey, ingraven in a copper plate;
and it was thus as followeth.</p>

                     <l>And children their own Parents, in a Word</l>
                     <l>All reverence shall then be banished:</l>

                  <p>No sooner was this aenigmatical monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

very deep sigh, said unto those that stood
by, It is not now only (I perceive) that
People called to the faith of the Gospel,
and convinced with the certainty of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
truths are persecuted; but happy is that
man that shall not be scandalized, but shall
alwayes continue to the end, in aiming at
that mark, which God by his dear Son hath
set before us, without being distracted or
diverted by his carnal affections and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Monk</hi> then said, What do you think in
your conscience is meant and signified by
this riddle? What? (said <hi>Gargantua)</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
and carrying on of the divine truth.
By St. <hi>Goderan</hi> (said the <hi>Monk)</hi> that is not my
exposition; it is the stile of the Prophet <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:</hi>
make upon it as many grave allegories
and glosses as you will, and dote upon it
you and the rest of the world as long as you
please: for my part, I can conceive no other
meaning in it, but a description of a set at
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:41088:140"/>
tennis in dark and obscure termes. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners
of men are the Makers of matches,
which are commonly friends. After the
two chases are made, he that was in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end of the tennis-court goeth out, and
the other cometh in. They beleeve the
first, that saith the ball was over or under
the line. The waters are the heats that the
players take till they sweat again. The cords
of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep
or goats. The Globe terrestrial is the tennis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.
After playing, when the game is done,
they refresh themselves before a clear fire,
and change their shirts: and very willingly
they make all good cheer, but most merrily
those that have gained; And so farewel.</p>

the charging of the whole Impression with it,

with so much ingeniositie, and wit, that
more impressions have been sold thereof in that

set forth at any time, within these fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

faithfully undertaken with the same hand to be
rendered into <hi>English</hi> by a <hi>Person of quality,</hi>
who (though his lands be sequestred, his house
garrisoned, his other goods sold, and himself
detained a Prisoner of warre at <hi>London,</hi> for
his having been at <hi>Worcester</hi> fight) hath,
at the most earnest intreaty of some of his
especial friends, well acquainted with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to the performance of conducible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
promised, besides his version of these
two already published, very speedily to offer up
unto this Isle of <hi>Britaine,</hi> the virginity of the
Translation of the other three most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
books of the aforesaid Author; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that by the plurality of judicious and
understanding men it be not declared, he hath
already proceeded too farre, or that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the rigour whereby he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
of all his both real and personal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
by pressing too hard upon him, be not
an impediment thereto, and to other more
eminent undertakings of his, as hath beene
oftentimes very fully mentioned by the said
<hi>Translatour,</hi> in several original Treatises
of his own penning, lately by him so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb facs="tcp:41088:144"/>
dispersed, that there is scarce any,
who being skilful in the <hi>English</hi> Idiome,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Illustrious and thrice valour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Champions, Gentlemen
and others, who willingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
your mindes to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of pretty conceits,
and honest harmlesse knacks of
wit: You have not long ago seen, read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the great and inestimable Chronicle of
the huge and mighty Gyant <hi>Gargantua,</hi> and like
upright Faithfullists, have firmly beleeved all
to be true that is contained in them, and have
very often past your time with them, amongst
Honourable Ladies and Gentlewomen, telling
them faire long stories, when you were out of
all other talk, for which you are worthy of great
praise and sempiternal memory: and I do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish that every man would lay aside his
own businesse, meddle no more with his Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor Trade, and throw all affaires concerning
himself behinde his back, to attend this wholly,
without distracting or troubling his minde
<pb facs="tcp:41088:146"/>
with any thing else, until he have learned
them without book; that if by chance the Art
of printing should cease, or in case that in time
to come all books should perish, every man might
truly teach them unto his children, and deliver
them over to his successors and survivors from
hand to hand, as a religious <hi>Cabal;</hi> for there
is in it more profit, then a rabble of great pockie
Loggerheads are able to discern, who surely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
far lesse in these little merriments, then
the foole <hi>Raclet</hi> did in the institutions of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have known great and mighty Lords, and
of those not a few, who going a Deer-hunting,
or a hawking after wilde Ducks, when the chase
had not encountred with the blinks, that were
cast in her way to retard her course, or that the
Hawk did but <hi>plaine</hi> and smoothly fly without
moving her wings, perceiving the prey by force
of flight to have gained bounds of her, have
been much chafed and vexed, as you understand
well enough; but the comfort unto which they
had refuge, and that they might not take cold,
was to relate the inestimable deeds of the said
<hi>Gargantua.</hi> There are others in the world,
(These are no flimflam stories, nor tales of a
tub) who being much troubled with the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache,
after they had spent their goods upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
without receiving at all any ease of their
pain, have found no more ready remedy, then to
put the said <hi>Chronicles</hi> betwixt two pieces of
<pb facs="tcp:41088:147"/>
linnen cloth made somewhat hot, and so apply
them to the place that smarteth, synapising
them with a little powder of projection, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
called <hi>doribus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what shall I say of those poor men, that
are plagued with the Pox and the Gowt? O
how often have we seen them, even immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after they were anointed and throughly greased,
till their faces did glister like the Key-hole of a
powdering tub, their teeth dance like the jacks
of a paire of little Organs or Virginals, when
they are played upon, and that they foamed from
their very throats like a boare, which the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel
Mastiffe-hounds have driven in, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
amongst the foyles: what did they then?</p>
                  <p>All their consolation was to have some page
of the said Roll-book read unto them: and we
have seen those who have given themselves to
a hundred punchions of old devils, in case that
they did not feele a manifest ease and asswage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of paine, at the hearing of the said book
read, even when they were kept in a purgatory
of torment; no more nor lesse then women in
travel use to finde their sorrow abated, when the
life of St. <hi>Margarite</hi> is read unto them: is this
nothing? finde me a book in any language, in
any faculty or science whatsoever, that hath such
vertues, properties and prerogatives, and I
will be content to pay you a quart of tripes. No,
my Masters, no, it is peerlesse, incomparable,
and not to be matched; and this am I resolved
<pb facs="tcp:41088:147"/>
for ever to maintaine even unto the fire <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive.</hi>
And those that will pertinaciously
hold the contrary opinion, let them be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Abusers, Predestinators, Impostors and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
of the People; it is very true, that there
are found in some gallant and stately books, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of high estimation, certain occult and hid
properties; in the number of which are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Whippot, Orlando furioso, Robert the
devil, Fierabras, William without feare, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Bourdeaux, Monteville,</hi> and <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune:</hi>
but they are not comparable to that
which we speak of; and the world hath well
known by infallible experience, the great emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and utility which it hath received by this
<hi>Gargantuine</hi> Chronicle; for the Printers have
sold more of them in two moneths time, then
there will be bought of Bibles in nine yeares.</p>

willing to increase your solace and recreation yet
a little more, do offer you for a Present another

                  <p>I know that reading this passage, you will
make a doubt within your selves, and that
grounded upon very good reason: which is
this, how it is possible that this relation can
be true, seeing at the time of the flood all
the world was destroyed, except <hi>Noah,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41088:152"/>
seven persons more with him in the Ark, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose number <hi>Hurtali</hi> is not admitted;
doubtlesse the demand is well made, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apparent, but the answer shall satisfie you,
or my wit is not rightly caulked: and because
I was not at that time to tell you any thing
of my own fancie, I will bring unto you the
authority of the <hi>Massorets,</hi> good honest fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
true <hi>ballokeering</hi> blades, and exact <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braical</hi>
bagpipers, who affirm that verily the
said <hi>Hurtali</hi> was not within the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi>
(neither could he get in, for he was too big)
but he sate astride upon it, with one leg on
the one side, and another on the other, as little
children use to do upon their wooden hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
or as the great Bull of <hi>Berne,</hi> which was
killed at <hi>Marinian,</hi> did ride for his Hackney
the great murthering piece called the <hi>Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perrier,</hi>
a pretty beast of a faire and pleasant
amble without all question.</p>
                  <p>In that posture, he after God, saved the
said Ark from danger, for with his legs he
gave it the brangle that was needful, and
with his foot turned it whither he pleased, as
a ship answereth her rudder. Those that were
within sent him up victuals in abundance by
a Chimney, as people very thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the good that he did them;
And sometimes they did talk together as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romenippus</hi>
did to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> according to the

the cause and reason of the name of

of <hi>Affrick,</hi> that there past thirty and six
moneths, three weeks, foure dayes, thirteen
houres, and a little more without raine, but
with a heat so vehement, that the whole earth
was parched and withered by it: neither was
it more scorched and dried up with heat in the
dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> then it was at that time; for
there was not a tree to be seen, that had either
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41088:153"/>
leafe or bloom upon it: the grasse was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
verdure or greennesse, the rivers were
drained, the fountaines dried up, the poore
fishes abandoned and forsaken by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
element, wandring and crying upon the
ground most horribly: the birds did fall
down from the aire for want of moisture and
dew, wherewith to refresh them: the wolves,
foxes, harts, wild-boares, fallow-deer; hares,
coneys, weesils, brocks, badgers, and other
such beasts were found dead in the fields with
their mouthes open; in respect of men, there
was the pity, you should have seen them lay
out their tongues like hares that have been
run six houres: many did throw themselves
into the wells: others entred within a Cowes
belly to be in the shade; those <hi>Homer</hi> calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libants:</hi>
all the Countrey was idle, and could
do no vertue: it was a most lamentable case
to have seen the labour of mortals in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves from the vehemencie of this
horrifick drought; for they had work enough
to do to save the holy water in the Churches
from being wasted; but there was such order
taken by the counsel of my Lords the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and of our holy Father, that none did
dare to take above one lick: yet when any
one came into the Church, you should have
seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang
upon him that was the distributer of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that with a wide open throat, gaping
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41088:154"/>
for some little drop, (like the rich glutton in
<hi>Luke,)</hi> that might fall by, lest any thing
should be lost. O how happy was he in that
yeare, who had a coole Cellar under ground,
well plenished with fresh wine!</p>
                  <p>The Philosopher reports in moving the
question, wherefore it is that the sea-water
is salt? that at the time when <hi>Phoebus</hi> gave
the government of his resplendent chariot to
his sonne <hi>Phaeton,</hi> the said <hi>Phaeton,</hi> unskilful
in the Art, and not knowing how to keep the
ecliptick line betwixt the two tropicks of
the latitude of the Sunnes course, strayed
out of his way, and came so near the earth,
that he dried up all the Countreys that were
under it, burning a great part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call <hi>via lactea,</hi>
and the <hi>Huffsnuffs,</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> his way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the most coped, lofty, and high-crest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Poets affirme that to be the place where
<hi>Iuno's</hi> milk fell, when she gave suck to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The earth at that time was so excessively
heated, that it fell into an enormous sweat,
yea such a one as made it sweat out the sea,
which is therefore salt, because all sweat is
salt; and this you cannot but confesse to be
true, if you will taste of your own, or of those
that have the pox, when they are put into a
sweating, it is all one to me. Just such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
case fell out this same yeare: for on a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41088:154"/>
certain <hi>Friday,</hi> when the whole people were
bent upon their devotions, and had made
goodly Processions, with store of Letanies,
and faire preachings, and beseechings of God
Almighty, to look down with his eye of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon their miserable and disconsolate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
there was even then visibly seen issue
out of the ground great drops of water, such
as fall from a puff-bagg'd man in a top sweat;
and the poore Hoydons began to rejoyce, as if
it had been a thing very profitable unto them;
for some said that there was not one drop
of moisture in the aire, whence they might
have any rain, and that the earth did supply
the default of that. Other learned men said,
that it was a showre of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
saith in his fourth book <hi>Quaestionum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalium,</hi>
speaking of the source and spring
of <hi>Nilus:</hi> but they were deceived, for the
Procession being ended, when every one
went about to gather of this dew, and to
drink of it with full bowles; they found that
it was nothing but pickle, and the very brine

                  <head type="sub">Of the Infancie of Pantagruel.</head>
                  <p>I Finde by the ancient Historiographers and
Poets, that divers have been borne in this
world, after very strange manners, which
would be too long to repeat; reade therefore
the seventh chapter of <hi>Pliny,</hi> if you have so
much leisure: yet have you never heard of
any so wonderful as that of <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> for
it is a very difficult matter to beleeve, how in
the little time he was in his mothers belly, he
grew both in body and strength. That which
<hi>Hercules</hi> did, was nothing, when in his Cradle
he slew two serpents; for those serpents were
but little and weak: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being yet
in the Cradle, did farre more admirable
things, and more to be amazed at, I passe
by here the relation of how at every one of
his meales he supped up the milk of foure
thousand and six hundred Cowes: and how
to make him a skellet to boil his milk in, there
were set a work all the Brasiers of <hi>Somure</hi> in
<hi>Anjou,</hi> of <hi>Villedieu</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
in <hi>Lorraine:</hi> and they served in this
whitepot-meat to him in a huge great Bell,
which is yet to be seen in the City of <hi>Bourge</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41088:158"/>
in <hi>Berrie,</hi> near the Palace; but his teeth
were already so well grown, and so strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
in vigour, that of the said Bell he bit off
a great morsel, as very plainly doth appeare
till this houre.</p>
                  <p>One day in the morning, when they would
have made him suck one of his Cows, (for he
never had any other Nurse, as the History
tells us) he got one of his armes loose from
the swadling bands, wherewith he was kept
fast in the Cradle, laid hold on the said
Cow under the left fore hamme, and grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to him, ate up her udder and half
of her paunch, with the liver and the kidneys,
and had devoured all up, if she had not cried
out most horribly, as if the wolves had held
her by the legs, at which noise company
came in, and took away the said Cow from
<hi>Pantagruel;</hi> yet could they not so well do it,
but that the quarter whereby he caught her
was left in his hand, of which quarter he
gulp't up the flesh in a trice, even with as
much ease as you would eate a salcige; and
that so greedily with desire of more, that
when they would have taken away the bone
from him, he swallowed it down whole, as a
Cormorant would do a little fish; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
began fumblingly to say, <hi>Good, good,
good,</hi> for he could not yet speak plaine; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them to understand thereby, that he
had found it very good, and that he did lack
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41088:158"/>
but so much more; which when they saw
that attended him, they bound him with
great cable-ropes, like those that are made at
<hi>Tain,</hi> for the carriage of salt to <hi>Lyons;</hi> or
such as those are, whereby the great <hi>French</hi>
ship rides at Anchor, in the Road of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven</hi>
in <hi>Normandie.</hi> But on a certain time,
a great Beare which his father had bred, got
loose, came towards him, began to lick his
face, for his Nurses had not throughly wiped
his chaps, at which unexpected approach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a sudden offended, he as lightly rid
himself of those great cables, as <hi>Samson</hi> did
of the haulser ropes wherewith the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
had tied him, and by your leave, takes
me up my Lord the Beare, and teares him to
you in pieces like a pullet, which served him
for a gorge-ful or good warme bit for that
meale.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>Gargantua</hi> fearing lest the
childe should hurt himself, caused foure great
chaines of iron to be made to binde him, and
so many strong wooden arches unto his
Cradle, most firmely stocked and mortaised
in huge frames: of those chaines you have
one at <hi>Rochel,</hi> which they draw up at night
betwixt the two great towers of the Haven:
Another is at <hi>Lyons:</hi> A third at <hi>Angiers:</hi>
And the fourth was carried away by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
to binde <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who broke his chaines
in those dayes, by reason of a cholick that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41088:159"/>
extraordinarily torment him, taken with
eating a Serjeants soule fried for his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
and therfore you may beleeve that which
<hi>Nicolas de Lyra</hi> saith upon that place of the
<hi>Psalter,</hi> where it is written, <hi>Et Og regem Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi>
that the said <hi>Og</hi> being yet little, was so
strong and robustious, that they were faine
to binde him with chaines of iron in his
Cradle; thus continued <hi>Pantagruel</hi> for a
while very calme and quiet, for he was not
able so easily to break those chaines, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
having no room in the Cradle to give
a swing with his armes. But see what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
once upon a great Holiday, that his
father <hi>Gargantua</hi> made a sumptuous banquet
to all the Princes of his Court: I am apt to
beleeve, that the menial officers of the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se
were so imbusied in waiting each on his
proper service at the feast, that no body took
care of poor <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was left <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culorum,</hi>
behinde-hand all alone, and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken.
What did he, Heark what he did?
good people: he strove and essayed to break
the chaines of the Cradle with his armes but
coold not, for they were too strong for him:
then did he keep with his feet such a stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stirre, and so long, that at last he beat
out the lower end of his Cradle, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
was made of a great post five
foot in square: and assoon as he had gotten
out his feet, he slid down as well as he could,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41088:159"/>
till he had got his soales to the ground; and
then with a mighty force he rose up, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Cradle upon his back, bound to him
like a Tortoise that crawles up against a wall;
and to have seen him, you would have
thought it had been a great <hi>Carrick</hi> of five
hundred tunne upon one end. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he entred into the great Hall, where they
were banquetting, and that very boldly,
which did much affright the companie; yet
because his armes were tied in, he could not
reach any thing to eate, but with great pain
stooped now and then a little, to take with
the whole flat of his tongue some lick, good
bit or morsel.</p>
                  <p>Which when his father saw, he knew well
enough that they had left him without giving
him any thing to eate, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that he should be loosed from the
said chains, by the counsel of the Princes and
Lords there present: besides that, also the
Physicians of <hi>Gargantua</hi> said, that if they did
thus keep him in the Cradle, he would be
all his life-time subject to the stone. When
he was unchained they made him to sit down,
where after he had fed very well, he took his
Cradle, and broke it into more then five
hundred thousand pieces with one blow of his
fist, that he struck in the midst of it, swearing
that he would never come into it again.</p>

of the said <hi>Iafrey</hi> with the great

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41088:161"/>
looking upon the pictute, whose lively
draughts did set him forth in the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a man in an extreme fury, drawing
his great <hi>Malchus</hi> faulchion half way out of
his scabbard: when the reason hereof was
demanded, the Chanons of the said place
told him, that there was no other cause of
it, but that <hi>Pictoribus atque Poetis, &amp;c.</hi> that
is to say, that Painters and Poets have liberty
to paint and devise what they list after their

their answer, and said, He is not thus painted
without a cause; and I suspect that at his death
there was some wrong done him, whereof he
requireth his Kinred to take revenge: I will
enquire further into it, and then do what
shall be reasonable; then he returned not
to <hi>Poictiers,</hi> but would take a view of the
other Universities of <hi>France:</hi> therefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Rochel,</hi> he took shipping and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he found no great
exercise, only now and then he would see
some Marriners and Lightermen a wrestling
on the key or strand by the river-side: From
thence he came to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> where he learned
to dance very well, and to <hi>play</hi> with the <hi>two-handed
sword,</hi> as the fashion of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

I am by nature sufficiently dry already, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heating my self any further.</p>
                  <p>He went then to <hi>Monpellier,</hi> where he
met with the good wives of <hi>Mirevaux,</hi> and
good jovial company withal, and thought to
have set himself to the study of Physick;
but he considered that that calling was too
troublesome and melancholick; and that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
did smell of glisters like old devils.
Therefore he resolved he would studie the
lawes; but seeing that there were but three
scauld, and one bald-pated Legist in that
place, he departed from thence, and in his
way made the Bridge of <hi>Gard,</hi> and the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater</hi>
of <hi>Neems</hi> in lesse then three houres,
which neverthelesse seems to be a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
then humane work. After that he came
to <hi>Avignon,</hi> where he was not above three
dayes before he fell in love; for the
women there take great delight in playing at
the close buttock-game, because it is Papal
ground; which his Tutor and Pedagogue
<hi>Epistemon</hi> perceiving, he drew him out of
that place, and brought him to <hi>Valence</hi> in
the <hi>Dauphinee,</hi> where he saw no great matter
of recreation, only that the Lubbards of the
Town did beat the Scholars, which so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him with anger, that when upon a certain

Scholars offering to put himself into the
ring to partake of that sport, the foresaid
lubbardly fellowes would not permit him the
admittance into their society; He taking
the Scholars part, so belaboured them with
blowes, and laid such load upon them, that
he drove them all before him, even to the
brink of the river <hi>Rhosne,</hi> and would have
there drowned them, but that they did squat
to the ground, and there lay close a full halfe

the plague drove them away. So from thence
he came to <hi>Bourges,</hi> where he studied a good
long time, and profited very much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Lawes: and would sometimes
say, that the books of the Civil Law, were
like unto a wonderfully precious, royal and
triumphant robe of cloth of gold, edged
with dirt; for in the world are no goodlier
books to be seen, more ornate, nor more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

                  <p>VPon a certain day, I know not when,
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> walking after supper with
some of his fellow-Students, without that
gate of the City, through which we enter on
the rode to <hi>Paris,</hi> encountered with a young
spruce-like Scholar that was coming upon
the same very way; and after they had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted

<hi>Scholar</hi> answered him: From the alme, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyte

answered, My worshipful Lord, my <hi>genie</hi>

By G—(said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> I will teach you to

whence thou art? To this the <hi>Scholar</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
The primeval origin of my aves and

saying to him, Thou flayest the Latine; by
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> I will make thee flay the foxe; for

<hi>Pantagruel)</hi> thou speakest naturally, and so
let him go, for the poor <hi>Limousin</hi> had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
berayed, and throughly conshit his
breeches, which were not deep and large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but round streat caniond gregs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the seat a piece like a keelings taile;
and therefore in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>de chausses, à

go: bnt this hug of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> was such a

terrour to him all the dayes of his life, and
took such deep impression in his fancie, that
very often distracted with sudden affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he would startle and say that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
held him by the neck; besides that it
procured him a continual drought and desire
to drink so that after some few years he died
of the death <hi>Roland</hi> in plain <hi>English</hi> called
thirst, a work of divine vengeance, shewing
us that which saith the Philosopher and <hi>Aulus
Gellius,</hi> that it becometh us to speak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the common language: and that we
shonld (as said <hi>Octavian Augustus)</hi> strive to

as much heedfulnesse and circumspection, as

                  <p>AFter that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had studied very
well at <hi>Orleans,</hi> he resolved to see the
great University at <hi>Paris;</hi> but before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
he was informed that there was a
huge big bell at St. <hi>Anian</hi> in the said town of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> under the ground, which had been
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41088:165"/>
there above two hundred and fourteen years;
for it was so great that they could not by any
device get it so much as above the ground,
although they used all the meanes that are
found in <hi>Vitruvius de Architectura, Albertus
de re aedificatoria, Euclid, Theon, Archimedes,</hi>
and <hi>Hero de ingeniis:</hi> for all that was to no
purpose, wherefore condescending heartily
to the humble request of the Citizens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the said Town, he determined
to remove it to the tower that was erected
for it: with that he came to the place where
it was, and lifted it out of the ground with
his little finger, as easily as you would hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

done a Hawks bell, or Bell-weathers tingle
tangle: but before he would carry it to the
foresaid tower or steeple appointed for it, he
would needs make some Musick with it about
the Town, and ring it alongst all the streets,
as, he carried it in his hand, wherewith all the
people were very glad; but there happened
one great inconveniency, for with carrying
it so, and ringing it about the streets, all the
good <hi>Orleans</hi> wine turned instantly, waxed
flat, and was spoiled, which no body there
did perceive till the night following; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man found himself so altered, and a dry
with drinking these flat wines, that they did
nothing but spit, and that as white as <hi>Maltha</hi>
cotton, saying: We have of the <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and
our very throats are salted. This done, he came
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41088:166"/>
to <hi>Paris</hi> with his retinue, and at his entry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one came out to see him, (as you know
well enough, that the people of <hi>Paris</hi> is sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
by <hi>nature,</hi> by <hi>B. flat,</hi> and <hi>B. sharp,)</hi> and
beheld him with great astonishment, mixed
with no lesse feare, that he would carry away
the Palace into some other countrey <hi>à remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
and farre from them, as his father former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had done the great peal of Bells at our

Now after he had stayed there a pretty space,
and studied very well in all the seven liberal
Arts, he said it was a good towne to live in,
but not to die; for that the grave-digging
rogues of <hi>St. Innocent,</hi> used in frostie nights
to warme their bums with dead mens bones.
In his abode there he found the Library of

                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Most dear sonne,</hi> amongst the gifts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and prerogatives, with which the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<hi>Plasmator</hi> God Almighty, hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and adorned humane Nature at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that seems to me most singular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
by which we may in a mortal estate
attain to a kinde of immortality, and in the
course of this transitory life perpetuate our
name and seed, which is done by a progeny
issued from us in the lawful bonds of
Matrimony: whereby that in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is restored unto us, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us by the sin of our first Parents,
to whom it was said, that because they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41088:170"/>
had not obeyed the Commandment of God
their Creator, they should die, and by death
should be brought to nought that so stately
frame and <hi>Plasmature,</hi> wherein the man at
first had been created.</p>
                        <p>But by this meanes of seminal propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which continueth in the children what
was lost in the Parents, and in the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children
that which perished in their fathers,
and so successively until the day of the last
judgement, when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> shall have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
up to God the Father his Kingdom in a
peaceable condition, out of all danger and
contamination of sin; for then shall cease all
generations and corruptions, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
leave off their continual transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
seeing the so much desired peace shall
be attained unto and enjoyed, and that all
things shall be brought to their end and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod;
and therefore not without just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
cause, do I give thanks to God my
Saviour and Preserver, for that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
me to see my bald old age reflourish in
thy youth: for when at his good pleasure,
who rules and governes all things, my soul
shall leave this mortal habitation; I shall
not account my self wholly to die, but to
passe from one place unto another: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that in and by that I continue in my
visible image living in the world, visiting
and conversing with people of honour, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41088:171"/>
other my good friends, as I was wont to do:
which conversation of mine, although it was
not without sin, (because we are all of us tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passers,
and therefore ought continually to
beseech his divine Majesty, to blot our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
out of his memory) yet was it by
the help and grace of God, without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of reproach before men.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if those qualities of the minde
but shine in thee, wherewith I am endowed,
as in thee remaineth the perfect image of my
body, thou wilt be esteemed by all men to be
the perfect guardian and treasure of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of our name: but if otherwise, I
shall truly take but small pleasure to see it,
considering that the lesser part of me, which
is the body, would abide in thee: and the best,
to wit, that which is the soule, and by which
our name continues blessed amongst men,
would be degenerate and abastardised: This
I do not speak out of any distrust that I
have of thy vertue, which I have heretofore
already tried, but to encourage thee yet more
earnestly to proceed from good to better:
and that which I now write unto thee, is not
so much that thou shouldest live in this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
course, as that thou shouldest rejoyce
in so living and having lived, and cheer up
thy self with the like resolution in time to
come; to the prosecution and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which enterprise and generous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41088:171"/>
thou mayest easily remember how
that I have spared nothing, but have so help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee, as if I had had no other treasure in
this world, but to see thee once in my life,
compleatly well bred and accomplished, as
well in vertue, honesty and valour, as in all
liberal knowledge and civility: and so to
leave thee after my death, as a mirrour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the person of me thy father, and
if not so excellent, and such <hi>indeed</hi> as I do
wish thee, yet such in my <hi>desire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But although my deceased father of happy
memory <hi>Grangousier,</hi> had bent his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to make me profit in all perfection and
Political knowledge, and that my labour
and study was fully correspondent to, yea,
went beyond his desire: neverthelesse, as
thou mayest well understand, the time then
was not so proper and fit for learning as it is
at present, neither had I plenty of such good
Masters as thou hast had; for that time was
darksome, obscured with clouds of ignorance,
and savouring a little of the infelicity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who had, whereever
they set footing, destroyed all good literature,
which in my age hath by the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
been restored unto its former light
and dignity, and that with such amendment
and increase of the knowledge, that now
hardly should I be admitted unto the first
forme of the little Grammar-school-boyes:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41088:172"/>
I say, I, who in my youthful dayes was, (and
that justly) reputed the most learned of that
age; which I do not speak in vain boasting,
although I might lawfully do it in writing
unto thee, in verification whereof thou hast
the authority of <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his book of
old age, and the sentence of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the
book intituled how a man may praise himself
without envie: but to give thee an emulous
encouragement to strive yet further.</p>
                        <p>Now is it that the mindes of men are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with all manner of discipline, and the
old sciences revived, which for many ages
were extinct: now it is, that the learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
are to their pristine purity restored,
<hi>viz. Greek,</hi> (without which a man may be
ashamed to account himself a scholar,) <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Arabick, Chaldaean</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise is now in use, so elegant, and so
correct, that better cannot be imagined, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was found out but in my time by
divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the other side was the invention of
Ordnance. All the world is full of knowing
men, of most learned Schoolmasters, and vast
Libraries: and it appears to me as a truth,
that neither in <hi>Plato</hi>'s time, nor <hi>Cicero's,</hi> nor
<hi>Papinian</hi>'s, there was ever such conveniency
for studying, as we see at this day there is:
nor must any adventure henceforward to
come in publick, or present himself in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41088:172"/>
that hath not been pretty well polished
in the shop of <hi>Minerva:</hi> I see robbers, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
free-booters, tapsters, ostlers, and such
like, of the very rubbish of the people, more
learned now, then the Doctors and Preachers
were in my time,</p>
                        <p>What shall I say? the very women and
children have aspired to this praise and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Manna of good learning: yet so it is,
that in the age I am now of, I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to learn the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, which I
contemned not like <hi>Cato,</hi> but had not the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in my younger yeares to attend the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of it: and take much delight in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Morals, the pleasant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Monuments of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias,</hi>
and the Antiquities of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> in
waiting on the houre wherein God my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
shall call me, and command me to depart
from this earth and transitory pilgrimage.
Wherefore (my sonne) I admonish thee, to
imploy thy youth to profit as well as thou
canst, both in thy studies and in vertue.
Thou art at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of many brave men may stirre up
thy minde to gallant actions, and hast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for thy Tutor and <hi>Paedagogue</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Epistemon,</hi> who by his lively and vocal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments
may instruct thee in the Arts and
Sciences.</p>
                        <p>I intend, and will have it so, that thou learn
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41088:173"/>
the Languages perfectly: first of all, the
<hi>Greek,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> will have it: secondly,
the <hi>Latine;</hi> and then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the holy
Scripture-sake: and then the <hi>Chaldee</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi>
likewise, and that thou frame thy stile in
<hi>Greek</hi> in imitation of <hi>Plato;</hi> and for the <hi>Latine,</hi>
after <hi>Cicero,</hi> let there be no history which thou
shalt not have ready in thy memory; unto
the prosecuting of which designe, books of
<hi>Cosmographie</hi> will be very conducible, and
help thee much. Of the liberal Arts of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi> I gave thee
some taste when thou wert yet little, and
not above five or six yeares old; proceed
further in them, &amp; learn the remainder if thou
canst. As for <hi>Astronomy,</hi> study all the rules
thereof, let passe neverthelesse the divining
and judicial <hi>Astrology,</hi> and the Art of <hi>Lullius,</hi>
as being nothing else but plain abuses and
vanities. As for the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> of that I would
have thee to know the texts by heart, and
then to conferre them with <hi>Philosophie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in matter of the knowledge of the
works of Nature, I would have thee to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that exactly, and that so there be no sea,
river nor fountain, of which thou doest not
know the fishes, all the fowles of the aire,
all the several kindes of shrubs and trees, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in forrests or orchards: all the sorts of
herbes and flowers that grow upon the
ground: all the various mettals that are hid
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41088:173"/>
within the bowels of the earth: together
with all the diversity of precious stones, that
are to be seen in the Orient &amp; South-parts of
the world, let nothing of all these be hidden
from thee. Then faile not most carefully to
peruse the books of the <hi>Greek, Arabian</hi> and
<hi>Latine</hi> Physicians, not despising the <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi>
and <hi>Cabalists;</hi> and by frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies
get thee the perfect knowledge of the
other world, called the Microcosme, which is
man: and at some houres of the day apply thy
minde to the study of the holy Scriptures:
first in <hi>Greek,</hi> the New Testament with the
Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old
Testament in <hi>Hebrew</hi> In brief, let me see thee
an Abysse, and bottomlesse pit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
for from hence forward, as thou grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
great and becomest a man, thou must part
from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou
must learn chivalrie, warfare, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of the field, the better thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
my house and our friends, and to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and protect them at all their needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the invasion and assaults of evil doers.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I will that very shortly thou
try how much thou hast profited, which thou
canst not better do, then by maintaining pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<hi>Theses</hi> and Conclusions in all Arts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all persons whatsoever, and by haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the company of learned men, both at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and otherwhere. But because as the wise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41088:174"/>
man <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wisdome entereth not into
a malicious minde;</hi> and that knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conscience is but the ruine of the soule,
it behooveth thee to serve, to love, to feare
God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and
all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity
to cleave unto him, so that thou mayest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be separated from him by thy sins. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the abuses of the world: set not thy
heart upon vanity; for this life is transitory,
but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever.
Be serviceable to all thy neighbours, and
love them as thy self: reverence thy Praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors:
shun the conversation of those whom
thou desirest not to resemble, and receive not
in vaine the graces which God hath bestowed
upon thee: and when thou shalt see that thou
hast attained to all the knowledge that is to
be acquired in that part, return unto me, that
I may see thee, and give thee my blessing
before I die. <hi>My sonne,</hi> the peace and grace
of our Lord be with thee. <hi>Amen.</hi>

all his life-time.</head>
                  <p>ONe day as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was taking a walk
without the City, towards <hi>St. Antonies</hi>
Abbey, discoursing and philosophating with
his own servants and some other Scholars,
met with a young man of a very comely sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and surpassing handsome in all the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his body, but in several parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
most pitifully wounded; in such bad equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
in matter of his apparel, which was but
totters and rags, and every way so far out of
order, that he seemed to have been a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with mastiffe-dogs, from whose fury he
had made an escape, or to say better, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the condition wherein he then was,
like an Apple-gatherer of the countrey of
<hi>Perche.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41088:175"/>
As farre off as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw him, he said
to those that stood by: Do you see that man
there, who is a coming hither upon the road
from <hi>Charanton</hi>-bridge? by my faith, he is
only poor in fortune; for I may assure you,
that by his <hi>Physiognomie</hi> it appeareth, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath extracted him from some rich and
noble race, and that too much curiosity hath
thrown him upon adventures, which possibly
have reduced him to this indigence, want and
penurie. Now as he was just amongst them,
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> said unto him, Let me intreat you,
<hi>(friend)</hi> that you may be pleased to stop here
a little, and answer me to that which I shall
ask you, and I am confident you will not
think your time ill bestowed; for I have an
extream desire, (according to my ability) to
give you some supply in this distresse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I see you are; because I do very much
commiserate your case, which truly moves
me to great pity; Therefore (my friend)
tell me, who you are? whence you come?
whither you go? what you desire? and what
your name is? the <hi>companion</hi> answered him
in the <hi>Dutch</hi> tongue, thus.</p>

<hi>I have no skill in that gibberish of yours;
therefore, if you would have us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you, speak to us in some other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
then did the drole answer him
thus.</hi>

my friend, (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> but cannot you
speak <hi>French?</hi> that I can do <hi>(Sir)</hi> very well,
(said the companion) God be thanked: it is
my natural language and mother tongue:
for I was borne and bred in my younger
yeares in the garden of <hi>France,</hi> to wit, <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine:</hi>
Then (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> tell us what is
your name, and from whence you are come;
fot by my faith, I have already stamped in
my minde such a deep impression of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, that if you will condescend unto
my will, you shall not depart out of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and you and I shall make up another
couple of friends, such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

were; Sir, (said the companion) my true and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41088:178"/>
proper <hi>christen</hi> name is <hi>Panurge,</hi> and now I
come out of <hi>Turkie,</hi> to which countrey I was
carried away prisoner at that time, when they
went to <hi>Metelin</hi> with a mischief: and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
would I relate unto you my fortunes,
which are more wonderful then those of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses</hi>
were: but seeing that it pleaseth you to
retain me with you, I most heartily accept of
the offer, protesting never to leave you,
should you go to all the devils in hell; we
shall have therefore more leasure at another
time, and a fitter opportunity wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them; for at this present I am in a very
urgent necessity to feed, my teeth are sharp,
my belly empty, my throat dry, and my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
fierce and burning: all is ready, if you
will but set me to work, it will be as good as
a <hi>balsamum</hi> for sore eyes, to see me gulch and
raven it, for Gods sake give order for it.
Then <hi>Pantagruel</hi> commanded that they
should carry him home, and provide him
good store of victuals, which being done,
he ate very well that evening, and (capon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
went early to bed, then slept until din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-time
the next day, so that he made but
three steps and one leap from the bed to the
board.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAntagruel,</hi> very well remembring his
fathers letter and admonitions, would
one day make trial of his knowledge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in all the <hi>Carrefours,</hi> that is, throughout
all the foure quarters, streets and corners of
the City, he set up Conclusions to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of nine thousand seven hundred sixty and
foure, in all manner of learning, touching in
them the hardest doubts that are in any sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And first of all, in the <hi>fodder-street</hi> he
held dispute against all the <hi>Regents</hi> or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of Colledges, <hi>Artists</hi> or Masters of
Arts, and Oratours, and did so gallantly, that
he overthrew them, and set them all upon
their tailes, he went afterwards to the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi>
where he maintained argument against
all the <hi>Theologians</hi> or Divines, for the space
of six weeks, from foure a clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
until six in the evening, except an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of two houres to refresh themselves, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41088:179"/>
take their repast: and at this were present the
greatest part of the Lords of the Court, the
Masters of Requests, Presidents, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
those of the Accompts, Secretaries, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
and others: as also the Sheriffes of
the said town, with the Physicians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the canon-law; amongst which it
is to be remarked, that the greatest part
were stubborn jades, and in their opinions
obstinate; but he took such course with them,
that for all their <hi>Ergo's</hi> and fallacies, he put
their backs to the wall, gravelled them in the
deepest questions, and made it visibly appear
to the world, that compared to him, they
were but monkies, and a knot of mufled
calves: Whereupon, every body began to
keep a bustling noise, and talk of his so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
knowledge, through all degrees of
persons in both sexes, even to the very Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
Brokers, Rostmeat-sellers, Penknife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
and others, who, when he past along
in the street, would say, This is he; in which
he took delight, as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> the Prince
of <hi>Greek</hi> Oratours did, when an old crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wife, pointing at him with her fingers,
said, That is the man.</p>
                  <p>Now at this same very time there was a
processe or suit in law, depending in Court
between two great Lords, of which one was
called my Lord <hi>Kissebreech,</hi> Plaintiffe of one
side, and the other my Lord <hi>Suckfist,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41088:179"/>
of the other; whose Controversie
was so high and difficult in Law, that the
Court of Parliament could make nothing
of it. And therefore by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King, there were assembled foure
of the greatest, and most learned of all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
of <hi>France,</hi> together with the great
Councel, and all the principal Regents of the
Universities, not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

together, after they had thereupon consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the space of six and fourty weeks,
finding that they could not fasten their teeth

the case, as that they might in any manner of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wixt the two aforesaid Parties, it did
so grievously vex them, that they most vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanously
conshit themselves for shame. In
this great extremity, one amongst them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Du Douhait,</hi> the learnedst of all, and
more expert and prudent then any of the
rest, whilest one day they were thus at their
wits end, all-to-be-dunced and <hi>philogrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi>
in their braines, said unto them: We
have been here (my Masters,) a good long
space without doing any thingelse, then trifle
away both our time and money, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
finde neither brim nor bottome in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41088:180"/>
this matter; for the more we study about it,
the lesse we understand therein, which is a
great shame and disgrace to us, and a heavy
burthen to our consciences; yea such, that
in my opinion we shall not rid our selves
of it without dishonour, unlesse we take
some other course; for we do nothing but
doat in our consultations.</p>
                  <p>See therefore what I have thought upon:
you have heard much talking of that worthy
personage named Master <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who
hath been found to be learned above the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of this present age, by the proofs he
gave in those great disputations, which he
held publickly against all men: my opinion
is, that we send for him, to conferre with him
about this businesse; for never any man will
encompasse the bringing of it to an end, if he
do it not.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto all the Counsellors and Doctors
willingly agreed, and according to that their
result having instantly sent for him, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to be pleased to canvass the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and sift it throughly, that after a deep
search and narrow examination of all the
points thereof, he might forthwith make the
report unto them, such as he shall think good
in true and legal knowledge: to this effect
they delivered into his hands the bags where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were the Writs and Pancarts concerning
that suit, which for bulk and weight were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41088:180"/>
almost enough to lade foure great <hi>couillard</hi>
or stoned Asses; but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said nnto
them, Are the two Lords, between whom
this debate and processe is, yet living? it was
answered him, Yes: To what a devil then (said
he,) serve so many paultry heapes, and
bundles of papers and copies which you
give me? is it not better to heare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
from their own mouthes, whilest
they are face to face before us, then to reade
these vile fopperies, which are nothing but
trumperies, deceits, diabolical cosenages of
<hi>Cepola,</hi> pernicious slights and subversions of
equity? for I am sure, that you, and all those
thorough whose hands this processe hath past,
have by your devices added what you could to
it <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi>-in such sort, that although their
difference perhaps was clear and easie enough
to determine at first, you have obscured it, and
made it more intricate, by the frivolous, sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,
unreasonable and foolish reasons, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of <hi>Accursius, Baldus, Bartolus, de castro,
de imola, Hippolytus, Panormo, Bertachin, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,
Curtius,</hi> and those other old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiffs,
who never understood the least law of
the Pandects, they being but meer block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
&amp; great tithe-calvs, ignorant of all that
which was needful for the understanding of
the lawes; for (as it is most certain) they had
not the knowledge either of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
tongue, but only of the <hi>Gothick</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian;</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:41088:181"/>
the lawes neverthelesse were first
taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Ulpian. l. poster. de origine juris,</hi>
which we likewise may perceive by that all
the lawes are full of <hi>Greek</hi> words and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and then we finde that they are reduced
into a <hi>Latine</hi> stile, the most elegant and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that whole language is able to afford,
without excepting that of any that ever
wrote therein; nay, not of <hi>Salust, Varo, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,
Seneca, Titus Livius,</hi> nor <hi>Quintilian:</hi>
how then could these old dotards be able to
understand aright the text of the lawes, who
never in their time had looked upon a good
<hi>Latine</hi> book, as doth evidently enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the rudenesse of their stile, which is
fitter for a Chimney-sweeper, or for a Cook
or a Scullion, then for a Jurisconsult and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
in the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, seeing the Lawes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpted
out of the middle of moral and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophie, how should these fooles have
understood it, that have by G—studied lesse
in Philosophie then my Mule? in respect of
humane learning, and the knowledge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
and History, they were truly laden
with those faculties as a toad is with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
and yet of all this the Lawes are so
full, that without it they cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as I intend more fully to shew unto
you in a peculiar Treatise, which on that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41088:181"/>
I am about to publish. Therefore if
you will that I take any medling in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
first, cause all these papers to be burnt:
secondly, make the two Gentlemen come
personally before me; and afterwards, when
I shall have heard them, I will tell you my
opinion freely without any feignednes or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Some amongst them did contradict this
motion, as you know that in all companies
there are more fooles then wise men, and that
the greater part alwayes surmounts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as saith <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> in speaking of the
<hi>Carthaginians:</hi> but the foresaid <hi>Du Douet</hi>
held the contrary opinion, maintaining that
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> had said well, and what was right,
in affirming that these records, bills of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
replies, rejoinders, exceptions, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and other such diableries of truth-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
Writs, were but Engines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to overthrow justice, and unnecessarily
to prolong such suits as did depend before
them; and that therefore the devil would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them all away to hell, if they did not take
another course, and proceeded not in times
coming according to the Prescripts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
and Philosophical equity. In fine, all
the papers were burnt, and the two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
summoned and personally convented;
at whose appearance before the Court, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>
said unto them, Are you they that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41088:182"/>
have this great difference betwixt you? Yes,
(my Lord) said they: Which of you (said
<hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> is the Plaintiffe? It is I, said <hi>my
Lord Kissebreech:</hi> Go to then, my friend, (said
he) and relate your matter unto me from
point to point, according to the real truth, or
else (by cocks body) if I finde you to lie so
much as in one word, I will make you shorter
by the head, and take it from off your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to shew others by your example, that
in justice and judgement men ought to speak
nothing but the truth; therefore take heed

and a halfpeny, forasmuch as the <hi>Riphaean</hi>

the blankets had no streaks, wherein the liars
were to be crossed with a ruffian-like crue: &amp;
the rain-bow being newly sharpned at <hi>Milan</hi>

the good woman should tread down the heel

had pinked and cut full of small holes
their high coped-caps, to lecher it the better,
and play at <hi>in and in.</hi> And indeed the time
was very dangerous in coming from the Faire,
in so farre that many trained bowe-men were

when they
did eate without disdaining the <hi>cocklicranes,</hi>

as for my own part, such is my Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
towards my neighbours, that I could
wish from my heart every one had as good a
voice, it would make us play the better at the

to expresse the real truth without dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
I cannot but say, that those petty sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

easily into the river of <hi>Seine,</hi> to serve for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

as it was heretofore decreed by the King of
the <hi>Canarrians,</hi> according to the sentence or
judgement given thereupon, which is to be
seen in the Registry and Records within the
Clerks office of this house.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (my Lord) I do most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
require, that by your Lordship there may
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41088:185"/>
be said and declared upon the case what is
reasonable, with costs, damages, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests.

this all you have to say? <hi>Kissebreech</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Yes, (my Lord) for I have told all the <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autem,</hi>

and good Lady, how many great Captaines
have we seen in the day of battel, when in
open field the Sacrament was distributed in
lunchions of the sanctified bread of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity,
the more honestly to nod their
heads, play on the lute, and crack with their
tailes, to make pretty little platforme leaps,
in keeping level by the ground: but now the
world is unshackled from the corners of the
packs of <hi>Leycester.</hi> One flies out lewdly and
becomes debauch't, another likewise five, four
and two, and that at such randome, that if
the Court take not some course therein, it
will make as bad a season in matter of glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this yeare, as ever it made, or it will
make goblets. If any poor creature go to
the stoves to illuminate his muzzle with a

Cow-shard, or to buy winter-boots, and that
the Serjeants passing by, or those of the
watch happen to receive the decoction of a
clystere, or the fecal matter of a close-stool,
upon their rustling-wrangling-clutter-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
masterships, should any because of that
make bold to clip the shillings and testers, and
fry the wooden dishes? sometimes when
we think one thing, God does another; and
and when the Sunne is wholly set, all
beasts are in the shade: let me never be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved

will make one finde the way to the wine

                  <p>Very true it is, that the foure oxen which
are in debate, and whereof mention was
made, were somewhat short in memory:

they feared neither the Cormorant nor

tipling sippers of <hi>Paris,</hi> that drink no more
then the little bird called a <hi>spink</hi> or <hi>chaffinch,</hi>
and never take in their beak ful of liquour,
till they be bobbed on the tailes after the
manner of the sparrows. O companion, if
I could mount up as well as I can get down,
I had been long ere this above the sphere of
the Moon with <hi>Empedocles.</hi> But I cannot tell
what a devil this meanes. This wine is so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41088:192"/>
good and delicious, that the more I drink
thereof, the more I am athirst; I beleeve
that the shadow of my Master <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>
engendereth the altered and thirsty men, as
the Moon doth the catarres and defluxions;
at which word the company began to laugh:
which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perceiving, said, <hi>Panurge</hi>
What is that which moves you to laugh so?
Sir, said he, I was telling them that these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish
Turks are very unhappy, in that they
never drink one drop of wine, and that
though there were no other harme in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets
Alcoran,</hi> yet for this one base point of
abstinence from wine, which therein is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
I would not submit my self unto
their law. But now tell me, (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi>
how you escaped out of their hands. By G—
Sir (said <hi>Panurge)</hi> I will not lie to you in one
word.</p>
                  <p>The rascally <hi>Turks</hi> had broached me upon
a spit all larded like a rabbet, (for I was so
dry and meagre, that otherwise of my flesh
they would have made but very bad meat)
and in this manner began to rost me alive.
As they were thus roasting me, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
my self unto the divine grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in my minde the good St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and
alwayes hoped in God that he would deliver
me out of this torment, which came to passe,
and that very strangely; for as I did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my self with all my heart unto God,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41088:193"/>
crying, Lord God help me, Lord God save
me, Lord God take me out of this pain and
hellish torture, wherein these traiterous dogs
detain me for my sincerity in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of thy law: the roster or turn-spit fell
asleep by the divine will, or else by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of some good <hi>Mercury,</hi> who cunningly
brought <hi>Argus</hi> into a sleep for all his hundred
eyes: when I saw that he did no longer turne
me in roasting, I looked upon him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he was fast asleep, then took I up
in my teeth a firebrand by the end where it
was not burnt, and cast it into the lap of my
roaster, and another did I throw as well as I
could under a field-couche, that was placed
near to the chimney, wherein was the straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of my Master turnspit; presently the fire
took hold in the straw, and from the straw to
the bed, and from the bed to the loft, which
was planked and seeled with firre, after the
fashion of the foot of a lamp: but the best
was, that the fire which I had cast into the lap
of my paultry roaster, burnt all his groine,
and was beginning to cease upon his cullions,
when he became sensible of the danger, for
his smelling was not so bad, but that he felt it
sooner then he could have seen day-light:
then suddenly getting up, and in a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
running to the window, he cried
out to the streets as high as he could, <hi>dalbaroth,
dalbaroth, dalbaroth,</hi> which is as much to say
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41088:193"/>
as, <hi>Fire, fire, fire:</hi> incontinently turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
he came streight towards me, to throw
me quite into the fire, and to that effect had
already cut the ropes, wherewith my hands
were tied, and was undoing the cords from
off my feet; when the Master of the house
hearing him cry, Fire, and smelling the smoke
from the very street where he was walking
with some other <hi>Baashaws</hi> and <hi>Mustaphaes,</hi> ran
with all the speed he had to save what he
could, and to carry away his Jewels; yet such
was his rage (before he could well resolve
how to go about it,) that he caught the
broach whereon I was spitted, and therewith
killed my roaster stark dead, of which wound
he died there for want of government or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;
for he ran him in with the spit a
little above the navel, towards the right flank,
till he pierced the third lappet of his liver,
and the blow flanting upwards from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe
or <hi>diaphragme,</hi> through which it had
made penetration, the spit past athwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the
<hi>pericardium,</hi> or capsule of his heart, and came
out above at his shoulders, betwixt the <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyls</hi>
or turning joints of the chine of the back,
and the left <hi>homoplat,</hi> which we call the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blade.</p>
                  <p>True it is, (for I will not lie,) that in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the spit out of my body, I fell to the
ground near unto the Andirons, and so by
the fall took some hurt, which indeed had
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41088:194"/>
been greater, but that the <hi>lardons,</hi> or little sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of bacon, wherewith I was stuck, kept off
the blow. My <hi>Baashaw</hi> then seeing the case
to be desperate, his house burnt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and all his goods lost, gave himselfe
over unto all the devils in hell, calling upon
some of them by their names, <hi>Gringoth, Asta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth,
Rappalus,</hi> and <hi>Gribouillis,</hi> nine several
times, which when <hi>I</hi> saw, <hi>I</hi> had above six
pence worth of feare, dreading that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
would come even then to carry away this
foole, and seeing me so near him would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
snatch me up too: <hi>I</hi> am already (thought
<hi>I)</hi> halfe rosted, and my lardons, will be the
cause of my mischief; for these devils are
very lickorous of lardons, according to the
authority which you have of the Philosopher
<hi>Iamblicus</hi> and <hi>Murmault,</hi> in the Apology of
<hi>Bossuris,</hi> adulterated <hi>pro magistros nostros:</hi> but
for my better security <hi>I</hi> made the signe of the
Crosse; crying, <hi>Hageos, athanatos, hotheos,</hi>
and none came: at which my rogue <hi>Baashaw</hi>
being very much aggrieved, would in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piercing
his heart with my spit have killed
himself; and to that purpose had set it against
his breast, but it could not enter, because it
was not sharp enough; whereupon <hi>I</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that he was not like to work upon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the effect which he intended, although he
did not spare all the force he had to thrust it
forward, came up to him and said, Master <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grino,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:41088:194"/>
thou dost here but trifle away thy time;
or rashly lose it, for thou wilt never kill thy
self thus as thou doest: well thou mayest hurt
or bruise somewhat within thee, so as to
make thee languish all thy life-time most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
amongst the hands of the Chirurgions;
but if thou wilt be counselled by me, I will
kill thee clear out-right, so that thou shalt
not so much as feel it, and trust me, for I
have killed a grear many others, who have
found themselves very well after it: Ha, my
friend, said he, I prethee do so, and for thy
paines I will give thee my Codpiece, take,
here it is, there are six hundred Seraphs in it,
and some fine Diamonds, and most excellent
Rubies. And where are they (said <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?)</hi>
By St. <hi>Iohn</hi> (said <hi>Panurge)</hi> they are a
good way hence, if they alwayes keep going:
but where is the last yeares snow? this was
the greatest care that <hi>Villon</hi> the <hi>Parisien</hi> Poet
took. Make an end (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> that we
may know how thou didst dresse thy <hi>Baashaw:</hi>
By the faith of an honest man (said <hi>Panurge)
I</hi> do not lie in one word, <hi>I</hi> swadled him in a
scurvie swathel-binding, which I found lying
there half burnt, and with my cords tied him
royster-like both hand and foot, in such sort
that he was not able to winse; then past my
spit thorough his throat, and hanged him
thereon, fastening the end thereof at two
great hooks or cramp-irons, upon which they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41088:195"/>
did hang their Halberds; and then kindling
a faire fire under him, did flame you up my
<hi>Milourt,</hi> as they use to do dry herrings in a
chimney: with this, taking his budget, and a
little javelin that was upon the foresaid hooks,
<hi>I</hi> ran away a faire gallop-rake, and God he
knows how <hi>I</hi> did smell my shoulder of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>I</hi> was come down into the street,
<hi>I</hi> found every body come to put out the fire
with store of water, and seeing me so halfe-roasted,
they did naturally pity my case, and
threw all their water upon me, which by a
most joyful refreshing of me, did me very
much good: then did they present me with
some victuals, but <hi>I</hi> could not eat much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they gave me nothing to drink but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
after their fashion. Other hurt they did
me none, only one little villainous <hi>Turkie</hi>
knobbreasted rogue, came thiefteously to
snatch away some of my lardons, but <hi>I</hi> gave
him such a sturdie thump and sound rap on
the fingers, with all the weight of my jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
that he came no more the second time.
Shortly after this, there came towards me a
pretty young <hi>Corinthian</hi> wench, who brought
me a box full of Conserves, of round <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolan</hi>
plums, called <hi>Emblicks,</hi> and looked
upon my poor <hi>Robin</hi> with an eye of great
compassion, as it was flea-bitten and pinked
with the sparkles of the fire from whence it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41088:195"/>
came, for it reached no further in length, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
me) then my knees; but note, that this
roasting cured me entirely of a Sciatick,
whereunto <hi>I</hi> had been subject above seven
yeares before, upon that side, which my roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by falling asleep, suffered to be burnt.</p>
                  <p>Now whilest they were thus busie about
me, the fire triumphed, never ask, How? for
it took hold on above two thousand houses,
which one of them espying, cried out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
By <hi>Mahooms</hi> belly all the City is on fire,
and we do neve rthelesse stand gazing here,
without offering to make any relief: upon
this every one ran to save his own; for my
part, <hi>I</hi> took my way towards the gate. When
<hi>I</hi> was got upon the knap of a little hillock, not
farre off, <hi>I</hi> turned me about as did <hi>Lots</hi> wife,
and looking back, saw all the City burning
in a faire fire, whereat <hi>I</hi> was so glad, that <hi>I</hi>
had almost beshit my selfe for joy: but God
punished me well for it: How? said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel:</hi>
Thus, said <hi>Panurge;</hi> for when with
pleasure <hi>I</hi> beheld this jolly fire, jesting with
my self, and saying, Ha poor flies, ha poor
mice, you will have a bad winter of it this
yeare, the fire is in your reeks, it is in your
bed-straw, out came more then six, yea more
then thirteen hundred and eleven dogs great
and small, altogether out of the town, flying
away from the fire; at the first approach
they ran all upon me, being carried on by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41088:196"/>
sent of my leacherous half-roasted flesh, and
had even then devoured me in a trice, if my
good Angel had not well inspired me with
the instruction of a remedy, very sovereign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the tooth-ache. And wherefore (said
<hi>Pantagruel)</hi> wert thou afraid of the tooth-ache,
or paine of the teeth? wert thou not
cured of thy Rheumes? By Palme-sunday,
(said <hi>Panurge)</hi> is there any greater pain of the
teeth, then when the dogs have you by the
legs? but on a sudden, (as my good Angel
directed me) <hi>I</hi> thought upon my lardons, and
threw them into the midst of the field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: then did the dogs run, and
fight with one another at faire teeth, which
should have the lardons: by this means they
left me, and <hi>I</hi> left them also bustling with,
and hairing one another. Thus did <hi>I</hi> escape
frolick and lively, grammercie roastmeat and
cookery.</p>

the walls of Paris.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PAntagruel</hi> one day to refresh himself of
his study, went a walking towards St.
<hi>Marcels</hi> suburbs, to see the extravagancie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41088:196"/>
of the <hi>Gobeline</hi> building, and to taste of their
spiced bread. <hi>Panurge</hi> was with him, having
alwayes a flaggon under his gown, and a good
slice of a gammon of bacon; for without
this he never went, saying, that it was as a
Yeoman of the guard to him, to preserve his
body from harme, other sword carried he
none: and when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would have given
him one, he answered; that he needed none,
for that it would but heat his milt. Yea but
(said <hi>Epistemon)</hi> if thou shouldest be set upon,
how wouldest thou defend thy self? With
great <hi>buskinades</hi> or brodkin blowes, answered
he, provided thursts were forbidden. At their
return, <hi>Panurge</hi> considered the walls of the
City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in derision said to <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi>
See what faire walls here are! O how
strong they are, and well fitted to keep geese
in a mue or coop to fatten them! by my
beard they are competently scurvie for such a
City as this is; for a Cow with one fart
would go near to overthrow above six fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
of them. O my friend (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel)</hi>
doest thou know what <hi>Agesilaus</hi> said,
when he was asked, Why the great City of
<hi>Lacedemon</hi> was not inclosed with walls? Lo
here (said he) the walls of the City, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the inhabitants and Citizens there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
so strong, so well armed, and so expert in
military discipline; signifying thereby, that
there is no wall but of bones; and that Towns
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41088:197"/>
and Cities cannot have a surer wall, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortification then the prowesse and vertue
of the Citizens and Inhabitants; so is this
City so strong, by the great number of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
people that are in it, that they care not
for making any other walls. Besides, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
would go about to wall it, as <hi>Strasbourg,
Orleans</hi> or <hi>Ferrara,</hi> would finde it almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
the cost and charges would be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive.
Yea, but (said <hi>Panurge)</hi> it is good
neverthelesse to have an out-side of stone,
when we are invaded by our enemies, were
it but to ask, Who is below there? As for the
enormous expence, which you say would be
needful for undertaking the great work of
walling this City about, if the Gentlemen
of the Town will be pleased to give me a
good rough cup of wine, I will shew them a
pretty, strange and new way how they may
build them good cheap. How (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel?)</hi>
Do not speak of it then (answered
<hi>Panurge,)</hi> and I will tell it you. I see that the

by the rules of Architecture, and placing the
largest in the first ranks, then sloping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ridgewayes, like the back of an Asse,
the middle sized ones must be ranked next,
and last of all the least and smallest. This
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41088:197"/>
done, there must be a fine little interlacing
of them, like points of Diamonds, as is to be
seen in the grear Tower of <hi>Bourges,</hi> with a
like number of the <hi>nudinnudo's, nilnisistando's,</hi>
and stiffe <hi>bracmards,</hi> that dwell in amongst
the claustral Codpieces. What devil were
able to overthrow such walls? there is no
metal like it to resist blowes, in so farre that
if Culverin-shot should come to grease upon
it, you would incontinently see distill from
thence the blessed fruit of the great pox, as
small as raine: beware in the name of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and hold off; furthermore, no thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt
or lightning would fall upon it, for why?
they are all either blest or consecrated: I see
but one inconveniency in it: Ho, ho, ha, ha, ha
(said <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> and what is that? It is that
the flies would be so lickorish of them, that
you would wonder, and would quickly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there together, and there leave their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

A poor Lion, walking through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of <hi>Bieure,</hi> and saying his own little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
devotions, past under a tree, where there
was a roguish Collier gotten up to cut down
wood, who seeing the Lion, cast his hatchet
at him, and wounded him enormously in one
of his legs, whereupon the Lion halting, he
so long toiled and turmoiled himself in roam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down the forrest to finde helpe,
that at last he met with a Carpenter, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
look't upon his wound, cleansed it as
well as he could, and filled it with mosse,
telling him that he must wipe his wound well,
that the flies might not do their excrements
in it, whilest he should go search for some
yarrow or millefoile, commonly called the
Carpenters herbe. The Lion being thus heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
walked along in the forrest, at what time
a sempiternous Crone and old Hag, was pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, and gathering some sticks in the said
forrest, who seeing the Lion coming towards
her, for feare fell down backwards, in such
sort, that the winde blew up her gown, coats
and smock even as farre as above her shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
which the Lion perceiving, for pity ran
to see whether she had taken any hurt by the
fall, and thereupon considering her <hi>how do
you call it,</hi> said, O poor woman, who hath thus
wounded thee? which words when he had
spoken, he espied a fox, whom he called to
come to him, saying, <hi>Gossip Renard,</hi> hau, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41088:198"/>
hither, and for cause: when the fox was
come, he said unto him, My gossip and friend,
they have hurt this good woman here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the legs most villainously, and there is
a manifest solution of continuity, see how
great a wound it is, even from the taile up to
the navel, in measure foure, nay full five
handfulls and a half; this is the blow of an
hatchet, I doubt me it is an old wound, and
therefore that the flies may not get into it,
wipe it lustily well and hard; I prethy, both
within and without; thou hast a good taile and
long, wipe, my friend, wipe, I beseech thee,
and in the mean while I will go get some
mosse to put into it; for thus ought we to
succour and help one another, wipe it hard,
thus, my friend, wipe it well, for this wound
must be often wiped, otherwise the Party
cannot be at ease: go to, wipe well, my little
gossip, wipe, God hath furnished thee with a
taile, thou hast a long one, and of a bignesse
proportionable, wipe hard and be not weary.
A good <hi>wiper,</hi> who in <hi>wiping</hi> continually, <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi>
with his <hi>wipard,</hi> by wasps shall never be
wounded: wipe, my pretty minion, wipe, my
little bullie, <hi>I</hi> will not stay long. Then went
he to get store of mosse; and when he was a
little way off, he cried out in speaking to the
fox thus, Wipe well still, gossip, wipe, and let
it never grieve thee to wipe well, my little
gossip, <hi>I</hi> will put thee into service to be wiper
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41088:199"/>
to <hi>Don Pedro de Castille,</hi> wipe, only wipe, and
no more: the poor fox wiped as hard as he
could, here and there, within and withou:
but the false old trot did so fizzle and fist, that
she stunk like a hundred devils, which put the
poor fox to a great de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l of ill ease, for he knew
not to what side to turn himself, to escape the
unsavoury perfume of this old womans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
blasts, and whilest to that effect he was
shifting hither and thither, without knowing
how to shun the annoyance of those unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
gusts, he saw that behinde there was
yet another hole, not so great as that which
he did wipe, out of which came this filthy
and infectious aire. The Lion at last return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
bringing with him of mosse more then
eighteen packs would hold, and began to put
into the wound, with a staffe that which he had
provided for that purpose, and had already
put in full sixteen packs and a half, at which
he was amazed: What a devil? (said he) this
wound is very deep, it would hold above two
cart-loads of mosse. The fox perceiving this,
said unto the Lion, O gossip Lion, my friend,
I pray thee do not put in all thy mosse there,
keep somewhat; for there is yet here ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little hole, that stinks like five hundred
devils; I am almost choaked with the smell
thereof, it is so pestiferous and impoison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Thus must these walls be kept from the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41088:199"/>
flies, and wages allowed to some for wiping
of them. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> How dost
thou know that the privy parts of women are
at such a cheap rate? for in this City there
are many vertuous, honest and chaste women
besides the maids: <hi>Et ubi prenus,</hi> said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge?</hi>
I will give you my opinion of it, and
that upon certain and assured knowledge. I
do not brag that I have bumbasted four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and seventeen, since I came into this
City, though it be but nine dayes ago: but
this very morning I met with a good fellow,
who in a wallet, such as <hi>Aesops</hi> was, carried
two little girles of two or three yeares old at
the most, one before, and the other behinde:
he demanded almes of me, but <hi>I</hi> made him
answer, that <hi>I</hi> had more cods then pence; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>I</hi> asked him, <hi>Good man,</hi> these two
girles are they maids? Brother, said he, <hi>I</hi>
have carried them thus these two yeares, and
in regard of her that is before, whom <hi>I</hi> see
continually, in my opinion she is a Virgin,
neverthelesse <hi>I</hi> will not put my finger in the
fire for it; as for her that is behinde, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
I can say nothing. Indeed (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel)</hi>
thou art a gentile companion, <hi>I</hi> will
have thee to be apparelled in my livery, and
therefore caused him to be clothed most
gallantly according to the fashion that then
was, only that <hi>Panurge</hi> would have the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of his breeches three foot long, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41088:200"/>
shape square, not round, which was done
and was well worth the seeing. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was he wont to say that the world
had not yet known the emolument and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
that is in wearing great Codpieces;
but time wonld one day teach it them, as
all things have been invented in time. God
keep from hurt (said he) the good fellow
whose long Codpiece or Braguet hath saved
his life: God keep from hurt him, whose
long Braguet hath been worth to him in one
day, one hundred threescore thousand and
nine Crowns: God keep from hurt him, who
by his long Braguet hath saved a whole City
from dying by famine. And by G—I will
make a book of the commodity of long Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guets,
when I shall have more leasure. And
indeed he composed a faire great book with
figures, but it is not printed as yet that I
know of.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PAnurge</hi> was of a middle stature, not too
high, nor too low, and had somewhat an
Aquiline nose, made like the handle of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor:
he was at that time five and thirty years
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41088:200"/>
old or thereabouts, fine to gild like a leaden
dagger; for he was a notable cheater and
cony-catcher, he was a very gallant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
man of his person, only that he was a
little leacherous, and naturally subject to a
kinde of disease, which at that time they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
lack of money: it is an incomparable
grief, yet notwithstanding he had chreescore
and three tricks to come by it at his need, of
which the most honourable and most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
was in manner of thieving, secret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining
and filching; for he was a wicked
lewd rogue, a cosener, drinker, royster, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and a very dissolute and debautch'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if there were any in <hi>Paris;</hi> otherwise,
and in all matters else, the best and most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man in the world: and he was still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
some plot, and devising mischief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Serjeants and the watch.</p>
                  <p>At one time he assembled three or foure
especial good hacksters and roaring boyes,
made them in the evening drink like <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers,</hi>
afterwards led them till they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
St. <hi>Genevieve,</hi> or about the Colledge of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> and at the houre that the watch
was coming up that way, which he knew by
putting his sword upon the pavement, and
his eare by it, and when he heard his sword
shake, it was an infallible signe that the watch
was near at that instant: then he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anions
took a tumbrel or dung-cart, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41088:201"/>
gave it the brangle, hurling it with all their
force down the hill, and so overthrew all the
poor watchmen like pigs, and then ran away
upon the other side; for in lesse then two
dayes, he knew all the streets, lanes and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>Paris,</hi> as well as his <hi>Deus det.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At another time he made in some faire
place, where the said watch was to passe, a
traine of gun-powder, and at the very instant,
that they went along, set fire to it, and
then made himself sport to see what good
grace they had in running away, thinking that
St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire had caught them by the legs.
As for the poor Masters of Arts, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
them above all others: when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered
with any of them upon the street,
he would not never faile to put some trick or
other upon them, sometimes putting the bit
of a fried turd in their graduate hoods: At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times pinning on little fox-tails, or hares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eares
behinde them, or some such other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
prank. One day that they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all to meet in the <hi>fodder-street,</hi> he made
a <hi>Borbonnesa</hi> tart, or filthy and slovenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
made of store of garlick, of <hi>Assa foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida,</hi>
of <hi>Castoreum,</hi> of dogs turds very warm,
which he steeped, temper'd and liquifi'd in the
corrupt matter of pockie biles, and pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
botches, and very early in the morning,
therewith anointed all the pavement, in such
sort, that the devil could not have endured it,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41088:201"/>
which made all these good people, there to
lay up their gorges, and vomit what was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their stomacks before all the world, as if
they had flayed the fox; and ten or twelve
of them died of the plague<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fourteen became
lepers, eighteen grew lousie, and above seven
and twenty had the pox but he did not care
a button for it. He commonly carried a whip
under his gowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewith he whipt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remission the pages, whom he found car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
wine to their Masters, to make them
mend their pace. In his coat he had above six
and twenty little fabs and pockets alwayes
full, one with some lead-water, and a little
knife as sharp as a glovers needle, wherewith
he used to cut purses: Another with some
kinde of bitter stuffe, which he threw into the
eyes of those he met: another with clotburrs,
penned with little geese or capons feathers,
which he cast upon the gowns and caps of
honest people: and often made them faire
hornes, which they wore about all the City,
sometimes all their life. Very often also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the womens <hi>French</hi> hoods would he stick
in the hind-part somewhat made in the shape
of a mans member. In another he had a
great many little hornes full of fleas and lice,
which he borrowed from the beggars of St.
<hi>Innocent,</hi> and cast them with small canes or
quills to write with, into the necks of the
daintiest Gentlewomen that he could finde,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41088:202"/>
yea even in the Church, for he never seated
himself above in the quire, but alwayes sate
in the body of the Church amongst the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
both at Masse, at Vespres, and at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
In another, he used to have good store
of hooks and buckles wherewlth he would
couple men and women together, that sate in
company close to one another, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those that wore gownes of crimson taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faties,
that when they were about to go
away, they might rent all their gownes. In
another, he had a squib furnished with tinder,
matches, stones to strike fire, and all other
tackling necessary for it: in another, two or
three burning glasses, wherewith he made
both men and women sometimes mad, and
in the Church put them quite out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
for he said that there was but an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistrophe,</hi>
or little more difference then of a
literal inversion between a woman, <hi>folle a la
messe,</hi> and <hi>molle a la fesse;</hi> that is, <hi>foolish at the
Masse,</hi> and <hi>of a pliant buttock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another he had a good deal of needles
and thread, wherewith he did a thousand
little devillish pranks. One time at the entry
of the Palace unto the great Hall, where a
certain gray Friar or <hi>Cordelier</hi> was to say
Masse to the Counsellors: He did help to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
him, and put on his vestments, but in
the accoutring of him, he sowed on his alb,
surplice or stole to his gowne and shirt, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41088:202"/>
then withdrew himself, when the said Lords
of the Court, or Counsellors came to heare
the said Masse; but when it came to the <hi>Ite,
missa est,</hi> that the poor <hi>Frater</hi> would have
laid by his <hi>stole</hi> or surplice (as the fashion then
was) he plucked off withal both his frock and
shirt which were well sowed together, and
therby stripping himself up to the very shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
shewed his <hi>bel vedere</hi> to all the world;
together with his <hi>Don Cypriano,</hi> which was
no small one, as you may imagine: and the
Friar still kept haling, but so much the more
did he discover himself, and lay open his
back-parts, till one of the Lords of the Court
said, How now, what's the matter? will this
faire Father make us here an offering of his
taile to kisse it? nay, St. <hi>Antonies</hi> fire kisse it
for us. From thenceforth it was ordained that
the poor Fathers should never disrobe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
any more before the world, but in their
vestry-room, or sextry, as they call it; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the presence of women, lest it should
tempt them to the sin of longing, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
desire. The people then asked, why it
was the Friars had so long and large genito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
the said <hi>Panurge</hi> resolved the <hi>Probleme</hi>
very neatly, saying, That which makes Asses
to have such great eares, is that their dams
did put no biggins on their heads, as <hi>Alliaco</hi>
mentioneth in his <hi>suppositions:</hi> by the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that which makes the genitories or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration-tooles
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41088:203"/>
of those faire <hi>Fraters</hi> so long
is, for that they ware no bottomed breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and therefore their jolly member having
no impediment, hangeth dangling at liberty,
as farre as it can reach, with a wigle-wagle
down to their knees, as women carry their
<hi>patinotre</hi> beads: and the cause wherefore they
have it so correspondently great, is, that in
this constant wig-wagging, the humours of
the body descend into the said member: for
according to the <hi>Legists,</hi> Agitation and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
motion is cause of attraction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> he had another pocket full of itching
powder, called <hi>stone-allum,</hi> whereof he would
cast some into the backs of those women,
whom he judged to be most beautiful and
stately, which did so ticklishly gall them, that
some would strip themselves in the open
view of the world, and others dance like a
cock upon hot embers, or a drumstick on a
taber: others again ran about the streets, and
he would run after them: to such as were in
the stripping veine, he would very civilly
come to offer his attendance, and cover
them with his cloak, like a courteous and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gracious man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> in another he had a little leather
bottle full of old oile, wherewith, when he
saw any man or woman in a rich new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
suit, he would grease, smutch and spoil
all the best parts of it under colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41088:203"/>
of touching them, saying, This is good
cloth, this is good sattin, good taffaties; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
God give you all that your noble heart
desireth; you have a new suit, <hi>pretty Sir;</hi>
and you a new gown, <hi>sweet Mistris,</hi> God give
you joy of it, and maintain you in all prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and with this would lay his hand upon
their shoulder, at which touch such a villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spot was left behinde, so enormously
engraven ro perpetuity in the very soule, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and reputation, that the devil himself
could never have taken it away: Then upon
his departing, he would say, <hi>Madam,</hi> take
heed you do not fall, for there is a filthy great
hole before you, whereinto if you put your
foot, you will quite spoile your self. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had all full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> very fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pulverised, in that power did he lay a faire
handkerchief curiously wrought, which he
had stollen from a pretty Seamstresse of the
Palace, in taking away a lowse from off her
bosome, which he had put there himself: and
when he came into the company of some
good Ladies, he would trifle them into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of some fine workmanship of bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
then immediately put his hand into their
bosome asking them, and this work, is it of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> or of <hi>Hainault;</hi> and then drew out
his handkerchief, and said, hold, hold, look
what work here is, it is of <hi>Foutaman</hi> or of
<hi>Foutarabia,</hi> and shaking it hard at their nose,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41088:204"/>
made them sneeze for foure houres without
ceasing: in the mean while he would fart like
a horse, and the women would laugh and
say, How now, do you fart, <hi>Panurge?</hi> No,
no, <hi>Madam</hi> (said he,) I do but tune my taile
to the plain song of the Musick, which you
make with your nose. In another he had a
picklock, a pellican, a crampiron, a crook,
and some other iron tooles, wherewith
there was no door nor coffer which he would
nor pick open. He had another full of little
cups, wherewith he played very artificially,
for he had his fingers made to his hand, like
those of <hi>Minerva</hi> or <hi>Arachne,</hi> and had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
cried <hi>Triacle.</hi> And when he changed
a teston, cardecu, or any other piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the changer had been more subtil then
a fox, if <hi>Panurge</hi> had not at every time made
sive or six sols, (that is some six or seven
pence) vanish away invisibly, openly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly,
without making any hurt or lesion,
whereof the changer should have felt nothing
but the winde.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How Panurge gained the pardons, and married
the old women, and of the suit in law
which he had at Paris.</head>
                  <p>ONe day I found <hi>Panurge</hi> very much out
of countenance, melancholick and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
which made me suspect that he had no
money; whereupon I said unto him, <hi>Panurge,</hi>
you are sick, as I do very well perceive by
your physiognomie, and I know the disease,
you have a flux in your purse; but take no
care I have yet seven pence half penny, that
never saw father nor mother, which shall
not be wanting, no more then the pox in your
necessity: whereunto he answered me, Well,
well, for money, one day <hi>I</hi> shall have but too
much; for I have a Philosophers stone, which
attracts money out of mens purses, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant
doth iron; but will you go with me
to gaine the pardons, said he? By my faith
(said he) I am no great pardon-taker in this
world; if <hi>I</hi> shall be any such in the other, <hi>I</hi>
cannot tell: yet let us go in Gods Name, it
is but one farthing more or lesse. But (said
he) lend me then a farthing upon interest.
No, no, (said I) <hi>I</hi> will give it you freely,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41088:205"/>
and from my hearr, <hi>Grates vobis dominos,</hi>
said he.</p>
                  <p>So we went along, beginning at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase,</hi>
and I got the pardons at the first boxe
only, for in those matters very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth
me: then did I say my small suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and the prayers of St. <hi>Brigid,</hi> but he
gained them at all the boxes, and alwayes
gave money to every one of the <hi>Pardoners;</hi>
from thence we went to our <hi>Ladies</hi> Church,
to St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> to St. <hi>Antonies,</hi> and so to the
other Churches, where there was a banquet
of pardons, for my part, I gained no more
of them: but he at all the boxes kissed the
relicks, and gave at every one: to be brief,
when we were returned, he brought me to
drink at the Castle-tavern, and there shewed
me ten or twelve of his little bags full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
at which I blest my self, and made the
signe of the Crosse, saying, Where have you
recovered so much money in so little time?
unto which he answered me, that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it out of the basins of the pardons; For
in giving them the first farthing (said he) I
put it in with such slight of hand, and so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
that it appeared to be a threepence;
thus with one hand I took three-pence, nine-pence
or six-pence at the least, and with the
other as much, and so thorough all the
Churches where we have been. Yea, but
(said I) you damn your self like a snake, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41088:205"/>
art withal a thief and sacrilegious perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
True (said he) in your opinion, but I am not
of that minde; for the Pardoners do give
me it, when they say unto me in presenting
the relicks to kisse, <hi>Centuplum accipies,</hi> that is,
that for one penny I should take a hundred;
for <hi>accipies</hi> is spoken according to the manner
of the Hebrewes, who use the future tense
in stead of the imperative, as you have in the
law, <hi>Diliges Dominum,</hi> that is, <hi>dilige:</hi> even
so when the Pardon-bearer sayes to me, <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuplum
accipies,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>centuplum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe;</hi>
and so doth <hi>Rabbi Kimy,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Aben
Ezra</hi> expound it, and all the <hi>Massorets, &amp; ibi
Bartholus.</hi> Moreover, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> gave me
fifteen hundred francks of yearly pension
(which in <hi>English</hi> money is a hundred and
fifty pounds) upon his Ecclesiastical revenues
and treasure, for having cured him of a canc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krous
botch, which did so torment him, that
he thought to have been a Cripple by it all
his life. Thus I do pay my self at my owne
hand (for otherways I get nothing) upon the
said Ecclesiastical treasure. Ho, my friend,
(said he) if thou didst know what advantage <hi>I</hi>
made, and how well <hi>I</hi> feathered my nest, by
the Popes bull of the Croisade, thou wouldest
wonder exceedingly. It was worth to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
six thousand <hi>florins</hi> (in <hi>English</hi> coine
six hundred pounds,) and what a devil is
become of them? (said <hi>I</hi>) for of that money
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41088:206"/>
thou hast not one half penny. They returned
from whence they came (said he,) they did no
mote but change their Master.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>I</hi> employed at least three thousand of
them (that is, three hundred pounds <hi>English,)</hi>
in marrying (not young Virgins; for they
finde but too many husbands) but great old
sempiternous trots, which had not so much
as one tooth in their heads; and that out of
the consideration <hi>I</hi> had, that these good old
women had very well spent the time of their
youth in playing at the close-buttock-game
to all commers, serving the foremost first, till
no man would have any more dealing with
them. And by G—<hi>I</hi> will have their skin-coat
shaken once yet before they die; by this
meanes, to one I gave a hundred florins, to
another six score, to another three hundred,
according to that they were infamous, detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and abominable; for by how much the
more horrible and execrable they were, so
much the more must I needs have given them,
otherwayes the devil would not have jum'd
them. Presently I went to some great and
fat wood-porters, or such like, and did my
self make the match, but before I did shew
him the old Hags, <hi>I</hi> made a faire muster to
him of the Crownes, saying, Good fellow,
see what <hi>I</hi> will give thee, if thou wilt but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to dufle, dinfredaille, or lecher it one
good time: then began the poor rogues to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41088:206"/>
gape like old mules, and I caused to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them a banquet, with drink of the
best, and store of spiceries, to put the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in rut and heat of lust. To be short, they
occupied all like good soules, only to those
that were horribly ugly and ill-favoured, I
caused their head to be put within a bag, to
hide their face.</p>
                  <p>Besides all this, I have lost a great deal in
suits of law: And what law-suits couldest thou
have? (said I) thou hast neither house norlands.
My friend, (said he) the Gentlewomen of
this City had found out, by the instigation
of the devil of hell, a manner of high-mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bands, and neckerchiefs for women, which
did so closely cover their bosomes, that men
could no more put their hands under; for
they had put the slit behinde, and those
neck-cloths were wholly shut before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the poor sad contemplative lovers were
much discontented. Upon a faire <hi>Tuesday,</hi> I
presented a Petition to the Court, making
my self a Party against the said Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and shewing the great interest that I
pretended therein, protesting that by the same
reason, <hi>I</hi> would cause the Codpeece of my
breeches to be sowed behinde, if the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur
would not take order for it. In summe, the
Gentlewomen put in their defences, shewed
the grounds they went upon, and constituted
their Atturney for the prosecuting of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41088:207"/>
cause, but <hi>I</hi> pursued them so vigorously, that
by a sentence of the Court it was decreed,
those high neckclothes should be no longer
worne, if they were not a little cleft and open
before, but it cost me a good summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<hi>I</hi> had another very filthy and beastly
processe against the dung-farmer (called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Fisi)</hi> and his Deputies, that they should
no more reade privily the pipe, punchon, nor
quart of sentences, but in faire full day, and
that in the fodder schools, in face of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Sophisters, where <hi>I</hi> was ordained to pay
the charges, by reason of some clause mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the relation of the Serjeant. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time <hi>I</hi> framed a complaint to the Court,
against the mules of the Presidents, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
and others, tending to this purpose,
that when in the lower Court of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
they left them to champ on their
bridles: some bibs were made for them,
that with their drivelling they might not
spoile the pavement, to the end, that the
Pages of the Palace might play upon it with
their dice, or at the game of coxbody,
at their own ease, without spoiling their
breeches at the knees; and for this <hi>I</hi> had
a faire decree, but it cost me deare. Now
reckon up what expence <hi>I</hi> was at in little
banquets, which from day to day <hi>I</hi> made
to the Pages of the Palace, and to what end,
said <hi>I?</hi> My friend (said he) thou hast no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41088:207"/>
passe-time at all in this world, <hi>I</hi> have more
then the King, and if thou wilt joyne thy
selfe with me, we will do the devil toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
No, no, (said <hi>I)</hi> by St. <hi>Adauras</hi>
that will <hi>I</hi> not, for thou wilt be hanged
one time or another: And thou (said he)
wilt be interred somtime or other; now which
is most honourable, the aire or the earth?
Ho, grosse pecore, whilest the Pages are at
their banqueting, <hi>I</hi> keep their mules, and
to some one <hi>I</hi> cut the stirrup-leather of
the mounting side, till it hang but by a
thin strap or thread, that when the great
puffe-guts of the Counsellor or some other
hath taken his swing to get up, he may fall
flat on his side like a pork, and so furnish
the Spectators with more then a hundred
francks worth of laughter. But <hi>I</hi> laugh yet
further, to think how at his home-coming
the Master-page is to be whipt like green rie,
which makes me not to repent what I have
bestowed in feasting them. In brief, he had
(as <hi>I</hi> said before) threescore and three wayes
to acquire mony, but he had two hundred and
fourteen to spend it, besides his drinking.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How a great Scholar of England would have
argued against Pantagruel, and was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by Panurge.</head>
                  <p>IN that same time, a certain learned man,
named <hi>Thaumast,</hi> hearing the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
of <hi>Pantagruels</hi> incomparable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
came out of his own countrey of
<hi>England,</hi> with an intent only to see him, to
try thereby, and prove, whether his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in effect was so great as it was reported
to be. In this resolution, being arrived at
<hi>Paris,</hi> he went forthwith unto the house of
the said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who was lodged in the
Palace of St. <hi>Denys,</hi> and was then walking in
the garden thereof with <hi>Panurge,</hi> philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
after the fashion of the Peripateticks.
At his first entrance he startled, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
out of his wits for feare, seeing him so
great, and so tall, then did he salute him cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
as the manner is, and said unto him,
Very true it is, (saith <hi>Plato</hi> the Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,)
that if the image and knowledge
of wisdom were corporeal and visible to the
eyes of mortals, it would stirre up all the
world to admire her: which we may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41088:208"/>
beleeve, that the very bare report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
scattered in the air, if it happen to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in to the eares of men, who for being stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and lovers of vertuous things, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Philosophers, doth not suffer them to
sleep nor rest in quiet, but so pricketh them
up, and sets them on fire, to run unto the
place where the person is, in whom the said
knowledge is said to have built her Temple,
and uttered her Oracles, as it was manifestly
shewen unto us in the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who
came from the utmost borders of the East
and Persian sea, to see the order of <hi>Solomons</hi>
house, and to heare his wisdom; in <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
who came out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> even unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
to see <hi>Solon;</hi> in <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
farre to visit the <hi>Memphitical</hi> Vatici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators;
in <hi>Platon,</hi> who went a great way off
to see the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Architas</hi>
of <hi>Tarentum;</hi> in <hi>Apollonius Tianeus,</hi> who
went as farre as unto Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> passed

and sailed over the great river <hi>Phison,</hi>

have we of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> whom to see and

from the Confines of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine; I</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41088:209"/>
dare not reckon my self in the number of
those so excellent persons, but well would
be called studious, and a lover, not only of
learning, but of learned men also: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
having heard the report of your so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
knowledge, <hi>I</hi> have left my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
my friends, my kindred and my house,
and am come thus farre, valuing at nothing
the length of the way, the tediousnesse of
the sea, nor strangenesse of the land, and
that only to see you, and to conferre with you
about some passages in Philosophy, of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancie,</hi>
and of the Cabalistick Art; whereof
<hi>I</hi> am doubtful, and cannot satisfie my minde,
which if you can resolve, <hi>I</hi> yield my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you for a slave henceforward, together
with all my posterity; for other gift have <hi>I</hi>
none, that I can esteem a recompence suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for so great a favour: I will reduce them
into writing, and to morrow publish them to
all the learned men in the City, that we may
dispute publickly before them.</p>
                  <p>But see in what manner, I mean that we
shall dispute: I will not argue <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi>
as do the sottish <hi>Sophisters</hi> of this town, and
other places; likewise I will not dispute after
the manner of the <hi>Academicks</hi> by declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
nor yet by numbers, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was
wont to do, and as <hi>Picus de la mirandula</hi> did
of late at <hi>Rome:</hi> but <hi>I</hi> will dispute by signes
only without speaking, for the matters are so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41088:209"/>
abstruse, hard and arduous, that words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the mouth of man, will never
be sufficient for unfolding of them to my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
May it therefore please your Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to be there, it shall be at the great Hall
of <hi>Navarre</hi> at seven a clock in the morning.
When he had spoke these words, <hi>Pantagruel</hi>
very honourably said unto him, Sir, of the
graces that God hath bestowed upon me, <hi>I</hi>
would not deny to communicate unto any
man to my power; for whatever comes from
him is good, and his pleasure is, that it should
be increased, when we come amongst men
worthy and fit to receive this celestial Manna
of honest literature: in which number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in this time (as <hi>I</hi> do already very
plainly perceive,) thou holdest the first rank,
<hi>I</hi> give thee notice that at all houres thou shalt
finde me ready to condescend to every one
of thy requests, according to my poor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
although <hi>I</hi> ought rather to learn of thee,
then thou of me, but as thou hast protested,
we will conferre of these doubts together, and
will seek out the resolution, even unto the
bottom of that undrainable Well, where <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi>
sayes the truth lies hidden: and <hi>I</hi> do
highly commend the manner of arguing which
thou hast proposed, to wit, by signes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking; for by this means thou and <hi>I</hi>
shall understand one another well enough,
and yet shall be free from this clapping of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41088:210"/>
hands, which these blockish Sophisters make,
when any of the Arguers hath gotten the
better of the Argument: Now to morrow
<hi>I</hi> will not faile to meet thee at the place and
houre that thou hast appointed, but let me
intreat thee that there be not any strife or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare
between us, and that we seek not the
honour and applause of men, but the truth
only: to which <hi>Thaumast</hi> answered, The Lord
God maintain you in his favour and grace,
and instead of my thankfulnesse to you, poure
down his blessings upon you, for that your
Highnesse and magnificent greatnesse, hath
not disdained to descend to the grant of the
request of my poor basenesse, so farewel till
to morrow? Farewel, said <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
you that read this present discourse,
think not that ever men were more elevated
and transported in their thoughts, then all
this night were both <hi>Thaumast</hi> and <hi>Pantagruel;</hi>
for the said <hi>Thaumast,</hi> said to the Keeper of
the house of <hi>Cluny,</hi> where he was lodged,
that in all his life he had never known himself
so dry, as he was that night. <hi>I</hi> think (said
he) that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> held me by the throat;
Give order, <hi>I</hi> pray you, that we may have
some drink, and see that some fresh water be
brought to us, to gargle my palat: on the
other side <hi>Pantagruel</hi> stretched his wits as high
as he could, entring into very deep and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meditations, and did nothing all that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41088:210"/>
night but dote upon, and turn over the book
of <hi>Beda, de numeris &amp; signis: Plotius</hi> book,

and a rabble of others, so long, that <hi>Panurge</hi>
said unto him,</p>
                  <p>My Lord, leave all these thoughts and go
to bed; for <hi>I</hi> perceive your spirits to be so
troubled by a too intensive bending of them,
that you may easily fall into some Quotidian
Fever, with this so excessive thinking and
plodding: but having first drunk five and
twenty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thirty good draughts, retire your
self and sleep your fill: for in the morning I
will argue against, and answer my Master
the <hi>Englishman;</hi> and if I drive him not <hi>ad
metam non loqui,</hi> then call me Knave: Yea,
but (said he) my friend <hi>Panurge,</hi> he is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously
learned, how wilt thou be able to
answer him? Very well, (answered <hi>Panurge)</hi>
I pray you talk no more of it, but let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
is any man so learned as the devils
are? No, indeed (said <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> withont
Gods especial grace: Yet for all that (said
<hi>Panurge)</hi> I have argued against them, gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and blanked them in disputation, and laid
them so squat upon their tailes, that I have
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41088:211"/>
made them look like Monkies; therefore
be assured, that to morrow I will make this
vain-glorious <hi>Englishman</hi> to skite vineger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the world. So <hi>Panurge</hi> spent the night
with tipling amongst the Pages, and played
away all the points of his breeches at <hi>primus
secundus,</hi> and at peck point (in <hi>French</hi> called
<hi>Lavergette.)</hi> Yet when the condescended on
time was come, he failed not to conduct his
Master <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to the appointed place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which (beleeve me) there was neither great
nor small in <hi>Paris</hi> but came, thinking with
themselves that this devillish <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who
had overthrown and vanquished in dispute
all these doting fresh-water Sophisters,
would now get full payment and be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to some purpose; for this <hi>Englishman</hi> is
a terrible bustler, and horrible coyle-keeper,
we will see who will be Conquerour, for he
never met with his match before.</p>
                  <p>Thus all being assembled, <hi>Thaumast</hi> stayed
for them, and then when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>
came into the Hall, all the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes,
Professors of Arts, Senior-Sophisters
and Batchelors began to clap their hands, as
their scurvie custome is. But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out with a loud voice, as if it had been the
sound of a double canon, saying, Peace.
with a devil to you, peace: by G—you
rogues, if you trouble me here, I will cut off
the heads of every one of your: at which words
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41088:211"/>
they remained all daunted and astonished,
like so many ducks, and durst not do so much
as cough, although they had swallowed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
pounds of feathers: withal they grew so
dry with this only voice, that they laid our
their tongues a full half foot beyond their
mouthes, as if <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had salted all
their throats. Then began <hi>Panurge</hi> to speak,
saying to the <hi>Englishman,</hi> Sir, are you come
hither to dispute contentiously in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
you have set down, or otherwayes
but to learn and know the truth? To which
answered <hi>Thaumast,</hi> Sir, no other thing
bronght me hither, but the great desire I had
to learn, and to kuow that of which <hi>I</hi> have
doubted all my life long, and have neither
found book nor man able to content me in
the resolution of those doubts which I have
proposed: and as for disputing contentiously,
I will not do it, for it is too base a thing, and
therefore leave it to those sottish <hi>Sophisters,</hi>
who in their disputes do not search for the
truth, but for contradiction only and debate.
Then said <hi>Panurge,</hi> if I who am but a mean
and inconsiderable disciple of my Master my
Lord <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> content and satisfie you in
all and every thing, it were a thing below my
said Master, wherewith to trouble him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it fitter that he be Chair-man, and sit
as a Judge and Moderator of our discourse
and purpose, and give you satisfaction in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41088:212"/>
things, wherein perhaps <hi>I</hi> shall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your expectation. Truly (said <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast)</hi>
it is very well said: begin then. Now
you must note that <hi>Panurge</hi> had set at the
end of his long Codpiece, a pretty tuft of
red silk, as also of white, green and blew, and
within it had put a faire orange.</p>

into the nostril of the same side, holding
his foure fingers streight out, and closed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
in a parallel line to the point of his nose,
shutting the left eye wholly, and making the
other wink with a profound depression of the
eye-brows and eye-lids. Then lifted he up
his left hand, with hard wringing and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth his foure fingers, and elevating
his thumb, which he held in a line directly
correspondent to the situation of his right
hand, with the distance of a cubit and a halfe
between them. This done, in the same forme
he abased towards the ground, both the one
and the other hand; Lastly, he held them in
the midst, as aiming right at the <hi>English</hi> mans
nose: And if <hi>Merourie,</hi> said the <hi>English</hi> man:
there <hi>Panurge</hi> interrupted him, and said, You

                  <p>Then made the <hi>English</hi> man this signe, his
left hand all open the lifted up into the aire,
then instantly shut into his fist the foure fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

length he placed upon the gristle of his nose:
Presently after, he lifted up his right hand all
open, and all open abased and bent it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
putting the thumb thereof in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place where the little finger of the left
hand did close in the fist, and the foure right

in his mouth, did very merrily warble it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
looking fixedly upon the <hi>English</hi> man.
The Divines, Physicians and Chirurgions
that were there, thought that by this signe
he would have inferred that the <hi>English</hi> man
was a Leper: the Counsellors, Lawyers and
Decretalists conceived, that by doing this he
would have concluded some kinde of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
felicity to consist in Leprosie, as the Lord
maintained heretofore,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> man for all this was nothing
daunted, but holding up his two hands in the
aire, kept them in such forme, that he closed
the three master-fingers in his fist, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his thumbs thorough his indical, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
and middle fingers, his auricularie or
little fingers remained extended and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41088:213"/>
out, and so presented he them to <hi>Panurge;</hi>
then joyned he them so, that the right thumb
touched the left, and the left little finger
touched the right. Hereat <hi>Panurge,</hi> without
speaking one word, lift up his hands and
made this signe.</p>
                  <p>He put the naile of the forefinger of his
left hand, to the naile of the thumb of the
same, making in the middle of the distance
as it were a buckle, and of his right hand shut
up all the fingers into his fist, except the
forefinger which he often thrust in and out
through the said two others of the left hand:
then stretched he out the forefinger, and
middle finger or medical of his right hand,
holding them asunder as much as he could,
and thrusting them towards <hi>Thaumast.</hi> Then
did he put the thumb of his left hand upon
the corner of his left eye, stretching out all
his hand like the wing of a bird, or the finne
of a fish, and moving it very daintily this way
and that way, he did as much with his right
hand upon the corner of his right eye. <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast</hi>
began then to waxe somewhat pale, and
to tremble, and made him this signe.</p>
                  <p>With the middle finger of his right hand,
he struck against the muscle of the palme or
pulp, which is under the thumb: then put he
the forefinger of the right hand in the like
buckle of the left, but he put it under and not
over, as <hi>Panurge</hi> did. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41088:214"/>
one hand against another, and blowed in
his palme, and put again the forefinger of his
right hand into the overture or mouth of the
left, pulling it often in and out; then held he
out his chinne, most intentively looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Thaumast.</hi> The people there which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
nothing in the other signes, knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well what therein he demanded (without
speaking a word to <hi>Thaumast,)</hi> What do you
mean by that? In effect, <hi>Thaumast</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to sweat great drops, and seemed to all
the Spectators a man strangely ravished in
high contemplation. Then he be thought
himself, and put all the nailes of his left hand
against those of his right, opening his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
as if they had been semicircles, and with
this signe lift up his hands as high as he could.
Whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> presently put the thumb
of his right hand under his jawes, and the
little finger thereof in the mouth of the left
hand, and in this posture made his teeth to
sound very melodiously, the upper against
the lower. With this <hi>Thaumast</hi> with great
toile and vexation of spirit rose up, but in
rising let a great bakers fart, for the bran
came after, and pissing withal very strong vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger,
stunk like all the devils in hell: the
company began to stop their noses; for he
had conskited himself with meer anguish and
perplexity. Then lifted he up his right hand,
clunching it in such sort, that he brought the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41088:214"/>
ends of all his fingers to meet together, and
his left hand he laid flat upon his breast:
whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> drew out his long Codpiece
with his tuffe, and stretched it forth a cubit
and a half, holding it in the aire with his right
hand, and with his left took out his orange,
and casting it up into the aire seven times, at
the eight he hid it in the fist of his right hand,
holding it steadily up on high, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to shake his faire Codpiece, shewing it to
<hi>Thaumast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Thaumast</hi> began to puffe up
his two cheeks like a player on a bagpipe, and
blew as if he had been to puffe np a pigs blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> put one finger of
his left hand in his nockandrow, by some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
St. <hi>Patricks</hi> hole, and with his mouth
suck't in the aire, in such a manner as when
one eats oysters in the shell, or when we sup
up our broth: this done, he opened his
mouth somewhat, and struck his right hand
flat upon it, making therewith a great and a
deep sound as if it came from the superficies
of the midriffe through the <hi>trachiartere</hi> or
pipe of the lungs, and this he did for sixteen
times; but <hi>Thaumast</hi> did alwayes keep blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a goose. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger
of his right hand into his mouth, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it very hard to the muscles thereof; then
he drew it out, aud withal made a great
noise, as when little boyes shoot pellets out
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41088:215"/>
of the pot-canons made of the hollow sticks
of the branch of an aulder-tree, and he did
it nine times.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Thaumast</hi> cried out, Ha, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
a great secret; with this he put in his
hand up to the elbow; then drew out a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that he had, holding it by the point down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> took his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
and shook it as hard as he could against
his thighes; then put his two hands intwined
in manner of a combe upon his head, laying
out his tongue as farre as he was able; and
turning his eyes in his head, like a goat that
is ready to die. Ha, I understand (said <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast)</hi>
but what? making such a signe, that he
put the haft of his dagger against his breast,
and upon the point thereof the flat of his
hand, turning in a little the ends of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
whereat <hi>Panurge</hi> held down his
head on the left side, and put his middle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
into his right eare, holding up his thumb
bolt upright; then he crost his two armes
upon his breast, and coughed five times, and
at the fifth time he struck his right foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the ground: then he lift up his left
arme, and closing all his fingers into his fist,
held his thumbe against his forehead, striking
with his right hand six times against his breast.
But <hi>Thaumast,</hi> as not content therewith, put
the thumb of his left hand upon the top of
his nose, shutting the rest of his said hand:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41088:215"/>
whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi> set his two Master-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
upon each side of his mouth, drawing
it as much as he was able, and widening it so,
that he shewed all his teeth: and with his two
thumbs pluck't down his two eye-lids very
low, making therewith a very ill-favour'd
countenance, as it seemed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                  <p>THen <hi>Thaumast</hi> rose up, and putting off
his cap, did very kindly thank the said
<hi>Panurge,</hi> and with a loud voice said unto all
the people that were there, My Lords,
Gentlemen and others, at this time may I to
some good purpose speak that Evangelical
word, <hi>Et ecce plus quàm Salomon hîc:</hi> You have
here in your presence an incomparable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that is, my Lord <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> whose
great renown hath brought me hither, out of
the very heart of <hi>England,</hi> to conferre with
him about the insoluble problemes, both in
<hi>Magick, Alchymie,</hi> the <hi>Caballe, Geomancie,
Astrologie</hi> and <hi>Philosophie,</hi> which I had in my
minde: but at present I am angry, even with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41088:216"/>
fame it self, which I think was envious to
him, for that it did not declare the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth
part of the worth that indeed is in
him: You have seen how his disciple only
hath satisfied me, and hath told me more
then <hi>I</hi> asked of him: besides, he hath opened
unto me, and resolved other inestimable
doubts, wherein I can assure you he hath to
me discovered the very true Well, Fountain
and Abysse of the <hi>Encyclopedeia</hi> of learning;
yea in such a sort, that I did not think I
should ever have found a man that could
have made his skill appear, in so much as the
first elements of that concerning which we
disputed by signes, without speaking either
word or half word. But in fine, I will reduce
into writing that which we have said and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the world may not take them to
be fooleries, and will thereafter cause them
to be printed, that every one may learne as
I have done. Judge then what the Master
had been able to say, seeing the disciple hath
done so valiantly; for, <hi>Non est discipulus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Magistrum.</hi> Howsoever God be praised,
and <hi>I</hi> do very humbly thank you, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that you have done us at this Act: God
reward you for it eternally: the like thanks
gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to all the company, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence, he carried <hi>Thaumast</hi> to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with him, and beleeve that they drank
as much as their skins could hold, or, as the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41088:216"/>
phrase is, with unbottoned bellies, (for in
that age they made fast their bellies with
buttons, as we do now the colars of our
doublets or jerkins) even till they neither
knew where they were, nor whence they
came. Blessed Lady, how they did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse
it, and pluck (as we say) at the Kids
leather: and flaggons to trot, and they to
toote, Draw, give (page) some wine here reach
hither, fill with a devil, so? There was
not one but did drink five and twenty or
thirty pipes, can you tell how? even <hi>Sicut

and besides, that they were very dry. In

set down by <hi>Thaumast:</hi> and the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

                  <head type="sub">How Panutge was in love with a Lady of
Paris.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PAnurge</hi> began to be in great reputation
in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> by means of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
wherein he pre vailed against the
<hi>English</hi> man, and from thenceforth made his
Codpiece to be very useful to him, to which
effect he had it pinked with pretty little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries
after the <hi>Romanesca</hi> fashion; And
the world did praise him publickly, in so farre
that there was a song made of him, which
little children did use to sing, when they went
to fetch mustard: he was withal made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in all companies of Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
so that at last he became presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and went about to bring to his lure one
of the greatest Ladies in the City: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
leaving a rabble of long prologues and
protestations, which ordinarily these dolent
contemplative Lent-lovers make, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meddle with the flesh; one day he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, <hi>Madam,</hi> it would be a very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to the Common-wealth, delightful to
you, honourable to your progeny, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for me, that I cover you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41088:217"/>
of my race, and beleeve it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will teach it you: the Lady at this
word thrust him back above a hundred
leagues, saying, You mischievous foole, is
it for you to talk thus unto me? whom do
you think you have in hand? be gone, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to come in my sight again; for if one
thing were not, I would have your legs and
armes cut off. Well, (said he) that were all
one to me, to want both legs and armes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
you and <hi>I</hi> had but one merry bout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
at the brangle buttock-game; for
here within is (in shewing her his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece)
Master <hi>Iohn Thursday,</hi> who will play
you such an <hi>Antick,</hi> that you shall feel the
sweetnesse thereof even to the very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of your bones: He is a gallant, and
doth so well know how to finde out all the
corners, creeks and ingrained inmates in your
carnal trap, that after him there needs no
broom, he'l sweep so well before, and leave
nothing to his followers to work upon:
whereunto the Lady answered, Go, vill in,
go, if you speak to me one such word more, <hi>I</hi>
will cry out, and make you to be knocked
down with blowes. Ha, (said he) you are
not so bad as you say, no, or else <hi>I</hi> am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in your physiognomie, for sooner
shall the earth mount up unto the Heavens,
and the highest Heavens descend unto the
Hells, and all the course of nature be quite
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41088:218"/>
perverted, then that in so great beauty and
neatnesse as in you is, there should be one
drop of gall or malice: they say indeed, that
hardly shall a man ever see a faire woman that
is not also stubborn: yet that is spoke only
of those vulgar beauties, but yours is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
so singular, and so heavenly, that I
beleeve nature hath given it you as a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
and master-piece of her Art, to make us
know what she can do, when she will imploy
all her skill, and all her power. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in you but honey, but sugar, but a
sweet and celestial Manna: to you it was, to
whom <hi>Paris</hi> ought to have adjudged the
golden Apple, not to <hi>Venus,</hi> no, nor to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
nor to <hi>Minerva;</hi> for never was there so
much magnificence in <hi>Iuno,</hi> so much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in <hi>Minerva;</hi> nor so much comelinesse in
<hi>Venus,</hi> as there is in you. O heavenly <hi>gods</hi>
and <hi>goddesses!</hi> how happy shall that man be to
whom you will grant the favour to embrace
her, to kisse her, and to rub his bacon with
hers? by G-. that shall be I, I know it well;
for she loves me already her belly full, I am
sure of it, and so was I predestinated to it by
the <hi>Fairies:</hi> and therefore that we lose no
time, put on, thrust out your gamons, and
would have embraced her, but she made as if
she would put out her head at the window, to
call her neighbours for help. Then <hi>Panurge</hi>
on a sudden ran out, and in his running away,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41088:218"/>
said, <hi>Madam,</hi> stay here till I come again, I
will go call them my self, do not you take so
much paines: thus went he away not much
caring for the repulse he had got, nor made
he any whit the worse cheer for it. The next
day he came to the Church, at the time that
she went to Masse, at the door he gave her
some of the holy water, bowing himself ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
low before her, afterwards he kneeled
down by her very familiarly, and said unto
her, <hi>Madam,</hi> know that I am so amorous of
you, that I can neither pisse nor dung for
love: <hi>I</hi> do not know <hi>(Lady,)</hi> what you mean,
but if <hi>I</hi> should take any hurt by it, how much
would you be too blame? Go, said she, go, <hi>I</hi>
do not care, let me alone to say my prayers.
<hi>I</hi> but (said he) equivocate upon this; <hi>a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
le viconte,</hi> or to faire mount the pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunts:
<hi>I</hi> cannot, said she: It is, said he, <hi>a beau
con le vit monte,</hi> or to a faire C—the pr—
mounts: and upon this pray to God to give
you that which your noble heart desireth,
and <hi>I</hi> pray you give me these patenotres.
Take them (said she) &amp; trouble me no longer:
this done, she would have taken off her pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres,
which were made of a kinde of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
stone called <hi>Cestrin,</hi> and adorned with
great spots of gold, but <hi>Panurge</hi> nimbly drew
out one of his knives, wherewith he cut
them off very handsomly, and whilest he was
going away to carry them to the Brokers, he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41088:219"/>
said to her, Will you have my knife? No, no,
said she: But (said he) to the purpose, <hi>I</hi> am
at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your commandment, body and goods,
tripes and bowels.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Lady was not very
well content with the want of her patinotres;
for they were one of her implements to keep
her countenance by in the Church: then
thought with her self, this bold flowting Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
is some giddy, fantastical, light-headed
foole of a strange countrey; <hi>I</hi> shall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my patenotres again, what will my
husband say, he will no doubt be angry with
me; but I will tell him that a thief hath cut
them off from my hands in the Church, which
he will easily beleeve, seeing the end of the
riban left at my girdle. After dinner <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>
went to see her carrying in his sleeve a
great purse full of Palace-crowns called
counters, and began to say unto her, Which
of us two loveth other best, you me, or I
you? whereunto she answered, As for me, I
do not hate you; for as God commands, I
love all the world: But to the purpose, (said
he) are not you in love with me? I have (said
she) told you so many times already, that you
should talk so no more to me, and if you
speak of it again, I will teach you, that I am
not one to be talked unto dishonestly: get
you hence packing, and deliver me my pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres,
that my husband may not ask me for
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41088:219"/>
How now, <hi>(Madam)</hi> said he, your pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notres?
nay, by mine oath I will not do so,
but I will give you others; had you rather
have them of gold well enameled in great
round knobs, or after the manner of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knots,
or otherwise all massive, like great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi>
or if you had rather have them of <hi>Ebene,</hi>
of <hi>Iacinth,</hi> or of <hi>grained</hi> gold, with the marks
of fine <hi>Turkoises,</hi> or of faire <hi>Topazes,</hi> marked
with fine <hi>Saphirs,</hi> or of <hi>baleu Rubies,</hi> with
great marks of <hi>Diamonds</hi> of eight and twenty
squares? No, no, all this is too little; I know
a faire bracelet of fine <hi>Emeraulds,</hi> marked with
spotted <hi>Ambergris,</hi> and at the buckle a <hi>Persian
pearle</hi> as big as an Orange: it will not cost
above five and twenty thousand ducates, I
will make you a present of it, for <hi>I</hi> have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
coine enough, and withal he made a noise
with his counters as if they had been <hi>French</hi>
Crownes.</p>
                  <p>Will you have a piece of velvet, either of
the violet colour, or of crimson died in
graine: or a piece of broached or crimson
sattin? will you have chaines, gold, tablets,
rings? You need no more but say, Yes, so
farre as fifty thousand ducates may reach, it is
but as nothing to me; by the vertue of which
words he made the water come in her mouth:
but she said unto him, No, I thank you, <hi>I</hi>
will have nothing of you. By G—said he,
but I will have somewhat of you; yet shall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41088:220"/>
it be that which shall cost you nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall you have a jot the lesse, when you
have given it, hold, (shewing his long Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece)
this is Master <hi>Iohn Good fellow,</hi> that
askes for lodging, and with that would have
embraced her; but she began to cry out, yet
not very loud. Then <hi>Panurge</hi> put off his
counterfeit garb, changed his false visage, and
said unto her, You will not then otherwayes
let me do a little, a turd for you, you do not
deserve so much good, nor so much honour:
but by G—I will make the dogs ride you,
and with this he ran away as fast as he could,
for feare of blowes, whereof he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fearful.</p>

were in the Church came running to this
Lady with the smell of the drugs that he had
strowed upon her, both small and great, big

smelling to her, and pissing every where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, it was the greatest villainy in the

and withdrew himself into some Chappel or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41088:221"/>
Oratory of the said Church, to see the sport;
for these villainous dogs did compisse all her
habiliaments, and left none of her attire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besprinkled
with their staling, in so much
that a tall grey-hound pist upon her head,
others in her sleeves, others on her crupper-piece,
and the little ones pissed upon her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines:
so that all the women that were round
about her had much ado to save her. Whereat
<hi>Panurge</hi> very heartily laughing, he said to
one of the Lords of the City, <hi>I</hi> beleeve that
the same Lady is hot, or else that some grey-hound
hath covered her lately. And when he
saw that all the dogs were flocking about her,
yarring at the retardment of their accesse to
her, and every way keeping such a coyle with
her, as they are wont to do about a proud or
salt bitch, he forthwith departed from thence,
and went to call <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> not forgetting
in his way alongst all the streets, thorough
which he went, where he found any dogs
to give them a bang with his foot, saying, Will
you not go with your fellowes to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
Away, hence, avant, avant, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
avant: And being come home, he said to
<hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, <hi>I</hi> pray you come and see
all the dogs of the countrey, how they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
about a Lady, the fairest in the City,
and would dufle and line her; whereunto
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> willingly condescended, and saw
the mystery, which he found very pretty and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41088:222"/>
strange: But the best was at the Procession,
in which were seen above six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and fourteen dogs about her, which
did very much trouble and molest her, and
whithersoever she past, those dogs that came
afresh, tracing her footsteps, followed her at
the heeles, and pist in the way where her
gown had touched. All the world stood ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
at this spectacle, considering the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of those dogs, who leaping up got
about her neck, and spoiled all her gorgeous
accoutrements, for the which she could finde
no remedy, but to retire unto her house,
which was a Palace: Thither she went, and
the dogs after her; she ran to hide her self,
but the Chamber-maids could not abstaine
from laughing. When she was entered into
the house, and had shut the door upon her
self, all the dogs came running, of halfe a
league round, and did so well bepisse the
gate of her house, that there they made a
stream with their urine, wherein a duck might
have very well swimmed, and it is the same
current that now runs at St. <hi>Victor,</hi> in which
<hi>Gobelin</hi> dieth scarlet, for the specifical vertue
of these pisse-dogs, as our Master <hi>Doribus</hi> did
heretofore preach publickly. So may God
help you; a Mill would have ground corne
with it; yet not so much as those of <hi>Basacle</hi>
at <hi>Toulouse.</hi>

newes, that the Dipsodes had invaded the
Land of the Amaurots: and the
cause wherefore the leagues are
so short in France.</head>
                  <p>A Little while after <hi>Pantagruel</hi> heard
newes that his father <hi>Gargantua</hi> had been
translated into the land of the Fairies by
<hi>Morgue,</hi> as heretofore were <hi>Oger</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi>
together, and that the report of his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being spread abroad, the <hi>Dipsodes</hi> had is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
out beyond their borders, with inrodes
had wasted a great part of <hi>Utopia,</hi> and at that
very time had besieged the great City of the
<hi>Amaurots;</hi> whereupon departing from <hi>Paris,</hi>
without bidding any man farewel, for the
businesse required diligence, he came to
<hi>Rowen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Pantagruel</hi> in his journey, seeing that
the leagues of that little territory about <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
called <hi>France,</hi> were very short in regard of
those of other Countreys, demanded the cause
and reason of it from <hi>Panurge,</hi> who told him
a story which <hi>Marotus</hi> set down of the <hi>lac
Monachus,</hi> in the acts of the Kings of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narre,</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41088:223"/>
saying, that in old times Countreys
were not distinguished into leagues, miles,
furlongs, nor parasanges, until that King
<hi>Pharamond</hi> divided them, which was done in
manner as followeth. The said King chose at
<hi>Paris</hi> a hundred faire, gallant, lustie, briske
young men, all resolute and bold adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in <hi>Cupids</hi> duels, together with a hundred
comely, pretty, handsome, lovely and well
complexioned wenches of <hi>Picardie,</hi> all which
he caused to be well entertained, and highly
fed for the space of eight dayes; then having
called for them, he delivered to every one
of the young men his wench, with store of
money to defray their charges, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
besides, to go unto divers places
here and there, and wheresoever they should
biscot and thrum their wenches, that thy
setting a stone there, it should be accounted
for a league: thus went away those brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
and sprightly blades most merrily, and
because they were fresh, and had been at
rest, they very often jum'd and fanfreluched
almost at every sields end, and this is the
cause why the leagues about <hi>Paris</hi> are so
short; but when they had gone a great way,
and were now as weary as poor devils, all the
oile in their lamps being almost spent, they
did not chink and dufle so often, but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, <hi>(I</hi> mean for the mens part,)
with one scurvie paultry bout in a day, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41088:223"/>
this is that which makes the leagues in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
Delanes, Germany,</hi> and other more
remote Countreys so long: other men
give other reasons for it, but this seems to
me of all other the best. To which <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
willingly adhered. Parting from <hi>Rowen,</hi>
they arrived at <hi>Honfleur,</hi> where they took
shipping, <hi>Pantagruel, Panurge, Epistemon, Eust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi>
and <hi>Carpalim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which place, waiting for a favourable
winde, and caulking their ship, he received
from a Lady of <hi>Paris</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept, and entertained a good long time,)
a letter directed on the out-side thus, <hi>To the

                  <head type="sub">A Letter which a messenger brought to Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel
from a Lady of Paris, together
with the exposition of a Posie, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in a gold Ring.</head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had read the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
he was much amazed, and
therefore demanded of the said messenger
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41088:224"/>
the name of her that had sent it: then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he the letter, and found nothing written
in it, nor otherwayes inclosed, but only a
gold ring, with a square table-diamond.
Wondering at this, he called <hi>Panurge</hi> to
him, and shewed him the case; whereupon
<hi>Panurge</hi> told him, thar the leafe of paper was
written upon, but with such cunning and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
that no man could see the writing at
the first sight, therefore to finde it out he set
it by the fire, to see if it was made with <hi>Sal
Armoniack</hi> soaked in water; then put he it
into the water, to see if the letter was written
with the juice of <hi>Tithymalle:</hi> after that he
held it up against the candle, to see if it was
written with the juice of white onions.</p>
                  <p>Then he rubbed one part of it with oile
of nuts, to see if it were not written with the
lee of a fig-tree: and another part of it with
the milk of a woman giving suck to her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
daughter, to see if it was written with the
blood of red toads, or green earth-frogs:
Afterwards he rubbed one corner with the
ashes of a Swallowes nest, to see if it were not
written with the dew that is found within the
herb <hi>Alcakengie,</hi> called the winter-cherry. He
rubbed after that one end with eare-wax, to
see if it were not written with the gall of a
Raven: then did he dip it into vineger, to
try if it was not written with the juice of the
garden <hi>Spurge:</hi> After that he greased it with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41088:224"/>
the fat of a bat or flittermouse, to see if it
was not written with the sperm of a whale,
which some call ambergris: Then put it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fairly into a basin full of fresh water, and
forthwith took it out, to see whether it were
written with stone-allum: But after all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
when he perceived that he could
finde out nothing, he called the messenger,
and asked him, Good fellow, the Lady that
sent thee hither, did she not give thee a staffe
to bring with thee? thinking that it had been
according to the conceit, whereof <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
maketh mention, and the Messenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, <hi>No, Sir.</hi> Then <hi>Panurge</hi> would
have caused his head to be shaven, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lady had written upon his bald pate,
with the hard lie whereof sope is made, that
which she meant; but perceiving that his hair
was very long, he forbore, considering that
it could not have grown to so great a length
in so short a time.</p>
                  <p>Then he said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Master, by the
vertue of G—I cannot tell what to do nor
say in it; for to know whether there be any
thing written upon this or no; <hi>I</hi> have made
use of a good part of that which Master <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco
di Nianto,</hi> the <hi>Tuscan</hi> sets down, who
hath written the manner of reading letters
that do not appear; that which <hi>Zoroastes</hi>
published, <hi>peri grammaton acriton;</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurnius

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:41088:225"/>
can see nothing, nor do I beleeve that there
is any thing else in it then the Ring: let us
therefore look upon it, which when they had
done, they found this in <hi>Hebrew</hi> written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>Lamach sabathani;</hi> whereupon they called
<hi>Epistemon,</hi> and asked him what that meant?
to which he answered, that they were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
words, signifying, <hi>Wherefore hast thou
forsaken me?</hi> upon that <hi>Panurge</hi> suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
<hi>I</hi> know the mystery, do you see this
diamond? it is a false one; this then is the
exposition of that which the Lady meanes,
<hi>Diamant faux,</hi> that is, false lover, why hast
thou forsaken me? which interpretation <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>
presently understood, and withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering,
that at his departure he had not
bid the Lady farewel, he was very sorry, and
would faine have returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> to make
his peace with her; but <hi>Epistemon</hi> put him in
minde of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s departure from <hi>Dido,</hi>
and the saying of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi>
That the ship being at anchor when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
we must cut the cable rather then lose
time about untying of it, and that he should
lay aside all other thoughts to succour the
City of his Nativity, which was then in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and indeed within an houre after that,
the winde arose at the North-north-west,
wherewith they hoised saile, and put out, even

by <hi>Melli,</hi> by the <hi>Cap di buona Speranza,</hi>

somewhat more.</p>
                  <p>When they were ashore, and pretty well
refreshed, <hi>Panurge</hi> said, Gentlemen, the City

what is to be done, that we be not like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi>
who never took counsel until after

(said he) there is but one thing that keeps my

this, that I know not in what order nor of

should go forward, and set on with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

thrust my self in with a grave and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick

                  <p>AS he was speaking this, they perceived
six hundred and threescore light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
gallantly mounted, who made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
thither, to see what ship it was that was
newly arrived in the harbour, and came in a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:41088:227"/>
full gallop to take them if they had been
able: Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> my Lads, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
your selves unto the ship, here are some
of our enemies coming apace, but I will kill
them here before you like beasts, although
they were ten times so many, in the meane
time withdraw your selves, and take your
sport at it. Then answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> No,
Sir, there is no reason that you should do so,
but on the contrary retire you unto the ship,
both you and the rest; for I alone will here
discomfit them, but we must not linger,
come, set forward; whereunto the others
said, It is well advised, Sir, withdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you know what we are able to do: Then
said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Well, I am content, but if
that you be too weak, <hi>I</hi> will not faile to come
to your assistance. With this <hi>Panurge</hi> took
two great cables of the ship, and tied them to
the kemstock or capstane which was on the
deck towards the hatches, and fastened them
in the ground, making a long circuit, the one
further off, the other within that. Then said he
to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Go aboard the ship, and when <hi>I</hi>
give you a call, turn about the capstane upon
the orlop diligently, drawing unto you the
two cable-ropes: and said to <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> and
to <hi>Carpalin, My Bullies,</hi> stay you here, and
offer your selves freely to your enemies, do
as they bid you, and make as if you would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41088:227"/>
yield unto them: but take heed you come
not within the compasse of the ropes, be
sure to keep your selves free of them; and
presently he went aboard the ship, and took
a bundle of straw, and a barrel of gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
strowed it round about the compasse of
the cordes, and stood by with a brand of
fire or match lighted in his hand. Presently
came the horsemen with great fury, and the
foremost ran almost home to the ship, and
by reason of the slipperinesse of the bank,
they fell they and their horses, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of foure and fourty, which the rest see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
came on, thinking that resistance had
been made them at theit arrival: But <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>
said unto them, My Masters, <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that you have hurt your selves, <hi>I</hi> pray
you pardon us, for it is not our fault, but the
slipperinesse of the sea-water, that is alwayes
flowing; we submit our selves to your good
pleasure; so said likewise his two other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and <hi>Epistemon</hi> that was upon the deck;
in the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> withdrew himselfe,
and seeing that they were all within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the cables, and that his two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
were retired, making room for all those
horses which came in a croud, thronging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the neck of one another to see the ship,
and such as were in it cried out on a sudden
to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Draw, draw: then began <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi>
to winde about the capstane, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41088:228"/>
whereof the two cables so intangled and
impestered the legs of the horses, that they
were all of them thrown down to the
ground easily, together with their Riders:
but they seeing that, drew their swords, and
would have cut them: whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi>
set fire to the traine, and there burnt them up
all like damned souls, both men and horses,
not one escaping save one alone, who being
mounted on a fleet <hi>Turkie</hi> courser, by meere
speed in flight got himself out of the circle of
the ropes; but when <hi>Carpalin</hi> perceived him,
he ran after him with such nimblenesse and
celerity, that he overtook him in lesse then a
hundred paces; then leaping close behinde
him upon the crupper of his horse, clasped
him in his armes, and brought him back to
the ship.</p>
                  <p>This exploit being ended <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was
very jovial, and wondrously commended
the industry of these Gentlemen, whom he
called his fellow-souldiers, and made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
themselves, and feed well and merrily
upon the sea-shore, and drink heartily with
their bellies upon the ground, and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

that familiarity: only that the poor devil
was somewhat afraid that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> would
have eaten him up whole, which, considering
the widenesse of his mouth, and capacity of
his throat, was no great matter for him to

he was rising up to go about it, he perceived
under the side of a wood a fair great roe-buck,
which was come out of his Fort (as I conceive)
at the sight of <hi>Panurge</hi>'s fire: him did he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
and run after with as much vigour and
swiftnesse, as if it had been a bolt out of a
Crossebowe, and caught him in a moment;
and whilest he was in his course, he with his
hands took in the aire foure great bustards,
seven bitterns, six and twenty gray partridges,

nine woodcocks, nineteen herons, two
and thirty coushots and ring-doves; and with
his feet killed ten or twelve hares and rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,
which were then at relief, and pretty
big withal, eighteen rayles in a knot toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with fifteen young wilde boares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two
little Bevers, and three great foxes: so stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Kid with his fauchion athwart the
head he killed him, and bearing him on his
back, he in his return took up his hares, rayls,
and young wilde boares, and as far off as he
could be heard, cried out, &amp; said, <hi>Panurge</hi> my
friend, vineger, vineger: then the good <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi>
thinking he had fainted, commanded
them to provide him some vineger; but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>
knew well that there was some good
prey in hands, and forthwith shewed unto
noble <hi>Pantagruel</hi> how he was bearing upon
his back a faire roe-buck, and all his girdle
bordered with hares; then immediately did
<hi>Epistemon</hi> make in the name of the nine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nine antick wooden spits: <hi>Eusthenes</hi> did
help to flay, and <hi>Panurge</hi> placed two great
cuirasier saddles, in such sort that they served
for Andirons and making their prisoner to
be their Cook, they roasted their venison by
the fire, wherein the horsemen were burnt:
and making great chear with a good deal of
vineger, the devil a one of them did forbear
from his victuals, it was a triumphant and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41088:229"/>
incomparable spectacle, to see how they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
and devoured. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>
Would to God every one of you had two
paires of little <hi>Anthem</hi> or <hi>Sacring</hi> bells hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at your chin, and that <hi>I</hi> had at mine the
great clocks of <hi>Renes,</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> and
of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to see what a peale they would
ring with the wagging of our chaps; But, said
<hi>Panurge,</hi> it were better we thought a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our businesse, and by what meanes we
might get the upper hand of our enemies:
That is well remembered, said <hi>Pantagruel;</hi>
therefore spoke he thus to the prisoner, My
friend, tell us here the truth, and do not lie
to us at all, if thou wouldest not be flayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
for it is <hi>I</hi> that eat the little children: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto us at full the order, the number and
the strength of the Army: to which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
answered, Sir, know for a truth that in
the army there are three hundred giants, all
armed with armour of proof, and wonderful
great: neverthelesse, not fully so great as
you, except one that is their head, named
<hi>Loup-garou,</hi> who is armed from head to foot
with <hi>Cyclopical</hi> annuils; furthermore, one
hundred threescore and three thousand foot,
all armed with the skins of hobgoblins, strong
and valiant men: eleven thousand foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men at armes or cuirasiers: three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
six hundred double canons, and harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers
without number; fourescore and

fourteen thousand Pioneers: one hundred
and fifty thousand whores, faire like goddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(that is, for me said <hi>Panurge,)</hi> whereof
some are <hi>Amazons,</hi> some <hi>Lionnoises,</hi> others
<hi>Parisiennes, Taurangelles, Angevines, Poicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
Normandes,</hi> and high <hi>dutch,</hi> there are

                  <p>Yea, but (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> is the King
there? Yes Sir, (said the prisoner) he is
there in person, and we call him <hi>Anarchus,</hi>
King of the <hi>Dipsodes,</hi> which is as much to
say as thirsty people, for you never saw men
more thirsty, nor more willing to drink, and
his tent is guarded by the Giants: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
(said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> come brave boyes,
are you resolved to go with me? To which
<hi>Panurge</hi> answered, God confound him that
leaves you: I have already bethought my self
how I will kill them all like pigs, and so the
devil one leg of them shall escape: but I am
somewhat troubled about one thing: And
what is that? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge)</hi>
how I shall be able to set forward to
the jusling and bragmardising of all the
whores that be there this afternoon, in such
sort, that there escape not one unbumped by
me, breasted and jum'd after the ordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of man and woman, in the Venetian
conflict. Ha, ha, ha, ha, said <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Carpalin</hi> said; The devil take these
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41088:230"/>
sink-holes, if by G—I do not bumbast
some one of them: Then said <hi>Eusthenes,</hi>
What shall not I have any, whose paces since
we came from <hi>Rowen,</hi> were never so well
winded up, as that my needle could mount
to ten or eleven a clock till now, that <hi>I</hi> have
it hard, stiffe and strong, like a hundred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?
Truly, (said <hi>Panurge,)</hi> thou shalt have
of the fattest, and of those that are most
plump, and in the best case.</p>
                  <p>How now? (said <hi>Epistemon)</hi> every one shall
ride, and <hi>I</hi> must lead the Asse, the devil
take him that will do so, we will make use of
the right of warre, <hi>Qui potest capere, capiat:</hi>
No, no, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> but tie thine Asse to
a crook, and ride as the world doth: And
the good <hi>Pantagruel</hi> laughed at all this, and
said nnto them, You reckon without your
host; I am much afraid, that before it be
night I shall see you in such taking, that you
will have no great stomach to ride, but more
like to be rode upon, with sound blowes of
pike and lance: <hi>Baste,</hi> (said <hi>Epistemon)</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of that, I will not faile to bring them
to you, either to roste or boile, to fry or put
in paste: they are not so many in number,

whistle, and most joyfully cried out aloud, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
live <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that,
he would have done as much; but with the
fart that he let, the earth trembled nine
leagues about, wherewith and with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
aire, he begot above three and fifty
thousand little men, ill favoured dwarfes,
and with one fisg that he let, he made as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41088:233"/>
little women, crouching down, as you
shall see in divers places, which never grow
but like Cowes tailes downwards, or like the
<hi>Limosin</hi> radishes, round. How now (said
<hi>Panurge)</hi> are your farts so fertile and fruitful?
by G— here be brave farted men, and fisgued
women, let them be married together, they
will beget fine hornets and dorflies; so did
<hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and called them Pygmies; those
he sent to live in an island thereby, where
since that time they are increased mightily:
but the cranes make warre with them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
against which they do most couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
defend themselves; for these little
ends of men and dandiprats, (whom in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
they call whiphandles, and knots of a
tarre-barrel) are commonly very teastie and
cholerick: the Physical reason whereof is,
because their heart is near their spleen.</p>
                  <p>At this same time, <hi>Panurge</hi> took two
drinking glasses that were there, both of one
bignesse, and filled them with water up to
the brim, and set one of them upon one stool,
and the other upon another, placing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five foot from one another: then he
took the staffe of a javelin, about five foot
and a half long, and put it upon the two glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
so that the two ends of the staffe did
come just to the brims of the glasses: This
done, he took a great stake or billet of wood,
and said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and to the rest: <hi>My

Masters,</hi> behold, how easily we shall have
the victory over our euemies; for just as I
shall break this staffe here upon these glasses,
without either breaking or crazing of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nay, which is more, without spilling one
drop of the water that is within them, even
so shall we break the heads of our <hi>Dipsodes,</hi>
without receiving any of us any wound or
losse in our person or goods: but that you
may not think there is any <hi>witchcraft</hi> in this;
hold (said he to <hi>Eusthenes)</hi> strike upon the
midst as hard as thou canst with this log:
<hi>Eusthenes</hi> did so, and the staffe broke in two
pieces, and not one drop of the water fell
out of the glasses: Then said he, I know a

to invade my countrey, wherein <hi>Pantagruel</hi>

would not give consent, but commanded
him to depart thence speedily, and be gone,
as he had told him, and to that effect gave
him a box full of <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> together with
some grains of the black <hi>chameleon thistle,</hi>
steeped into <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> and made up into the

that his end was not to rob nor ransom men,
but to enrich them, and reduce them to total
liberty; Go thy way (said he) in the peace
of the living God, and never follow evil
company, lest some mischief befall thee. The

that we will not assault them till to morrow at

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41088:235"/>
all the six hundred and nine and fifty horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and he alone escaped to bring the news:
besides that, he was charged by the said Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
to tell him, that the next day about noon
he must make a dinner ready for him, for at
that houre he was resolved to set upon him:
then did he give him that boxe wherein were
those confitures; but assoon as he had swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down one spoonful of them, he was taken
with such a heat in the throat, together with
an ulceration in the flap of the top of the
winde-pipe, that his tongue peel'd with it, in
such sort that for all they could do unto him,
he found no ease at all, but by drinking only
without cessation, for assoon as ever he took
the goble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a fire, and therefore they did nothing but
still poure in wine into his throat with a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
which when his Captains, <hi>Bashawes,</hi> and
guard of his body did see, they tasted of the
same drugs, to try whether they were so
thirst-procuring and alterative or no: but it
so befell them as it had done their King, and
they plied the flaggon so well, that the noise
ran throughout all the Camp, how the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
was returned, that the next day they
were to have an assault, that the King and his
Captains did already prepare themselves for
it, together with his guards, and that wiah
carowsing lustily, and quaffing as hard as
they could, every man therefore in the army
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41088:235"/>
began to tipple, ply the pot, swill and guzzle
it as fast as they could. In summe, they drunk
so much, and so long, that they fell asleep
like pigs, all out of order throughout the
whole Camp.</p>
                  <p>Let us now return to the good <hi>Pantagruel,</hi>
and relate how he carried himself in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
departing from the place of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies:</hi>
he took the mast of their ship in his
hand like a Pilgrims staffe, and put within
the top of it two hundred and seven and
thirty poinsons of white wine of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the
rest was of <hi>Rowen,</hi> and tied up to his girdle
the bark all full of salt, as easily as the <hi>Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennets</hi>
carry their little panniers, and to set
onward on his way with his fellow-souldiers.
When he was come near to the enemies
Camp, <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto him, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you
would do well, let down this white wine of
<hi>Anjou,</hi> from the scuttle of the mast of the
ship, that we may all drink thereof, like <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereunto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> very willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and they drank so neat, that there was
not so much as one poor drop left, of two
hundred and seven and thirty punchons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one <hi>Boracho</hi> or leathern bottle of <hi>Tours,</hi>
which <hi>Panurge</hi> filled for himself, (for he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that his <hi>vade mecum,)</hi> and some scurvie
lees of wine in the bottom, which served him
in stead of vineger. After they had whitled
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41088:236"/>
and curried the canne pretty handsomely;
<hi>Panurge</hi> gave <hi>Pantagruel</hi> to eate some devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
drugs, compounded of <hi>Lithotripton,</hi>
(which is a stone-dissolving ingredient,) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrocatarticon,</hi>
(that purgeth the reines) the
marmalade of Quinces, (called <hi>Codiniac)</hi>
a confection of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> (which are green
flies breeding on the tops of olive-trees) and
other kindes of <hi>diuretick</hi> or pisse-procuring
simples. This done, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palin,</hi>
Go into the City, scrambling like a
cat up against the wall, as you can well do,
and tell them that now presently they come
out, and charge their enemies as rudely as
they can, and having said so, come down ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a lighted torch with you, wherewith
you shall set on fire all the rents and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Camp, then cry as loud as you are
able with your great voice, and then come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from thence. Yea but, said <hi>Carpalin,</hi> were
it not good to cloy all their ordnance? No,
no, (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> only blow up all their
powder. <hi>Carpalin</hi> obeying him, departed
suddenly, and did as he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and all the Combatants came
forth that were in the City, and when he had
set fire in the tents and pavillions, he past so
lightly through them, and so highly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
did they snort and sleep, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perceived him. He came to the place
where their Artillery was, and set their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41088:236"/>
on fire: but here was the danger, the
fire was so sudden, that poor <hi>Carpalin</hi> had
almost been burnt; and had it not been for
his wonderful agility, he had been fried like
a roasting pig: but he departed away so speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that a bolt or arrow out of a Crossebowe
could not have had a swifter motion. When
he was clear of their trenches, he shooted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,
and cried out so dreadfully, and with
such amazement to the hearers, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the devils of hell had been let loose:
at which noise the enemies awaked, but can
you tell how? even no lesse astonished the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Pantagruel</hi> began to sowe
the salt that he had in his bark, and because
they slept with an open gaping mouth, he
filled all their throats with it, so that those
poor wretches were by it made to cough like
foxes. Ha, <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> how thou addest great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
heat to the firebrand that is in us. Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> had will to pisse, by meanes of
the drugs which <hi>Panurge</hi> had given him, and
pist amidst the Camp so well and so copiously,
that he drowned them all, and there was a
particular deluge, ten leagues round about, of
such considerable depth, that the history

and pist likewise, it would undoubtedly have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41088:237"/>

but they were deceived in thinking <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruels</hi>

for they could not see but by the
light of the fire of the pavillions, and some

                  <p>The enemies after that they were awaked,
seeing on one side the fire in the Camp, and
on the other the inundation of the urinal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
could not tell what to say, nor what to
think; some said, that it was the end of the
world, and the final judgement, which ought
to be by fire: Others again thought that the
sea-gods, <hi>Neptune, Protheus, Triton,</hi> and the
rest of them did persecute them, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> Sir, yonder are the Giants co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

you mast gallantly like an old Fencer; for
now is the time that you must shew your self
a brave man and an honest. And for our

why, <hi>David</hi> killed <hi>Goliah</hi> very easily; and
then, this great Lecher <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> who is
stronger then foure oxen, will not spare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

(said <hi>Pantagruel,)</hi> of courage <hi>I</hi> have more
then for fifty francks, but let us be wise, for
<hi>Hercules</hi> first never undertook against two;
that is well cack'd, well scummered, (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge)</hi>
do you compare your self with <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les?</hi>
You have by G—more strength in your
teeth, and more sent in your bum, then ever
<hi>Hercules</hi> had in all his body and soule: so much
is a man worth as he esteems himself. Whilest
they spake those words behold, <hi>Lougarou</hi> was
come with all his Giants, who seeing <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
in a manner alone, was carried away
with temerity and presumption, for hopes
that he had to kill the good man; whereupon
he said to his companions the Giants, You
Wenchers of the low countrey, by <hi>Mahoom,</hi>
if any of you undertake to fight against these
men here, I will put you cruelly to death: it is
my will that you let me fight single, in the
mean time you shall have good sport to look
upon us: then all the other Giants retired
with their King, to the place where the flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
stood, and <hi>Panurge</hi> and his <hi>Camerades</hi>
with them, who counterfeited those that have
had the pox, for he wreathed about his mouth,
shrunk up his fingers, and with a harsh and
hoarse voice said unto them, I forsake—od
(fellow souldiers) if I would have it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
that we make any warre at all; Give
us somewhat to eat with you, whilest our
Masters fight against one another; to this the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41088:238"/>
King and Giants joyntly condescended, and
accordingly made them to banquet with
them. In the mean time <hi>Panurge</hi> told them
the follies of <hi>Turpin,</hi> the examples of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi>
and the tale of a tub. <hi>Loupgarou</hi> then
set forward towards <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> with a
mace all of steel, and that of the best sort,
weighing nine thousand seven hundred kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and two quarterons, at the end whereof
were thirteen pointed diamonds, the least
whereof was as big as the greatest bell of our
<hi>Ladies</hi> Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> (there might want
perhaps the thicknesse of a naile, or (at most
that <hi>I</hi> may not lie) of the back of those
knives which they call cut-lugs or eare-cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but for a little off or on, more or lesse, it
is no matter) and it was inchanted in such
sort, that it could never break, but contrarily
all that it did touch, did break immediately.
Thus then as he approached with great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pride of heart: <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> casting
up his eyes to heaven, recommended himself
to God with all his soule, making such a Vow
as followeth.</p>
                  <p>O thou Lord God, who hast alwayes been
my Protectour, and my Saviour, thou seest
the distresse wherein I am at this time: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
brings me hither but a natural zeale,
which thou hast permitted unto mortals, to
keep and defend themselves, their wives and
children, countrey and family, in case thy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41088:239"/>
own proper cause were not in question, which
is the faith; for in such a businesse thou wilt
have no Coadjutors, only a Catholick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and service of thy Word, and hast
forbidden us all arming and defence; for
thou art the Almighty, who in thine owne
cause, and where thine own businesse is taken
to heart, canst defend it far beyond all that
we can conceive, thou who hast thousand
thousands of hundreds of millions of legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Angels, the least of which is able to
kill all mortal men, and turn about the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and earth at his pleasure, as heretofore
it very plainly appeared in the army of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi>
if it may please thee therefore at this
time to assist me, as my whole trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is in thee alone: <hi>I</hi> VOW unto thee, that
in all Countreys whatsoever, wherein <hi>I</hi> shall
have any power or authority, whether in this
of <hi>Utopia,</hi> or elsewhere, <hi>I</hi> will cause thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gospel to be purely, simply and entirely
preached, so that the abuses of a rabble of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
and false prophets, who by humane
constitutions, and depraved inventions, have
impoisoned all the world, shall be quite exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
from about me. This Vow was no

from heaven, saying, <hi>Hoc fac, &amp; vinces:</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Do this, and thou shalt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:41088:239"/>
with his mouth wide open was drawing near
to him, went against him boldly, and cried
out as loud as he was able, Thou diest, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
thou diest, purposing by his horrible
cry to make him afraid, according to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Withal, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
cast at him out of his bark which
he wore at his girdle, eighteen cags, and foure
bushels of salt, wherewith he filled both his
mouth, throat, nose and eyes: at this <hi>Loup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garou</hi>
was so highly incensed, that most
fiercely setting upon him, he thought even
then with a blow of his mace to have beat out
his braines: but <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was very nimble,
and had alwayes a quick foot, and a quick
eye, and therefore with his left foot did he
step back one pace, yet not so nimbly, but
that the blow falling upon the bark, broke it
in foure thousand, fourescore and six pieces,
and threw all the rest of the salt about the
ground: <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing that, most gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
displayed the vigour of his armes, and
according to the Art of the axe, gave him
with the great end of his mast a homethrust a
little above the breast: then bringing along
the blow to the left side, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lash struck
him between the neck and shoulders: After
that, advancing his right foot, he gave him a
push upon the couillons, with the upper end
of his said mast, wherewith breaking the
scuttle, on the top thereof he spilt three or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41088:240"/>
foure punchons of wine that were left
therein.</p>
                  <p>Upon that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> thought that he had
pierced his bladder, and that the wine that
came forth had been his urine: <hi>Pantagruel</hi>
being not content with this, would have
doubled it by a side-blow; but <hi>Loupgarou</hi> lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his mace, advanced one step upon
him, and with all his force would have dash't
it upon <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> wherein (to speak the
truth) he so sprightfully carried himself, that
if God had not succoured the good <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi>
he had been cloven from the top of
his head to the bottom of his milt, but the
blow glanced to the right side, by the brisk
nimblenesse of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and his mace
sank into the ground above threescore and
thirteen foot, through a huge rock, out of
which the fire did issue greater then nine
thousand and six tuns. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> seeing him
busie about plucking out his mace, which
stuck in the ground between the rocks, ran
upon him, and would have clean cut off his
head, if by mischance his mast had not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a little against the stock of <hi>Loupgarous</hi>
mace, which was inchanted, as we have said
before: by this meanes his mast broke off
about three handfuls above his hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he stood amazed like a Bell-Founder, and
cried out, Ah <hi>Panurge,</hi> where art thou? <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>
seeing that, said to the King and the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41088:240"/>
Giants, By G—they will hurt one another, if
they be not parted; but the Giants were as
merry as if they had been at a wedding: then
<hi>Carpalin</hi> would have risen from thence to
help his Master; but one of the Giants said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, By <hi>Golfarin</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Mahoon,</hi>
if thou stir hence I will put thee in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of my breeches, in stead of a Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
which cannot chuse but do me good;
for in my belly I am very costive, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well <hi>cagar,</hi> without gnashing my teeth,
and making many filthy faces. Then <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi>
thus destitute of a staffe, took up the
end of his mast, striking athwart and alongst
upon the Giant, but he did him no more
hurt then you would do with a filip upon a
Smiths Anvil. In the time <hi>Loupgarou</hi> was
drawing his mace out of the ground, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already plucked it out, was ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to have struck <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> who being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
quick in turning, avoided all his blowes,
in taking only the defensive part in hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
on a sudden he saw that <hi>Loupgarou</hi> did
threaten him with these words, saying, Now,
villain, will not I faile to chop thee as small as
minced meat, and keep thee henceforth from
ever making any more poor men athirst; for
then without any more ado, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck
him such a blow with his foot against the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he made him fall backwards, his heels
over his head, and dragged him thus along at
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41088:241"/>
flay-buttock above a flight-shot. Then
<hi>Loupgarou</hi> cried out, bleeding at the throat,
<hi>Mahoon, Mahoon, Mahoon,</hi> at which noise all
the Giants arose to succour him: but <hi>Panurge</hi>
said unto them, Gentlemen, do not go, if
you will beleeve me, for our Master is mad,
and strikes athwart and alongst, he cares not
where, he will do you a mischief; but the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
made no account of it, seeing that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
had never a staffe.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw those Giants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
very near unto him, he took <hi>Loupga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi>
by the two feet, and lift up his body like
a pike in the aire, wherewith (it being harnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Anvils) he laid such heavy load a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those Giants, armed with free stone,
that striking them down as a Mason doth
little knobs of stones, there was not one of
them that stood before him, whom he threw
not flat to the ground, and by the breaking of
this stony armour there was made such a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
rumble, as put me in minde of the fall
of the butter-tower of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> at <hi>Bourge,</hi>
when it melted before the Sunne. <hi>Punurge,</hi>
with <hi>Carpalin</hi> and <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> did cut in the
mean time the throats of those that were
struck down; in such sort that there escaped
not one. <hi>Pantagrnel</hi> to any mans sight was
like a Mower, who with his sithe (which was
<hi>Loupgarou,)</hi> cut down the meddow grasse (to
wit the Giants,) but with this fencing of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruels,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41088:241"/>
Loupgarou</hi> lost his head, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> struck down one
whose name was <hi>Riftandouille</hi> or pudding-plunderer,
who was armed <hi>cap-a-pe</hi> with
grison stones, one chip whereof splintring
abroad cut off <hi>Epistemons</hi> neck clean and
faire: for otherwise the most part of them
were but lightly armed with a kinde of sandie
brittle stone, and the rest with slaits: at last
when he saw that they were all dead, he threw
the body of <hi>Loupgarou,</hi> as hard as he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the City, where falling like a frog up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his belly, in the great <hi>piazza</hi> thereof, he
with the said fall killed a singed he-cat, a wet
she-cat, a farting duck, and a brideled goose.</p>

finely healed by Panurge, and of the newes
which he brought from the devils, and
the damned people in hell.</head>
                  <p>THis Gigantal victory being ended,
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> withdrew himself to the
place of the flaggons, and called for <hi>Panurge</hi>
and the rest, who came unto him safe and
sound, except <hi>Eusthenes,</hi> (whom one of the
Giants had scratched a little in the face,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41088:242"/>
whilst he was about the cutting of his throat,
&amp; <hi>Epistemon,</hi> who appeared not at all: whereat
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> was so aggrieved that he would
have killed himself; but <hi>Panurge</hi> said unto
him, Nay, Sir, stay a while, and we will search
for him amongst the dead, and finde out the
truth of all: thus as they went seeking after
him, they found him stark dead, with his
head between his armes all bloody. Then
<hi>Eusthenes</hi> cried out, Ah cruel death! hast
thou taken from me the perfectest amongst
men? At which words <hi>Pantagruel</hi> rose up
with the greatest grief that ever any man did
see, and said to <hi>Panurge,</hi> Ha, my friend, the
prophecy of your two glasses, and the jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
staffe was a great deal too deceitful, but
<hi>Panurge</hi> answered, My dear bullies all, weep
not one drop more, for he being yet all hot,
<hi>I</hi> will make him as sound as ever he was; in
saying this, he took the head, and held it
warme fore-gainst his Codpiece, that the
winde might not enter into it, <hi>Eusthenes</hi> and
<hi>Carpalin</hi> carried the body to the place where
they had banqueted, not out of any hope
that ever he would recover, but that <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
might see it.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him very good
comfort, saying, If I do not heale him, I will
be content to lose my head (which is a fooles
wager,) leave off therefore crying, and help
me. Then cleansed he his neck very well
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41088:242"/>
with pure white wine, and after that, took
his head, and into it <hi>synapised</hi> some powder
of <hi>diamerdis,</hi> which he alwayes carried about
him in one of his bags. Afterwards, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed
it with I know not what ointment,
and set it on very just, veine against veine, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
against sinew, and spondyle against
spondyle, that he might not be wry-necked,
(for such people he mortally hated, this
done, he gave it round about some fifteen
or sixteen stitches with a needle, that it
might not fall off again, then on all sides,
and every where he put a little ointment on
it, which he called <hi>resuscitati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Suddenly <hi>Epistemon</hi> began to breath, then
opened his eyes, yawned, sneezed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
let a great houshold fart; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Panurge</hi> said, Now certainly he is healed,
and therefore gave him to drink a large full
glasse of strong white wine, with a fugred
toast. In this fashion was <hi>Epistemon</hi> finely
healed, only that he was somewhat hoarse for
above three weeks together, and had a dry
cough of which he could not be rid, but by
the force of continual drinking: and now he
began to speak, and said that he had seen the
divel, had spoken with <hi>Lucifer</hi> familiarly,
and had been very merry in hell, and in the
<hi>Elysian</hi> fields, affirming very seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them all, that the devils were boone
companions, and merry fellowes: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41088:243"/>
of the damned, he said he was very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that <hi>Panurge</hi> had so soon called him back
into this world again; for (said he) I took
wonderful delight to see them: How so?
said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> because they do not use them
there (said <hi>Epistemon)</hi> so badly as you think
they do: their estate and condition of living
is but only changed after a very strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
for I saw <hi>Alexander</hi> the great there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
and patching on clowts upon old
breeches and stockins, whereby he got but a

with him very courteously, and <hi>I</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be intreated, we tipled and chopined
together most theologically. In the mean
time came <hi>Cyrus</hi> to beg one farthing of him

a few onions for his supper? No, no, said
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> I do not use in my almes-giving to

exceeding glad to have met with such a

who when he came to his Master the Pye-maker,
told him that they had taken away his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41088:246"/>

him such a sound lash with an eele-skin, that
his own would have been worth nothing to
make bag-pipe-bags of. <hi>I</hi> saw Master <hi>Iohn le
maire,</hi> there personate the Pope in such fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he made all the poor Kings and Popes
of this world kisse his feet, and taking great
state upon him, gave them his benediction,
saying, Get the pardons, rogues, get the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
they are good cheap: I absolve you
of bread and pottage, and dispense with you
to be never good for any thing: then calling
<hi>Caillet</hi> and <hi>Triboulet,</hi> to him, he spoke these
words, My Lords the Cardinals dispatch
their bulls, to wit, to each of them a blow
with a Cudgel upon the reines, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
was forthwith performed.</p>
                  <p>I heard Master <hi>Francus Villon</hi> ask <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
How much the messe of mustard? A farthing,
said <hi>Xerxes:</hi> to which the said <hi>Villon</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
The pox take thee for a villain: as much
of square-ear'd wheat is not worth half that
price, and now thou offerest to inhance the
price of victuals: with this he pist in his pot
as the mustard-makers of <hi>Paris</hi> use to do. I
saw the trained bowe-man of the bathing tub,
(known by the name of the <hi>Francarcher de
baignolet)</hi> who being one of the trustees of
the Inqusition, when he saw <hi>Pierce Forrest</hi>
making water against a wall, in which was
painted the fire of St. <hi>Antonie,</hi> declared him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41088:246"/>
heretick, and would have caused him to be
burnt alive, had it not been for <hi>Morgant,</hi>
who for his <hi>Proficiat</hi> and other small fees gave
him nine tuns of beer. Well (said <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,)</hi>
reserve all these faire stories for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, only tell us how the Usurers are
there handled: I saw them (said <hi>Epistemon)</hi>
all very busily employed in seeking of rustie
pins, and old nailes in the kennels of the
streets, as you see poor wretched rogues do
in this world; but the <hi>quintal</hi> or hundred
weight of this old iron ware, is there valued
but at the price of a cantle of bread, and yet
they have but a very bad dispatch and rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in the sale of it: thus the poor Misers
are sometimes three whole weeks, without
eating one morsel or crumb of bread, and yet
work both day and night looking for the
faire to come: neverthelesse, of all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
toile and misery they reckon nothing,
so cursedly active they are in the prosecution
of that their base calling, in hopes at the
end of the yeare, to earne some scurvie
penny by it.</p>
                  <p>Come, (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> let us now make
our selves merry one bout, and drink (my
Lads) <hi>I</hi> beseech you, for it is very good
drinking all this moneth: then did they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
their flaggons by heaps and dozens, and
with their leaguer-provision made excellent
good chear: but the poor King <hi>Anarchus</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41088:247"/>
could not all this while settle himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any fit of mirth; whereupon <hi>Panurge</hi>
said, Of what trade shall we make my Lord
the King here, that he may be skilful in the
Art, when he goes thither to sojourn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the devils of hell? Indeed (said
<hi>Pantagruel)</hi> that was well advised of thee, do
with him what thou wilt: I give him to
thee: Grammercie (said <hi>Panurge)</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is not to be refused, and I love it from
you.</p>

King Anarchus to an old Lantern-carrying
Hag, and made him a
Cryer of green sauce.</head>
                  <p>AFter this wonderful victory, <hi>Pantagruel</hi>
sent <hi>Carpalin</hi> unto the City of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maurots,</hi>
to declare and signifie unto them
how the King <hi>Anarchus</hi> was taken prisoner,
and all the enemies of the City overthrown,
which news when they heard, all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the City came forth to meet him in
good order, and with a great triumphant
pomp, conducting him with a heavenly joy
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41088:247"/>
into the City, where innnumerable bone-fires
were set on, thorough all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and faire round tables which were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with store of good victuals, set out in
the middle of the streets; this was a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the golden age in the time of <hi>Saturn,</hi>
so good was the cheere which then they
made.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having assembled the
whole Senate, and Common Councel-men
of the town, said (My Masters) we must now
strike the iron whilest it is hot; it is therefore
my will, that before we frolick it any longer,
we advise how to assault and take the whole
Kingdom of the <hi>Dipsodes:</hi> to which effect let
those that will go with me provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against to morrow after drinking; for
then will I begin to march, not that <hi>I</hi> need
any more men then I have to help me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it; for I could make it as sure that way
as if <hi>I</hi> had it already, but <hi>I</hi> see that City is so
full of inhabitants, that they scarce can turn
in the streets; <hi>I</hi> will therefore carry them as
a Colonie into <hi>Dipsodie,</hi> and will give them all
that Countrey, which is faire, wealthie, fruitful
and pleasant, above all other Countreys in the
world as many of you can tell who have been
there heretofore every one of you therefore
that will go along, let him provide himself as
<hi>I</hi> have said. This counsel and resolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
published in the City, the next morning
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41088:248"/>
there assembled in the <hi>piazza,</hi> before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
to the number of eighteen hundred fifty
six thousand and eleven, besides women and
little children: thus began they to march
straight into <hi>Dipsodie,</hi> in such good order as
did the people of <hi>Israel</hi> when they departed
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to passe over the red-sea.</p>
                  <p>But before we proceed any further in this
purpose, I will tell you how <hi>Panurge</hi> handled
his prisoner the King <hi>Anarchus:</hi> for having
remembred that which <hi>Epistemon</hi> had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how the Kings and rich men, in this
world were used in the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields, and how
they got their living there by base and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
trades; he therefore one day apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his King in a pretty little canvass doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
all jagged and pinked like the tippet of
a light horsemans cap, together with a paire
of large Mariners breeches, and stockins
without shoes; For (said he) they would but
spoile his sight; and a little peach-coloured
bonnet, with a great capons feather in it: I
lie, for <hi>I</hi> think he had two: and a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
girdle of a sky-colour and green, (in
<hi>French</hi> called <hi>pers &amp; vert)</hi> saying, that such a
livery did become him well, for that he had
alwayes been <hi>perverse:</hi> and in this plight
bringing him before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> said unto
him, Do you know this royster? No indeed,
said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> It is (said <hi>Panurge)</hi> my Lord,
the King of the three batches, or thread-bare
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41088:248"/>
sovereign: <hi>I</hi> intend to make him an honest
man. These devillish Kings which we have
here are but as so many calves, they know
nothing, and are good for nothing, but to
do a thousand mischiefs to their poor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and to trouble all the world with warre
for their unjust and detestable pleasure: I
will put him to a trade, and make him a
Crier of green sauce: Go to, begin and
cry, <hi>Do you lack any green sauce?</hi> and the poor
wretch cried: That is too low (said <hi>Panurge;)</hi>
then took him by the eare, saying, Sing higher
in <hi>Gesolreut:</hi> So, so, (poor wretch) thou hast
a good throat: thou wert never so happy as
to be no longer King: and <hi>Pantagruel</hi> made
himself merry with all this; for I dure bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that he was the best little gaffer that
was to be seen between this and the end of a
staffe. Thus was <hi>Anarchus</hi> made a good
Crier of green sauce, two dayes thereafter
<hi>Panurge</hi> married him with an old Lanterne-carrying
Hag, and he himselfe made the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with fine sheeps-heads, brave haslets
with mustard, gallant salligots with garlick,
of which he sent five horse-loads unto <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel,</hi>
which he ate up all, he found them so
appetizing: and for their drink, they had a
kinde of small well-watered wine, and some
sorbapple-cider: and to make them dance he
hired a blinde man, that made musick to them
with a windbroach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:41088:249"/>
After dinner he led them to the Palace,
and shewed them to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and said,
pointing to the married woman, You need
not feare that she will <hi>crack:</hi> Why? said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi>
Because, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> she is well
slit and broke up already; What do you mean
by that? said <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Do not you see?
said <hi>Panurge,</hi> that the chestnuts which are
roasted in the fire, if they be whole, they
<hi>crack</hi> as if they were mad; and to keep them
from <hi>cracking,</hi> they make an incision in them,
and slit them; so this new Bride is in her lower
parts well slit before, and therefore will not
crack behinde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave them a little lodge near the
lower street, and a mortar of stone wherein
to bray and pound their sauce, and in this
manner did they do their little businesse, he
being as pretty a Crier of green sauce, as
ever was seene in the Countrey of <hi>Utopia:</hi>
but <hi>I</hi> have been told since that his wife doth
beat him like plaister, and the poor sot dare
not defend himself, he is so simple.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How Pantagruel with his tongue covered a
whole Army, and what the Author saw in
his mouth.</head>
                  <p>THus as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> with all his Army
had entered into the Countrey of the
<hi>Dipsodes,</hi> every one was glad of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
rendred themselves unto him,
bringing him out of their own good wills the
Keyes of all the Cities where he went, the
<hi>Almirods</hi> only excepted, who being resolved
to hold out against him, made answer to his
Heraulds that they would not yield but upon
very honourable and good conditions.</p>
                  <p>What? (said <hi>Pantagruel)</hi> do they ask any
better termes, then the hand at the pot, and
the glasse in their fist? Come let us go sack
them, and put them all to the sword: then
did they put themselves in good order, as
being fully determined to give an assault, but
by the way passing through a large field, they
were overtaken with a great shower of raine,
whereat they began to shiver and tremble,
to croud, presse and thrust close to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
When <hi>Pantagruel</hi> saw that, he made
their Captains tell them, that it was nothing,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41088:250"/>
and that he saw well above the clouds, that
it would be nothing but a little dew; but
howsoever, that they should put themselves
in order, and he would cover them: then did
they put themselves in a close order, and
stood as near to other as they could: and
<hi>Pantagruel</hi> drew out his tongue only half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
and covered them all, as a hen doth
her chickens. In the mean time I, who
relate to you these so veritable stories,
hid my self under a burdock-leafe, which was
not much lesse in largenesse then the arch of
the bridge of <hi>Montrible;</hi> but when I saw
them thus covered, I went towards them to
shelter my self likewise, which I could not do;
for that they were so (as the saying is) <hi>At the
yards end there is no cloth left.</hi> Then as well
as <hi>I</hi> could, I got upon it, and went along full
two leagues upon his tongue, and so long
marched, that at last I came into his mouth:
but oh gods and goddesses, what did I see
there? <hi>Iupiter</hi> confound me with his trisulk
lightning if I lie: I walked there as they do
in <hi>Sophie</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and saw there
great rocks like the mountains in <hi>Denmark,</hi> I
beleeve that those were his teeth, <hi>I</hi> saw also
faire meddows, large forrests, great and strong
Cities, not a jot lesse then <hi>Lyons</hi> or <hi>Poictiers,</hi>
the first man <hi>I</hi> met with there, was a good
honest fellow planting coleworts, whereat
being very much amazed, <hi>I</hi> asked him, My
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41088:250"/>
friend, what dost thou make here? I plant
coleworts, said he: But how, and wherewith
said I? Ha Sir, said he, every one cannot have
his ballocks as heavy as a mortar, neither can
we be all rich: thus do <hi>I</hi> get my poor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and carry them to the market to sell in
the City which is here behinde Jesus! (said
<hi>I)</hi> is there here a new world? Sure (said he)
it is never a jot new, but it is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that without this there is an earth,
whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of
a Sunne and a Moone, and that it is full of,
and replenished with very good commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but yet this is more ancient then
that: Yea, but (said I) my friend, what is
the name of that City, whither thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
thy Coleworts to sell? It is called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharage,</hi>
(said he) and all the indwellers are
Christians, very honest men, and will make
you good chear. To be brief, I resolved
to go thither. Now in my way, I met
with a fellow that was lying in wait to
catch pigeons, of whom <hi>I</hi> asked, (My
friend) from whence come these pigeons?
Sir, (said he) they come from the other
world: then I thought, that when <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>
yawned, the pigeons went into his
mouth in whole flocks, thinking that it had
been a pigeon-house.</p>
                  <p>Then I went into the City, which <hi>I</hi> found
faire, very strong, and seated in a good aire:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41088:251"/>
but at my entry the guard demanded of
me my passe or ticket: whereat <hi>I</hi> was much
astonished, and asked them, (My Masters) is
there any danger of the plague here? O
Lord, (said they) they die hard by here so
fast, that the cart runs about the streets;
Good God! (said <hi>I)</hi> and where? whereunto
they answered that it was in <hi>Larinx</hi> and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinx,</hi>
which are two great Cities, such as
<hi>Rowen</hi> and <hi>Nants,</hi> rich and of great trading:
and the cause of the plague was by a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and infectious exhalation, which lately
vapoured out of the abismes, whereof there
have died above two and twenty hundred
and threescore thousand and sixteen persons
within this sevennight; then <hi>I</hi> considered,
calculated and found, that it was a rank and
unsavoury breathing, which came out of
<hi>Pantagruels</hi> stomack, when he did eat so
much garlick, as we have aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Parting from thence, I past amongst the
rocks, which were his teeth, and never left
walking till <hi>I</hi> got up on one of them; and
there <hi>I</hi> found the pleasantest places in the
world great large tennis-Courts, faire gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
sweet meddows, store of Vines, and
an infinite number of banqueting summer
out-houses in the fields, after the <hi>Italian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,

stayed full foure moneths, and never made
better cheer in my life as then. After that I
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41088:251"/>
went down by the hinder teeth to comt to
the chaps; but in the way <hi>I</hi> was robbed by
thieves in a great forrest, that is in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
towards the eares: then (after, a little
further travelling) <hi>I</hi> fell upon a pretty pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
village, (truly <hi>I</hi> have forgot the name of
it) where <hi>I</hi> was yet merrier then ever, and
got some certain money to live by, can
you tell how? by sleeping; for there they
hire men by the day to sleep, and they
get by it six pence a day, but they that
can s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ort hard get at least nine pence. How
<hi>I</hi> had been robbed in the valley <hi>I</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Senators, who told me that in very
truth the people of that side were bad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and naturally theevish, whereby I
perceived well, that as we have with us the
Countreys <hi>cisalpin</hi> and <hi>transalpine,</hi> that is,
behither and beyond the mountains, so have
they there the Countreys <hi>cidentine</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine,</hi>
that is, behither and beyond the
teeth: but it is farre better living on this
side, and the aire is purer. There <hi>I</hi> began to
think, that it is very true which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, that the one half of the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how the other half liveth; seeing
none before my self had ever written of that
Countrey, wherein are above five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Kingdomes inhabited, besides deserts, and
a great arme of the sea: concerning which
purpose, <hi>I</hi> have composed a great book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled

said I: Ha, ha, thou art a merry fellow, said

                  <p>And <hi>I</hi> wonder much at a rabble of foolish
Philosophers and Physicians, who spend
their time in disputing, whence the heat of
the said waters cometh, whether it be by
reason of <hi>Borax,</hi> or sulphur, or allum, or
salt-peter that is within the mine; for they
do nothing but dote, and better were it for
them to rub their arse against a thistle, then
to waste away their time thus in disputing of
that, whereof they know not the original;
for the resolution is easie, neither need we to
enquire any further, then that the said baths
came by a hot pisse of the good <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to tell you after what manner he
was cured of his principal disease; <hi>I</hi> let passe
how for a <hi>minorative,</hi> or gentle potion, he
took foure hundred pound weight of <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoniack
Scammonee:</hi> six score and eighteen
cart-loads of <hi>Cassia:</hi> an eleven thoufand and
nine hundred pound weight of <hi>Rubarb,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other confused jumblings of sundry
drugs: You must understand, that by the
advice of the <hi>Physicians,</hi> it was ordained that
what did offend his stomach should be taken
away; and therefore they made seventeen
great balls of copper, each whereof was big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41088:253"/>
then that which is to be seen on the top
of St. <hi>Peters</hi> needle at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in such sort,
that they did open in the midst, and shut
with a spring. Into one of them entered one
of his men carrying a Lanterne and a torch
lighted, and so <hi>Pantagruel</hi> swallowed him
down like a little pill: into seven others went
seven Countrey-fellows, having every one
of them a shovel on his neck: into nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
entred nine wood-carriers, having each
of them a basket hung at his neck, and so
were they swallowed down like pills:
when they were in his stomack, every one
undid his spring, and came out of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins:
the first whereof was he that carried
the Lantern, and so they fell more then half
a league into a most horrible gulph, more
stinking and infectious then ever was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitis,</hi>
or the marishes of <hi>Camerina,</hi> or
the abominably unsavoury lake of <hi>Sorbona,</hi>
whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh mention. And had
it not been, that they had very well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidoted
their stomach, heart and wine-pot,
which is called the noddle, they had been
altogether suffocated and choaked with
these detestable vapours. O what a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume!
O what an evaporation wherewith
to beray the masks or musters of young
mangie queans: after that with groping
and smelling they came near to the fecal
matter and the corrupted humours; finally
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41088:254"/>
they found a <hi>montjoy</hi> or heap of ordure and
filth: then fell the Pioneers to work to dig
it up, and the rest with their shovels filled
the baskets; and when all was cleansed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one retired himself into his ball.</p>
                  <p>This done, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> enforcing himself
to a vomit, very easily brought them out,
and they made no more shew in his mouth,
then a fart in yours: but when they came
merrily out of their pills, I thought upon
the <hi>Grecians</hi> coming out of the <hi>Trojan</hi> horse:
by this meanes was he healed, and brought
unto his former state and convalescence;
and of these brazen pills, or rather cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-balls,
you have one at <hi>Orleans,</hi> upon the
steeple of the Holy Crosse Church.</p>

excuse of the Author.</head>
                  <p>NOw (my Masters) you have heard a
beginning of the horrifick history of
my Lord and Master <hi>Pantagruel:</hi> Here will I
make an end of the first book; My head
akes a little, and I perceive that the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of my braine, are somewhat jumbled
and disordered with this septembral juice.
You shall have the rest of the history at
<hi>Franckfort mart</hi> next coming, and there shall
you see how <hi>Panurge</hi> was married and made
a Cuckold within a moneth after his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
how <hi>Pantagruel</hi> found out the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
stone, the manner how he found it,
and the way how to use it: how he past o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Caspian</hi> mountaines, and how he
sailed thorough the <hi>Atlantick</hi> sea, defeated
the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and conquered the isles of
<hi>Perles,</hi> how he married the daughter of the
King of <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Presian,</hi> how he fought
against the devil, and burnt up five cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of hell, ransacked the great black
chamber, threw <hi>Proserpina</hi> into the fire,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41088:255"/>
broke five teeth to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the horne
that was in his arse. How he visited the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Moon, to know whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Moon were not entire and whole,
or if the women had three quarters of it in
their heads, and a thousand other little mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
all veritable. These are brave things
truly; Good night, Gentlemen, <hi>Perdonate mi,</hi>
and think not so much upon my faults, that
you forget your own. If you say to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(Master) it would seem that you were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise in writing to us these flimflam stories,
and pleasant fooleries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> answer you, that you are not much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
to spend your time in reading them: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse,
if you read them to make your
selves merry, as in manner of pastime <hi>I</hi>
wrote them, you and <hi>I</hi> both are farre more
worthy of pardon, then a great rabble of
squint-minded fellowes, dissembling and
counterfeit Saints, demure lookers, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
pretended zealots, tough Fryars, bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin-Monks,
and other such sects of men,
who disguise themselves like Maskers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the world, for whilest they give the
common people to understand, that they
are busied about nothing but contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and devotion in fastings, and maceration
of their sensuality; and that only to sustain
and aliment the small frailty of their humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
It is so far otherwise, that on the contrary
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41088:255"/>
(God knows) what cheer they make, <hi>Et
Curios simulant, sed bacchanalia vivunt.</hi> You
may reade it in great letters, in the colouring
of their red snowts, and gulching bellies as
big as a tun, unlesse it be when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
themselves with sulphur; as for their
study it is wholly taken up in reading of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruelin</hi>
books, not so much to passe the time
merrily, as to hurt some one or other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievously,
to wit, in <hi>articling, sole-articling,
wry-neckifying, buttock-stirring, ballocking,</hi>
and <hi>diabliculating,</hi> that is, calumniating;
wherein they are like unto the poor rogues of
a village, that are busie in stirring up and scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in the ordure and filth of little children,
in the season of cherries and guinds, and that
only to finde the kernels, that they may sell
them to the druggists, to make thereof po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander-oile.
Fly from these men, abhorre
and hate them as much as <hi>I</hi> do, and upon
my faith you will finde your selves the better
for it. And if you desire to be good <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elists</hi>
(that is to say, to live in peace, joy, health,
making your selves alwayes merry) never
trust those men that alwayes peep out at one
hole.</p>
