            <title>The tryal, condemnation, and execution of three vvitches viz. Temperace [sic] Floyd, Mary Floyd, and Susanna Edwards. Who were arraigned at Exeter on the 18th. of August, 1682. And being prov'd guilty of witch-craft, were condemn'd to be hang'd, which was accordingly executed in the view of many spectators, whose strange and much to be lamented impudence, is never to be forgotten. Also, how they confessed what mischiefs they had done, by the assistance of the devil, who lay with the above-named Temperence Floyd nine nights together. Also, how they squeezed one Hannah Thomas to death in their arms; how they also caused several ships to be cast away, causing a boy to fall from the top of a main-mast into the sea. With many wonderful things, worth your reading.</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LEt not my assertions seem strange to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Reader, who seems to affirm this
(by some incredulous) Story, concerning the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
matter; nor will I trouble you with a long
Prologue, to stir you to believe that which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Letters have verified, concerning the matter in
hand, but so it was.</p>
            <p>THe Assizes being held at <hi>Exon,</hi> (alias) <hi>Exeter,</hi> on
the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> 1682. It happened that there
was three Persons Arraigned for Witch-Craft, whose
Names take as followeth, <hi>(viz.) Temperance Floyd,
Mary Floyd,</hi> and <hi>Susannah Edwards,</hi> all dwelling in
one Town, in the aforesaid County of <hi>Devon,</hi> namely
<hi>Bideford,</hi> by some call'd <hi>Bythford,</hi> all three being
stricken in years, which might have taught them more
Grace; but Man's Enemy, Souls destroyer, and the
Author of Wickedness, so prevailed with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
they made an Interchange, accepting a Hell for a
Heaven, rather willing to please the Devil then the
great Creator, whose smiles are more precious then
refined Gold, the loss of whose love is no less then
Everlasting Destruction. These I say, these poor souls
(aiming at nothing but ruine) imbrace Folly instead
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37510:4"/>
of Wisdom, present pleasure for eternal pain; take
Flames for Crowns, misery for happiness, change
God for a Devil, and a Soul for Hell. It is much to
be lamented, that these persons should take delight
in nothing more then to converse with Divils, who
reason tells, seeks nothing but Destruction, Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour,
Mans overthrow (to, if it were possible) empty
Heaven and fill Hell.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Particulars, the aforesaid persons
whose names are already inserted, came to their Tryal,
having been some time before accused of VVitch-craft,
and for that cause Imprisoned; when they came
to the Bar their Indictment was read, and though the
Devil had so much power over them, yet had they not
Impudence enough to deny what they there were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
for: Intemperate <hi>Temperance Floyd</hi> who was the
eldest of the three, pleaded to her Indictment, and
owned the Accusation, acknowledging she had been
in League with the Devil 20. years and upwards, and
that in the term of those years she had been guilty of
many Cruelties, and by Hellish power afflicted both
Man and Beast; but now to the other Two who were
Instructed in that Damnable Art of VVitch-craft by
the afore-named <hi>Temperance Floyd,</hi> they acknowledg'd
that they had served five years to her to learn her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
Art, and during the Term of those years they
saw and were acquainted with many wonderful and
unlawful Tricks. For they owned that they had not
been idle in their Hellish practices, but had served him
faithfully, who will reward them gratefully for their
Diabolical Indulgence. VVe have an account of some
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37510:4"/>
of their VVicked, Inhumane, Accursed, Damnable,
and Preposterous Actions. But let us chiefly mind the
Eldest and worst of these Three, namely, <hi>Temperance
Floyd,</hi> Let her be the substance of our matter, who
was the Introducer and cause of the other Two's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
These VVicked VVretches being all of one
mind, at last began to exercise their Divelish Arts, and
upon one Mr. <hi>Hann</hi> a Minister in those parts; a person
of good Repute and honest Conversation; who sought
his souls eternal happiness, while they design'd their
everlasting Ruine. These Hellish Agents intended mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and misery to the person of Mr. <hi>Hann:</hi> but the
Over-ruling Power prevented them; but because they
could not be suffered to exercise their Diabolicism
upon his body, they thought they would be some other
way Reveng'd; so VVitch like, they laid their Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Charms upon his Cattle, so that those Cows
that used to give Milk, when they came to be Milked
they gave blood, to the great astonishment of the
Milkers; but finding themselves Outcasts from ever<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lasting
Happiness, they grew insolent in their Cursed
Conceits, resolving to make use of that Art which
they should so dearly pay for; But I too much insist
upon the Old Hag whose Cruelties are and were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
manifested by her own Confession at her
<hi>Tryal,</hi> the other Two VVitches being somewhat
younger then the Old Shape of Prince Lucifer, who
acknowledged themselves to haue been servants to
the Old one for Five Years, to learn the Art and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Hellish, Damnable, Accursed, and most to be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37510:5"/>
Lamented Witch-Craft; and in the term of those 5
years grew to be as dexterious as their Devilish Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
trying their Experiments upon Man and Beast,
to the Injury of both; but the Old one Confessed
plainly that she had caused several Ships at Sea to be
Cast away, to the loss of many mens lives, and the
prejudice of many others: She confessed also that the
Devil lay Carnally with her for Nine Nights together,
and that she had Paps about her an Inch long, which
the Devil us'd to suck to Provoke her to Letchery:
but the other two seemed to be more Pensive then
she, for they confessed that she was the Introducer of
their Misery, and that they had served both the Devil
and her five years slavery, to understand the ready way
to everlasting Destruction. But Heavens Vengeance
never fails to follow such Offenders who do wickedly,
presumptuously, and prophanely, make use of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to satisfie their Impious wills. But to proceed, this
Old VVitch whose name was <hi>Temperance Floyd,</hi> was
without doubt perfectly Resolute, not minding what
should become of her Immortal Soul, but rather Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
at, as well as after her Tryal, so Audacious, that
she had done many wicked Exploits by the power
(not virtue) of her Hellish Discipline; She confessed
that she had been instrumental to the Death of several,
namely, one <hi>Hannah Thomas</hi> by pretence of Love,
Squeezing her in her Arms so long till the blood gush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of her mouth; she confessed that she and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two had been the Death of Two more, besides
several others that they had Lamed by their Hellish
Art; they confessed that they had been the Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37510:5"/>
of many Cattle both small and great, and many
more things too tedious to relate; being asked at their
Tryal to say the Lords Prayer, they answered, that
they could not, except it were backward, they said that
the Devil used to be with them on nights in several
Shapes, sometimes like a Hound, who Hunted before
them (but without doubt he Hunted for Souls.) There
was many more Accusations laid against them, which
they all owned (except one) which was about causing
a Ship to be Sunk, and a Boy that fell from the Top-Mast
of another Ship and so broke his Neck, or as
some say, Drowned in the Sea.</p>
            <p>It being asked how long they had been in league
with the Divel, one of them said twenty-years she had
been his Familiar Acquaintance, the other two were
of lesser standing, but long enough to Ruine their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Souls. They also Asserted, that the Devil came
with them to the Prison Door, and there left them,
much like what he is, the Author of Lies, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter
of Mischief, the Betrayer of Souls, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
deceiver, and Gods Enemy.</p>
            <p>All these things being Confessed by their own
Tongues, it is not strange to think that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
past upon them regularly in such Cases.</p>
            <p>But now to proceed;</p>
            <p>As to the manner of their Deportment going
to the place of Execution. It is certainly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37510:6"/>
the Old Witch <hi>Temperance Floyd,</hi> went all the
way Eating, and was seemingly unconcerned; but
<hi>Mary Floyd</hi> was very obstinate, and would not go,
but lay down, insomuch that they forc'd to tye her
upon a Horse-back, for she was very loath to receive
her deserved Doom: But when they came to the
place of Execution, they desired the Minister to pray
for them, and that part of the 40<hi>th</hi> Psalm might be
sung, which was accordingly done, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Executioner did his Office.</p>
            <p>Thus have you heard of the Wicked life and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
death of three gross Offenders, who slighted
Gods Commandements, despis'd a Christ and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
a Devil, lost Heaven to purchase Hell, at the
dear rate of their Immortal Souls: Let this then be
a Caution for all Sinners to forsake Sin and Satan,
whose end and design is to ruine Souls, to enslave
Mortals, and without doubt were it possible, to pull
Gods Almighty Majesty out of his Everlasting <hi>Throne.</hi>
'Tis great pitty that some have so little esteem of their
Jewels which Jesus Christ the Son of the Almighty,
purchased at so dear a rate; yet vild Sinners, never
call to mind, or at least very seldom, what Labyrinths
of misery they involve themselves in, how they crush
Christ, how they wound his already wounded side
for sinners: But now to conclude, take a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
advice, Walk uprightly and Justly, and let not
the fruition of present injoyments, cause you to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Eternal Happiness, the injoyment of which, is
beyond Expression, and the loss thereof Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
Destruction, and Ruine.</p>
