            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE Government in <hi>SCOTLAND</hi> During the Reign of King CHARLES II. AGAINST Mis-representations made in several Scandalous Pamphlets.</head>
            <p>THe Design of this Paper is neither to seduce others into <hi>Faction,</hi> nor to make an <hi>Apologie;</hi> the one being too <hi>Malicious,</hi> and the other too <hi>Mean:</hi> But because many honest and sincere Men have been abused by some late Misinformations, whereby the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves are much weakened; therefore this Paper comes to set things in their <hi>true light, by a bare Narrative,</hi> which will be sufficient to reclaim those who are abus'd, and to confute those <hi>malicious Authors,</hi> who have endeavour'd to Reproach a whole Nation with Villanies, of which none but these Authors themselves could have been guilty.</p>
            <p>Because the Civil Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> was never bigot in that <hi>King's</hi> Reign, therefore we shall not run back to consider E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy or Presbyterie, otherways than as they may concern the Civil Government. Neither should we run so far back as to the Government of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. were it not to prove, that these of the same persuasion, who now complain, were the first
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97748:3"/>
Aggressors; and consequently, what was done against them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves rather the name of <hi>Self-defence</hi> than <hi>Persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing this, it is necessary to represent, that in the Year 1637, we liv'd under the most Pious and Orthodox Prince of the Age, and yet a Rebellion was form'd against him, as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, and a Tyrant,</hi> by which all the Fundamental Laws were shaken, and all honest Men ruin'd. Neither needs there any other proof for this Assertion, than the Records of <hi>Parliament, General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,</hi> and <hi>Iustice Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Records and Acts of Parliament it is undeniable, that the power of nominating Judges, Counsellors, and all Officers of State; the power of levying War, and raising Taxes, were <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp'd</hi> by the people; <hi>Covenants</hi> were entred into by a part of the Subjects, and by them impos'd imperiously upon the rest; <hi>Leagues</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> were entred into with <hi>England;</hi> Ambassadours were sent to Foreign <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States;</hi> and even to <hi>France</hi> (tho' little less terrible then, than now) exclaiming against the Injustice of the <hi>King,</hi> justifying their taking Arms against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreating the <hi>French</hi> Aid and Assistance: The <hi>King himself</hi> was inhumanely deliver'd up to his Enemies, and thereafter the Army that went in to defend his precious Life, were declared <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> all which was uncontravertedly inconsistent with the Laws of the Kingdom then standing.</p>
            <p>From the Acts of the General Assembly it is clear, that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, 1639. refus'd to rise, when dissolv'd by the <hi>King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner,</hi> and most of the following Assemblies did both sit down and rise without his Warrand. This Assembly threw out the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and abrogated Episcopacy without Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' the <hi>Bishops</hi> were always <hi>the first of the three Estates of Parliament.</hi> A new Oath was invented, called, the <hi>Covenant,</hi> without the King's Authority; and all Men Women and <hi>Children,</hi> that were above ten years of age, forc'd to take it; and such as took it not, were <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> upon which all their Moveables or Chattels were Confiscated, and they themselves being declar'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Laws, were forc'd to fly. The <hi>King's</hi> Negative Voice was declared <hi>Illegal,</hi> and the Acts made for assisting him in the Year <hi>Forty Eight,</hi> were declar'd <hi>Void and Null,</hi> by an unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97748:3"/>
Invasion, the General Assembly, (imitating in this, as in many other things, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) raised themselves above <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Records of the <hi>Iustice Court</hi> we find that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states made <hi>Advocates or Attorney Generals</hi> by their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; who prosecuted to death <hi>such as defended their own Houses by vertue of express Commissions from the King, and such as rose in Arms for his Defence, tho' they had both his Commissions, and Remissions, though the Iudes that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them, sat by vertue of that very King's Commission.</hi> They not only borrowed vast Sums by meer force from private Men, whom they never payed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also they were the first that brought in <hi>Free and dry Quarter, Cess, Excise,</hi> and all these Publick burthens afterwards so much complain'd of (<hi>when they were continued upon necessary Exigencies, by lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>) we having neither formerly known <hi>Oaths, nor Publick burthens under our gentle Kings,</hi> against whom they so much exclaim'd as Tyrants, because forsooth they kept <hi>them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such:</hi> All these Proceedings were not only condemn'd by the general Opinion of both Protestants and Papists abroad, but stand yet condemned by express Acts of Parliament, and by many Acts in the like Cases in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and so nothing which can be alledged in justification of them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves or needs an answer.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second being restored by almost the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal consent of all the People, the <hi>worst</hi> of whom grew weary of their <hi>Villanies</hi>: The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being called, they enquired very seriously into the occasion of such Disorders, and soon found that they were all to be charged upon the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and those who adhered thereto; and therefore they endeavoured to perswade the Presbyterians to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the <hi>Covenant,</hi> all favour being promised to them upon that condition: But finding that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> generally thought themselves bound to own the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Parliament conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the same Men, owning the same Principles, would be ready upon occasion to act over again the same things, therefore they by Vote (which may be called unanimous, seeing only
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97748:4"/>
four or five dissented) restored Episcopacy, and that so much the rather, because that Government had in <hi>no age nor place forced</hi> its way into the State by the <hi>Sword,</hi> but had still been brought in by the <hi>uncontraverted Magistrate,</hi> without ever thrusting it self in by Violence, and yet the Government did sustain <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as a part of the State, but never as a <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy wholly independent</hi> from it,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Presbyterian Preachers</hi> had all along taught the People, That as their Government was <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> so the People might thereby be obliged to defend <hi>them</hi> and <hi>it,</hi> under pain of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation, even (<hi>when Episcopacy</hi> was Established by Law;) and accordingly some of the People who retained that Principle, frequented the <hi>Conventicles</hi> at which these Ministers Preacht; whereupon the State fearing that the old Humour might ferment again into a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> discharged under some small Penalties any above <hi>Five Strangers</hi> to meet in a Conventicle, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby at once the free exercise of their Conscience in their Families, and yet securing the State against such a total defection, as might involve us in a New Civil-War, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt was all the State design'd: But to elude these Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for House-Conventicles, some <hi>Preachers</hi> (amongst whom were some of those who had been formerly banished) gathered the People together in the Fields; they bringing <hi>Arms</hi> with them to secure their Ministers, came at last to have such an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own strength, that they formed themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Army, and were defeated at <hi>Pentland Hills, Novemb. Anno</hi> 1666. Yet within a short time of that, the State <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> them so far as to allow them their own Ministers, settling them in Churches, and allowing them the enjoyment of the Benefices in many places. This did not satisfie these People, because the Ministers so Indulged acknowledged the King and Council's Authority; and they, with some of their violent Preachers railed as much against these <hi>Indulged Ministers,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>regular Clergy,</hi> and call'd them <hi>Council Curates,</hi> and separated from them. The State considering that by the Laws of all Nations, <hi>rising in Arms is to be accounted Rebellion,</hi> and that a Preacher's Presence could legitimate the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97748:4"/>
               <hi>Action</hi> no more than a Priest could <hi>Transubstantiate</hi> the <hi>Elements;</hi> they declared by several Acts, Field-Meetings to <hi>be the Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzes of Rebellion</hi>: Notwithstanding all which, these Dissenters proceeded, as from House to Field-Meetings, so from Field-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles to publish Proclamations, Declaring that the <hi>Covenant was the Original Contract betwixt God, the King, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and therefore King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second having broken it,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cargil</hi> and <hi>Sanchars</hi> Covenant at the end.</note> 
               <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted his Crown,</hi> and being to be considered only as a <hi>private Subject,</hi> and <hi>Enemy to God,</hi> they had declared a just War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and that it was lawful to <hi>kill him,</hi> and all who served him, following as was pretended the Noble Examples of <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Eliud</hi>; and in consequence of this Doctrin they murthered the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews, and several others</hi>; to defend these Murtherers an Army was gathered by them, which was beat a <hi>Bothuel-Bridge, Anno</hi> 1679. But yet the <hi>King</hi> to reclaim them, granted both an <hi>Indemnity</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi>; notwithstanding of which, a <hi>New Plot</hi> was entred into, and it was Contrived in a Meeting of the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> that 20000 Men should be raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Garrisons of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> and all the Officers of State should be seized, which was likewise seconded by <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>Argyle</hi>'s <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Anno</hi> 1685. Whereupon the <hi>Parliament</hi> finding that the Preaching up of Rebellion in private Conventicles had occasion'd all this danger to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and that nothing could be <hi>secure</hi> whilst every thing might be <hi>preacht,</hi> they Enacted, That the Ministers who preacht at Conventicles should be Capitally Punished; but by Vertue of this Act, no Man was ever Punished, much less Executed.</p>
            <p>This being the true Progress, and these the Occasions of making those <hi>Acts,</hi> it is admired why the <hi>Government</hi> is taxed with so much Cruelty, and the <hi>Acts</hi> themselves reproached as Diabolical: For First, These against House-Conventicles are the same with the Laws in <hi>England,</hi> and less severe than those made against Dissenters in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time, or than those now standing against the <hi>Calvinists</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> or those made, and now executed by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> but much more gentle than those our <hi>Presbyterians made when they Govern'd.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97748:5"/>2. Whatever might be said against such Acts <hi>in Countries where Dissenters never entred into a War,</hi> yet in <hi>this Isle,</hi> where they upon the same Principles overturned the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and were upon every occasion again attempting it, <hi>so small a Caution</hi> cannot be accounted severe. 3. This Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much more just in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than even in <hi>England</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Dissenters in <hi>Scotland</hi> were more bigotted to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> which is a constant Fond for Rebellion. 4. The Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Acts made against Field-Conventicles, were the necessary product of new accessional degrees of Rebellion; and were not Punishments design'd against Opinions in Religion, but meerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Treasonable Combinations,</hi> which exceeded what was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in <hi>England,</hi> or elsewhere; and the Governours (for the time) can truly and boldly say, That no Man in <hi>Scotland</hi> ever <hi>suffer'd for his Religion.</hi> But if any will pretend, that Religion obliges him to <hi>rise in Arms, or to Murder,</hi> this Principle ought neither to be sustain'd as a <hi>Defence,</hi> nor the obviating of it to be made a <hi>Crime</hi>; and as the <hi>Covenanters</hi> laughed at such a defence when propos'd for them, who assisted King <hi>Charles</hi> I. meerly for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake, so they cannot deny, but they zealously prest Sir <hi>Iohn Dalrymple,</hi> then <hi>Advocate,</hi> to hang Mr. <hi>Renwick</hi> a <hi>Field-Preacher,</hi> for <hi>Field-Preaching, where some of his Hearers were Arm'd, because he was like to divide their Church,</hi> after they got an Indulgence from King <hi>Iames,</hi> against the accepting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Renwick</hi> and his Party exclaim'd highly; and that so much the more plausibly, for that many of them, who now accepted an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence from a <hi>King</hi> professedly Popish, had rejected and preacht against those who accepted of one when offer'd by a King of the <hi>Protestant Profession.</hi> I must also ask them, if any should now rise in Arms in defence of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and alledge <hi>Conscience</hi> for so doing, <hi>would they sustain that as a just defence</hi>? 5. When ever any Man offer'd to keep the <hi>Church,</hi> former Fines were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitted, if timeous Application was made; and more Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and Indemnities were granted by this <hi>King</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than by any that ever reign'd; and generally no Man was executed in his Reign, who would say, <hi>God Bless the King,</hi> or acknowledge his Authority; an unusual Clemency, never shewn in any other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97748:5"/>
Nation, and such as was not practised by those, who now cry out against the Severity of that Government..</p>
            <p>The Reader will be astonished, when we inform him; that the way of Worship in our Church, differed nothing from what the Presbyterians themselves practised, (except only, that we used the <hi>Doxologie, the Lord's Prayer,</hi> and in Baptism, <hi>the Creed,</hi> all which they rejected.) We had no <hi>Ceremonies, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Altars, Cross in Baptisms,</hi> nor the meanest of those things which would be allowed in <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> in way of Accommodation: That the most Able and Pious of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, did hear the Episcopal Clergy Preach, many of them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the Churches, and almost all the People Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated also; so that it cannot be said <hi>that they were Persecuted,</hi> and forced to joyn with an <hi>Vnsound,</hi> much less <hi>Heretical</hi> Church, as the <hi>French</hi> Protestants are.</p>
            <p>From all which, it follows clearly, that the Complainers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were the Aggressors, that the Government proceeded by slow steps, to Punish even those who had <hi>forced it into a Resentment,</hi> and that all pains were taken to <hi>Reclaim</hi> rather than <hi>Punish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any Reasonable and Unprejudiced Man must allow, that the State had reason to be jealous that the same Men who had <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded</hi> and <hi>overturned the Government</hi> under King <hi>CHALES</hi> I. retaining still the same Principles <hi>as Sacred,</hi> and bursting forth into the same <hi>Excesses</hi> under King <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. <hi>were still to be kept in awe,</hi> and within the <hi>Barriers</hi> of Law, and that by their own Principle of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> better some few of the Society should perish than that the whole should go to ruin. <hi>Vnitas, non unus,</hi> as was said by them in the <hi>E. Straffords</hi> Case; and if two States of Parliament without <hi>the King,</hi> were thought the best, and necessary Judges, of what was <hi>Salus Populi</hi> in those days; much more should it be acknowledged, that <hi>the King and three Estates,</hi> in many subsequent Parliaments, agreeing cordially together, should be acknowledged to be the true Judges of what was <hi>Salus Populi</hi> in our Government, especially when what they did was founded on <hi>a Series of uncontraverted Laws,</hi> and upon long and deplorable experience of the Mischiefs occasion'd by that Pary. Whereas they who condemn our proceedings, <hi>must,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97748:6"/>
and do acknowledge before they Condemn us, that they consider themselves as a People coming into a Country where there were no Laws, and so might take any new Laws they thought fit, for the present exigent: A Liberty which we (Poor Slaves!) durst never take, foolishly conceiving our selves over-ruled by our Statute-Books, Ancient Customs, and Oaths, regulating our Duty and Conscience.</p>
            <p>For answering the <hi>Objections</hi> which are made against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I shall class them <hi>into these General Enormities with which the Government is charged,</hi> and into the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of its pretended Cruelty.</p>
            <p>The first General <hi>Objection</hi> is, That the <hi>severe Laws</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Conventicles</hi> were yet more severely put in execution by Sir <hi>Iames Turner,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Ballantine,</hi> and others, which occasion'd the Insurrection at <hi>Pentland-hills,</hi> and it is alledged that these <hi>Conventiclers</hi> came only to petition the <hi>Council,</hi> not to overturn the Government.</p>
            <p>To this it is answered, That all rising in Arms upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text whatsoever, is <hi>declared Rebellion</hi> in this and all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if any should rise now in Arms because Free-quarter is taken from them against Law, they would find this Government so to take it. Nor can it be pretended that Justice was denied to private Petitioners; but on the contrary, <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> were laid aside, which is all the <hi>State</hi> could do, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to answer for all the extravagancies of Soldiers, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the most just Government. From this likewise it necessarily follows, that because this was no just War, therefore the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Worthy Sir <hi>Iohn Nisbet,</hi> then <hi>King</hi>'s Advocate, and <hi>the Criminal Iudges</hi> were unjustly reproached for refusing to allow the defence founded on giving Quarter, that being only to be allowed in <hi>Iusto Bello</hi>: And it is to be remembred, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not allowed to the Worthy President Sir <hi>Robert Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Son to the famous Archbishop, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1645, tho' the War was just on the <hi>King</hi>'s side, and he acted by vertue of a Commission from that very <hi>King</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whose Authority the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that Condemned him was called; and it could not be proved by those that were taken at <hi>Pentland-hills,</hi> that Quarter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97748:6"/>
was granted them; whereas it was clearly proved, that the Council in General had discharged granting of Quarter upon <hi>the foresaid account.</hi> We pass under silence here, the Dreadful Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of several Hundreds Killed after Free Quarter given, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring of the Castle of <hi>Dunvileigh,</hi> (which made Lieutenant General <hi>Leslie,</hi> who then commanded the Army, threaten to lay down his Commission,) notwithstanding of a violent Sermon made before him upon these words, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> Chap. 15. v. 14. <hi>What meaneth then this bleating,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>That is, this noise of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners yet preserved alive. So the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er applied his Doctrin.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As to the sending away People to the Plantations, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that none were sent away, but such as were taken at <hi>Bothuel-Bridge,</hi> or in <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Rebellion; and the turning Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Punishment into exile, was an Act of Clemency; not of Cruelty. As to <hi>Torture,</hi> it is allowed not only by the Law of our Nation, but of all Nations except <hi>England,</hi> and founded on the foremention'd <hi>Maxims, Salus Populi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pereat unus, potius quam Vnitas</hi>; nor was it ever inflicted, but where the Person tortured was evidently proved to be <hi>Guilty of Accession to the Crime,</hi> and that he knew the Accomplices; it being still left in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to secure himself against Torture, by confessing who were his Accomplices, or by clearing himself by his Oath, <hi>that he did not know them,</hi> which Oath was required to free, not to bind the Deponent; because his Knowledge of the matter was first proved, and it was still previously declared by Act of Council, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he was to Depone should prejudge him; And those who had been in that Government were very sorry that when <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was declared a <hi>Grievance</hi> in the last Convention, Matters of high importance relating to the Government, <hi>were still excepted,</hi> which expos'd the Subjects to as much danger as formerly. As to the <hi>Imprisoning free Leidges without giving any reason, and detaining them in Prison for many Years</hi>; It is answered, that we have no Act for <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so these things may be accounted <hi>Severe,</hi> but not <hi>Illegal</hi>; and they were introduced in the <hi>late Vnhappy Presbyterian Rebellion,</hi> where thousands were kept in Prison a great many years, without any Crime or Hopes of Releasment; but the true Reason of the frequent Imprisonments, during K. <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>'s Government,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97748:7"/>
should only be charged <hi>on those</hi> who were Accessories to the <hi>Plots and Rebellions which occasion'd them;</hi> and no Men wish'd more than we did, to see those peaceable times which might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> for <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing which occasioned these long Imprisonments, was, That the persons imprisoned <hi>refus'd to acknowledge the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> without which they could not have been set at liberty, when there was a clear <hi>Probation</hi> against them. But can this be objected to <hi>Vs,</hi> by <hi>those</hi> who have since Imprison'd <hi>more in one Year than we did in five</hi>?</p>
            <p>As to the bringing in the <hi>Highlanders on the Western shires, and taking free Quarter there;</hi> it is answered, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands had gather'd in <hi>Field Conventicles</hi> with <hi>Arms</hi> for several Years; and when these <hi>Conventicles</hi> which used to meet in several places, pleas'd to join in one, they could easily <hi>form an Army.</hi> To prevent which, the <hi>Council</hi> wrote a Letter to these <hi>Western<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shires,</hi> entreating them to fall upon some course for <hi>security of the Peace</hi>; they returning for answer, <hi>That the Peace could not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured there without Abrogating Episcopacy.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> consider'd this as a Sacrificing the <hi>Laws</hi> to the <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi> of <hi>private Men,</hi> and such too, as they had reason to think, could no more be satisfied with that Concession than their <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours</hi> were, who proceeded to ruin King <hi>Charles</hi> I. after he had parted with the Order of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to <hi>please them</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Highlanders</hi> were sent <hi>in, to secure the Peace;</hi> and because Mony could not be provided in haste, the <hi>Council</hi> declar'd by their <hi>Act,</hi> That those on whom they were quartered should be paid out of the first and readiest of the <hi>Fines</hi> owing there, and the <hi>Superplus</hi> should be paid by the <hi>King</hi>; nor have those who were then in the Government, clamour'd so much <hi>now</hi> for <hi>a Years</hi> Free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as <hi>these People</hi> did then for a <hi>Fortnights,</hi> and even during that <hi>Fortnight</hi> most men <hi>pay'd for their Quarters</hi>; nor was there any more Surety sought, at least from <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Heretors,</hi> than the ordinary Surety of <hi>Law-borrows,</hi> by the very style whereof, any private Man may force another by the Law to secure him against all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices from his <hi>Men, Tennents</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> and others of his Command, <hi>Out-hounding</hi> and <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ihabition.</hi> And that the <hi>King</hi> had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97748:7"/>
great reason to be jealous of their <hi>breaking the Peace,</hi> appears ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>Reasons</hi> above <hi>Represented,</hi> and when this <hi>Surety</hi> was thereupon approv'd by <hi>Parliament,</hi> by which it was <hi>Enacted,</hi> that <hi>Masters should be liable eithr to remove their Tennents from their Lands,</hi> or <hi>to present them to Iustice:</hi> It prov'd a most <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous</hi> Remedy for <hi>settling the Nation,</hi> to the great <hi>advantage</hi> both of <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi>; this alternative securing the Master from many hardships, and ingaging his Servants to obey <hi>him,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> was obliged to obey the <hi>King</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>keep the Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Cumulative Iurisdiction</hi> so much <hi>complain'd</hi> of, because it gives the <hi>King</hi> a power to name <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and other <hi>Inferiour Iudges,</hi> who may have an equal share in the <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with those who had the sole <hi>Heretable Iurisdiction</hi> formerly, whereby it is <hi>pretended</hi> the <hi>Property</hi> of the Subjects was <hi>invaded.</hi> It is answered, that <hi>Heretable Iurisdictions</hi> are of themselves very little to be favour'd, because the <hi>Heir</hi> must be a <hi>Iudge</hi> both in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> though he want <hi>Probity</hi> or <hi>Knowledge in the Law,</hi> and the Interested Superiours or <hi>Over-Lords</hi> had thereby the unfortunate poor <hi>Vassals</hi> absolutely at their Devotion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by an old Law in K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 2<hi>ds</hi> time, there was an Act made, discharging all <hi>Heretable Iurisdictions</hi> without consent of <hi>Parliament</hi>; and Sir <hi>Iohn Nisbet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The truly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Advocate for the King.</hi>
               </note> upon these and many other <hi>good Reasons,</hi> advised, that all the other <hi>Heretable Iurisdiction</hi> (because almost all granted since that time) should be <hi>Repealed</hi>; and yet, though these <hi>Heretable Iudges</hi> refus'd to concur in putting the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Field-Conventicles,</hi> and <hi>Armed Insurrections</hi> in Execution, or conniv'd at them, whereby they grew very formidable, the <hi>Council</hi> unwilling to take away <hi>these Iurisdictions totally,</hi> chose rather to name others to sit with <hi>those Iudges,</hi> or to supply their absence if they refused to come; but there-after S. <hi>G. M.</hi> succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Advocate, to prevent all Debate, advis'd the bringing this point to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the end, that that procedure of the King's Council might be either <hi>Vncontravertedly Legal</hi> if acquiesc'd in, or <hi>let fall</hi> if refus'd; and accordingly the Parliament having pass'd it into <hi>an Act;</hi> it seems great <hi>Malice and Ignorance</hi> to call this <hi>Illegal;</hi> and it being founded upon such <hi>just</hi> and <hi>solid Reasons,</hi> it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97748:8"/>
seem'd as strange, why it should be thought severe, and never <hi>Lawyer</hi> spoke against it except those who had <hi>Heretable Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> It were unreasonable that the <hi>King</hi> should complain of what he consented to in <hi>Parliament</hi> in favours of his Subjects; and so it must be likewise concluded unreasonable that the <hi>Subject</hi> should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <hi>of this point</hi> which they have granted to the <hi>King,</hi> especially seeing it is more in favours of the <hi>Subjects</hi> than of <hi>Him,</hi> it being a <hi>strong Bulwark</hi> against great Mens oppressing of their <hi>Vassals</hi> and Inferiours; and therefore I cannot see why the <hi>Inferior sort</hi> should be so dull or unreasonabe as to complain of it. But notwithstanding of this <hi>Clamour,</hi> and abstracting even from this <hi>Act,</hi> it is still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the <hi>Advocate,</hi> that all Lawyers, and particularly our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Craig</hi> in his Book <hi>De Feudis,</hi> assert, that the <hi>Superiour</hi> has still an <hi>Accumulative Iurisdiction</hi> with his Vassal <hi>as to the point of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; for tho' he delegate a Jurisdiction for his Conveniency, yet that is not <hi>exclusive,</hi> that being a quality which still <hi>adheres,</hi> as <hi>Craig</hi> says; <note n="†" place="margin">

               </note> however Sir <hi>George Makenzee,</hi> Advocate, advis'd to stop all Clamours, that the <hi>Heretable Iudge</hi> might still have the <hi>Casualties,</hi> so that his <hi>Property</hi> could not be said to be <hi>invaded;</hi> and lest this might be drawn to the <hi>Session,</hi> as is <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously</hi> pretended, the Act is only made <hi>Relative</hi> to <hi>Iurisdictions</hi> given by his Majesty to his good Subjects, which can in no sense fall under the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the Session, <hi>i. e. the Iudges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Act made in Council, allowing Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to kill such as refused to own the King's Authority;</hi> It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that there being many Proclamations issued out, by the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> declaring, That <hi>the King had forfaulted his Right by breaking the Covenant, and that therefore it was lawful to kill him, and those who serv'd him</hi>: Many accordingly being <hi>kill'd,</hi> it was thought necessary by some (upon the fresh news of <hi>Murdering</hi> some of the King's Horse-Guard at <hi>Swyn-Abbey</hi> in their Beds) to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them out of this Extravagancy, by allowing the Soldiers to use them as in a War, in which, if any call, <hi>For whom are you?</hi> and the others owning <hi>that they were for the Enemy</hi>; it is <hi>lawful</hi> then <hi>to kill</hi>: And thus they felt their Folly, and the necessary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97748:8"/>
of their Principle; and yet still it was <hi>ordered,</hi> That <hi>none should be kill'd</hi> except those who were found <hi>in Arms, owning that Principle of Assassination,</hi> and <hi>refusing</hi> to clear themselves of their having been in <hi>Accession</hi> to the <hi>declaring of War, which they had then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun</hi>; nor were these kill'd but when their deliberate refusal could be proved by two Witnesses. But that it may plainly appear, that no more was in all this intended by the Governours, than to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> by terrifying those Assassines who had so manifestly invaded it; Secret <hi>Orders</hi> were given, that this should not last above a <hi>fortnight,</hi> and that none should be <hi>kill'd</hi> except those who were found in the <hi>publickly printed List of declar'd Rebels,</hi> who may be kill'd by the Laws of all Nations; and but very few, even of those <hi>Rebels</hi> were kill'd, tho' this has been made the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many dreadful Lies.</hi> This <hi>mischief</hi> was intolerable in it self, and we desire to know how it could have been otherways <hi>remedied,</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> must find <hi>Cures</hi> for all <hi>Mischiefs,</hi> and <hi>these who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd them, should of all others, be least allow'd to complain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the terrour of that procedure had much cooled the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Assassination</hi> for a time, it took <hi>new fire,</hi> and several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations for <hi>disowning</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Murthering his Servants</hi> were posted upon all Church Doors, and Mercat-Crosses, so that no man who <hi>served</hi> the <hi>King</hi> could know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not his <hi>Murtherer</hi> was at his <hi>elbow,</hi> and they had reason to look upon every place as their <hi>Scaffold</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Considering the violent and cruel temper of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </note> Whereupon the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> being desired to raise Processes against some who owned those <hi>Pernicious Principles,</hi> he prevailed with the <hi>Council</hi> to ask the Opinion of all the <hi>Iudges</hi> upon this Quaery, <hi>viz. Whether any of his Majesties Subjects being questioned by his Majesties Iudges or Commissioners, if they own a late Proclamation in so far as it does declare War against his Sacred Majesty, and asserts that it is lawful to kill all those who are employed by his Majesty, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to answer upon Oath, are thereby guilty of High Treason, and are airt and part of the said Treasonable Declaration, Salus Populi requiring that every one should contribute what was in his Power to the preservation of the Society</hi>; and as none of the Kings Servants without this could know if he was secure of his Life, so it was very easie for the person accused to clear himself if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97748:9"/>
he was innocent: They consider'd likewise that <hi>Law</hi> in general, for the good of the People, did accommodate its self to <hi>what probation could be allowed,</hi> and therefore invented <hi>presumptive probation</hi> upon that account, whereof there are so many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be seen in all Laws, that it were Childish to insist on them, and no man has been so just as to produce one Law or Reason to convince us of the Illegality of this <hi>Opinion;</hi> and there is an express Act of Parliament penned by the Learned Sir <hi>Iohn Nisbet,</hi> whereby for the same Reason, such as are prosecuted for <hi>Conventicles</hi> are obliged to Swear <hi>whether they were Innocent or Guilty,</hi> which does run yet higher than this Opinion.</p>
            <p>There is another Opinion given by the Judges much chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>some having gone about amongst the People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Fifty Pound Sterling from each as a Contribution for the Earl of</hi> Argyle <hi>then forfaulted, they from whom that Mony had been asked, and conceal'd it, were found Guilty of Treason, because this was so far beyond private Charity,</hi> that it would have amounted to a greater Sum than any Parliament had ever granted the King: And whereas the proposal of any <hi>Assistance to a Rebel is Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, the Concealing of it</hi> by our Law, and by the Law of Nations is <hi>undoubted Treason.</hi> If the matter of Fact in these Answers had been Represented to the late Convention, it cannot in Reason be thought they would have <hi>condemn'd them</hi>; and if any Man will compare these Opinions of the Judges, with <hi>that Grievance</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the late Convention, and <hi>that again</hi> with the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they will find the matter of Fact variously represented in all the three. We must likewise inform the World, <hi>That no Man died upon either of these Opinions</hi>; and to cut off all Debate, both <hi>these forenamed Opinions</hi> of the Judges are expresly <hi>ratified</hi> by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and consequently are the <hi>Sense of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we enter upon private Processes, we must <hi>complain,</hi> That tho' K. <hi>Ch.</hi> having by Act of Parliament, added <hi>five</hi> of the <hi>Learnedst</hi> of all his <hi>Iudges</hi> to his <hi>Iustice General</hi> and <hi>Iustice Clark</hi> in place of <hi>two Advocates,</hi> who were generally but Young or Mean, because they had only Fifty pounds Salary, and that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pay'd; that yet every <hi>Ignorant Scribler</hi> should presume to <hi>Reproach their Sentences,</hi> and shou'd take upon them to judge
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97748:9"/>
the deepest Controversies in point of Law; and should Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally-Write of Criminal Sentences, tho' they never saw a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Court, and be Applauded in things which every Servant about that Court knew to be Nonsence: Particularly, 'as that the Advocate, <hi>Threatned Iuries</hi>; whereas all he did, was to <hi>Protest for an Assize of Error,</hi> which the Laws Command, and which all Advocates ever did, and to this day doe. Again, it is as Foolishly pretended; That the Advocate <hi>Prosecuted Men without Order</hi>; whereas indeed, he never Prosecuted any, until he was <hi>Commanded</hi> by the Council, <hi>who are our Grand Iury upon Oath,</hi> and all their Orders are Registrated; the Court likewise, was so very favourable to these Criminals, that they did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Name (those of their own Profession) Presbyterians to pass upon their Jury, and sent Ministers of their own Perswasion, to Reclaim them; and <hi>these Iurors and Ministers,</hi> seldom fail'd to Condemn them as much as the Judges did.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Capital Sentences</hi> in that Court, were <hi>Founded Generally</hi> upon <hi>Actual Rebellion</hi>; and even as to <hi>those,</hi> there was not one of a thousand Executed: Nor in all <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Rebellion, was any Executed by their Sentence, except one or two, who were pitched upon as Examples to terrifie others. Nor did there dye upon <hi>any Publick Account, Twelve,</hi> in all that Reign so Exclaim'd against, <hi>as Bloody</hi>; and not one Dyed for any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Religion, unless it be thought a Religious Principle to Dye for <hi>Actual Rebellion</hi>; as to such, there needs no particular Defence, the very <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> the common <hi>Interest of Societyes,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of Nations,</hi> declaring it a Crime to justifie them.</p>
            <p>It is pretended, <hi>That tho' the Crimes had been Legally founded, yet the Probation was suspect in those times, because the Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Witnesses were Previously taken, whereby Witnesses being once Ensnared, were forced to stand by their Depositions.</hi> To which it is answered, that in all Nations abroad, Depositions are Previously taken, as is Uncontroverted by all their Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Writers, and this is very necessary for the Good of the Subjects, lest they should be Prosecuted groundlesly, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97748:10"/>
this is as fit for the Good of the King, or Kingdom, lest such as are Guilty of Atrocious Crimes against the whole Society, should escape without being Punished, because Tryed when the formal and full Probation is not ready; yet to prevent all mistakes, the <hi>Advocate</hi> interceeded that this Trust of Examining Witnesses, should not be left to the King's <hi>Advocate,</hi> as it ever formerly had been, but should be lodged in the Judges, and that lest their Depositions should be any <hi>Tye</hi> upon them, the Judges with Consent of the <hi>Advocate,</hi> ordered that <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions should be torn before they Deposed in Iudgment, and they were allow'd either to Correct or Pass from their former Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they pleas'd</hi>; And whereas formerly the King's <hi>Advocate</hi> had the Naming of the Jury, it is now lodged by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Judges. Nor was there ever any Witnesses sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, except only in <hi>Chesnock</hi>'s Case, wherein the Depositions were true; and albeit the Witnesses afterwards Asserted upon Oath on their Knees, <hi>That their first Deposition was very true,</hi> and <hi>that they were only Frighted and Confounded in the Second</hi>; yet the Council would not resume the Process, and thereupon he was Absolv'd: in the rest the Probation was but too clear, for beside all the Legal Probation, most of those who Died, owned and Gloried in their Crimes when they Died, Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to imitate them, <hi>in their Disowning the King, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against him</hi>: and many of them Exhorted the People, <hi>to Kill all such as oppos'd their Principles,</hi> assuring them, that to <hi>Kill Malignants was acceptable to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strangers would likewise be pleas'd to be inform'd, That our Law allows the Party Accused, a <hi>Liberty</hi> to call in Witnesses, who may Depose upon Oath <hi>for Him</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> which the Law of <hi>England</hi> does not, and this kind of <hi>Exculcapation</hi> was never allow'd till the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> II. The first Act which was the Warrant thereof, having been made by Sir <hi>Iohn Cunningham,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> when they were <hi>Criminal Iudges</hi>: and this was never refus'd to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Accused, albeit they brought in frequently Witnesses, who took very great Latitudes, to save those of their own
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97748:10"/>
Principles by Swearing; for instance, <hi>that tho' they saw a Person very like the</hi> Pannel <hi>or Party Accus'd, yet they could not Depose it was he, because it might have been a Vision,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit at the same time, they had known him formerly very well, and that they Talkt with him that time in Arms, at the distance of ten or twelve paces, for half an hour together; and at other times, they did positively refuse to Depose <hi>that they saw him have a Sword,</hi> tho' they owned that <hi>they saw the</hi> Hilt <hi>and</hi> Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard: Notwithstanding of which, and many such ridiculous Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the Party Accus'd, was alwaies Acquitted.</p>
            <p>To descend to particular Processes: It is clamoured, <hi>that</hi> Mitchill <hi>the Famous Assassine, was Executed after he Confessed the Crime upon Promise of Life</hi>; To which it is answered, that <hi>Mitchill</hi> having upon the High-Street of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Shot at the Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> with a design to Murther him, he Wounded the Bishop of <hi>Orkney</hi> with that Shot, of which he never Recovered, and being thereafter Apprehended, Confessed the Crime, but continuing still to Glory in it, and very Famous Witnesses having Deposed, that <hi>Mitchill</hi> was upon a new Plot to Kill the same Arch-Bishop; <hi>Mitchill</hi> was brought to a Tryal, and his <hi>Defences were, that the Earl of</hi> Rothes, <hi>to whom he Confest it, had promised to secure his Life, or that the Privy Council had afterwards promised the same;</hi> for clearing whereof, the said Earl, and all who were upon the Committee, together with all such Members of <hi>Council</hi> as he desired to be cited, were fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, upon all his interrogatories: and the Registers of <hi>Council</hi> were produced, but not the least mark of a promise was made to appear by either, so that nothing remain'd, but that the Lord high Chancellour, and Lords of the Privy Council (as they alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) perjured themselves, and that the Registers of <hi>Council</hi> were vitiated; and how it's possible to imagine that all this Villany was committed to take so inconsiderable a Fellows life; I leave the World to Judge? However, he also died glorying in his Crimes, and recommending to others <hi>the sweetness of such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinations.</hi>

               <hi>George Lermonth</hi> is alledged to have been unjustly executed, because he was condemned <hi>for being present at a Field-Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, with a Rod only in his hand:</hi> whereas the truth is, that he was condemned for being <hi>Art and Part,</hi> that is to say, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to the Death of a Soldier,</hi> who was killed upon that place, and that he <hi>commanded</hi> those who killed him as an <hi>Officer,</hi> of which a man may be guilty in Law, without having a Sword; and therefore the <hi>Iustices most legally</hi> repelled the defence founded on <hi>his not having a Sword.</hi>

               <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Monkland</hi> was not found guilty <hi>because he went into the Rebels to seek his Son,</hi> as some falsly suggest: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being <hi>there,</hi> he sollicited a Committee of the <hi>Rebels</hi> to make his Servant an Officer; and accordingly he being made one, he came back within some few days, and stayed several Months with <hi>Monkland,</hi> a point of Law so clear that his own Advocates could make no reply to evade it.</p>
            <p>There were indeed two Women executed, and <hi>but two in</hi> both these Reigns, and they were punished for most hainous Crimes which no Sex should defend. Their Crimes were, that they had recepted and entertained, for many Months together, <hi>the Murtherers of the Archbishop of St. Andrews,</hi> who were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>condemned Traitors</hi> for having been openly in Rebellion at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> whereupon they having been prosecuted, declined the King's Authority, <hi>as being an Enemy to God, and the Devil's Vicegerent.</hi> And tho' a pardon was offered to them upon their Repentance, they were so far from accepting it, that they own'd the Crimes to be duties; and our Accusers should remember that these Women were executed for higher Crimes, than the following <hi>Montross</hi>'s Camp, for which <hi>fourscore Women and Children</hi> were drowned, being all in one day thrown over the Bridge at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> by the Covenanters, and six more at <hi>Elgine</hi> by the same Faction, all without Sentence, or the least formality of Law.</p>

would the Advocate raise an Indictment until Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> and one of the Learnedst of the present Judges; did declare that the <hi>point of Law</hi> and Probation were both most clear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concurred in the <hi>process (concealing of Treason is beyond all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate punishable as Treason in our Law)</hi> and some of the Witnesses were his own Relations, who swore plainly and positively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p>The E. of <hi>Argile's</hi> Process deserves to be more largely clear'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and since this last Parliament has rescinded it, we shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Justification represent the Matter of Fact, which stands thus. The TEST being Enacted to be a <hi>Bulwark</hi> to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> as upon the Event it prov'd, the E. was not oblig'd, but would needs take it with this Caution, <hi>I take it as far as it is consistent with it self, or with the Protestant Religion; and I declare, that I mean not to bind up my self to wish or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any Alteration I think to the advantage of the Church or State</hi>; whereupon the Council observing, that the <hi>Test</hi> by one part of this his Declaration appear'd <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> and by the other it became <hi>ineffectual</hi> to all the Intents and Purposes for which it was design'd; for so every Man's Opinion became the <hi>Rule of his own Loyalty,</hi> and no Man thereby oblig'd to be further Loyal than he himself might think <hi>convenient.</hi> They therefore Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed earnestly with the <hi>Earl</hi> to pass from this his <hi>Declaration,</hi> but he refusing to disown it in the least, and <hi>Copies</hi> of it being <hi>industriously spread abroad,</hi> it was represented to him, that by <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> all such as put <hi>Limitations</hi> upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance were guilty of Treason, for beside, that Men are not obliged to <hi>dispute the Reasonableness of Acts of Parliament</hi> after they were once made; it is apparent that this Act was made upon most just and necessary Motives, for the Foundation of the Rebellion in the last Age, was, <hi>That by the Covenant the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were not further obliged to own the King's Interest, than in so far as it agreed with the word of God, and the Laws of the Land, of which every private Breast made himself the Iudge</hi>; and if this be allow'd, <hi>no Oath of Allegiance</hi> can bind, and so all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety must be dissolv'd. Notwithstanding all which, <hi>the Earl</hi> still persisting, and the <hi>Duke</hi> then <hi>High-Commissioner,</hi> being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97748:12"/>
assured by one of the best Lawyers in the Nation, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per imported Treason, (tho' the Advocate scrupled to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him from a Principle of Personal Kindness to the Earl) he was thereupon prosecuted, and found Guilty after a full Debate, wherein Eight or Nine of the best Lawyers of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a positive Command from the Council, did assist the <hi>Earl</hi> It is here also very observable, that no Malice could be design'd against the Earl; because he was earnestly entreated to pass from the Paper containing his Declaration before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess should commence; and after all, the Captain of the Castle was allow'd not to keep him strictly, and as it is undeniable, That the <hi>King</hi> allowed the <hi>Earl's Estate to his Creditors,</hi> and that <hi>his Children got a far larger share of it, than if he had dy'd in his Bed</hi>; so it can be prov'd it was fully resolv'd, <hi>that he should not die,</hi> nor did he die till he had <hi>Invaded his Native Countrey by open War,</hi> whereby the Parliament being convinc'd <hi>by this Open Act,</hi> that he had very clearly design'd by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Caution in his Explicatory Declaration of the Test, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to himself a Power <hi>to rise in Rebellion when he thought fit</hi>; as was argued in the former Process; they therefore ratified the Process of Forfaulture <hi>(nemine contradicente) and added their Authority to that of the Iustice Court,</hi> and because 'tis wonder'd <hi>why he was not prosecuted upon this New Rebellion</hi>; it is answer'd, That by the Laws of all Nations, and by the Laws especially of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England, no Man can be try'd for the very same crime for which he stands convicted, tho' he may for a crime which deserves a greater Punishment, for the Law has exhausted its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge by the first Sentence</hi>; but yet where a new Notorious Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation superveens, which is so clear, that it can admit of no Debate, nor needs no Probation; it were very unjust that the Law should not here be put in Execution, tho' the first Sentence had been thought too severe to deserve it. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then this Process with this Reflection, <hi>That a Government can in no sense be call'd Severe, where the person accus'd has Liberty (and is entreated) to retract his crime, where his Children and Creditors get all his Estate, and where he himself does not suffer, until he made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97748:12"/>
it manifest by his Invasion of his Native Countrey, that the design of his explaining the</hi> Test <hi>in a Paper under his Hand, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to himself a power to Rebell, and till he had aggravated highly his former guilt.</hi> But why do <hi>they</hi> reproach us with this one <hi>Decision, who</hi> do yet sustain those abominable ones, that were executed without the least shadow of Justice against the Marquess of <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Montrose,</hi> President <hi>Spotswood, Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and Seven hundred Gentlemen more, who died by their Justice Court, when their <hi>Covenant</hi> over-rul'd <hi>Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>: and against <hi>Four hundred and Fifty</hi> Gentlemen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons who died by the Justice-Court of <hi>Argyle,</hi> beside the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands</hi> who died in the <hi>Civil War,</hi> (of which <hi>they</hi> must be guilty, who raised it, and who <hi>never yet</hi> made the least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Repentance for it.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, 1685, being inform'd of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>'s Invasion, and being convinc'd that <hi>Argyle</hi> had reserv'd <hi>that power</hi> in his Explicatory Paper of the <hi>Test,</hi> meerly that he might Invade his Countrey and its Laws; and reflecting on the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Principle of the Covenant of defending the King, <hi>only in defence of Religion,</hi> and the late limitations of owning no King, except he had taken their Covenant; They therefore (not by a <hi>Recognising Act,</hi> but in the Narrative only of the Act relating to the Excise) offer'd their <hi>Lives and Fortunes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserve</hi>; which Clause was inserted by the Parliament, not to introduce a blind Slavery, as some maliciously pretend, but meerly to exclude these <hi>Rebellious Limitations of Obedience</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Covenanters, which were inconsistent with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer standing Laws, and by which the People had been highly debauch'd in the late Civil War; for in that very Parliament they enlarged <hi>the Peoples Liberties,</hi> and ratified all Laws in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>; and the very same persons in the next Parliament refus'd to take away <hi>the Penal Statutes,</hi> whereas, if <hi>an absolute Slavery</hi> had been design'd, all the former Acts establishing our <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and all the <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> granted to us by our Kings for securing our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, should have been expresly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enumerated and Abrogated;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97748:13"/>
and so the words in the Narrative of that Act could be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the Proclamation, <hi>disabling the Laws against Toleration</hi> as some would have us believe: and they who <hi>now complain,</hi> were the <hi>only</hi> persons who <hi>then</hi> took the benefit of <hi>that stretch</hi> of the Prerogative.</p>
            <p>We could wish that our Accusers would be careful, that in being too rigid Censurers of us, they do not <hi>expose all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and even the <hi>present</hi> to reproach; for it would seem to some who are now by-standers, as they then were, that though they cry'd out against us <hi>for torturing,</hi> when it was warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our uncontroverted Law; yet the <hi>expediency</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or some other reason makes them do it, after they had <hi>declar'd it a Grievance,</hi> and had rail'd against it as <hi>inconsistent with all humanity.</hi> Nor do I see that the reserving it only to King and Parliament answers this Objection; for the Parliament by their Authority <hi>cannot make that fit,</hi> which is inconsistent <hi>with Humane Nature,</hi> or that <hi>convenient</hi> which was declar'd to <hi>be incapable to produce the true effect for which it was design'd:</hi> and the making Torture <hi>then only a Grievance, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted without a Cause</hi> (as is pretended) seems to satisfie as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, since every Man can easily pretend that what he does is done upon just Motives. <hi>The Imprisoning many, and keeping them long,</hi> can hardly be objected to us, since the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment find themselves <hi>obliged to do both;</hi> and the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in their great Wisdom, thought it fit to reject a Bill for <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> when it was press'd <hi>as suitable to one of the Grievances:</hi> Nor can we yet discover why the <hi>forfeitures of those</hi> should be rescinded by the current Parliament, <hi>who</hi> were Sentenc'd for having taken up Arms at <hi>Pentland-Hills,</hi> and <hi>Bothwell-Bridge</hi>; or <hi>those</hi> who were forfeited for <hi>the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at <hi>Sanquhar,</hi> and elsewhere, wherein King <hi>Charles</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have lost his Right to the Crown, <hi>for having broke the Covenant</hi> (that Tripartit and Fundamental Contract betwixt God, the King, and his People) and wherein it is declared a <hi>Duty to kill him,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> who serv'd him, and to throw off the Race of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> as constant Enemies to God: <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Compare this with the</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil's <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at the end of this Paper.</hi>

the Forfeiture of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and all who adher'd to him, and that of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> were repealed in <hi>Cumulo</hi>; for if it be lawful for Subjects to rise in Arms upon the single pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conscience, no King, nor no Government can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: If a considerable part of the Nation should now rise for <hi>Liberty, Property</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> upon the same pretext, would the Parliament find this defence good; some are also found who reproach the present Government for suffering Ministers to be thrown out by the Rabble without any previous Tryal or repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration afterwards, and many other things which afford but too great ground for Satyr and Complaint, if I were inclined to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>State</hi> is that Supereminent Law to which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion all particular Acts must bow; what else can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to justifie the <hi>throwing out</hi> the first estate of Parliament, the <hi>passing by</hi> the Magistrates then in possession in making of their Elections; and allowing some who had been sentenced for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to sit and Vote in Parliament, without ever examining the grounds upon which they had been Condemned: These who think that the <hi>necessity of State</hi> can justifie such Proceedings, (which must be their only Plea,) ought to be very careful how they blame their Predecessors for Severities, which some Mens ungovernable humours necessitated them to.</p>
            <p>We must also be allowed to admire how those who so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently comply'd with the <hi>Dispencing Power</hi> in taking an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> from the Papists, and who magnified King <hi>Iames</hi> upon that account as the best of Kings that ever Reign'd, should so snarle at us, who in a Parliament (at which not one of them assisted) refused to take away the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> made against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, whilst many of us resign'd our <hi>Places</hi> willingly in defence of those Laws? Or how those who did sit in Parliament and Judicatures with us, consenting to and approving what was done in those Reigns, should now Countenance such Reproaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; it being most undeniable that there's but very few who deserved any Employment, or had any sence, who did not concur in most of those things for which we are now so severely censured, and there are very few of any Note
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97748:14"/>
or Consideration either in the last <hi>Convention,</hi> or present <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who have not been accessory to many of the things now complain'd of.</p>
            <p>We do therefore in the last place recommend to all disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed Men, to consider that the Men of the greatest Quality, Learning, Experience, Parts, and Estates being then in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and upon Oath, it is to be presumed that love to the Salvation of their Souls, respect to their Honour, and care of their Families and Posterity would have obliged them to shun and avoid all those Severities with which they are now most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly charged, and in common Charity to believe, that what was then done by those in Power, was design'd only for the Security of the Protestant Religion, against those Factions and Schisms, and to preserve the Country from those Civil Wars and Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which had destroyed both in the last Age; and threatned to do the like in this; notwithstanding all the Pains and Care that was taken to reduce the Authors of those Mischiefs to live peaceably and quietly. We foreseeing very clearly, that one Months Civil War would occasion more ruine and destruction to the Country, than possibly the Severities of a whole Reign could do.</p>
            <p>The only Design of this Paper being to defend our selves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending others, and rather to cement than widen Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we wish that all sides may busie themselves so much in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Native Country, that they may forget injuries, which the most impartial cannot think so great in the Reign of King <hi>Ch.</hi> the Second, as those that were committed by the Complaining Party in the Reign of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> the First, and we should be sorry they had been ballanced. But sure they will be most unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who begin again upon a new score; for after that nothing can be expected, but that all Parties will run in an endless Circle of Severities. <hi>Which God of his infinite Mercy avert.</hi>

            <p>IT is much to be admired, That such as never read our <hi>Law,</hi> revis'd our <hi>Records,</hi> nor were ever employ'd as <hi>Iudges</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats</hi> in our <hi>Criminal Courts,</hi> should adventure to condemn the Proceedings of those, who for many years have made that part of our Law their constant Study, who were upon <hi>Oath,</hi> and knew that their Posterity should be judged by their Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But to inform all men more particularly, and to set things in their true light; I shall represent the <hi>Legal way of Procedure in Cases of Treason,</hi> which is the only Crime to which this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie may reach; and then prove <hi>that the King's Advocat cannot prejudge the party accus'd in any step of the process.</hi>

               <hi>Treason may be pursued</hi> either at the instance of a private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, or at the instance of the <hi>King's Advocat,</hi> who is <hi>ratione Officii, Calumniator Publicus:</hi> If a private person inform, then <hi>his Name must be exprest,</hi> to the end he, nor none of his Relations may be us'd <hi>as Witnesses,</hi> he must find Surety that he shall prove, and that he shall insist, as being liable in <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>That is, the same Punishment which the Law provides against such a Criminal.</hi>

               <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Talionis,</hi> if he fail in proving the Crime. When the <hi>pursuit</hi> was to be carried on for the publick Interest, the <hi>King's Advocat</hi> examined the Witnesses alone; but Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> thinking the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat might have been jealous'd, <hi>as too interested,</hi> prevail'd to get this Examination referr'd to <hi>the Iudges,</hi> who in all Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>Grounds whereupon pursuits are to be rais'd,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Depositions were taken, and <hi>sign'd by the Iudges and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> the Advocat presents them to the <hi>Privy Council;</hi> and if, after reading them, and a full debate upon them (many of the Learned Lawyers of the Nation being Privy Counsellors) it be found by Vote of Council, <hi>that there is sufficient ground from the Evidence to raise Process of Treason,</hi> then there is an Act of Council drawn, <hi>ordering the King's Advocat to insist</hi>; but in this Tryal, the <hi>Advocat,</hi> tho a Counsellor, never votes. The Reason why this previous Examination is allow'd, is to secure the Subjects against their being <hi>rashly and unwarrantably pursued</hi> or prosecuted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient Grounds: But left <hi>a Witness might have lookt upon himself as pre-engaged by this previous Deposition</hi>; therefore these first Depositions were always torn, and the Witnesses declared free <hi>from whatever they had formerly depos'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To strengthen the Security of the Defendant or party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> us'd to interpose <hi>with the Officers of State,</hi> before the Depositions were brought into the Council, and to represent to them his <hi>own scruples:</hi> And if the Officers of State continued still of Opinion <hi>that a Process was to be rais'd,</hi> or the Party accused to be proceeded against, then he desired the ablest Advocats of the Nation to be called, before whom the Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were read, and if they concurr'd with the <hi>Officers of State in their Iudgment of the matters being criminal,</hi> then these Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97748:15"/>
were Ordain'd also to concur <hi>with him in the pursuit.</hi> And many of the most learn'd and most popular Advocats <hi>did concur with him in the most intricate cases</hi>; as in <hi>Argyle</hi>'s, <hi>Iervis Wood</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is not to be imagin'd they would have done, had they thought their Pleading in these cases any guilt or fault.</p>
            <p>Tho by the <hi>Laws of</hi> England <hi>and other Nations,</hi> the Defendant is allowed no Advocats to plead for him in <hi>Criminal Cases,</hi> but especially not in <hi>Treason,</hi> except where <hi>the Iudges</hi> can see <hi>debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able points of Law,</hi> yet lest the <hi>Defendant</hi> may by <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>confusion</hi> omit to represent those matters of Fact, from which new points of Law may arise, therefore <hi>Our Law allows always Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to the Defendant,</hi> and forces any whom he does name to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Employ. <hi>Act</hi> 91. <hi>Parl.</hi> II. <hi>I.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Tho by the Laws of some Nations no Witnesses are allow'd to be produc'd for the Defendant, but such as do appear voluntarily, yet when Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> was a <hi>Iudge in the Criminal Court,</hi> which answers to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> he ordered for the good of the People <hi>the Remedy of Exculpation,</hi> whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant representing <hi>that he has some Defences,</hi> a <hi>Warrant</hi> is giv'n to force the Witnesses whom he names <hi>to appear,</hi> under severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties; and such time is granted to him and them, as may be sufficient for their appearance, and <hi>these Witnesses</hi> when compear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are <hi>examined upon Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Iury</hi> is obliged to believe any two of them (tho <hi>no Witnesses</hi> are allowed to Swear against the King in <hi>England</hi>) This <hi>Order</hi> was thereafter turn'd <hi>into an Act of Parliament. Act</hi> 16.3 <hi>Sess. Parl.</hi> 2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Article</hi> II. And also to take off all possibility of <hi>Packing Iuries in Edinburgh,</hi> where ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Juries are chosen, 'twas ordered by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> at Sir <hi>George</hi> his earnest Request, <hi>That the Town of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>should give up a List of all their Housekeepers who were able to pass upon Iuries, and that all these should be named</hi> per vices, <hi>according to the situation of the place where they liv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because the <hi>Defendant</hi> did not know what <hi>Witnesses</hi> were to be produced against him by the <hi>King's Advocate,</hi> and so could not have <hi>Witnesses</hi> ready to prove his <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> against <hi>them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Art. eod.</hi> II.</note> therefore Sir <hi>George</hi> prevailed with the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97748:16"/>
that the <hi>King's Advocate</hi> should be for ever after obliged <hi>to give with the Indictment a List of what Witnesses or Members of inquest were to be used by them</hi>; and an order is given <hi>for citing</hi> any Witnesses the Defendant pleases, with a competent time for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. <hi>Fifteen days</hi> being still the least time allowed by our <hi>Law,</hi> for <hi>preparing the Defendant</hi> in all such cases.</p>
            <p>When the day of Tryal or Appearance comes, the Witnesses who were present <hi>at the giving the citation</hi> are obliged to depose upon Oath, <hi>that they truly saw the citation given</hi>: thereafter the <hi>King's Advocate</hi> produces his <hi>Warrant</hi>: Nor did ever Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> prosecute any man until he was <hi>commanded by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and till he produced his <hi>Warrant,</hi> (as still appears from <hi>the Records of the Council and Criminal Court,</hi> to both which he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly appeals;) and then the <hi>Indictment</hi> is read, after which the Advocates for the Defendant, dictate to the Clerk his defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to which the King's Advocate dictates his replies, the Defendants Advocates again <hi>their duplies,</hi> &amp;c. and that to the end the <hi>Iudges may the better consider what is said,</hi> and may stand in awe of posterity. After <hi>the debate</hi> is closed, the King's Advocate and all others retire, and the <hi>Iudges</hi> having read fully <hi>the Debate,</hi> they argue the case amongst themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they by their <hi>Interlocutory Sentence find such and such points to be relevant,</hi> that is to say, <hi>well founded in Law,</hi> and they sign this <hi>Interlocutory Sentence</hi> or <hi>Iudgment,</hi> which is imposed as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>tye</hi> upon the <hi>Iudges,</hi> for the security of the People; nor are <hi>Witnesses</hi> allowed to be examined upon any thing, but what they have found thus to be Legal.</p>
            <p>The Advocates for the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Defendant</hi> being both called in before the Court, <hi>the Defendant hears the Sentence read,</hi> and then the <hi>forty five Iurors</hi> are called, and the Defendant's <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against them</hi> are discussed; and tho' of old the <hi>King's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate had the naming of the Iury,</hi> as being presumed disinteressed, yet Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> prevailed <hi>to get an Act of Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 3. <hi>ejusdem.</hi>
               </note> whereby <hi>the Nomination of the Iury was referred to the Iudges, fifteen</hi> of these <hi>forty five</hi> only are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97748:16"/>
as a sufficient <hi>Iury,</hi> and the Defendant is allowed to <hi>challenge</hi> or reject, without giving any ground or reason for it, <hi>any thirty that he pleases</hi> of that number, and the <hi>fifteen</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main make up the Jury, and are set by the Judges.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iury</hi> being thus constituted, in the <hi>next place</hi> all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are called <hi>in before the Court one by one,</hi> and not allowed to hear what one another say; and after <hi>the Objections</hi> against such Witnesses are fully debated <hi>in Writ and upon Record,</hi> the <hi>Witnesses</hi> are either admitted or rejected, as the Judges find ground in Law and Equity: If <hi>admitted,</hi> the <hi>President of the Court</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines only upon what is found <hi>legal</hi> or <hi>relevant</hi> in the <hi>Indictment.</hi> And in the next place he is <hi>examined</hi> upon any <hi>Interrogatory</hi> that is moved either by the <hi>Defendant, or any of the Iury for him,</hi> and then the <hi>whole Deposition</hi> is dictated by the <hi>President</hi> of the Court, and is fully read in the hearing of the <hi>Witness,</hi> and of the <hi>Defendant</hi> and his <hi>Advocats</hi>; and if they desire any thing to be <hi>corrected,</hi> it is accordingly done, if the Witness agree with them in the correction; and in the last place, the <hi>Deposition</hi> is <hi>signed by the President and the Witness</hi> that gave it.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Depositions</hi> being thus taken, the <hi>Advocats for the King,</hi> and <hi>Defendant</hi> speak to the <hi>Iury</hi> in a full Harangue; but because the <hi>Publick Interest</hi> was still to be preferr'd to private mens, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Law</hi> allowed the <hi>King's Advocat to be the last Speaker</hi> in all Criminal Cases, till Sir <hi>George</hi> prevail'd with the Parliament to give the last word to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in all Cases except that of Treason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 10.</note> because ordinarily the greatest impression was supposed to be made by the last pleading.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Debate</hi> and <hi>Examinations</hi> thus ended, <hi>the Iury are enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and get in with them the whole Debate, interlocutory Sentence and Depositions in writing, signed by the Iudges, Clerk, and Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> This instructs them fully how to proceed; and after they have chosen a <hi>Chancellour</hi> (or <hi>Foreman</hi>) and a <hi>Clerk,</hi> they read all the Process, and debate fully upon it; and to the end every <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> may stand in awe of Posterity, it is <hi>marked by the Clerk in the Verdict, who absolved, and who condemned</hi>; and as no Witness can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97748:17"/>
be examined but in presence of the <hi>Party indicted,</hi> so if any man speak to <hi>any of the Iury</hi> after they are enclosed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act</hi> 92. <hi>Ses.</hi> II. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6.</note> the <hi>Defendant</hi> is for ever <hi>Free.</hi> And tho of old the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the Court was used to be enclosed with the Jury for their direction; yet Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> procured, that, because the Clerk had some dependance upon the Crown, <hi>he might be excluded from going in with them,</hi> and that they might chuse their own Clerk; which they use accordingly to do since that Act. <hi>Art.</hi> 8. of the foresaid <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that no Nation is more nice in securing the Subject, or have ever shewed more judgment in <hi>Processes</hi> or Proceedings of <hi>Treason,</hi> than <hi>Scotland</hi> has.</p>
            <p>In the next place I must observe, That no Nation has ever blamed a <hi>King's Advocat</hi> for <hi>assisting</hi> in <hi>Criminal Processes,</hi> nor lies there any <hi>Action or Scandal</hi> against him any where on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; as can be proved from many hundreds of Citations of the best Laws and Lawyers; but he <hi>darkens his own Cause,</hi> when just, who uses <hi>these</hi> to ignorant people; and he <hi>lessens his own esteem,</hi> who thinks he needs them amongst men of <hi>better sense</hi>: The Law trusts him entirely as a <hi>Publick Servant,</hi> who manages these <hi>Pursuits</hi> by Virtue of his Office, and not by Malice. The <hi>King's Advocat</hi> must either have a <hi>Negative</hi> over the King and all the <hi>Iudicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> by refusing to concur, by which he might make the <hi>justest pursuit useless</hi> (for tho he should lay down his Employment, yet it would give an ill impression even of the best Cause) or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways he must be obliged to <hi>concur</hi>; in which Case he can do no <hi>prejudice,</hi> because <hi>Iudges</hi> are presum'd to be learned, and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat</hi> is still to be consider'd as too interested, to have <hi>any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Influence:</hi> Nor can he abuse the <hi>Iury</hi> with any <hi>misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in point of Law,</hi> for they are only allow'd by <hi>our Law</hi> to consider <hi>what is meer matter of Fact,</hi> and whether the precise point of Law referr'd to them by the Judges, be prov'd by <hi>these Depositions</hi> of the Witnesses which lye before the Jury in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. <hi>Iudges</hi> may err in <hi>point of Law,</hi> and Juries in <hi>point of Fact,</hi> but neither of these are entrusted to <hi>the Advocate,</hi> so that poor People are abus'd extreamly when they are informed <hi>that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97748:17"/>
King's Advocate occasioned any Mans Death.</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> might here likewise represent, that in the <hi>Rebellion against K.</hi> Ch. I. many Noblemen and Gentlemen were <hi>pursued for rising in Arms by that same King's Commission by whose Authory their Iudges did sit;</hi> and yet none of the Advocats of these times were ever quarrel'd with or mis-represented <hi>for debating even against their Master's Commission</hi> and <hi>Remission,</hi> as will appear by the Processes of <hi>Haddo, Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Spotswood, <hi>Marquess of</hi> Huntley, <hi>Montross,</hi> and hundreds of other Gentlemen, but Sir <hi>Geo.</hi> needs justifie himself by no such Precedents.</p>
            <p>In the third place, Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> may unanswerably urge, that no Man who endeavoured so to lessen the <hi>Power of the King's Advocats</hi> by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Regulations,</hi> can be thought to have had any inclinations to <hi>stretch it;</hi> as also he may value himself <hi>for refusing to accept the King's Advocate's place, till his Predecessour resign'd it under his hand; that he never inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against any Man, nor suggested any pursuit;</hi> that when a Pursuit was motioned, <hi>he pleaded as much in private for the Defendant, if the case was dubious, as any of his Advocates did thereafter in the process; nor did he ever shew any vehemence in the process,</hi> except when he was jealous'd of Friendship to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> or of love to <hi>popularity,</hi> because he had so pleaded in private: and no age did ever see so <hi>many thousands pardoned,</hi> nor so many <hi>Indemnities</hi> granted, as was in his time, which as it must be principally ascribed to the <hi>extraordinary Clemency of the Kings he served,</hi> so it may be in some measure imputed <hi>to the natural Byass which Sir</hi> George <hi>had to the merciful hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is great Reason to believe that <hi>poor People are only mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by mis-informations,</hi> since <hi>some</hi> in their <hi>Pamphlets</hi> clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Advocate for threatning the Iury with a Process of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> whereas all that he does <hi>is to protest for a process of Errour,</hi> which is a duty imposed upon <hi>him by our Law.</hi> They accuse him also for having <hi>occasioned great expences to the Countrey, for keeping Witnesses unexamined,</hi> whereas it appears fully from our Statutes and Practice that the examination of Witnesses is no part of his duty, for the <hi>Sollicitor</hi> presents them, and the <hi>Iudges</hi> only can examine them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97748:18"/>The bulk of all the processes raised in K. <hi>Charles</hi> 2. and K. <hi>Iames</hi> 7. Reigns, were against such <hi>as rose in actual Rebellion at</hi> Pentland-Hills, Bothwell-Bridge, <hi>and</hi> Argyle<hi>'s Invasion</hi>; the first were pursued by Sir <hi>Iohn Nisbet,</hi> one of the best Lawyers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men that ever pleaded; and Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> did but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py his Libels in pursuing Men in the other two Rebellions, These <hi>Indictments</hi> were founded upon the <hi>Laws of all Nations,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> declaring that <hi>Subjects taking Arms against the King and his Authority were Traytors.</hi> All the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry, almost all who are in the present Government rose against them with their Swords in their hands, and so were more guilty (if that must be called guilt) than any Judge; these <hi>Proceedings were justified</hi> by many <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and all the <hi>Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures</hi>; and <hi>England</hi> still continues to think that <hi>Monmouth's Invasion was a Rebellion;</hi> so that the succeeding <hi>King's Advocates</hi> could not be blamed for pleading in defence of what others <hi>fought for,</hi> and judged.</p>
            <p>There were other two Classes of Men prosecuted in those times, the one was of <hi>the Murderers of the Arch-Bishop of St.</hi> Andrews, the other was of such as in <hi>publick Rendezvous of Rebellion,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavour the Extirpation of <hi>Popery, Prelacy</hi> (that is, <hi>Church Government by Archbishops, Bishops, their Chancellours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Arch-Deacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that Hierarchy) Superstition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, Schism, Prophaneness,</hi> and whatsoever shall be found to be contrary to <hi>sound Doctrine</hi> and the <hi>Power of Godliness;</hi> Lest we partake in other mens sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues; And that the <hi>Lord may be One,</hi> and <hi>his Name One</hi> in the three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We shall with the same sincerity, reality, and constancy, in our several Vocations, endeavour with <hi>our Estates and Lives</hi> mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to preserve the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> And to preserve and defend the Kings Majesties <hi>Person and Authority,</hi> in the <hi>preservation</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the Kingdoms; That the World may bear witness with our Consciences of our <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and that we have no <hi>thoughts</hi> or <hi>intentions</hi> to <hi>diminish</hi> His Majesties <hi>Iust Power</hi> and Greatness.</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="6">6.

            <p>And, because these Kingdoms are guilty of <hi>many sins</hi> and <hi>provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> against GOD, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our <hi>present distresses</hi> and <hi>dangers,</hi> the fruits thereof, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and declare before GOD and the World, our unfeigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,

especially that <hi>we have not,</hi> as we ought, <hi>valued the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable benefit of the Gospel,</hi> that we have not <hi>laboured for the Purity and Power thereof,</hi> and that we have <hi>not endeavoured to receive Christ in our Hearts,</hi> nor to walk <hi>worthy of him</hi> in our lives, which are the causes of other sins and transgressions so much abounding amongst us, and our true and unfeigned pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, desire, and endeavour for our selves and all others under our Power and Charge, both in publick and in private, in all Duties we owe to GOD and Man, <hi>to amend our lives,</hi> and each one to <hi>go before another</hi> in the <hi>example</hi> of a <hi>real Reformation</hi>; That the Lord may turn away his wrath, and heavy indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Establish these Churches and Kingdoms in Truth and Peace.

            <p>It is true, We are not ignorant of the great unmindfulness, failing, counteracting, and mocking that has been in our <hi>former Vows and Covenants</hi> with God, and of the great <hi>Iudgments</hi> that hath, and are like to follow such <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>sinful dealing</hi> with God in such weighty Matters, (for which we both ought and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to <hi>be Humbled before Him,</hi>) which cannot but <hi>make us</hi> with great trembling of Heart <hi>enter into new ones,</hi> knowing both our own weakness and readiness to relapse, and the great hazard and danger of such relapses; Yet, the desire of <hi>recovering</hi> and <hi>preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> a remnant, and the <hi>conviction of</hi> this, as the most <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mean,</hi> the zeal to Gods glory, and Christs reigning, (which is the highest and most acceptable duty Man can perform to God,) hoping <hi>for His Mercies</hi> (who is witness to the Integrity of our Hearts and rightness of our Intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) that <hi>he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, direct, accept,</hi> and <hi>prosper</hi> us, we go forward, declaring, that nothing else but what we here express is our Design.</p>
            <p n="1">I.

Tyranny, Incroachment,</hi> and <hi>corruption of Prelacy</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Erastianism</hi> on the other.

            <p n="3">III. That we shall endeavour to our outmost, the <hi>extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Darkness,</hi> and whatsoever is contrair to the Kingdom of Christ, and especially <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> in all the Articles of it, as we are bound in our <hi>National Covenant;</hi> and Superstition, Will-worship, and Prelacy, with its Hierarchy, as we are bound in our <hi>Solemn League and Covenant;</hi> And that we shall with the same sincerity, endeavour (God giving us Assistance) the <hi>overthrow</hi> of that Power that <hi>hath established</hi> that Prelacy and Erastianism over the Church, and exercises such a <hi>Lustful and Arbitrary Tyranny</hi> over the Subjects, seeking again to introduce <hi>Idolatry and Superstition</hi> in these Lands, <hi>contrair to our Covenants</hi>: And in a word, that we shall endeavour the <hi>extirpation</hi> of all the works of Darkness, and the Relicts of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superstition, (which are both much enlarged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in our times,) and <hi>execute righteous Iudgments impartially</hi> (according to the Word of God, and degree of Wickedness) upon the Committers of these things, but especially Blasphemy, Idolatry, Atheism, Sorcery, Perjury, Uncleanness, Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, Oppression and Malignancy, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus zealous for God, he may delight to dwell among us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Seriously considering, that the <hi>hand of our Kings</hi> has been against the <hi>Throne of the Lord,</hi> and that now for a long time, the <hi>Succession of our Kings,</hi> and the most part of our <hi>Rulers</hi> with him, hath been <hi>against the purity and power of Religion and Godliness,</hi> and freedom of the Church of God, and hath <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> from the <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>good Government</hi> of their Predecessors, into Tyranny, and hath of late so manifestly <hi>rejected God,</hi>

his <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> as a Slavery, as they themselves call it in their publick Papers, (especially in these last Letters to the King, and Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>) disclaiming <hi>their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, and Blasphemously inacting it <hi>to be burnt by the hand of a Hang-man,</hi> governed contrary to <hi>all right Laws</hi> divine and humane, excercised such <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, opprest</hi> Men in their Consciences and Civil Rights, used free Subjects (Christian and reasonable Men) with <hi>less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and justice</hi> than their Beasts; and so not only frustrate the <hi>great end of Government,</hi> (which is, <hi>that Men may live God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holily</hi> and <hi>Peaceably</hi> under them, and might be maintained in their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> form <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi>) but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so walked contrary to it, so that it can no more be called <hi>a Government,</hi> but <hi>a lustful Rage,</hi> excercised with as little <hi>right Reason,</hi> and with <hi>more Cruelty</hi> than in Beasts, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves can be no more called <hi>Governours,</hi> but <hi>publick Grassators,</hi> and <hi>publick Iudgements,</hi> which all Men ought as earnestly to <hi>labour</hi> to be <hi>free</hi> of, as of Sword, Famine, or Pestilence raging amongst us; and besides, hath <hi>stopped</hi> (instead of <hi>punishing</hi>) the <hi>Course of Law</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> against Idolaters, Blasphemers, Atheists, Murderers, Incestuous and Adulterous, and other Malefactors; and instead of <hi>rewarding the Good,</hi> hath made <hi>Butcheries</hi> and <hi>Murthers</hi> on the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>People,</hi> sold them as Slaves, Imprisoned, For faulted, Banished and Fined them, upon no other account, but for <hi>maintaining the Lords Right to rule Consciences,</hi> against the Usurpations of Men, for <hi>fulfilling their Vows,</hi> and <hi>repelling</hi> unjust Violence, which innocent Nature allows to all; of all which, and more particulars, we can give (we speak as before God) innumerable and sure Instances: Neither can it be thought that there is hope of their returning from these Courses, having so often shewed their <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Enmities</hi> against <hi>God</hi> and <hi>all Righteousness,</hi> and so often declared and renewed their Purposes and Promises of persevering in these Courses. And, suppose they should <hi>dissemble a Repentance</hi> of these Evils, and profess to return to better Courses, being put to Straits, or for their own Ends, (for upon no other account can we reasonably expect it;)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97748:25"/>
and though it might be thought, that there <hi>might be Pardon</hi> for what is done, (which we cannot yet see to be, without the <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and a great <hi>guiltiness</hi> on the Land, from which guiltiness the Land can never be free, but by <hi>executing of God's righteous Iudgements upon them,</hi> for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of so greatly deserved, and so necessarily requisite a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;) yet they cannot be believed, after they have violated all Tyes that Humane Wisdom can devise to bind Men; and beside, there will be something of <hi>Folly</hi> found, to think to <hi>bind a King</hi> that pretends to absoluteness: And our Fathers, or rather our selves, at first judged it <hi>not warrantable to receive Him,</hi> without consenting to, and swearing of the Covenant: And if so, the renouncing and disclaming thereof, we ought at present to judge to be a just and reasonable ground of <hi>rejecting Him upon these Grounds,</hi> being assured of God's approbation, and Mens, whose Hearts are not utterly byassed, and their Consciences altogether corrupted, and knowing assuredly, that the <hi>upholding of such,</hi> is to <hi>uphold</hi> Men to <hi>bear down Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and to <hi>uphold Satans,</hi> and the depriving of Men of right Government and good Governours, to the ruining of Religion, and undoing of Humane Society.

               <hi>taken</hi> altogether <hi>away</hi> Christ's Church and Government, and <hi>changed</hi> the Civil Government of this Land (which was by King and free Parliament) into Tyranny, where none are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate to be partakers of the Government, but only those who will be found by Justice <hi>to be Guilty of Criminals,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers excluded, even those who by the Laws of the Land by Birth had a right to, and a share in that Government, and that only, because not of the <hi>same Guiltiness</hi> and <hi>mischievous Purposes</hi> with themselves: And also, all <hi>free elections</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for Parliaments, and Officers for Government, are <hi>made void</hi> by <hi>their making</hi> those the Qualifications of admission to these Places, which by the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and the Laws of this Land, were the <hi>cause of their exclusion before,</hi> so that none can look upon us, or judge us bound in Allegeance to them. unless they say also we <hi>are bound in Allegeance to Devils,</hi> they being his Vicegerents, and not Gods.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We then being <hi>made free,</hi> by God and their own doings, he giving the Law, and they giving the Transgression of that Law, which is the cause that we are <hi>loosed now</hi> from all <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> to them, and knowing that no Society of Men that hath <hi>Corruption in them,</hi> (which always is ready to beget disorders and do injuries, unless restrained and punished by Laws and Government) can be without Laws and Government, and withal desiring to be governed in <hi>the best</hi> way that is least lyable to Inconveniencies and Tyranny: We do declare, that we shall <hi>set up over our selves,</hi> and <hi>over all that God shall give us Power,</hi> Government, and Governours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, and especially according to that word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the People, able Men, such as fear God, Men of Truth, hating Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness</hi>; and that we shall no more <hi>commit the Government</hi> of our selves, and the making of Laws for us, to <hi>any one single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>lineal Successor,</hi> we not being tied as the <hi>Iews</hi> were by

the Ecclesiastick-Government is swallowed up in the Civil, (if the rest had followed them) the Ministry should have also been <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct</hi> with themselves, and the whole <hi>Work of Reformation had been buried in Oblivion,</hi> not so much as the remembrance of it kept up: These, together with the other of their Commissions in Preaching, the <hi>lawfulness of paying that Tribute</hi> declared to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for the bearing down of the true Worship of God, (which they falsly termed <hi>Seditious Conventicles,</hi>) and their advising these poor Prisoners to subscribe the Bond, and consequently could not but so advise all others, if put to it, (for the hazard that Men were in, will not make a real change of the morality of that Action,) and beside, the rest may be put to it upon the same hazard, and so if the <hi>one should advise,</hi> (which consequently they must do,) and the <hi>other should subscribe,</hi> this would altogether close that door which the Lord hath made use of in all the Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> for casting off the <hi>Yoke of the Whore,</hi> and restoring the <hi>Truth and Purity</hi> of Religion and Reformation, and freedom of the Churches, and should have stopped all ingress for Men, when once brought under Tyranny, to recover their Liberty again. These Ministers then, <hi>not being followers of Christ,</hi> who before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> gave a good Confession, which was, that he was a King; and no King, if he have not power to order his House and Subjects, and they <hi>not following him,</hi> nor his Ministers, if not asserting and maintaining of this Kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, against all Incroachers and Usurpers of it; and besides, we being commanded, <hi>If any Brother walk disorderly, from such to withdraw;</hi> and although in the capacity we now are in, we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have, nor assume to our selves Authority to give our defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and authoritative Sentences of Deposition and Suspension against these Ministers; yet we declare, which is proper for us to do, that <hi>we neither can,</hi> nor <hi>will bear Preaching,</hi> nor <hi>receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> from these Ministers that hath <hi>accepted</hi> of, and <hi>voted</hi> for that Liberty; and declares all who have encouraged and strengthened their Hands, by hearing and pleading for them, all those who have traffiqued for an union with them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their renouncing and repenting of these things, all those

            <p>IT is not amongst the smallest of the Lords Mercies to this poor Land, that there hath always been some who hath given a Testimony of <hi>every course of Defection</hi> which we were guilty of, which is a <hi>token for Good,</hi> that he does not as yet intend to cast us off altogether, but that He will <hi>leave a remnant,</hi> in whom <hi>He will be glorious,</hi> if they (through His Grace) keep themselves clean still, and walk in His Way and Method, as it hath been walked in, and owned by Him in our Predecessors (of truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Memory) their time, in their <hi>carrying on our noble Work of Reformation,</hi> in the several steps thereof, <hi>from Popery and Prelacy,</hi> and likewise from <hi>Erastian-Supremacy,</hi> so much usurped by him, who it is true (so far as we know) is descended from the Race of our Kings; yet he hath so far deborded from what he ought to have been, by <hi>Perjury and Vsurpation in Church Matters,</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in Matters Civil,</hi> as is known by the whole Land, that we have just reason to believe, that one of the <hi>Lords great Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> against us is, that <hi>we have not disowned him,</hi> and <hi>the Men of his Practices,</hi> whether inferiour Magistrates, or any others, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

Likewise, in the Holy Scriptures, we renounce Chapters and Verses, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, because it is only done by Humane Wisdom, and the changing of the Books after the Holy Ghost had placed them: we being pressed to this work by the Holy Ghost, do renounce the Impression and Translation of both the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments, and that for additions put unto them by Men, and other causes; as first, putting in horrid Blasphemy, making a Tyrant Patron of the Church, when the Scriptures holds of none but of God, and needs no Patronage from any King, Prince, or Rulers, and the writing of that Blasphemous, Sacrilegious, (as some call it) the Epistle Dedicatory, filled with such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as <hi>Dread Sovereign Highness, most High and Mighty, most Sacred Majesty</hi>; and likewise the horrid unparallell'd Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, making a Triangle with these <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters in it thus, <gap reason="foreign">

We renounce the Acts of the General Assembly, and all the Covenants, and acknowledging of Sins and engagement to Duties, and that which they call Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books, and all their works, way, form, and manner of Worship, Doctrine, Discipline, and Government, and the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying on their Books, the thing they call their Preaching, for instead of going to God for his mind to the People, they go to their Books, and so makes their Books their God and their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so all following that way, go to Hell together: The cause of this is, we find none of their works but they are

And likewise, we renounce the Covenant taken at <hi>Queensferry,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cargil</hi>'s Covenant, and likewise <hi>Hamiltown</hi> Declaration, yea, and <hi>Sanquhare</hi> Declaration, because they may and has owned these, and are owning these, who are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Holiness, and were Enemies to us, as some of them said, we should suffer Kirk Censure for giving over the old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postat Ministers to the Devil, and some of them counted us their Enemies for the truths sake, and sent us word they would protest against us, and so we justifie our Lord in breaking them at <hi>Airds</hi> Moss, we justifie the Lord likewise, in taking away that they call Field-Preachings, or mockings, because they were nothing but Rebellion against the High Lord, as we find now when our Lord is come to the Cross, there is neither Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster nor People to bide by him, of the many Thousands has flocked to the thing they call Preachings or mockings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now all are found void of saving Grace, and so we see that word is accomplished, <hi>Strait and narrow is the way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it</hi>: And that other word, <hi>many shall strive and shall not be able.</hi> We find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all former Actions to be such as Devils has and can

            <p>We renounce all the Customs and Fashions of this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their way and custom of eating and drinking, sleeping and wearing, and all our own former ways, as well Religious as Moral, in so far as they have been squared and casten in this Generations mould, and all our iniquious courses, lightness and unconcernedness with the Glory of God, the only end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were sent into the World the 7<hi>th</hi> day of the Week, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 27<hi>th</hi> of the 5<hi>th</hi> Month.</p>
            <p>We renounce all that are now in Prison-houses or Correction-houses, Men and Women; for none of them are with us in this work, and when we sent them a Copy of this our Renouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they called us Devils. The Copy of this we burnt instead of the Books and Works of this Apostate Generation, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Ashes in our and covered it with dust.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding of our burning Covenants and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and renouncing of them and their works; Be it known to All, that we do neither vindicate the cursed Murderers of their Bloodshed on Fields, and Scaffolds, and Seas, and other horrid Cruelties, such as Torturings, Imprisonments, Pillagings, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, Scourgings, Stigmatizings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor condemn we the worthy Martyrs, and the sufferings of others, only we give the Lord Justice, and vindicats his tarrying, for now the Furnace has brought forth a more pure Cause which we term, <hi>Holiness to be built upon the word of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97748:32"/>That all may know and see our innocency, and know our end is and was the Glory of God in all we did, though we came far short; and in the Months past we could get none to shew us kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Meat or Lodging, though we could pay for it our selves: That word in <hi>Malachy, Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, even the whole Nation.</hi> And likewise in <hi>Deut. We seeing the Land all thus cursed, and all justifying themselves in that iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were afraid to eat, or drink, or sleep under a Roof with them</hi>: though there were many that would have shelter'd us, yet we could not eat, drink, converse, or pray with them, lest we had come under the Curse, so many times our Beds has been in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Fields, and we have come to houses and they would not sell us Meal to make Potage of, and we have found Meal and Water a rare dish, because the curse was off it, and it was blessed to us, according to that Scripture, <hi>the blessing of the Lord maketh Rich.</hi> We are not murmuring in this, but when the Weather has been worst, Winds and Rain, cold Frost and Snow, and when we had fasted most, we were best satisfied, according to that Scripture, <hi>all shall work together for their good, that truly seek the Lord;</hi> when we had outward straits, then we had most inward peace, we had joy in the Holy Ghost, so the things the World calls the worst of our life, as reproaches, imprisonments, nakedness, hunger, and cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we had rather be suffering for our Lords sake, than be Kings of the whole earth, for our joy no man can take from us, and our Prison is so pleasant through our Lord, that we care for no company, for we know no company but all are cursed, and we know not what it is to be weary, but according to that Scripture, <hi>eat and drink my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, yea eat and drink abundantly,</hi> we are rather in Paradise.</p>
            <p>These things were cleared to us when fasting and praying, and we were pressed to do this by the Holy Ghost, we had many Fasts about this thing, and this Week we took some Milk and Bread in the third day of the week in the morning being the 24 after the 5<hi>th</hi> Month 1681. And tasted neither meat nor drink, nor any other kind of living, till the 6<hi>th</hi> day of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97748:32"/>
week at 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day of noon (and then we took a little Milk and Bread) for to find out the causes of his wrath we have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, mourned, wept, many a night and day in Houses and Fields, for we have and has had no other end but his Glory, that the Elect such as should be saved might be brought in, and it is only Conscience that keeps us from giving Men Reverence in word and behaviour, though some call us dumb Devils, and unlearned Bruits, and one of us when coming before them they call Rulers, was called a Block-head, notwithstanding of all that came on us, we know and are taught by the Holy Scriptures, to give Honour unto whom Honour is due, and to salute one another, but it has been our work of a time to renounce the filthy vile Imbracings, Salutations, and Complements of this Generation, which they call Court-breeding, our carriage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to follow the Lord Jesus, should be steed and circumspect according to that Scripture, <hi>Let us walk circumspectly, not as Fools, but as wise Men,</hi> as it is written in <hi>Matthew, Let your light so shine before Men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cursed are they that says peace to a Land, who are in the place of Watchmen, when the Lord says no peace, which practice, we silly unlearned Creatures renounce, for we bless him he has keeped us from resting till the Ark rest, and as for these they call Watchmen, that cries peace or keep silence, we shall refer them to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which ye may read at leisure, which we think shall be <hi>Scotland.</hi> Doom, for we have heard tell of few of them they call Ministers, but they have all said peace, when brought before the Enemies to witness their practice, being most unconscionable on Hill sides, and Moor sides, before several thousands, they called them Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and intollerable Oppressors, and their Government Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression, and that the Crown of Supremacy that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> had usurped over the Kirk, would weigh him down from the Throne, and all that Race with him, and when they are brought before them, and into
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97748:33"/>
Prisons, nothing but in with the other supplication, to the Honourable Lords of His Majesties Secret Council, beck and beinge, and please your Lordships Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now they are all at peace with his Enemies, save one whom we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, and so or long the Enemies shall Curse them, when the Lord awakens their Consciences, (though we confess we have had some special Witnesses of Ministers) and we think or long, the Malignants shall pursue these Ministers to Death for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness, for the vilest Creatures in the Land high and low, Rich and Poor, noble and ignoble, must give account for works done in the flesh; then the Dogs, Sorcerers, Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, False-Swearers, Cursers, Sabbath-breakers, Idle loose Livers, and all that are unchast in thoughts, words, and behaviour, and all that makes no Conscience of their way, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lye, shall tremble that day when they shall enter into Eternity; when it shall be said as it was to <hi>Dives, Thou in thy Lifetime hadst thy good things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>his bad things: For except a Man be born again, he can in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We take up the Book of the Holy Scripture at the Lords command, and for a Testimony of our Dissatisfaction, at the abounding Corruptions, both of Translators and the Press, and likewise for a Testimony of our desires and intentions for a new Translation and Impression, free of the foresaid and other abuses, we to our power reform our own Books, and sayes, that the word of God needs no humane Art; we hold that the Word of God is laid the Foundation of this new Building, and shortly it shall become the head Corner stone of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, over both Kirk and Stater Kirk-Men, and States-Men; so that Scripture towards the end of the <hi>Rev.</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> shall be fulfilled; <hi>And I saw Heaven opened, and behold a white Horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in Righteousness he doth Iudge and make War, his Eyes were as a flame of Fire, and on his Head were many Crowns, and he had a new Name written that no Man knew, but he himself, and he was Cloathed with a Vesture dipt in Blood, and his Name is called the word of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97748:33"/>And first, to shew that we take the Word of God in every point to be our Rule, the sum and end of our so much reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mocked at Exercise (Fasting and Prayer) will be found in the Book of <hi>Psalms; Be thou exalted, O God, above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and let thy glory be above all the Earth.</hi> It is written in the Acts of the Apostles, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us:</hi> but they usurping Supremacy, says, by the Authority of the <hi>General Assembly</hi> allows these <hi>Psalms</hi> to be sung in Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we renounce: And more, we think the <hi>Psalm</hi> Book in Meeter, and no other thing ought to be within the broads of the Bible, but the simple Scriptures of Truth; the <hi>Psalms</hi> may be had in a Book by themselves.</p>
            <p>We are so reproached and calumniate, that we are forced to make our defence, and shew that we have mourned, fasted, and prayed many a day, and many a night this last Winter, many times in the open Fields, in Frost and Snow, while our Cloaths were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen upon us, and our Feet frozen in our Shooes, as the Town of cursed <hi>Borronstonness</hi> can witness, and all this to find out the causes of our Lords tarrying, when those who are now calling us Devils, were turning themselves upon their Ivory beds, like a door upon the Hinges, eating the fat and drinking the sweet at their own ease: And when we were driven thence by Persecution, we took our selves to the Fields, holding still by our duty, where many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did offer themselves to the Work, with whom our spirits was many a time burdened, whom we could not put away (as our blessed Lord dealt with <hi>Iudas</hi> whom he knew would betray him) without manifest causes: We stayed not with them but on so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn days, such as <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and appointed times for publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but when they took their rest betwixt hands, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinnued still in Fields, nights and days, fasting and praying for two or three days together several times, and it was always their fear we should propose some question to try them for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that night before we was taken, we warned them that the Soldiers would come, and told them to use their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: we saw them also a mile off, an hour before they came,
<pb facs="tcp:97748:34"/>
and none of them would go away; and after we were brought in hither, after some several days Fasting and Prayer, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned by the Holy Ghost, followed <hi>Esther</hi>'s advice, and continued from eight a Clock of the morning the 24 day of the 5 Month, till the 27 at four afternoon, Fasting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we sent them word likewise to Fast and Pray, and when we sent them the answer of our Prayers in the writ, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us Devils: Thence we fasted till the 28 day at night, and thence till the 30 at night, waiting still to see if they would recover, but they waxed still worse, and we were forced to write this to vindicate our carriage towards them.</p>
