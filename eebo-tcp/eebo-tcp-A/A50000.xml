            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> a quondam ſervant, and favourite, to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was of late yeares ſent over by his Majeſty as Ambaſſadour to the Great Turke, for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the affaires of our Engliſh Merchants in his Dominions reſiding. Of his good or evill Deportment before our Domeſtique quarrels began, wee have no will to inquire, but ſhall begin our diſcourſe from that time when our Merchants were moſt ſenſible of his injurious oppreſſions of them, and of his Deviation from that eſpeciall truſt which was repoſed in him by the King his Maſter for their protection and advantage.</p>
            <p>At firſt Sir <hi>Sackvile</hi> began to burthen their goods with heavy and unaccuſtomed impoſitions, which they not reſenting, hee, to aggravate a more full miſchiefe upon them, impriſons their perſons, threatens their lives, &amp;c. But well knowing (theſe tyrannicall actions) would be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned by his Majeſty the King of England, and that the Merchants being men of active ſpirits and able performances would ſeeke redreſſe and complaine, Hee moſt abuſively pretends a new Letter from his Majeſty to the great Turke, dated <hi>Newcaſtle 24. Septemb. 1646.</hi> to aſſiſt the ſayd Sir <hi>Sackvile</hi> in his further unjuſt proceeding against our Merchants. But neither did his Majeſty ſend any ſuch new Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Grand Signieur, or give unto the ſayd Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> under his Royall Signature any other Commiſſion ſo to abuſe and undo his loyall ſubjects.</p>
            <p>For His Majeſty moſt graciouſly upon Complaint from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Sir <hi>Sackviles</hi> miſdemeanours, revoked the Credentiall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters formerly given unto him, and newly elected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and admitted as his Ambaſſadour unto the Grand Signieur, a perſon of fortune and honour,
<pb facs="tcp:94874:3"/>
by name Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> Baronet; The many diſturbances which this worthy Gentleman encountred with at his firſt Arrivall in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, by meanes of Sir <hi>Sackvile</hi> his diſobedience to his Majeſties Letter of revocation, and his ſcandalous aſperſions upon the Actions and perſon of the Lord Ambaſſadour, were I ſay enough to have diſhearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned even an aſſured reſolution, and inforced a Receſſe from ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous an employment among ſuch rigid and harſh people as the Turkes are: but his Lordſhip being of an invincible ſpirit, and maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how farre his Majeſties, and the Nations honour, and welfare of the London Merchants were concerned herein, by admirable reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at laſt obtained the perſon of Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> and then ſhipt him for London, where at preſent he ſtands committed to the Tower.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſince his happy inveſture lives amongſt the Turkes, in great eſtimation and honour, equall if not ſuperiour to any former Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, continually as occaſion is offered, aſſiſting the induſtrious Merchants, betwixt whom and his Lordſhip, there is a very amiable Compliance. I might juſtly by way of aggravation unfold the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility of Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> in inciting his Lady at Alicant in Spaine, as they returned for England, there to complain unto the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſhee and her husband were Catholiques, and inforced againſt their wills to become Proteſtants; whereupon the honeſt Captaine and his Mate, who civilly went aſhore with her, were detained Priſoners, and ſo alſo many of our Engliſh Merchants, not yet releaſed; But the diſcourſe will beſt manifeſt the truth thereof, atteſted by the hands of thoſe Merchants now ſuffering.</p>

            <p>A true Relation of the Cariage of the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> Barr. Lord Ambaſſadour with the <hi>Grand Signieur</hi> at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> together with his Letters and Arres he ſent abroad to ſeverall of his Oppoſers in his Embaſſie.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo dayes before his Lordſhip came to <hi>Bruſhia,</hi> (for he came from <hi>Smyrna</hi> overland) Mr. <hi>Lancelot</hi> the Agent ſent him a Letter, that hee Vizeere was cut off, withall, telling him, that hee had ſent to this new one, to congratulate him in his place, and did intend (by his leave) to viſit him within three or foure dayes, and Diſtill our Caſe into him, with the beſt Oratorie he had, withall telling him, that he was a Rugged harſh man, and not likely to favour our Cauſe. Hereupon my Lord (conſidering how little need the Company had of this unneceſſarie charge) did forthwith diſpatch a Poſt to him, with a few lines to this purpoſe; That he would not have him upon any tearmes to make a Viſit, nor act in any buſineſſe further, for it was not fitting, nor would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, his Lordſhip being ſo neer the Port; he told him that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling the Caſe into his head, was croſſe to his Lordſhips deſigne, who came peremptorily to demand juſtice, and cared not whether the Vizeere were good, bad, or indifferent. But before this Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could arive him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had not only viſited him with a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but (to my Lords great vexation &amp; future trouble) had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Hattecherife, which coſt us not leſſe then 40000 l. to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Sir <hi>Sac. Crow</hi>; for the words of the Hattecherife under the Grand Signieurs hand, (which is as the Law of the Medes and Perſians)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94874:4"/>
were theſe, (let the Ambaſſadour have no more to doe with the Engliſh Nation) while this was in our hands, he could never ſtirre againſt us, nor durſt publike miniſters ſuffer him, but juſt now (without, if not contrary to advice) againſt my Lord ſhould ſet foot on this ſhore, our chained enemy is let looſe upon him; and indeed but that my Lord could not find any deſigne he had in it, but meere want of reſolution and judgement, the world could never have perſwaded him, but that the Agent had done it on purpoſe: for Sir <hi>Sack. Crow</hi> ſtraightwayes provides a very great preſent, and with full attendance goes to the Vizeere, the day before my Lord arrived, with confidence hee ſhould bee yeſted (which had been re-eſtabliſhment) but was deceived. The next day being the 16. <hi>September,</hi> my Lord early in the morning (having come all night by Sea in a Boat) arrived here, and after hee had repoſed himſelfe ſome houres, went together with the Agent in his Coach, attended by his Retinue, and us, to that houſe the Agent had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him; The next day my Lord calls a Court, and reſolved there to ſend Mr. Agent to the Vizeere to demand Audience for him of the Grand Signieur, and to tell him hee could not expect juſtice from him, who had broke open the Merchats houſes but three dayes bofore his comming, and had taken out goods to the value of 40000. pounds. This Meſſage was ſo in pieces delivered, as the Vizeere though he did, yet hee would not underſtand it but asked if he had Letters for him, yes ſaid the Agent, let me ſee them ſaid he, that I may know what to doe, and you ſhall have Audience with the Grand Signieur. Upon this anſwer my Lord reſolves to viſit him next himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt know, that when my Lord came firſt to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> a Letter wat conveyed into his ſons hands to give him, this came from Sir <hi>Sack. Crow,</hi> and was verbatim as followes.</p>

            <p>WHen they remembred my Lord Ambaſſadours love to him, he told them they were welcome as from <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> but not as Ambaſſadour; he opened and read them, and ſaid that the Copy he read, he could not believe to be the Copy of the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that in the very firſt line or two, there was a double contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that the whole frame, ſtile, matter and language was ſo unlike thoſe of his Majeſties, that if the Originall was not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Copy, he ſhould not care a ruſh for it, and that he could not believe Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh</hi> had any ſuch Letter from the King of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore could not receive him as Ambaſſadour; that hee would further conſider of the Letter, and if hee thought convenient would ſend him anſwer by ſome of his owne poelpe within a day or two, which he did, but that being ſo Tedious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing but falſe ſurmiſes, and daring expreſſions, from the buſineſſe, ſo that as my Lord thought it not worthy his anſwering, ſo wee conceive it not convenient to trouble your patience with it in this place. Now the next thing that my Lord aimes at, is for a

faire and ſitting Audience with the Vizeere, who offered him to come when he pleaſed; but my Lord was privatly informed he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an affront by not Veſting him. My Lord at a Court then holden, deſires ſix of us might be choſen to meet conſtantly to adviſe with him; When it was agreed that the beſt way was privately by two or three of the Merchants to found <hi>Aronomone</hi> the Vizeers Jew; after much debate with him for the ſpace of foure houres, telling him, except my Lord were ſure of his dues, he would come without a preſent, at laſt he promis'd that he ſhould be Veſted with his ſon, and at leaſt one or two more; Hereupon he ſent to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeere, that he would viſit him upon Thurſday the 23. <hi>September,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been juſt a week in town, and in the mean time had neither been ſent to by the Emperours Agent, the French Ambaſſadour, nor the Lord Bayliffe (only the Dutch Merchants did, whoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is not yet conformed, but will ſee what ſucceſſe wee have) for Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> hath wrought all thoſe firme to him. Now was the Town full of expectation, nothing talked of but our buſineſſe. On Thurſday about twelve a clock, with all the Merchants, and my Lords retinue, my Lord went to the Vizeere, who being ſet before he came, ſtirred not from his ſeat, neither did my Lord mind him untill he was ſet as well as the Vizeere; Then he ſpake to him to this effect, that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſaluted him, and wiſhed him health and happineſſe, and had ſent him his Ambaſſadour to keepe his Merchants and ſubjects from doing, and ſuffering wrong, and commanded him to indeavour to keep and uphold the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nations, and alſo to give thankes for the Juſtice the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeere ſhewed to the Merchants, when the Ambaſſadour would have ruined them, and alſo to deſire him to ſend the ſaid Ambaſſadour home, that the King his Maſter, hearing their Difference, might judge him according to merit; and while he was ſaying this, hee preſented the Kings Letters to him, which he read before us; to this the Vizeere replyed, that the old Ambaſſadour had Letters, and did pretend to be Ambaſſadour as well as his Lordſhip, and hee knew not how to decide the buſineſſe, but muſt heare them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; to which my Lord anſwered, My Lord, you miſtake me, I come not hither to be judged, neither is it for my honour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare here with that man, which your own Lawes have judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, neither may I countenance him without the juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94874:7"/>
of the Grand Signieur; the French Ambaſſadour alſo (ſaid the Vizeere) could ſay ſomething in the Cauſe; The French Ambaſſadour (ſaid my Lord) hath nothing to doe with our State; have you a Letter to the old Ambaſſadour (ſaid the Vizeere) from the King of <hi>England,</hi> I have, ſaid my Lord, which I deſired to deliver him before witneſſe, therefore he asked him for two Chou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, you ſhall have it (ſaid the Vizeere) but give mee the Letters and I will deliver them my ſelfe; My Lord told him hee could not, for the King his Maſter commanded him to deliver them with his own hand; then ſaid he, I will ſend for him hither, if you doe ſo (ſaid my Lord) I will have no Contract with him, I hope thoſe Letters will witneſſe the truth of my Embaſſie; Yes, ſaid he, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you are the true Ambaſſadour, but I would heare him what he can ſay, and ſee the delivery of the Letters, and I will ſoon end the buſineſſe; doe ſo if you will (ſaid my Lord) and I will ſtay here till he come; ſo hee was immediatly ſent for, but he excuſed, ſaying he had taken phyſick that day, but to morrow hee would come at one a clock; when my Lord heard that, he ſaid, My Lord, doe not you by theſe Letters acknowledge me to be the true Ambaſſadour? yes, ſaid he, then what need you trouble your ſelfe further with him ſaid my Lord; upon this he knew not what to ſay, but roſe up on a ſudden to be gone, ſaying he muſt ſpeak with Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow.</hi> When my Lord perceived he would not Veſt him, hee deſired him to ſpeak one word more; then he ſate down again, and my Lord ſpake; My Lord, you ſeem to be unſatisfied in this buſineſſe, Look behind, I have all the Merchants my witneſſes, and all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Aleppo Alexandria</hi> and all the Coaſts of Turky; I have ſhips at <hi>Smyrna</hi> Laden for this Port, and divers more ready to come out; Let Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> ſhew me two Merchants, and halfe a ſhip, and I will yield him the place. The Vizeere riſeth to be gone, but my Lord ſpake on, I hope my Lord, if I be an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, as you ſay, and having brought you a Preſent as befits you, you will not deny me the Honour due to me in Veſting me? With this he turned away, and anſwered not a word, in an uncivill clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh way, which when my Lord ſaw, he was moved with paſſion, and with a great ſtamp upon the ground, ſaid, Never Ambaſſadour was ſo baſely uſed as I am, which the great men ſitting by obſerving his anger, were ſomething amazed, and inquired what hee ſaid,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94874:7"/>
which was told them. This was his firſt entertainment, which as we are certainly informed ſince, was procured by five bags of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney given him by the Venetians that day to hinder his Lordſhips Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. When he came away, he commanded all his Drugermen that none ſhould attend any more his Court, for he had one with him. The next day about 9. of the clock came two Chouzes to my Lord, to tell him from the Vizeere, that the Ambaſſadour <hi>Crow</hi> would be there, and he would have my Lord meet him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no (replyed my Lord) tell your Lord I will not meet him, nor come at his houſe any more, he hath uſed me unworthily and baſely, and ſo tell him from me. What (replyed the Chouzes) will you not come no more at his houſe? let not my Lord ſay ſo; the Vizeere is a great man, Vicegerent to the Grand Signeur and wee dare not carry him ſuch a ſleighting Meſſage. A great man? And ſo am I a great man too, ſaid my Lord; If he be Vicegerent to the Grand Signeur, tell him that I am Ambaſſadour to the King of England. Then they deſired my Lord, that ſome of his own men might carry that Meſſage, for they would not, tis no matter ſaid my Lord. I will make his uſage of me ring all Conſtantinople over before 24. houres come about; and indeed my Lord had provided Arres to ſend about, to declare his uſage of him. Now was Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> with the Vizeere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be veſted (as he had bragged the day before) but how or what part of this meſſage they delivered I know not, but Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> after he had rayled upon my Lord before the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeere and called him <hi>furfant,</hi> came home no wiſer then hee went, and the next morning the Vizeere ſent three Chouzes (one a man of great qualitie, and had been foure times Ambaſſadour with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes) remembred his kind love to my Lord, and ſent him word that he had ſent him a man of honour, that ſhould goe with him to Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> and ſee him deliver his Letters, and he would ſoon make an end of the buſineſſe. This civill reſpectfull Meſſenger, and Meſſage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſed my Lord again ſo that he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this as a favour, and the rather it pleaſed him, becauſe he ſhould croſſe Sir <hi>Sackvile Crowes</hi> humour, for not above an houre before they came he ſent to him, to tell him he would come to him (if he were at home) to deliver him Letters from the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at firſt hee lovingly ſent my Lord word, that his dores were as well open to his foes as to his friends, but preſently ſends word again upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

conſideration, that if my Lord would come privately he might, but as a publike miniſter he would not receive him, but afront him; thoſe Chouzes he ſent to deliver the Meſſage to Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> from the Vizeere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and withall that he was ready; Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> ſaid he would not receive him, but ſhut the dores againſt him, (ſuch a horror did this Letter of revocation ſtrike into him) but they returning with that paſſage to the Vizeere, hee ſeemed ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, that he commanded them to take three more to them, and to command him to let my Lord deliver his Letters, and bring him word what his anſwer was; then his ſtout heart was fain to ſtoope, and my Lord having ſuch warning, becauſe he would he ſure not to goe privately, got us and all his attendance after him, who when they came into the room after him, they that knew him formerly, ſaid that he was much daunted; then my Lord ſaluted him by the name of my Lord; he replyed, Sir, you are welcome: The King my Maſter (ſaid my Lord) commanded mee to deliver you this Letter; then they both ſate down, and Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> looking upon the Company, ſaid, you have a great many witneſſes here, my Lord told him yes, the better for him if his Cauſe were good he did not love to do things in corners; then he took the Letter &amp; ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſometimes winked upon his own people, when preſently he called the French Ambaſſadours Secretarie to beare witneſſe what paſſed; what have wee to doe (ſaid my Lord) with the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours Secretary? yes ſaid he, the French Ambaſſadour hath to doe in this buſineſſe; how (ſaid my Lord) hath any to doe with the Engliſh here beſides you and I? that will be ſeen hereafter: then he pawſed a while, and ſtraight asked my Lord, if the King delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Letter to him with his own hand? my Lord told him no; marke this ſaid he to the Frenchman; Sir, ſaid my Lord, my words are true, I ſaid his Majeſtie commanded me by a Letter of his, to deliver you this; What logick make you of this now? then he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my Lord when he ſaw the King, but my Lord deſired he would excuſe him, ſaying Excuſe me Sir, I am not bound to give you an anſwer: then he asked him where his Commiſſion was, he told him it was at his houſe; he demanded to ſee it, my Lord told him it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned himſelfe only, and not him, and if I act contrary (ſaid my Lord) to my Commiſſion, I muſt anſwer it, and not you; here is my Commiſſion, ſaith he, and I charge you in the Kings name to ſhew

Here was ſome pawſe of ſpeech, which when the Chouzes ſaw, and that he would not open his Letter, they ſtood up, and required him to open it, then he did, and told them he would anſwer the Letter to the King, and ſend his mind in writing to the Vizeere, which hee did the next day, and this it was (as the Vizeere ſent my Lord word by his Druggerman) That thoſe Merchants were Rebels, and that my Lord was the head of them, and other words, as if the King were forced to write thoſe letters. His Lordſhip having delivered his Letters according to the Kings command, tooke his leave very fairly of him, and he of my Lord, but came no further with him then the middle of the roome, where at firſt my Lord found him. Now the next worke my Lord indeavoured was to get to be Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the Vizeere, and obtain Audience with the Grand Signeur, to this purpoſe he ſent his Druggerman to haſten it; the Vizeere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after this ſent him good words, as that all things ſhould bee done to his minde, and wiſhed him not to bee troubled with any thing, and ſo protracted time from day to day. All this time my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> is not idle, although he keeps his houſe yet he employes the French Agent, and the Venetians, whoſe Druggerman <hi>Gryllo</hi> is alwayes attending upon the Vizeere, and feeds him with moneys and preſents to work us out, the French Ambaſſadour talkes with the Vizeere privately, and but that my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> and the Vizeere told my Lord he had to doe in the buſineſſe, my Lord would ſcarce have taken him for his enemy, yet one day he was heard to tell the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeere, my Lord had offered my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> 30000 l. to be gone out of the Country, by which (ſaid he) you may judge the truth of his Meſſage, and withall told him that the King of France his Maſter would be much troubled, if he ſhould change this old Ambaſſadour, for the new, and this report that my Lord would give the Lord <hi>Crow</hi> money to depart hence, was not only ſent to him by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeeres Jew, but by the Kogag, which my Lord to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and make appeare to the world how much hee deteſted ſuch by-wayes, he was forced to write this Warrant in Italian, and ſend it down to Gallatta by two Janiſaries and a Druggerman <hi>pro forma</hi>; and fix one upon the Treaſurers houſe, the other upon Mr. <hi>Pearles</hi> houſe, that all Jewes &amp; Merchants might take notice of it.</p>

            <p>MY Lord, I cannot out of my well-wiſhes to you and the good of this State, but give you this timely information, that the Venetians and the French doe endeavour both by moneys and all incouragements to maintain the Man-ſold Ambaſſadour againſt me, and that Regall power which ſent me hither, thereby to make a breach between this and the Engliſh Nation and ſo to advance their own deſigne, which either by Peace or Warre will prove very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to this Emperie, beſides the Conſideration of the great Trade our Nation brings to ſupply the Emperie. Whether you had rather have it by the hands of Enemies or Friends (if they could maintain it) I leave your wiſe conſideration, none obſtanding that the ſaid former Ambaſſadour being proved to be an oppreſſor, the Grand Signieur deprived him from the Charge of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with his Hatteſherife, for which his Majeſtie of England with his Letters, now ſent by me his Ambaſſadour, doth give him many thankes therefore.</p>
            <p>From the Venetians he never heard word ſince, nor from the French Ambaſſadour, although he told my Lords ſervants he would anſwer him in writing, but wee heare he is ſo troubled in mind,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94874:10"/>
the truth being ſo apparent, that he cannot deny it, and what title to give my Lord he cannot reſolve, if hee acknowledges him Lord Ambaſſadour, he hath ſaid the contrary to the Vizeere, and ſo gives himſelfe the lye, if no Lord, and he ſhould be Confirmed, he makes my Lord his enemie for ever. But to our buſineſſe, whilſt my Lord is thus deluded, and fed with faire words, all attempts are made, and Traps laid, how to get my Lord to compound himſelfe by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies into his rights and dues, the Vizeeres Jew hath tempted us, the Merchants, the Kogag hath ſpoke to my Lords Drugerman many times, that if he would not come off, his buſineſſe would never bee done; My Lords Druggerman told him alwaies, that my Lord would ſooner loſe his life, then come in upon ſuch diſhonourable tearmes; My Lords Drudgerman being ſicke, on Sunday the third of October, he ſent Maſter <hi>Juate</hi> and another Merchant to tell the Vizeere ſo, and that he ſent them to receive his Meſſage; he gave them no anſwer but this, Bid the Druggerman come to mee on Tueſday. This vexed my Lord, but he was reſolved to try another day; on Tueſday the Druggerman went to him, and then he told him plainly that he could not decide the Controverſie between the two Ambaſſadours, but muſt ſend a Chouze for England: as ſoon as my Lord perceived he had delayed him all this time for this, hee preſently wrote him this Letter, or Arrs, and ſent him the next morning.</p>

                  <p>As he read this he nodded ſeverall times, and when he had done, called the Druggerman to him, and ſaid, Did I ever deny your Lord to be a true Ambaſſadour?

My Lord told him 't was impoſſible without three or foure dayes warning, hee pitched on Monday, and after ſome Debate, as the urgency of the Affaires of the State, the neceſſitie of the ſhips ſpeedy comming in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My Lord conſented to it, but withall made him promiſe him, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the honour, and dues of Ambaſſadours he ſhould be entertained, and feaſted at the publique Druanine, which he did very willingly agree unto.</p>
            <p>Monday morning being come, The Vizeere ſent <hi>Hyſſan Aga,</hi> one of the principall Chouzes, with two Chouzes more, to attend My Lord, who conducted him to the water ſide, and upon his landing on Conſtantinople ſide, the Chouze Baſha, with fourty two Chouzes more on horſeback, conducted him thence to the Vizeeres houſe, where he ſtayed in his Yegays Chamber, till the Vizeere ſent to the Grand Signieur, to tell him his Lordſhip was ready for Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: his Majeſtie ſent word he would receive him at the Keske, (being a kind of a Banqueting-houſe, or for Repoſe, very ſtately) by the water ſide in his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whether the Vizeere went before him, and his Lordſhip followed with the Chouſe-Baſſa, and fourty two Chouzes attending him (beſides all the Merchants, and all his own Gent. and attendance, no Ambaſſadour heretofore ever having the like) he came to a gate which opened into the Garden where the Keske ſtood there my Lord with 18. more were Veſted, but none ſuffered to goe in but only my Lord, who was led by the Chouze-Baſſa on his right hand, and the Buſtange Baſſa on the left; Signieur <hi>Dominico</hi> his Secretary, who carryed the Letter in a gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bag, led by two Chouſes more, and Maſter <hi>Vernon</hi> his Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man led by two other Chouzes. When my Lord came within ſight of the Grand Signieur, they ſuffered him not to goe forwards, but ſide-waies untill he came juſt againſt him (hee being ſet upon an

Ivorie and mother of Pearle Couch, the ſeates being lined with Luſin Furres) and then brought him forwards untill he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of 20. paces, where my Lord made a low obedience to him, and the Grand Signieur (which was never ſeen before) bowed very much, and ſaluted my Lord, at which my Lord bowed very low again. After <hi>Dominico</hi> had read in Turkiſh my Lords Speech, with a laudable voyce, the Grand Signieur by his actions ſeemed much pleaſed at it, and having done, replyed (which was never known to any Ambaſſadour before) That if the King of England would hold that Amity and Friendſhip with him, which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Predeceſſors did with the Grand Signieur before, and his Merchants did come with that duty and reſpect as they ought, hee would protect and defend them ſtrongly (for his hand hee ſaid was ſtrong) from all their Enemies, and they ſhould freely Trade in his Dominions. Signieur <hi>Dominico</hi> replyed from my Lord, that it was his intentions to increaſe the Trade, ſo as the ſhips and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants may have the Freedome and liberty of their goods and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, according to the Capitulations; he replyed again, tell him, his Ships ſhall be Free to goe out, and come in, when they pleaſe, and the Merchants ſhould have their Liberties, and their goods, and he would confirme the Capitulations, and no body ſhould medle with them throughout his whole Dominions, and he would protect them, but ſaid, let them ſee they did their duty, elſe his hand would reach them where ever they were, ſo now he may goe. When he tooke the Letter, he asked if the Tranſlate was in it, they told him yes, Said he (pointing to his eyes) I will read it every word, every word.

THat whereas by the Capitulations, the Merchants ſhipps ſhould paſſe in, and out of any of the Ports in Turky freely, and may take for their mony, any Proviſion for their neceſſary food, in what Port they come, and that if any Fleet of the Grand Signieur ſhould meet any of the Engliſh ſhips, that they ſhall not ſtay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, pretend, or take any thing from them.</p>
                        <p>Now contrary to the Capitulations, thoſe ſhips which ſhould paſſe out, and into this port, are detained at the Caſtells, untill they ſhall buy their paſſage with a ſumme of money, and being here, are often detained by the Cuſtomer, and Meſſetareages, upon any ſmall pretence, during their pleaſure, neither are they ſuffered to buy their neceſſary proviſions for their maintenance in their voyage, and the Captain Baſſa meeting any ſhip or ſhips of ours, ſuffers them not to paſſe without a large ſumme of money. And alſo where he hears of any ſhips lying in any Ports abroad ſends to them for a preſent, which as due he requires to take of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And whereas by the Capitulations the Merchants ought to have the free power and diſpoſall of all ſuch goods which are brought to them, and that they ſhould have libertie to lade or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade them at their pleaſures, and that no Cuſtome ſhould bee above one time paid, in caſe they ſhall carry them by Land, or Reſhip them for any other place.</p>

And for one other piece more taken by <hi>Omeraga,</hi> worth 4100 l. and moreover, our goods landed at one ſcale, and paying Cuſtome, are not permitted to be ſent to another place without paying it over againe.</p>

            <p>My Lord having done with the Grand Signieur, he went through the Seraglio Garden with all his attendance to the gate, where his horſe ſtood, and by the Chouze Baſſa, and his 42.

Goe tell my Lord, except I ſee what I ſhall have, I will not ſtirre one foot further. Whereupon my Lord ſent his Druggerman to him again, to perſwade him to truſt to my Lords bounty, but could by no means be drawn to doe more without ſome aſſurance, wherefore after two or three dayes was ſpent, and nothing could bee done, my Lord ſent him this Letter.</p>

and ſo queſtionleſſe it had, but now ſee a moſt unfortunate accident, that we muſt act our own deſtruction, for when the Market was ſo ſtarved, that all the Jewes, Turkes, and even the Grand Signieur himſelfe, cryed out for the Engliſh ſhips to come in, which my Lord would not ſuffer untill his Conditions were granted, the Councell of Smyrna being ſcared with a proteſt which <hi>D.

Caſes of Silke, and ſeven packs of Clothes to be landed, and carried up to Conſtantinople, which at this very time ſo ſupplyed the market, and ſtopped their mouthes, that the next day when the Merchants came to ſeale, he told them, Except they would make an abſolute bond, without Conditions, that they owed him 20000. l. he would not meddle with the buſineſſe, but bid them do what they could. This unexpected miſchiefe when my Lord had wrought all his ends into ſo fine a condition to bee on a ſudden ſo daſhed in pieces, was too great a trouble to my Lord, and us all, for the Jewes and all people laughed at us, and told the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeere, that if he would be patient, the ſhips would unlade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether my Lord would or not; ſo that the evill report which this bred, was worſe then the ſupply of the Market, for all believed it.

All this while the ſhips lay at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for demereage, the goods in them like to rot or receive much Damage, and if they ſtayed out paſt the little Bycam, the cloth would not ſell this yeare; beſides, the Merchants at a Gaze, and all Trade ſtopped; all theſe inconveniences being conſidered, wee valued every day delayed at 1000. l. wherefore my Lord being much troubled, becauſe he knew not how to helpe us, for delayes muſt not be admitted beſides, my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> ſwelled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt to ſee us in this extremitie, who being ſummoned by my Lord (according to the Kings Command) to depart for England, In ſtead of obeying the ſummons, ſent him an unworthy and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming anſwer. An Overture at this preſent was afforded to us, by <hi>Arononcone</hi> the Vizeeres Jew, that he would undertake that all the forenamed Propoſitions ſhould be granted, and for the ſending my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> to Smyrna, he required but ſeven dayes time, but for the compleating hereof (till which time hee would not receive an aſper) doe what the Merchants could, hee would 35000. pounds. And indeed conſidering the vaſt expences delayes would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Company, and to ſettle the Trade in a more ſecure way then ever, out our enemy, and recover our owne Debts, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by my Lord, and us all, a very good bargain, yet my Lord muſt not take knowledge of it, but as made between us and the Jew privately, only his gratuity to the Vizeere muſt ſeeme to doe the buſineſſe. This Bargain concluded, the Jew ſo wrought the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, that within the ſpace of ſix dayes he got by meanes of the Vizeere a Hatteſherife to ſend my Lord <hi>Crow</hi> out of Turky, which was preſently put in execution, and two Chouzes ſent to take him out of his houſe, and put him into a Boat for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> hee made no reſiſtance at all, but went preſently with him; upon Wedneſday morning the three Druggermen railing upon my Lord, and calling him Devill, wiſhed the Devill to take him, and us all. My La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the reſt of the Family ſtayed behind to pack up their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuffe till Saturday following; in the mean time ſhee made much moan, that ſhe had not an aſper in the houſe left her, beſides wages of Nurſes, and divers other ſervants came to 500. l. and upwards, which were unpaid. This good Lady (only worthy of pitty)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94874:15"/>
being by the evill diſpoſition of her husband brought to this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was thought no wayes acceſſary to his bad deſignes; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord moved us in way of pitty to conſider her condition; upon which wee ſent her 1000. l. which ſhe kindly accepted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her Husband was offered by ſome of us not long before 20000. l. to be quiet, and depart the place in peace. Strange were the Plots and deſignes this man had to ruine us; beſides the ſeizing of our eſtates, lending away our ſhips, and impriſoning our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons, and ſome in chaines; at one time he pretended that wee owed him 100000. l. of which to be eſtabliſhed, hee offered the Grand Signieur 50000 l. and to the Vizeere the other 50000 l. when the Eſtate would not give him credit in this, hee workes upon the Venetians to ſupply him, and they hoping (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground) by this meanes to make a breach between the Turkes and us, or to undoe the Merchants (which might be very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall both to their Wars, and Trade) doe furniſh him both with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and preſents; the French Ambaſſadour hee had made ſure to him, and it is verily believed by money, and therefore hee's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Sir <hi>Sackvile Crowes</hi> Broker; this man ſweares, and ſaies any thing, Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> would have him; but being of a wretched and miſerable condition, and of ſo poore and hen-hearted a ſpirit, was able to get no Credence in this Court. Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> was to us a roaring Lion, threatens nothing but Ruine and deſtruction, and ſince my Lord came, told ſome of us, that he would be as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> if they forced him hence, hee would pull the houſe upon them, and for my Lord that dared to come againſt him, to ſend him, and his Followers home in Chaines, he thought to light a puniſhment, but had decreed him a perpetuall priſoner in Rhodes or Ciprus. Oh how poore, miſerable, and weake are the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and fancies of man, when God leaves him! that this man that over-night deſpiſed the authority of his King, bid defiance to his Ambaſſadour, and ſcorned all men in reſpect of himſelfe, was the next day by two Chouzes without further help led into a Boat, and carryed whither he never intended. Here ends his ſtory in Turky, God ſend him more honeſty in England, whither wee wiſh him a good voyage.</p>
