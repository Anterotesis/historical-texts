            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

True Relation
WHAT SENTENCE
Was paſſed upon the Servants of the Lord,
by one who is in Commiſſion to do Juſtice,
called by the world Sir <hi>William Walter,</hi>
with the conſent of the reſt of thoſe called
Justices, that ſat upon the Bench with
him at that time, becauſe we could not
ſwear for conſcience ſake, but abide in
the Doctrine of Chriſt, who ſaith <hi>Swear
not at all</hi>; Alſo ſomething in Anſwer to
it, ſhewing the unjuſtneſſe of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt us; With a warning to them
to repent, and turn from the evil of their
ways, and fear the Lord, leaſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God come upon them at unawares.</head>
            <p>UPON the ſecond day of the eight
Month, called by the world <hi>October,</hi>
in the year 1660. the general Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Seſſions for the County of <hi>Oxen</hi>
was kept at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and one which
is called by the world Sir <hi>William Walter</hi> was
Judge of the Court, and I, and another friend,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105403:2"/>
called <hi>Benjamin Staples</hi> was brought by the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of <hi>Oxford</hi> into the Court before them, and
when they had examined me, and could find
nothing againſt me, they on purpoſe to enſnare
me, tendered unto me the Oath of Allegiance,
I told them I owned the King to be the Supream
Governour, in civil and temporall things, and
was willing to obey him in all juſt and lawful
commands, but if <hi>King Charles</hi> and they that are
in Authority under him, command me to do that
which is contrary to the Command of the <hi>LORD
JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> then I ſhall chooſe rather to obey
<hi>CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> then <hi>King Charls,</hi> or them that
are in Authority under him, and ſo I told them
I could not ſwear for conſcience ſake, if it would
gain me the whole world, becauſe Chriſt Jeſus
hath forbid it, and ſaith <hi>Swear not at all</hi> (and
the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> likewiſe) Matth. 5. 33, 34,
35, 36, 37. &amp; James 5. 12.) but nothing would
ſatisfie them that could be ſpoken, except I
would ſwear, and ſo in obedience to Chriſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to ſwear; then the aforeſaid <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
aſked the reſt of thoſe called Juſtices that
ſat upon the Bench with him, <hi>whether they had
any thing to ſay againſt it, whereby he might not
paſſe judgement againſt me,</hi> they all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
conſented <hi>to him that he might,</hi> then he ſaid
unto me, HEAR YOUR SENTENCE, <hi>You are
out of the Kings protection, and all your Lands,
Goods, and Chattels are forfeited, and to be cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on for the uſe of the King, and you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in Priſon during the Kings pleaſure;</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105403:2"/>
then he command the Jaylor <hi>to take me away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and I aſked him if he gave orders to the Jaylor
to put Irons upon me (which was thereon when
I was brought before them, and when I came
firſt into Priſon) as Theeves and Murderers have,
he anſwered, <hi>The Jaylor might doe what he would
with me</hi> (or words to this purpoſe) <hi>for I was out
of the Kings protection,</hi> and ſo the Jaylor took
me away, and brought the aforeſaid <hi>Benjamin</hi>
before them, and when they had examined him
and could finde nothing againſt him, then they
tendered unto him the ſame Oath, but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to take it (in obedience to Chriſt) for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſake, as I did, and ſo the aforeſaid <hi>William
Walter,</hi> with the conſent of the reſt, paſſed the
ſame Sentence on him as he did on me; and ſo
the Jaylor ſent us both away to Priſon, and
when the ſaid Jaylor came down to the Priſon,
he ſpoke to the Common-Priſoners and told
<hi>them, if they wanted Coats, they might take ours
off our backs, for we could have no law againſt
them;</hi> then one of the Priſoners anſwered, <hi>He
would go naked before he would take off ours.</hi>
And this is Printed and publiſhed that all ſober
minded people may ſee and conſider, whether
we be not cruelly uſed, and unjuſtly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
by them that are now in Authority, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the righteous Law of God, (which is) <hi>that
every one ſhould do unto all men, as they would be
done unto themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here followeth ſomething in anſwer to the
aforeſaid Sentence, which was paſſed by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105403:3"/>
               <hi>William Walter,</hi> with the conſent of the
reſt of thoſe called Juſtices which ſat upon the
Bench with him that day.</p>
            <p>You that pretend to be the Kings friends, and
to act for him, and in his name, this I would
have you take notice of, foraſmuch as you have
perſecuted the ſervants of the Lord, for obeying
the command of Chriſt Jeſus, and hath caſt us
into Priſon, and paſſed an unjuſt Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, contrary both to the Command of
Chriſt and the Apoſtles, recorded in Matth: 5.
33, 34, 35, 36, &amp; 37. verſes, &amp; Jam: 5. 12. and
contrary to the <hi>promiſe of King Charls,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are enemies to <hi>CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> &amp; King
<hi>Charls,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and
<hi>King Charls</hi> hath promiſed, <hi>that we ſhall have
the liberty of our conſcience, and not ſuffer for our
Religion or Opinion</hi> (or words to this purpoſe)
and moreover he ſaid, <hi>We had the word of a King
for it;</hi> and this he hath promiſed to my friends,
which is one with me in Spirit, and it is now in
Print, to the publick view of his Subjects; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are no friends neither to God, nor the
King, but on the contrary you are enemies to
both, becauſe you go about, and do as much as
in you lyes to compel and force the ſervants of
the Lord to break the command of Chriſt, and
make it of no effect and force; and alſo you go
about to cauſe the King to break his promiſe,
and to make his promiſe and word of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which he hath promiſed before the Lord,
and to his people, for which he muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105403:3"/>
to the Juſt God, if he do not perform his
promiſe which he made to them; therefore if
you do not repent of this your wickedneſſe,
and turn to God with all your hearts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the evil of your ways and doings, and ceaſe
perſecuting the people of God, the Lord will
cut you off from the face of the earth, and give
you your portion with the wicked and ungodly,
and reward every one of you according to your
works, and paſſe this ſad Sentence againſt you
which he did againſt the wicked and ungodly
in the dayes of old, which is recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi>
7. 23. <hi>Mat. 25. Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27, 28. verſes,
<hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire,
which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi>
and theſe went away into <hi>everlasting puniſhment
where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing
of teeth;</hi> and the Lord is the ſame now (as he
was then) and you your ſelves are in the ſame
nature, and as vile, and wicked, and guided by
the ſame ſpirit as they was, as your fruits make
you manifeſt; and the ſame woe and miſery that
came upon them for their wickedneſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
will certainly come upon you for
your ungodlineſs and diſobedience to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
the Light of the world, If you do not repent
ſpeedily, and fear the Lord, and ceaſe from all
your ungodly wayes, and Iearn to do well; for
the God that we (who are in ſcorn and deriſion
called <hi>Quakers</hi>) own, ſerve, obey and worſhip, is
the only true God that made Heaven and Earth,
who is pure, <hi>and of purer eyes then to hehold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105403:4"/>
and not any that lives in pride, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
high-mindedneſs, vain-glory, ſelf-ſeeking,
pleaſures, vanities, hawking, hunting, gaming,
ſporting, oppreſſion, perſecution, envy, wrath,

jeſting, corrupt communication, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
whatſoever, can enter into Gods
kingdom, nor any unclean thing whatſoever; and
they that are without purity and holineſs, whoſe
hearts are full of luſt, pride, and deceit, living
and dying in this miſerable ſtate and condition,
cannot enjoy the pure preſence of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this life, nor in the life which is to come
after death; and verily the Lord God is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to anger daily, and his Spirit is griev'd to
ſee the wickedneſſe and the abominations that is
acted, committed, and done in <hi>England,</hi> and
elſewhere, both amongſt the Rulers, Teachers,
Profeſſors, and prophane now at this time, for
all the whole world lyeth now in wickedneſſe,
and are in the broad way that leads to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and there is no true change, nor reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
neither amongſt the Rulers, Teachers, nor
the generality of people, but they grow worſe
and worſe, and more vile and wicked then they
have been formerly, and ſo their hearts is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſin and wickedneſs, and they are paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>whoſe conſciences is ſeared as with a hot Iron,</hi>
for they have given themſelves over unto laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe,
to work all uncleanneſs with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>and the leaders of the people cauſed them to
erre,</hi> and they that are led of them are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105403:4"/>
for the leaders lives in pride, covetouſneſſe, and
in all manner of wickedneſſe, and without the true
fear of God, and ſo doth the generality of people
that followeth them, and ſo as they are, ſuch are
the people, for they are patterns of ungodlineſſe,
and evil examples for others to follow, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
are like to periſh for want of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, whom to know experimentally is
life eternal, and therefore if the blind lead the
blind, they are both in great danger to fall into the
Ditch; therefore as you tender the good of your
ſoules, and the honour and glory of God, Prize
your time while it is called to day, and ſee that you
walk more circumſpectly then you either have
done, (or do) and take warning in time, and do not
act againſt the Lord Jeſus, nor his people any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
(as now you do) leaſt the Jugements of God
come upon you at unawares.</p>
            <p>And although you have paſſed an unjuſt Sentence
againſt us, whereby to deſtroy both our perſons and
eſtates, and deprive us from having any protection
by the King, or his Laws, which the righteous God
will one day call you to an account, both for this, &amp;
many other unjuſt things which you have acted
againſt him, which Gods witneſs in your own hearts
and conſciences will ſet you ſee, and tell you what
you have done againſt the Lord and his people, if
you hearken to it, and it will accuſe and condemn
you for what you have done. And this I would
have both you and others to know, that you cannot
(neither is it in your power to deprive us from being
protected by the <hi>KING</hi> of Heaven and Earth, who
is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and he is our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105403:5"/>
King, Law-giver and Judge, and he doth (and will)
protect and defend us, and in his own time he will
deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, and out
of the hands of all the wicked and ungodly, and this
we do verily beleeve that our God whom we ſerve
and obey will do for us, as he hath done great
things for us already, bleſſed and praiſed be
his great and glorious name for evermore; and our
only hope, truſt, and confidence is in the Lord, who
will never leave nor forſake his own people that
puts their whole truſt and confidence in him; and in
the mean time we are contented with our preſent
condition, and what the Lord hath ſuffered to come
to paſſe, knowing that all things which the Lord
brings, or ſuffers to be brought to paſſe concerning
his people, will work altogether for their good; and
this is ſuffered by the Lord to be thus done unto us,
for the exerciſe and tryal of our faith and patience,
and the Lord hath made us willing to ſubmit unto
his will, and bleſſed be his glorious name for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
