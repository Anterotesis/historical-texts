            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am very ſenſible that when a woman appears in Print, ſhe muſt certainly run the Gauntlet, and therefore ought to be well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if Mrs. <hi>Philips</hi>'s ſenſe, and Mrs. <hi>Behn's</hi> wit (Joyned with her aſſurance) was not ſufficient to protect them from the Critick's
<pb facs="tcp:57479:4"/>
ſtrokes, it may very well diſcourage me from venturing my name in the front of this ſmall trifle, knowing it to fall infinitely ſhort of what has been performed by others of my Sex, and that the Cenſurers of our age are much more refined then they were formerly; but I perceive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty generally takes, bow deformed ſoever it is, and the <hi>Bantam</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours had as many followers, as King <hi>Solomon</hi> could have had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival; therefore I hope this book may ſell, if it be but for the rarity of its dreſs; and if it does, it may turn to your advantage, whether they can ſay any thing to mine or not.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, Sir, you will deſire me, to find ſome Patron under whoſe ſhadow I may ſhelter my failings from too ſtrict a ſcrutiny; in that caſe I muſt flatter them firſt, that
<pb facs="tcp:57479:4"/>
they may excuſe me, after which it might trouble both our conſciences, and for that reaſon, if you pleaſe, I will let it alone, tho at the ſame time, I confeſs no paper ever came out that had more need of a Second, but I ſuffer it to be made publick at the requeſt of ſome few friends, who muſt bluſh for me, ſince I live in ſuch a retirement that no reflections can reach my ears. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not be thought high minded, I will humbly addreſs my ſelf to the Reader.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen, that are tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly young and good natured, will kindly overlook a womans Errors (tho I have not expreſs'd my ſelf by the Rules of Grammar) falſe Engliſh being particularly intailed upon the Sex. I hope my Eſſay of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage will plead for me, and I aſſure
<pb facs="tcp:57479:5"/>
you, I am one that never promotes Rebellion againſt your Arbitrary ſway, (whenſoever any of you make uſe of it towards your wives, tho I own I think the mildeſt way is beſt) therefore as I am for condeſcention, without making them uneaſy, whom we permit to be our Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in gratitude you muſt not be ſatyrical upon your advocate, leſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that you find never another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that will adviſe her friends to ſo great obedience in the bonds of wedlock.</p>
            <p>But for the old ſurly <hi>Sages,</hi> who will ſcarce allow a wife to write or read, or underſtand any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſpreading Plaiſters, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I expect they will condemn me unheard, as a publick Neuſance and a breaker of Evil cuſtoms in writing this book. I have
<pb facs="tcp:57479:5"/>
only one thing to offer to them in my excuſe, which is, to intreat them to conſider that when I am writing, I am neither dreſſing, nor going abroad, and they eſteem both to be as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imployments, as ſcribling (unleſs I made a Journal of their Lives); be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I hope I have obliged them, by giving them an opportunity of rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that being the chief thing they delight in.</p>
            <p>And now for the Ladies, into whoſe hands I ſhall fall: I beſeech them to be merciful for their own ſakes, as well as mine, and all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kinds; to clear us from the aſperſion of being always the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſighted into one anothers infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to prevent the ſuſpition of their being piqu'd at (Patience I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comcommend) in the Eſſay of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which would perhaps obſtruct
<pb facs="tcp:57479:6"/>
the preferment of the Maids and Widows, if they owned it.</p>
            <p>Some ſort of Wives, I know will make open War with me, I mean thoſe who pretend to an Imperious management of their Husbands, but they are ſuch Monſters in nature they deſerve no Apology, nor do I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their opinion.</p>
            <p>This treatiſe was the product of a Meditation deſigned for the good of my ſelf and others; if my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions has not fully explained my ſenſe of the matter, it is in vain to inlarge now, therefore I will conclude with the ingenious <hi>Hudibras</hi>'s Rule, that

            <head>AN ESSAY OF Marriage, &amp;c,</head>
            <p>MArriage is Deſpiſed by ſome and by others too much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted; the firſt ſin againſt the Laws of Nature, and Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the laſt againſt their own Quiet; for thoſe, that are in extraordinary haſt for a Settlement, (as they call it) do commonly Advance their Expectation of Happineſs, much beyond what they have Poſſeſſed in a Single Life, and many times the imaginary Heaven proves a Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57479:7"/>And though your changing your Condition, Dear Madam, had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Proſpect; yet I hear my laſt Letter, which was to wiſh you joy, found you in Sorrow; but I know you are too well Principl'd not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time will come when the wicked ceaſe from Troubling; the Weary will be at Reſt; and if your Husband continues ſo Induſtrious to Torment you, as the World repreſents him, I believe you can expect little Reſt till that time is come; unleſs it is by the inward Peace of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which no one can take from you, a Conſolation which clamorous, gain-ſaying Wives, always looſe; and which, I am ſure, cannot be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by any Point they gain; and ſince the Laws of God and Nations have given Man the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Marriage, we ought not firſt to accept them upon thoſe Terms, and then Mutiny upon all Occaſions, as often as the Terms are uneaſy to us; for though ſome Men are ſo kind as to make our Yoke ſit light upon us; yet we take them <hi>for better or worſe</hi>; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57479:7"/>
experience ſhews us, that the Odds are on the Worſer ſide.</p>
            <p>All this we ſhould conſider before we engage our ſelves in thoſe ſtrict Ties, which obliges us to deny our own Inclinations, if They require it; and to make it our Study to comply with Theirs. This Leſſon even Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Policy will Teach us, for if we make a Man's Home leſs agreeable to him, than any other place, we furniſh him with a good Excuſe to go abroad; which can never be to the advantage of the Family, for thoſe men whom buſineſs does not call out to get money, are ſure to ſpend it; and he that is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from home by a wife's ill humor, is generally more Extravagant, and thinks, he has a better pretence to be ſo, nay, ſometimes the Provocation runs ſo high, as to make him Sacrifice his Body and Soul too, as well as Eſtate to his revenge.</p>
            <p>Some women indeed will divert themſelves, and not ſeem to value it, and inſtead of indeavouring to win their husbands by Complaiſency, turn as Extravagant as they, and ſtrive to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57479:8"/>
light the Candle at both Ends; tho they know it muſt at laſt burn their fingers, and if they can neither Jump in affection nor wit, will yet Sympathiſe with them in their folly and excurſions; but they ſeldom fail of ſuffering by their raſhneſs, and the farther they run out, the ſooner they find a check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their expences, beſides, if they ſhould preſerve their honeſty, yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the certain loſs of their reputation, which is, to be valued infinitely more than their Recreations; and if they hope at laſt that this careleſs way will Reclaim the men; I fear they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miſtaken, however, we ought not to do Evil, that good may come of it.</p>
            <p>But, I, moſt of all, wonder at ſome of our Acquaintance, who ſeem to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber women, and to have good ſenſe, and yet recommend it, as the beſt way to deal with a paſſionate husband, to be more unreaſonable and paſſionate than He. Such bawling may perhaps ſilence ſome few men, and would be more pardonable if God as well as man were to be ſilenced by it, but our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57479:8"/>
Religion tells us, we muſt not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Evil, but overcome Evil with Good, which name I preſume the greateſt Patroneſs of equal power dares not beſtow upon contention, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſets all the world in a Flame, and is indeed good for nothing in the world, and King <hi>Solomon</hi> (who is pretty often in the right) ſays it only comes from Pride. God grant us, ſo true a ſenſe of our unworthineſs, as may abate that high conceit which makes us unable to bear a contradiction; you will wonder perhaps to hear me preach, and yet I cannot forbear to tell you that our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour Commands us, not to do, as we are done by, but as we would have others do to us; and if they are ſometimes wanting in the return, I doubt we are much oftner remiſs in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Example, not at all regarding the ſtrict precepts and pattetn he left us, of Love and Gentleneſs to each other, which himſelf exerciſed to his moſt barbarous Enemies, during his ſtay upon the Earth, and does ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in his interceſſion for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he bids us learn of him, <hi>For he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57479:9"/>
is meek and lowly, and our Souls ſhall find reſt</hi>; And if meekneſs is the way to be at reſt, why ſhould any Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us to leave it, or what can we hope to get by our perverſeneſs, but the diſcompoſing of both our Bodies and Souls? St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>The tongue is an unruly Member, and ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> which flame never appears ſo black, as when a woman takes the liberty to ſpeak, againſt her husband, all the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant things which the Devil, or her Reſentment, which is a kind of Devil inſpires her with. We commonly ſay, that a madman is poſſeſs'd, and every one, that is not in a rage himſelf, will allow paſſion to be a temporary mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that makes men act as irrationally as Lunaticks, tho not as excuſably as they; becauſe they have not the ſame miſerable reſiſtleſs diſtemper, to plead for the involuntary wrongs they do. Now theſe their furious Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will perhaps tell you, that theirs alſo is a natural Infirmity, a violent Diſtemper which they ſtrive againſt, what force they offer to their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſeves know beſt, for very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57479:9"/>
effects of it are viſible to others; however, theſe imperious men imagine, that pretence will ſweeten the matter, and make us ſwallow the bitter draught, but what can juſtify women whom God has made of a milder temper, if they ſhould take pains to change their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, only in hopes of a little better treatment for the preſent, (which they may fail of too) and at the ſame time ſet aſide that patient abiding of the meek, which God has promis'd with an Oath that it ſhall not periſh for ever? It muſt therefore neceſſarily be a diſtruſt of his promiſes to recompence our Patience, or preferring a little Momentary ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction before any reward he deſigns us, that (after ſuch incouragement) can carry us to wrath and peeviſhneſs, which tho it may gratify our paſſion to let it out, yet our reaſon will quickly wiſh it in a gain; if a husband is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and difficult, it is a great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the holy Scripture tells us, all things of that nature are grievous, but as contrary as they are to fleſh and blood, we are ſenſible they ariſe not from the duſt, and that it is not for us

to contend with our Maker. He that can with a word controul the Fury of the Winds and Seas, can, with as little trouble, avert any ſtorm that threatens us, when he ſees us fit for the mercy of a Deliverance; and if we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by any invention of our own to ſhake off the Yoke, or think by ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to make the Chain ſit looſer upon us; we ſhould perceive our ſelves much in the wrong, like birds taken in a net, who, by beating their feathers off, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Miſery, and at the ſame time diſable themſelves from making their eſcape, thoſe amongſt us that have been ſo obliging, never to deſerve an ill word from our Perſecutors, muſt acknowledge we every day merit God's Chaſtiſements, and know that wicked and unreaſonable Men are a Sword of his, and this Sword does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wound us the deeper, the more we love the hand which he imploys to correct us; but how ſharp ſoever it is we ſhould not repine, conſidering the firſt cauſe is to humble us, in order to draw us nearer to himſelf. He has ſaid thoſe, that have ſuffered, have ceaſed to

            <p>But ſetting all religious Motives to quietneſs a part, it is a very ſilly thing for people to quarrel, who muſt be friends again, unleſs they are indifferent in the point, chooſing rather to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder than ſubmit ſilently to many things that they cannot approve; I will not pretend to Determine what provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſufficient to juſtify ſuch a breach, nor to ſay that ſuch a breach cannot be juſtify'd, ſince much better Women than my ſelf have parted from their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; but they ſeem ſincerely to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſeparation, nor does their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage accuſe them to have done it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or upon the account of taking their pleaſures, which would ſoon be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for, in ſuch Circumſtances, many eyes are upon them, and they muſt live more reſerved than the reſt of the world, or elſe they would quickly be

liable to ſuch a cenſure, as muſt vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their husbands for leaving them.</p>
            <p>And tho in all quarrels betwixt a man and his wife, if it come to a hot diſpute, there is faults in both Parties, yet the weaker veſſel is ſo little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for being weak, that they are blamed ſometimes much more than they deſerve; which cenſure they can no ways prevent ſo well as by a ſtrict obſervance of their duties, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, in all their Actions to have a Conſcience void of offence, towards God and towards Men. Nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth can be ſaid to afford a real ſatisfaction, only as our Imagination makes it appear ſo at a diſtance, and this proſpect of happineſs is dreſſed by fancy in ſuch various ſhapes, that what would be a delight to one, would be a pennance to another; and age or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion does ſometimes give the ſame perſons ſuch different guſto's, that they grow ſick of the very thing they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for before; this is probably the reaſon why old people are ſo much for denying young ones, the Innocent Diverſions they are grown weary of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57479:11"/>
themſelves; tho perhaps at the ſame time they gratify their own <hi>foible</hi> in ſome other kind, at leaſt as ridiculous, but if there were any intrinſick worth in whatever worldly thing, we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately Solicitous about, would any Parent be ſo inhumane to abridge their Children of it, more than they do of the common mercies God allows, of eating, drinking, and ſleeping, which every body acknowledges to be good; and ſo they muſt our other Injoyments too, had not experience evinced an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in them enough to baulk our Appetites?</p>
            <p>It is this contrariety in wills that makes Matrimony ſo uneaſy, for when each ſets up a ſeveral Diana to worſhip, their hearts cannot be full of affection to one another, and if both are bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their own ways, it too often ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines not only themſelves, but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent children, a ſad effect of their Diviſions which they are not aware of, and yet muſt dearly anſwer for hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57479:12"/>But you, Madam, are not in danger of this error being of too complying a nature, to bring your ſelf and others into any inconveniency upon that ſcore, and I rejoice extreamly to hear how unmoved you appear under ſo great a Provocation; for I confeſs, I think a husband's keeping another before one's eyes, is the unkindeſt thing he can do, yet even in that caſe, it is moſt prudent to ſhew no frowardneſs; for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs will be ſure to entertain him with mirth and careſſing, which will make the wife's frowns ſeem more intolerable, and ſuch women never fail to magnify all Domeſtick Accidents. Theſe are indeed the chiefeſt eſtrangers of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love, for Them the Gentlemen put on their beſt Countenances, and with them they paſs their moſt pleaſant hours, the indignation is reſerved for the wife of the Boſom, who muſt have a ſhare in nothing but the Grievances, till at laſt they are partners in their wants; which commonly attend ſuch courſes; ſome few inſtances we have had of husbands who have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by a wife's tenderneſs, before

the intrigue has gone too far, but I think, none was ever hectored out of it; but I ſuppoſe the hen-peck'd Sparks, that are under ſuch Correction, dare not preſume to give ſuch offence. However, I am ſure, you are very much in the right only to tell him, with all imaginable Gentleneſs, your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the matter, and to pray to God to convert him: Some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are ſo kind to their wives, as to indeavour to conceal their falſehood, which if they do, it is very indiſcreet for the Ladies to be ſo curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into it, and they are none of their friends that give them the information; he, that goes about to hide his Amour, ſhews either a ſenſe of ſhame, or regard to his Spouſe, and that may in time wean them from ſuch Company; it is a ſign at leaſt he does not deſire to grieve her, which moſt men eſteem their great Prerogative, and would looſe half their ſatisfaction in their intrigues, if the wife were not tormented by it, tho there are thoſe that have ſtretched the ſtring till it has broke, and with ſuch treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it can only be an extraordinary

Principle, that keeps any woman from returning the Compliment, to which Pride and Revenge will both incline her, for a Gallant's Admiration repairs the affront which a husband puts upon her Charms, by giving her place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is perhaps leſs handſom than her ſelf. This has been thought a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe by ſeveral women, that, upon their husbands runing aſtray, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted their Melancholly hours to the loſs of their honour; and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſcord of their houſe, unleſs they agree (like a couple I have heard of) to aſſiſt, rather than interrupt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's harlotery, which is an agreement more ſcandalous and more dangerous than any quarrel. But whatever I have ſaid of mutual failings, I do not make any Compariſon in favour of my own Sex; for I know the wrong is infinitely greater in the wife, as ſhe may bring another Man's child to inherit an Eſtate, and the crime more deteſtable, Modeſty being the higheſt Ornament of Woman-kind, which makes their caſting it off a ſin both againſt God and

            <p>This ſort of Debauchery is a very Slovenly Qualification; but is a vertue compared to Gaming, for when that bewitches a Man, either with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bottle, it makes his wife and children too (if he have any) much more unhappy; He that Drinks and Plays both, ought to be confined as a Priſoner to his Chamber, or elſe in a ſhort time he may lie in the ſtreets; not that I think, it is a wife's office to ſecure him there, but, if he has a grain of underſtanding left, he ought to ſecure himſelf, tho it were only in kindneſs to his Family, and not be ſo ſhamefully and blindly led, by the rooks and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Town, who live plentifully out of their Cullys pockets, in the mean time the poor wife is like to get but little reſt, that has her husband fall'n into their Clutches, whether they ſend him home with his head full, or

only with his pocket empty, her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance is much the ſame, for tho they perhaps may manage him ſo well as to make him pleaſant in company, yet when they have bit him, he begins to ſmart, as ſoon as he begins to cool and generally returns in fury to his own bed; however, the perſon, that is ſenſible of her husband's being in this hazard, muſt needs be diſturbed all night by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that before morning they may have nothing left, and towards day ſhe hears him curſing and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ill luck, when chance had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the matter; the Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid too deep for the Dice to help him. Now having no money left, one would think he ſhould ſleep the quieter (ſince he is not in fear of thieves) but inſtead of that, he lies ſtudying where to get a little more caſh to fetch the reſt back, as he thinks, tho in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it is to fling after that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be retrieved; if his wife has any Gold or Jewels, perhaps he may conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to give her good words that ſhe may part with them, with the more privacy (being out of Countenance at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57479:15"/>
firſt to have his faults known) but when ſhe can no longer be ſerviceable to ſupply him, he grumbles at her moſt neceſſary expences, becauſe he has ſo much the leſs to throw away.</p>
            <p>This muſt be a cutting thing to thoſe who have bred their children like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faſhion; having the proſpect of an Eſtate ſuitable to it; and when they grow up, to ſee them reduced to begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by their father's obſtinate vanity of ſhaking his Elbows.</p>
            <p>Yet in this, and all occaſions there is a place where we may find comfort, if we apply our ſelves rightly to it, and lay up our treaſure where neither moth nor ruſt can deprive us, nor any cruel husband ſquander it a way; He that provides for the young ravens will not be leſs merciful to us and ours, when we cry to him and depend upon him for ſuccour, and to make us leſs Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about the time to come, he has told us that ſufficient to the day is evil thereof, and really I believe very few married women, find any one day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evil enough, to exerciſe their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with, for as ſoon as hony moon is

            <p>OUR Expectation of happineſs is (generally) ſo ill placed from all things in this Life, that it is no wonder we find perpetual Diſappointments in them; but when paſſion makes our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57479:18"/>
choice, we have ſo very blind a guide as will inevitably lead us to Deſtruction, and tho Love appears then gentleſt and beſt natured of all thoſe Troops, which daily riſes in Rebellion againſt Religion and Reaſon; yet our affections are ſo much the right of our Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that as often as we fix them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately upon any of the fading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here below (how tempting ſoever they ſeem to us) we are certainly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sacriledge towards the Divine Goodneſs, which fault is commonly puniſhed by the very thing we doat upon.</p>
            <p>This (my dear Friend,) I doubt has been your Caſe, and not yours alone; for ſoon or late, few eſcape that miſchief, eſpecially amongſt our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sex, whoſe tender Nature leaves them moſt expoſed to Ruine, and tho' they ſee other Ship-wreck'd before their Eyes, will venture out to Sea on the ſame bottom, inſenſible of danger till themſelves periſh and ſometimes fall unpitied.</p>

Yet ſince he is not ſure it is ſo, I wiſh for his own ſake at leaſt he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how he could receive that ſentence, Thou fool, this night thy perjur'd Soul ſhall be required of thee, but I ſuppoſe he thinks himſelf excuſed as being more knave than fool, which Title indeed is ſo highly due to him, that I believe none (that knows him) will do him ſuch manifeſt wrong as to diſpute it; and I am ſure, the blacker he appears, the greater cauſe you have to bleſs that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which permited him to break the Contract (ſince you were not in the leaſt acceſſory to the parting) for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, he, that proved ſo ill a Lover to the beſt of Miſtreſſes, would have made an intolerable husband to the beſt of wives, and his ill uſage would

live without her (tho ſhe has ſince had aboundant cauſe to repent of her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) but he was at the trouble of Counterfeiting a good while, and had the art to look pale, ſigh and languiſh violently for her, her money I mean (the only charm ſhe was miſtreſs of) which ſo dazled his Eyes, that he had been married to her three days before he perceived ſhe wanted an Eye; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his apprehenſion is grown much quicker ſince, and now he diſcovers ſo many Imperfections in her, as he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will juſtify all his ill uſage, which is indeed ſufficient to need a greater excuſe.</p>
            <p>When ſhe reproaches him with his perfidiouſneſs, he tells her, if her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding had not been as blind as her left Eye, ſhe muſt have diſcerned what he aimed at; when ſhe ſcolds he laughs, and ſays, ſhe had better forbear bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſhe has no teeth to bite; thoſe that are near her tells me, he has made her diſtracted; but I believe he found her ſo, or elſe ſhe would never have entertained him upon that account; he is juſt going to ſend her into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

(however ſhe did falſely underſtand it) but ſhe was not ſo nice in keeping this writing as ſhe ought to have been, thinking ſhe had a ſtricter tye upon him, by the mighty paſſion he pretended; which ſhe now finds, is, vaniſht into Air.</p>

            <p>Pardon me Dear Madam, for this Digreſſion, in giving you an account of thoſe you have ſome knowledge of, tho their Actions ſhew how little they improved by good Acquaintance; a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>London</hi> ought to have ſome News, and I ſhall think my ſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if mine can amuſe your thoughts for a ſmall time, all the world knows their caſes are not in the leaſt parallel to yours, yet if another's greater errors can juſtify our failings, their want of foreſight, to ſo high a Degree, ſhould make you eſteem it a leſs weakneſs in your ſelf, to be deluded by a perſon, that ſeemed to every one (as well as you) to be ſo very good, ſo very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it was thoſe well Counterfeited Accompliſhments that made him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of your Affections, but ſince you

either that or her Conſcience, both would have joined in warning her to flye a Serpent who had ſo barbarouſly bit another only for cheriſhing him, in pity to his pretended pain: but hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe may ſee her Error, and ſmart for the Wound ſhe has helped to give you; yet as none of theſe things come by Chance, and you know by whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they are tranſacted; I doubt not you will look up to the (firſt) hand by whom the Blow was directed, and yield quietly to it; I wiſh you could ſo far overcome your paſſion as to do it thankfully; for all your Friends look upon it as a great Deliverance, and time may convince you that it is ſo; but this I am confident you are ſenſible of alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it is deſigned for your good, and are ſo much a Chriſtian, that you will endeavour to make a right uſe of it; for whatever Idea, you have entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Felicity in being his, will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly greater as well as ſurer, in your Contemplation of the Love and Goodneſs of God, who ſuffers us to meet with Diſappointments in this Life to make us ſeek our Happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

He only can give us true content, whom we ſeldom regard but when we are driven to it by neceſſity: how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs then ſhould we be in doing our Duties, if all our Undertakings were attended with ſucceſs, which makes us ſo eager in the purſuit of pleaſure, that we can think of nothing elſe; tho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day's Experience informs us, that it is impoſſible to find any delight without a mixture of bitterneſs and ſorrow, which one would imagin were ſufficient to drive us from placing our ſatisfactions in thoſe things that periſh in the uſing; and the truer perfection we fancy to be in them, the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhock, each change, each deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives us, what ſordid poor wretches muſt we then be, who, after the paying ſo dear for our knowledge, are ſtill ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that what we covet inceſſantly is but vanity and vexation of Spirit; this we are told by him, who had tryed all the alluring Charms of Love and Beauty, whoſe Quality and Riches gave him the opportunity to gratify every Inclination, and ſet no bounds to his wiſhes; if he found ſuch emptineſs in poſſeſſion of them, it is no wonder every one of us, muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover

the ſame truth to our own coſt, if we will miſtake it upon his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let us therefore reſolve upon all occaſions, to ſubmit our wills as much as we can to the will of our Heavenly Father; and then we need not fear but he will repair all our Loſſes, and Redreſs all our wrongs, and in lieu of a deceitful Lover whom you have loſt, You will find a moſt Gracious God who is conſtant to all thoſe that are true to him, and ſevere upon all thoſe that are falſe to others.</p>

I, who think every Poſt an Age in coming, ſhall now to my grief be infinitely more uncertain, how it may pleaſe the great Phiſician of our Souls and Bodies, to deal with you ſince my Husband's Affairs obliges us to croſs the <hi>Seas.</hi>

            <p>Whilſt we continue in this World, we are ſubject to variety of Afflictions, and whenſoever God ſees fit to lay ſevere pain or ſickneſs either upon our ſelves,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57479:26"/>
or thoſe that are dear to us, we muſt be forced to acknowledge that we are but miſerable comforters, not being able to afford each other a moment's eaſe or ſatisfaction; want of health vitiates the palate and takes off our taſte from all things valuable in this Life, imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering every Injoyment; as for the noiſe and busſles which at another time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, they do then become Inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſturbers of our Reſt; and if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we have been never ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by them, yet we find not the leaſt remains of Inclinations left, but are willing if we can to lie ſtill and forget 'em.</p>
            <p>Riches and Honours, as tempting as they appear to the greateſt votaries when well, yet in ſickneſs, if they are accompanied with their uſual train of Viſitants and Courtſhip, inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us good by gratifying our Ambition, they help to foment the Diſtemper but are far from curing it.</p>
            <p>And as Crown'd heads are no more exempt from the ſword of the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel, than the pooreſt Beggers, we may learn from their Anguiſh how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57479:26"/>
little we ought to value Grandeur, which can give us no aſſiſtance in our Extremities; a down-bed is not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſurer of ſleep in ſuch a caſe, than a heap of ſtraw (to thoſe that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed to it) and a King that groans under a hopeleſs ſharp Diſeaſe (tho he has been never ſo abſolute) is made quickly ſenſible, it takes its Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a higher power than his, and muſt without Reſiſtance yield to its Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults in ſpite of all the Doctors, who, 'tis ten to one to ſhow their Zeal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Torments by their fruitleſs Operations; and diſtinguiſh him from the Vulgar, by making him ſmart more; it is then, he eſteems himſelf wretched beyond any of his Servants, in their full ſtrength, and would (were it poſſible) change places with them; health, Alas! is a mercy which is not regarded till it is loſt.</p>
            <p>Sickneſs, multiplies all our other Grievances, as well as renders us inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleaſures, and the weakneſs of the body has ſuch effect upon the mind, that it ſinks under thoſe troubles that would not move it at another

time, but our Judgment decaying with us (which ſhould fill the breaſt with well digeſted thoughts) we ſhall too ſoon find its place ſupplyed by wild Chimera's of our own; and ſtartle eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment at Gyants of our own rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, then every haſty word af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights, and every whiſper gives us an Alarm, and a ſhow of the leaſt unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtrikes us lower than it found us; nay, ſometimes we are ſo unjuſt to charge our beſt friends for failing in their Love or Diligence, when they have toiled about us, to a degree that we cannot mention without thanks and bluſhing after our recovery; and when the want of ability to help our ſelves, forces us to become burthenſome to others, inſtead of excuſing the trouble; we are apt to increaſe their uneaſineſs by continual fretting; this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method through which the ſick afflict their own Brains, and their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant's cares, but God's name be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who, as he always indued you with an Extraordinary patience, does not ſuffer it to leave you in this Tryal; for tho Complaining may ſatisfy the fancy

at the preſent, it muſt needs diſorder the whole frame of the Body, much more than lying quiet till he that made us, is pleaſed to reſtore us to health and eaſe, but it is not in our power to do this without his help.</p>
            <p>Tumbling and Moaning, our miſery is indeed ſo very natural that of our ſelves we cannot forbear it, tho we know it rack's the head, indangers cold, and what is worſt of all, raiſes the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, an Enemy we ſeldom have the skill to lay again, Vapours that are alone, a Diſtemper which fills the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination with a thouſand terrifying whimſies; and not only Alters, but totally deprives us of our ſenſes, and appears like a forerunner of Death to them that ſee, as well as they who feel, its moſt amazing ſymptoms, this ſort of illneſs varies very often and baffles both them that preſcribe, and them that apply the Remedies; and much leſs can they, who are overcome by the apprehenſions of its fatal Conſequences, give a juſt account of themſelves; for it ſeizes ſo deeply upon their Intellects, that they read their doom in every ſad

look, and are ready to graſp at the leaſt Diſcouragement, to feed the conceit of their own being paſt all hopes of Recovery: and this opinion when it is fixed, not only obſtructs the cure, but makes them reſent it, if their friends do not altogether credit the diſmal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they give of their own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which however they find to their comforts, that they often repreſent more dangerous than it proves, they think you do them a great deal of wrong, if you queſtion their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the caſe; but the learned have been convinced by many years experience, that vapours mimick all other Diſeaſes, and deceive none ſo much as thoſe that have 'em; Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly will raiſe the Spleen in Sickneſs (and ſometimes in Health) to ſuch a height that they almoſt die daily in their belief, not in the Apoſtle's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for tho the beſt of Chriſtians are as liable to this misfortune as any other, (it being a defect in Nature not in Grace) I doubt it is a certain hindrance in all their Duties, which we hope, however, that God will mercifully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,

if their deſires are bent ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards him, according to their ſtrength; for at his Throne the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more conſidered than a ſtudied Speech, for he knows our neceſſities before we ask, but oh! how happy are they whoſe minds living and dying are Compoſed in his Service, whom no care nor pain Diſtracts, and are able, in all the Providences of the Almighty, to ſay his will be done; not that the beſt amongſt us are capable of this Reſignation, without a particular ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from above, we muſt only beſeech him if he ſees it conſiſtent with our Soul's good, that theſe houſes of clay where he has placed them may molder away ſo gently, as to give our better part as little emotion as is poſſible in ſuch a ſeparation, and that he would in mercy tranſlate them from Praiſing him on Earth, to ſing Eternal Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs to his Name in Heaven; which ſcene of Bliſs exceeds our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, let us therefore humbly adore without pretending to ſearch into theſe ſacred myſteries, and by a ſteady faith in our Redeemer's merits, expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

what he has purchaſed, for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as believe in him, and do his will, if we have this Glorious Proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes, it will prove the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cordial to our drooping Spirits, and make up for all we ſuffer in our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, tho it is rugged and contrary to fleſh and blood, whoſe dictates we are ſubject to follow, as long as they are about us, which occaſions repining at our ſufferings, till we looſe that thought in remembring the price of our high calling; not that I think a gueſs is to be made at any perſon's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Eſtate by their Patience, or Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience on a ſick bed, much allowance is to be given to their Diſpoſitions and the nature of their illneſs; which if it affects the head, it is no longer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that Act, and Conſequently they ought not to be accountable for it: at leaſt not to us who are liable to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and know not how ſoon the mildeſt of us may grow peeviſh under an acute, or Languiſhing Diſtemper; but in this and all other Tryals, it is God alone that is a ſure Rock, in the needful time of trouble, when humane
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57479:29"/>
frailty ſtifles our reaſoning, if he pleaſes to lay his hand under us, and let his right hand ſuſtain us, tho we walk in the valley of the ſhadow of Death, yet ſhall we fear no Evil, for his Rod and and his Staff is ſufficient to comfort us.</p>
            <p>Now when he lays his Rod without his Staff, who can abide it in ſuch a day of diſtreſs, there is no ſhelter; ſhould we lean upon any other for help, they would prove as ſpears to pierce our hearts, or as weak Reeds that will quickly bend under us, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us deſtitute and expoſed to Temptations and Sorrows; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we find a Deprivation of Health, which the Devil who knows our blind ſides very well, believed to be ſo unguarded a fort that he thought himſelf aſſured <hi>Job's</hi> integrity would fall a victim to him by it, if he had God's permiſſion to attack him there; skin for skin ſays he, and all that a Man has will he give for his Life; but tho neither the force nor cunning of this Enemy, joyned with the cruel reproofs of his friends, had the power to make him charge God fooliſhly (how ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57479:30"/>
ſoever he was Tormented by them yet it did compel him to break out in bitter Exclamations, againſt the day of his Birth, and in the midſt of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, he expreſſed a deep ſenſe of his Calamities; it is no wonder then if we Complain ſince that was done by ſo great an Example of patience, of whom our Cteator declared, that there was at that time none like him upon the Earth: and in this degenerate Age I fear there are ſtill fewer Imitators of his virtues, but as God has not given us the ſame ſtrength as he had, neither has he ſuffered us to fall into ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in Body and Eſtate; for if he did, I doubt we ſhould ſpeak unadviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with our Lips.</p>
            <p>But too many, amongſt us, ſeldom need his miſeries to carry them to a fault; that is now daily practiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any excuſe but meer Diverſion, or an Idle Cuſtom, by men of all ranks, whoſe common Diſcourſes are ſo ſtuft with Oaths, and horrid Imprecations, that one would conclude <hi>Job's</hi> wife were there Spiritual guide, they ſhew ſuch readineſs to curſe God, and call
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57479:30"/>
not only for Temporal but Eternal Death, invoking him at every word to damn and ſink 'em, little reflecting how dreadful a ſentence they would bring upon their own heads, if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Amen:</hi> I doubt it would ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when they come into another Region, to pretend they were not in earneſt in what they ſpake ſo devoutly; yet after all, I am far from imagining they mean what they ſay; but ſince ſome have been ſnatched out of the world, with thoſe words in their mouth, I think the danger conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to be avoided, and I fancy theſe Martyrs in the cauſe, making ſo horrible an Exit, could be no Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to their followers, who dare ſcarce vindicate the crime they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; I wiſh it had more force to deter them from ſhewing ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to the moſt high God, and mentioning the Blood of the Covenant as an unholy thing, by mixing it in all their filthy jeſts, or ſometimes uſing the wounds of the Meek, the Bleſſed Jeſus, to expreſs their rage and luſt, indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one way or other, to draw him in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57479:31"/>
as a Confederate to Debauchery and Oppreſſion, who knew no ſin, neither was any guile found in his Lips; and, as if this were not ſufficient to make them in danger of Hell fire, they add (the leſſer weight) of not only diſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Brother, but breathing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Execrations againſt him, upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frivolous occaſion; and ſometimes in good fellowſhip, as if they only curſed him to the Devil that they might not be parted.</p>
            <p>This is ſtrange daring in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſtitutions, but to hear thoſe who are ſcarce able to creep about, that look like <hi>Lazarus</hi> fetched from the Grave, and are rotten enough to be worms meat before they come there; to hear theſe poor Mortals venture to provoke and (ſeem ſometimes to) defy the hand which has almoſt cruſhed them to peices already, is ſurely the heigth of Impudence, and muſt coſt them many ſad thoughts, if they have but ſence enough to think of that place whither they are going, and to which their own curſes have condemn'd them; but I am afraid, whoever indulged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57479:31"/>
themſelves in this, or any other ſin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hopes of a Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, found it a very improper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and would not adviſe their Friends to delay it ſo long; it muſt be very difficult when the body and mind are wearied with their Diſtemper, to call the Conſcience to an account for what was ſo cuſtomary to them, that they were hardly ſenſible when they did it, and could not in perfect health indure the Fatigue of ſlightly recollecting their Souls.</p>
            <p>But beſides the more then ordinary pains, beſides the hazard of not having oppertunity given for this dilatory way of making our Peace, and our great unfitneſs to begin this work, when we can have ſo little aſſiſtance from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſome have been ſplit upon another Rock, and fallen into a dreadful deſpair of God's mercy, which is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable torment that fleſh and blood can feel, and is as much beyond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as the Heaven they think they are excluded from; It may then truly be ſaid, the whole Head is heavy, the whole Heart is ſick, and renders them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57479:32"/>
incapable of one minutes eaſe; for the Spirit of a Man may bear his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but a wounded Spirit, oh! Lord, who can bear.</p>
            <p>Nothing tranſcends their miſery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that Everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, which is ſo lively repreſented to their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it gives them a taſte of the flame and brimſtone into which they fancy they are Dropping; how prudent are they who conſider and avoid this precipice; for early or late, we ſhall all find what fruits we ſhall have of thoſe things whereof we are, or ſhould be aſhamed, but tho curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is grown a bold fac'd tranſgreſſion, and people are not much given to be aſhamed of it at preſent, they will find in the end it muſt be accounted for, and they cannot deny but it is the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable of all ſins; for it damns a Man for a little Air, or extorts a dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from them, without being inticed by any pleaſure into their fault.</p>
            <p>A diſturbed Conſcience is certainly the ſaddeſt Circumſtance of a ſick friend, and I heartily beſeech God to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57479:32"/>
keep me and all I am concerned in, from falling into it, that we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have a diſtruſt of our Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt, nor preſume groundleſly upon his Merrits, without lamenting and forſaking our ſins.</p>
            <p>But your Life hitherto has been ſo ſtrictly pious, that I do not in the leaſt apprehend you want a ſummons from me to look up to him, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and the Finiſher of your Faith, and to call upon him in all diſtreſſes: no, to my Joy, I hear how conſtant you are to your Devotion in the midſt of your pains, and that you retain your ever quiet temper, under thoſe variety of tortures, that might diſcompoſe the ſtrongeſt brains, that you ſhow no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at the will of our Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>All this ſedate frame of yours, being conſidered, it may appear very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in me, to mention ſeveral things that my pen ſlipt into; but I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly led into it by ſome unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that I have lately ſeen of thoſe who in their health could talk irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently enough of a leap in the Dark,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57479:33"/>
but in their ſickneſs had a glimpſe of fire, tho not of light, only ſo much as ſerv'd to convince them, that they were altogether out of their way; but God who opened their Eyes, I hope did at the laſt forgive their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>

            <p>IMpute not my ſilence, Dear Madam, to any want, but the exceſs of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which makes me too much a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in your ſorrow, to find words at all ſuitable to the ſhare I have with you in it; if therefore I am the laſt in Condol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your great Loſs, I do moſt faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

aſſure you, it is no inſenſibility, but the higheſt Degree of Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs towards you, that occaſioned it; the grief that is leaſt, is ſooneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and perhaps the more noiſe it makes, the leſs miſcheif is ſuſtained by it: had I been unconcerned, my pen and thoughts had been freer; and (though I could have ſaid nothing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to ſtem ſo fierce a Tide as your juſt Lamentations) I might have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome poor reaſons againſt other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens afflicting themſelves ſo much, which I ſhould be aſhamed to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, having been a witneſs, how far your Husbands Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, excelled the beſt of Mankind I have ever met with, and I am ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your Reciprocal affection, that I know the power of God only can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you under ſuch a ſeparation, which I believe, was much more terrible to you then Death it ſelf, that ſo lately ſeemed to look you in the face with its ſevere Attendants of pain and ſickneſs; and without doubt, if we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bewail any misfortune in this world, you will be excuſed for duly

fit for no places but Charnel houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where all things are as corrupted and rotten as their Principles, and yet theſe Monſters are too too often receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the nobleſt Palaces, where that their deformities may not be obſerved; they take care to render their Proſelytes, as odious and infectious as themſelves, and ſo joyn together to ſpread the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contagion, as far as their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance reaches; had your dear Husband fall'n a prey to them, he had been loſt for ever to you, and to himſelf; but now, tho his change muſt of neceſſity give you a very great trouble, for being deprived of the beſt Companion, and the trueſt Friend that ever any woman was made happy by, yet after a due debt paid to his memory, which I know can be diverted by nothing upon Earth, I hope that trouble will find the moſt comfortable allay in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that this parting is to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſable advantage, and has remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from a tranſitory and imperfect, to an Everlaſting happineſs, whither I doubt not you are daily preparing to follow him; and ſince it has pleaſed

God to deny you the further aſſiſtance of ſuch an Example and Counſellor, to ſtrengthen you in your Travel, he will abundantly recompenſe that loſs, by allowing you a greater meaſure of his, to carry you thorough the tryals and temptations to which you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the way, unleſs you neglect to implore his help by giving up your ſelf to a Melancholy, that muſt needs diſcompoſe all your faculties at the ſame time, weakning your body, and unhinging your mind; which fruitleſs grief, if the Saints in Heaven have a ſenſe of what paſſes here below, would be more diſapproved by him, whoſe diſeaſe is the occaſion of it, then by any of your ſurviving friends; and were it poſſible by your tears to recal him for one minute, from that Scene of Glory, which he is now (as we reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably imagin) tranſlated into, he muſt regard you as his bittereſt Enemy, to interrupt him in that ſtate of Joy, which tongue cannot expreſs, nor can it enter into the heart of Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but if he is capable of making any wiſhes concerning you, we may

conclude from his laſt words, that they all tend only to your attaining a firmer Title, to the Love and Knowledge of our Creator, that you may injoy a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled peace in your mind, and ſo reſign up your ſelf to the will of God, in this Gloomy providence, that your dear Spouſe and you may hereafter dwell together, in that ſtate of pleaſures that has no end nor interruption; and tho the time of the afflicted ſeems moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, yet they have the conſolation to know that the miſeries of this world muſt have an end, and ſo muſt our Mourning too, and this I have learnt even from the Heathens, that all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pains are ſhort, and all laſting pains, are lightſome; and from hence conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any ſort of pain might eaſily be endur'd, whether it were this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſelf-love that made them bear the loſs of friends with ſuch indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will not preſume to determine; but I have met with ſome ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh people, whoſe exceſſive tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their own perſons has prevented their grieving for any others; now when <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

from that Principle, I fear it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come under the name of vertue, but ill nature; for we are commanded to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, and none can loſe the thing they love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret, which regret when it is for a friend, or thoſe that are nearly allyed to us, I hope is inoffenſive, and God who in mercy overlooks many of our infirmities, will (I truſt) pity and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this, which is the moſt natural of them all, at leaſt if it does not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport us beyond moderation, but for thoſe Chriſtian Stoicks I laſt mentioned, their tranquility is not more aſſured for a leſs ſhare of humane gratitude, or natural affection, ſince I never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any of them without a darling paſſion, which affects them as tenderly, tho not ſo commendably as the other; in ſome Coveteouſneſs and in others Pride, ſupplies the place of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which as it chears them when they find ſucceſs, ſo every diſappointment torments and grieves their Spirits, as much as the Death of our deareſt friends does ours; and as mankind is the moſt excellent of all created beings

upon Earth, I think it is undiſputable that the degree of Love, which the ſupream Lord of all things is pleaſed to ſpare from himſelf, is much nobler imployed in kindneſs to one another, then in doting upon the unneceſſary treaſures, or the vain Ornaments of this Life, that take up moſt of the time and wiſhes of them, whoſe humor cannot be moved by any other ſpring. I grant that we ought not to expect any ſolid comfort from any of the Injoyments which we meet with here below, that the deareſt friends muſt unavoidably part, and we know not whoſe turn it will be to be left behind; for as we came not into this world together, ſo we muſt not think to go together to the next, and tho we are permitted to Love, and commanded according to our Ability to aſſiſt each other, in this weariſom Pilgrimage, yet when it pleaſes God to part us, we muſt yeild to this common fate, notwithſtanding the hardſhip it ſeems to put upon us; and whilſt we do injoy the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our friends, we ſhould prize the Goodneſs more then the outward Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications

By that acknowledging that Death is an effect of God's great mercy, to all ſuch to whom the following Text may be applyed, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, even ſo ſaith the Spirit, for they reſt from their Labours</hi>; And if the Diſſolution of the Righteous, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from Labours, tho our own intereſt makes us eager to detain them longer with us; yet the ſenſe of what they enjoy in Heaven, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that attends them, whilſt they are upon the Earth, muſt be a great means to ſilence our repinings; and to abate our grief: ſome indeed

have ſo little peace and ſatisfaction, during their ſtay amongſt us, that themſelves are ready to ſay with <hi>Job, Wherefore is light given to him that is in Miſery, and Life unto the bitter in Soul, which long for Death, but it cometh not, and dig for it, more then for hid treaſures, which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the Grave.</hi> In ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, ſurely thoſe that love them beſt, can bid them moſt chearfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu, hoping that all their ſufferings are ended with their lives, and having pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently indured their Heavenly Fathers Correction, ſhall now be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Joy; were it not for this bleſſed Expectation, the Servants of God would commonly be moſt wretched, ſince their Cup is often empty, and as often filled with an unpleaſant Potion; whilſt their ungodly Neighbours have plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Rivers to drink, but tho we grieve the leſs for the Death of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Friend, yet his misfortunes make us grieve the more for him, whilſt he lives; a certain Demonſtration that the days of man are evil, as well as few, ſince Friendſhip, the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

pleaſure in the world, only gives us the trouble of lamenting the unhappy Life, or bewailing the untimely Death of thoſe we love: if our life then is conſtantly attended with ſuch perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, why ſhould we be ſo apprehenſive of our Death; and yet, except thoſe few that are extraordinarily harras'd, the reſt of us are as zealous to hug our chains; as if we diſſembled when we complained of bondage, like the old man in the Fable, tho groaning under the burthen, yet we deſire to bear it longer, rather then have the fatal ſiſters cut the thread. 'Tis true, we are told, that this averſion to Death is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſince all Animals that have ſenſe enough to foreſee their danger, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid it; whether it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in nature which teaches them to flye from pain and oppreſſion, or the fear of Annihilation, is beyond my reach, but we know when their breath is gone, they have no further being, and if we were Animals like them, we might have the like Apprehenſions too, but now the ſting of Death is taken away from us, by the blood of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,

who graciouſly opens the Door of Life, to all ſuch as patiently wait till their change ſhall come; and piouſly ſtrive in the mean time to make their change happy; for which reaſon we ought neither to be diſcontented to live, nor unwillling to dye; and tho we muſt feel pain, ſickneſs, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe we term misfortunes, with the ſame ſenſes that others do (for Religion humbles, but does not ſtupify) yet the knowledge that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved much more ſtripes from our great Judge, muſt make us reſolve to lay our hands upon our mouths, and our mouths in the duſt; not being able to offer one word in our own juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but muſt ſay with the Publican God be merciful to me a ſinner; and when we have according to our Duties proſtrated our Souls before him, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, and all that is dear to us, to his moſt wiſe diſpoſal; let us in Gods Name riſe up chearfully and make our own way to Heaven, looking up to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our faith, and to the Examples of thoſe bleſſed Saints that have gone before us,

would chuſe the former; and now ſince God has been ſo gracious, not only to give you a Man that exceeded your wiſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let you paſs thrice that number of years, in mutual Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſguſt; you muſt not ſpend all the remainder of your time, in thinking upon what you have loſt; but conſider how very few women are ſo bleſt at all, and of thoſe few how ſeldom their happineſs laſts ſo long as yours has done; ſo it pleaſeth our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father to order it, that he may draw us by afflictions nearer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and never continueth in one ſtay; being therefore we are ſo fully convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the viciſſitudes of this Life, let us receive every alteration with ſuch a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of mind, as becomes the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who has promiſed to lay no more upon us, then he will inable us to bear, as I hope you will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that mercy, to aſſiſt you in this tryal of your faith and patience; and that you may find no decay, no want of either, is the hearty prayer of Yours.</p>

            <p>IT is very natural for the moſt curious Travellers, after having ſpent ſome time abroad to return with joy to their native Countrey; but much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me who did not go out of it by my own choice, nor any hope of improvement; and to add to the great ſatisfaction of ſeeing my Friends (in which number you give me leave to

Now, if you ask theſe ſeveral ſorts of Gentlemen, what it is they wiſh for, you ſhall find they have ſeveral ends, ſome of them are men that have by their extravagence ſpent their fortunes, and almoſt their credit too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are in violent haſte for a Civil War, in hopes by plunder to ſupply their pockets, like Vultures that live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Carcaſs, and are always watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a battel, and therefore they ſpeak aloud as they would have it, that all things are running into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; others like Crows love the fruits of the Earth, but hate the ſmell of Gun-Powder, and theſe affirm as poſſitively, tho not ſo loudly, that we ſhall be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ruined, unleſs things return into the ſame Channel they were in before, and would fain inſinuate that the only

            <p>A third ſort of this diſaffected party, are the Commonwealth-men, a ſort of men like Moles that are always work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ground, and no kind of ſoil can ſcape them; this made them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine K. <hi>J.</hi> and after His, ruin the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and theſe vermine are now at the ſame work again, and think their game ſure after this King is dead, but have not patience to ſtay ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heaving at him, whilſt he is alive, in which they joyn with the other party; tho as I ſaid before, they propoſe a very different end, the one intending to make diviſions in order to have K. <hi>J.</hi> and the other to have no King at all; both wiſely ſuppoſing we may alter this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as eaſily as we did the laſt, when that was carried by the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all the Nation; and if they pretend the Nation now is under the

ſame diſcontent, only for being loaded with Taxes, as if King <hi>William</hi> ſhould have kept out the <hi>French,</hi> by the virtue of <hi>hocus pocus,</hi> and conjured an Army upon occaſion without our paying of the charge, I believe they will find themſelves much miſtaken, as to the number of their Confederates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the nature of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and am ſorry ſo many of my Countreymen ſhould fall under the cenſure of the Poet,

they could not pitch upon a Man that would content any one of them till the year were out; unleſs he were to Reign himſelf, who would be much further from pleaſing (even) their own Club than they by whom our affairs now are managed; and how can we expect a Magiſtracy free from faults, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perticular perſon muſt acknowledge himſelf to have ſo many; if thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin were to throw the firſt ſtone, or go out of <hi>England,</hi> the King would have fewer ſubjects then Duke <hi>Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calo.</hi>

hand; I know not how to interpret this ſhyneſs in you, it makes me fear you never eſteemed me worthy of your friendſhip, if you could imagin the change of your Circumſtances ſhould alter my Love; I had a different noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our mutual obligations, and ſhould have thought it a wrong to your generous temper, to have concealed any thing of conſequence that had hapned to me, tho it had been to leſſen me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much in the world (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects people according to the port they live in); I hoped till now you had put the ſame confidence me, who had nothing to recommend me to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but the plain ſincerity of Soul; if you ſhould not be welcome to me in the meaneſt habit, I could not deſerve your company at all; but far be ſuch mercenary baſe inclinations from my breaſt, who have more pleaſure in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a ſmall fortune with my friends, then in hoarding up, or injoying the greateſt treaſures without them; and ſince I never valued any perſon for having a ſplendid equipage, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly confounded to find I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

ſo unlike my ſelf to you, (for what elſe can make you avoid me, when it is in my power to be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, unleſs you queſtion my will to do it) I dare not quarrel with you now, leſt it confirms your deſign of breaking our correſpondence, which is as dear to me as ever, yet give me leave to complain of a greater loſs then yours, the loſs of my Friend; for now I perceive it is in the power of adverſe fortune, to draw you from me; and let me tell you, thoſe apprehenſions that made you eſtrange your ſelf, muſt at the ſame time accuſe me of Pride and Coveteouſneſs, as well as ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the firſt of which ſins would be more unpardonable in me, then the reſt of my Sex; but I always knew my own defects well enough to ſtifle any ſuch ſuggeſtions; nor could I ever boaſt of any advantage ſo much, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made happy by your kindneſs; and ſince every Soul is not capable of faithfulneſs, the Character you gave of me for being ſo, together with your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing me in your confidence, above the reſt of your friends, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57479:50"/>
elevate me with joy (tho not to oſtentation) but you have ſufficiently mortifyed me now, by ſhewing me your truſt was not abſolute; and that you believed I loved you only as long as you were in humor for Diverſions, or elſe I had ſome ſiniſter ends, which are diſappointed by this turn in your affairs; I think I can ſcarce be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with crimes I have a much greater antipathy to then theſe I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as Coveteouſneſs is the root of all Evil, it is an Enemy to all good, (which I muſt ever account Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be) that perſon that delights only in money can have no laſting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, for as it is the nature of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to make themſelves wings, and fly away, the miſer that locks them never ſo faſt in his trunk, is ſo ſenſible of their fleeting qualities, that he has as many racking meditations about them, as if they were already out of his reach, his ſleep is interrupted and all tyes of nature are broke; he regards a poor relation with as much averſion and caution as he can do a theif; as for Fendſhip he has not the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57479:50"/>
(or as he thinks weakneſs) to pretend to it, leſt he bring in a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his wealth; for many of thoſe ſordid wretches, will acknowledge ſuch an intimacy does oblige us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our powers, to help each other, and therefore they not being deſirous to give a title to any part of their Eſtate, will keep out of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; by which means, they want the chiefeſt comfort of humane life; a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteous Man after many years deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf all Conveniencies (as well as duties) if he gets the reputation of being rich, may be courted by them who have an expectation from him, but he receives their addreſſes very warily, being conſcious to himſelf, that he deſerves nothing of civility, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtill of a deſign upon his Coffers, where he knows his only attraction lies; if he gets any preſents upon truſt of a double return at his Death, this <hi>Janus</hi> may look with ſmiles upon his Benefactors, but his affectionate face is always fixt towards his Gold; which yet he knows not how ſoon he muſt leave, if it does not leave him firſt; but

ſometimes the miſerable wretch meets a diſappointment in his darling hopes; and by an unforeſeen fate is reduced to the real want, which his greedy deſire of money impoſed upon him, even in the midſt of plenty; he may then too late wiſh he had made himſelf friends, with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, for he finds no body willing to receive him, and does in vain groan for that bleſſing which he declined in his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and would have proved of more advantage then all his ill got treaſure; I mean a true friend, for they will not be wanting to help and to aſſiſt one another, in all exigencies, with their purſe and adviſe; but they that will know no body when it is in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to oblige, will find no body know them in their extremity; as a late <hi>French</hi> Author well obſerves, out of whoſe ingenious writings I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome choice remarks, which I hope may be not only an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an aſſiſtance to you in your preſent circumſtances. The world is grown ſo very bad, that there is little faith left amongſt us; nor gratitude
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57479:51"/>
for any kindneſs, the beſt ſervices are too often the worſt requited; we ſhould therefore obſerve peoples beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in their Correſpondencies with others, not to imitate their treachery, but to ſtand ſo much upon our guard that we may not be ſufferers by it; Thoſe that are too eaſy to believe, do many times when it is too late find themſelves miſtaken, yet we ought to be cautious in ſhewing a diſtruſt of the truth of another, that being an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary rudeneſs unto them, and if it amounts to the degree of ſuſpecting every body, it is an indication of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in our ſelves, for a lyer can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe nor be believed; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt report of any thing, it is moſt prudent to ſuſpend our Judgment, unleſs we know the integrity of him that ſpeaks it; yet the ſafeſt way of all to avoid being partial, is not to make any concluſion till we hear both ſides; how unjuſt are they, whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are ſo ingaged towards one party, that truth can make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on them; but continue wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their opinion, beyond the power
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57479:52"/>
of reaſon to ſeparate them from it; the beſt interpretation that can poſſibly be put upon ſuch pernicious practiſes, is a defect in their capacity; tho 'tis ten to one their honeſty is chiefly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moſt in fault: The greateſt part of our life is ſpent in information, and that which is viſible to us is leaſt eſſential; we take moſt things on the words of others, and that makes us generally impoſed upon; we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly know the truth of what we ſee, but ſeldom of what we hear, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if it come from far (which ſhould make us more circumſpect in what we give credit to) for when a relation of a thing has paſſed through ſeveral hands, it has ſo many gloſſes put upon it by the paſſions, or intereſt of them that recount it, as makes it never arrive pure and unmixt to our ears; Let us therefore conſider, whether they which ſpeak of any perſon, or thing are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſs'd; and if they are not, we muſt give grains of allowance for their praiſes, and much more for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſes, ſince the depraved temper of moſt men is ſtronglier inclined to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57479:52"/>
ſpightful, then good natured; it is thoſe ſlanders that are ſpoken behind our backs (to undiſcerning men) that does us miſchief, for a wiſe perſon will gain a greater advantage from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their enemies, for what they do amiſs, if they hear it, then a fool will take from the advice of his friends, which ſeldom prevails with him; the envious holds a glaſs to ſhew us our faults, and we ought to correct them in our ſelves, and not retaliate their railings.</p>
            <p>We ſhould indeavour to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with every body, and diſoblige none willingly; for any perſon is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being an enemy, but not all of doing friendſhips; nor is it prudent to be over forward in ingaging our ſelves in any tyes, either in Love or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (more then what Chriſtianity commands us to have for all men) yet when we have made a Proteſtation of Amity, no generous Soul will brake the correſpondence, tho they meet ſome inconveniencies in it; but if the diviſion is inevitable, will be ſure it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57479:53"/>
ſhall be juſtifyable on their ſides; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both parties will be condemned, where there is a rupture betwixt friends, either for want of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the beginning, or of conſtancy in the end; the ſpectators of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do every one repreſent it as they pleaſe, (or at leaſt as they think), and they Judge according as they Love; it is better to decline making a promiſe then to repent of it afterwards; a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged friend often proves the worſt of enemies, and where you find a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in them, a coldneſs is better then a quarrel; for contention generally ruines our reputation, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cauſing people to diſcover thoſe failings, that our civility had made them overlook; the heat of diſpute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Spirits, and raiſes up that infamy which was dead before; our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts thinking to confound if they cannot confute us, begin with a <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto</hi> of invectives, (that is ſuppoſing them as ill as they ſet us forth to be) for thoſe are Arms unworthy a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon to make uſe of; Let us therefore ſtrive to have a concern with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57479:53"/>
none that are not ſo, their goodneſs being a defence againſt ill language as well as falſehood; for they would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways act like themſelves; but there is no ſecurity, when we treat with thoſe that are not guided by Reaſon nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſuch we ſhould not have a difference, and much leſs contract a friendſhip, for whatſoever affection we muſt expreſs, we muſt remember all is not Gold that gliſters, and theirs is ſubject to a baſe alloy, which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough to make us fly them, that have no Principles of honour, for hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the trueſt pledge of faithfulneſs, and we can be ſafe with none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>The greateſt benefit we can receive from riches, is their enabling us to do more good then thoſe that have leſs; a good eſtate is a charge that we muſt give an account of, and leads us into many inconveniencies, if we have no friend to regulate our unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. A perſon that is rich is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flattered, and they muſt love us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that will venture their own
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57479:54"/>
intereſts to repreſent us truly to our ſelves; which is the moſt requiſite of any knowledge, tho it is unwillingly received by moſt people; a proud Man is hurried into many other vices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none dares ſhow him the odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his carriage; for he that keeps all his acqaintance at a diſtance, if he is falling down a precipice has no body near enough to ſtop him; but a friend will kindly advertiſe us of thoſe evils, for the which an enemy would expoſe us, and perhaps the very people who have betrayed us into it, ſhall be the firſt to trumpet our diſgrace; ſuch treatment is abſolutely againſt the Laws of Friendſhip, ſince that injoyns us to conceal, as well as ſtrive to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy each others errors; and is a chain that proves of greater ſecurity to us, the more firmly it is linked; he that ſtands alone, cannot be ſo ſtrong as he that is ſupported, nor is any help (from this world) ſo ready and ſubſtantial, as that which proceeds from a true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; tho alas, there is but little of that to be found in the age we live in, and it is this decay of kindneſs, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57479:54"/>
occaſions the ruine of ſo many families, for if there are ſeveral branches, it is not likely they ſhould all be proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but where they are united they ſeldom fall; we were born, next to ſerving God, to ſerve our Neighbours, and eſpecially thoſe of our own blood, which may be Policy as well as Duty, ſince we all want aſſiſtance in our turns, and a rich perſon has as much need of Counſel as one in a meaner Station has of relief; but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Circumſtances are, we ſhould omit no opportunity of being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the reſt of mankind; thoſe that have a conſiderable fortune to diſpoſe of, ſhould let their friends injoy a neceſſary ſhare of it ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it may not appear like a gift, but as if they had an equal Title to it; and in all conditions we ſhould aid the diſtreſſed to the utmoſt of our power, never follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their examples, who are moroſe to all about them, not only to avoid the trouble of obliging, but from an Antipathy they have to all good nature; directly oppoſite to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57479:55"/>
goodneſs, who is inceſſantly communicating his benefits to us; we ought in prudence to manage our Converſation with ſuch an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſantneſs (bounded by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that people may delight in our companies; for all the goods of this life would be worth nothing, if we were to poſſeſs them alone, but we are ſure to have either friends or enemies about us; and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day ingages the world to be more or leſs kind to us; let us therefore carry our ſelves ſo, that tho we do not deſire to make many confidents, we may at leaſt gain the eſteem of all that know us; for with friends all things are well accepted that are meant ſo; they put no ill conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon each others words; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſweetens all our cares, and takes away the conſtraint we are in before them, that are indifferent or ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us; as in Summer we muſt provide againſt Winter, we ſhould make our ſelves ſo well beloved in proſperity, as to reap the fruit of it in adverſity; if we have an alteration
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57479:55"/>
in our affairs, which are ſubject to mutation as long as we continue upon Earth, and ſome have been forced to crouch to thoſe they once diſdained to ſmile on; Humility and Complacenſy have this reward, that they never fail to bring glory to thoſe that exerciſe them, they add a luſtre to the brighteſt ornaments, and if a change of fortune happens, their beauty is not ſullied by Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the honour of an humble perſon remains, tho all their other circumſtances are altered, and an obliging word or look coſts us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; therefore we may afford that; when we are reduced never ſo low, it will not only procure us eſteem whilſt we live, but make us be lamented when we die; a mild and charitable perſon imprints ſuch Love, ſuch Reverence in all that know him, as will not end with his life, but his memory will be reſpected; and when he goes from this world, it will be to his own comfort and other peoples grief; whilſt a ſevere haughty man, tho
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57479:56"/>
he hugs himſelf with the conceit of keeping others in awe, will not only fall unpittied, but being conſidered for nothing beſides his power to do miſchief, if his Station alters, will find that fear turned into hatred; nor can his death be regretted, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the publick good to have ſo ill an example removed.</p>
            <p>If incivility proceeds from Pride, it is a baſe effect from a worſe cauſe, which never proves of advantage to thoſe that nouriſh it; if it is from ignorance, we ſhall be diſpiſed for not informing our ſelves better, ſince thoſe who have not had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of fine breeding, may learn a civil candeſcention; and that we owe to every body, even our very enemies, for we muſt pity and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them in their neceſſities, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affront them nor proclaim their failings; it is a ſign of our leading an ill life, if we carry a regiſter of the wicked actions of others, and it is the conſolation of fools only to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with their own ſins, becauſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57479:56"/>
another's are of ſomething a deeper dye; yet too many are as violent in decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe debaucheries they imitate, as if they were provoked by the ſteps they made in Vice beyond themſelves, and whilſt they rail, ſtill run to overtake them.</p>
            <p>Let us on the contrary, be ſtrict in obſerving our own ways, and eaſy in the interpretation we put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others.</p>
            <p>A generous perſon will ſpeak well of thoſe that are not his friends, as far as truth permits, and where he cannot, will be ſilent; ſince it is much better to be ſo, then to ſay that which will proſtitute our Neighbours reputation; but to magnify his faults with all the ſeverity we can invent, is to make our tongues like the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Serpent, whoſe bite is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and will render us as deteſtable as they are.</p>
            <p>A wiſe man will be moderate to all his diſcourſes, and particularly in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57479:57"/>
giving the Character of others, not being tranſported into a heat, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are friends or enemies he mentions; nor hyperbolizing in the commendation of people that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, for exceſſive praiſe awakens curioſity, and provokes envy to look into their failings; and every one appears the worſe that has been too much extolled before hand; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſadvantage we bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our friends, in having ſo mighty expectations to ſatisfy, if they fall ſhort of what we have repreſented them, we muſt bring our own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or Judgment in queſtion; but we ſhould leaſt of all deſcribe our ſelves, ſince we are ſo unable to Judge rightly in that point, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſelves in an abominable vanity; and to diſcommend our ſelves, is to beg a complement, and both ways we put the company in pain, either to forbear laughing at our conceitedneſs, or to find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, which they think will anſwer our expectations, tho they do not believe one word of it themſelves,

but they who delight to hear no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies tongue in motion, but their own, are liable to theſe and many other errors; and the moſt watchful may ſometimes need a friend to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; for tho Converſation is the ordinary exerciſe of life, we muſt conſider how ſmall a ſlip in it may ruine our reputation, which is of ineſtimable price, and is never in more danger then when we keep company with thoſe that have none of their own to loſe; whatſoever charms they poſſeſs, if vertue is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our fame will quickly be like theirs, and friendſhip will then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ill, as well as the good of this world betwixt us; why ſhould we for any diverſions incourage a reprobate perſon, and run the riſque of being eſteemed ſo our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is every bodies happineſs to have wiſe friends, if they have wit enough to be adviſed by them; they which love truly are firm as a Diamond, and as hard to break; but ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious people are like glaſs, ſo brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57479:58"/>
and dangerous to touch, that it is impoſſible to have a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, without being in conſtraint; the leaſt <hi>punctilio</hi> that you omit, makes a flaw in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, they are continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to themſelves and others; they who would keep their favour muſt ſtudy their humors, and dares ſcarce ſtir before them, leſt they ſhould be offended at their motions; they are fond of nothing but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and being ſlaves to their own wills, expect their friends ſhould be ſo too; we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whom we receive into that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; if they are well principled, the correſpondency will be mingled with pleaſure and profit; but amongſt the generallity of people, freedom in diſcourſe is of ill conſequence, leſt we furniſh them with Arms to deſtroy us, if they become our Enemies; and we often ſee thoſe that expreſs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us to day, are moſt ready to do us an injury to morrow, and they are capable of making the more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el war upon us, if they know our weakneſs: Tho we may be ſenſible
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57479:58"/>
when we are treated ill, and ſhew a reaſonable reſentment, yet in all quarrels, we ſhould leave a door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for reconciliation, and put a curb to all thoughts of revenge; for if we give liberty to ſuch inclinations, we may do that in our paſſion that may out-ballance the delight of puniſhing another; and a religious perſon finds a greater ſatisfaction in pardoning, then in returning an affront, rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing when they have an opportunity to overcome evil with good.</p>
            <p>But ſome are very far from this temper, who will take part with thoſe that are in the wrong, if their enemies have a diſpute with him, only to oppoſe the man they hate, not reflecting that they hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt, if he has the ſenſe to eſpouſe the right ſide; they ſhow great folly that are againſt him, only for contradiction ſake, which would be more inexcuſable then if they did it, through a defect in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; but thoſe who are guided by virtue and goodneſs, will act quite
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57479:59"/>
otherways, knowing a poſitive ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs makes all converſation uneaſy, and many times thoſe that think to ſhow their wit by diſputing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their ill nature only, and give their adverſary cauſe to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; we ſhould rather imitate the Bee then the Spider, as the Bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſucks the ſweets from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very flower, ſo let us make the beſt of all croſs accidents, and then the counſels of our friends will prove as honey to us; but they whoſe envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition obſerve the worſt they can in every diſcourſe, are like the Spider that ſwells with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, he extracts where're he goes: they that cannot bear a private, friendly reproof, are as big with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs, as any of thoſe inſects I mentioned, can be with the moſt Poyſonous Exhalation: It is a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be allied to ſuch a Perſon, but when we fall into his Hands, we muſt not ſpend our Time in <hi>Fruitleſs Lamentations</hi>; For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints do often cauſe Diſdain, and the <hi>World</hi> is ſo Inhumane, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57479:59"/>
of moving Compaſſion, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries we Receive from one, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages another (of as ill a principle) to accumulate our wrongs; it is beſt to conceal the rudeneſſes we ſuffer, and cannot remedy, and acknowledge the favours that are conferr'd upon us; which is Policy, as well as Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſince it many times excites thoſe that hear us to be as kind; but that proud heart who will not own his obligations to his friends, does juſtly deſerve to be contemned by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body; and when he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſlighted upon that ſcore, it muſt be an aggravation to his miſery, to conſider how much his own inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility contributed to his ruine.</p>
            <p>They who do their duties, are the beſt prepared to undergo what we call the frowns of fortune, and making a good uſe of their afflictions, will find a happy end of them; and enable us to be ſerene in thoſe hurricanes of life, that are apt to ſhock the ſteddieſt brain, where we can meet no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſafety, but in the hand of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57479:60"/>
Providence; let us therefore wait patiently upon him, till he pleaſes to make a turn in our affairs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we can as much calm the raging of the Seas as alter his will.</p>
            <p>Fretting at our Circumſtances ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our Judgment leſs able to Act, and decays our health, a troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may grow clear without, but never with ſtirring in it; yet ſorrow is ſcarce ſupportable alone, therefore they are doubly wretched that have none to eaſe their mind in trouble; and tho other people may be ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous to neglect, or uſe them worſe for what they ſuffer already, if they have made a good choice in placing their friendſhip, they need not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſuch a treatment; tho indeed there is ſo much baſeneſs in this age, that they ought to know them very well in whom they confide.</p>
            <p>Some are incapable of keeping a ſecret, their minds being like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealed letter, it is not prudence to commit any thing of Conſequence to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57479:60"/>
them; theſe are quickly to be found out, and are as certainly diſpiſed; a cunning perſon, is yet more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for they pretend to deſign our intereſts, whilſt they promote their own, tho it be to our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But religious perſons will preſerve their Faith inviolable to their friend, and never diſcloſe what they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, which gains them the eſteem of all that knows it; but if they had nothing paid them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they will not fail to diſcharge a good conſcience, and not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their friends concerns, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a great felicity to be ſerviceable to them (as without all doubt it is a much more ſubſtantial pleaſure to give, then to receive a favour) a compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate temper never ſees another in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, without bearing a part with him; but friendſhip ſhould carry us yet further, and divide the care and grief equally betwixt us.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall you ever find me want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in demonſtrating the truth of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57479:61"/>
what I have ſo often profeſſed; for I did not inſtance theſe maxims as things of courſe; but becauſe many of the rules ſuited with my own thoughts, and I ſhall omit no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to convince you, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtricteſt rules of Friendſhip,</p>
