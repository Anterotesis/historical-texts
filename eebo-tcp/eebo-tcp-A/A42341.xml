            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this Hiſtory, was the better fitted for the Work he undertook, becauſe he was born at <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> and there lived all his days (a few years excepted) whereby he had the advantage of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with many things, about which he writes. Particularly, the <hi>Monuments</hi> in the Church, broken down in the late Sacrilegious times: whoſe Inſcriptions when he was but a Boy (as he himſelf writes in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Henſhaw,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Peterburgh)</hi> he both often read and alſo tranſcribed.</p>
            <p>Theſe he hath preſerved and tranſmitted to Poſterity; as that learned Antiquary Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> hath alſo done: Who in the Year <hi>1641.</hi> fearing what ſhortly followed, was at the pains and charge to take the <hi>Draughts,</hi> as well as the <hi>Inſcriptions,</hi> of the Monuments in ſundry Cathedral Churches of this Realm (which ſoon after were demoliſhed) and of this Church among the reſt. By whoſe kindneſs they would have been communicated to the World, if the <hi>Undertaker</hi> had come to the knowledge of them, before he had received Subſcriptions to his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals: which were not high enough, to bear the charge of them.</p>
            <p>But the beſt Monuments, the Records of the Church, out of which a more compleat Hiſtory might have been gathered, are never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: being torn in pieces, or burnt, by the more than Gothiſh Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe ignorant people; who took upon them the glorious name of <hi>Reformers.</hi> An account of which is given, by a faithful hand, in the concluſion of the <hi>Supplement</hi> to this Work.</p>
            <p>One Book indeed, and but one, ſtill remains, which was happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the fire, by the then Chaunter of the Church, Mr. <hi>Humfry Auſtin.</hi> Who, knowing the great value of it, firſt hid it (in <hi>February 1642.)</hi> under a Seat in the Quire; and when it was found by a Souldier on the <hi>22 April 1643.</hi> (when all the ſeats there were pulled down) reſcued it again, by the offer of ten Shillings for that old Latine Bible, as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it; after which he pretended to enquire. The name of the Bible, by the help of the ten Shillings, preſerved this pretious Treaſure from the Flames, whither it was going: as Mr. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath left upon Record in the beginning of the Book; with a Copy of the Souldiers acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he had given him ſatisfaction for it, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I pray let this Scripture Book alone, for he hath paid me for it, and therefore I would deſire you to let it alone. By me</hi> Henry Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyffe <hi>Souldier under Captain</hi> Cromwell <hi>Colonel</hi> Cromwell<hi>'s Son;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61653:3"/>
               <hi>therefore I pray let it alone.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which goodly Warrant for its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, the Fellow ſubſcribed his name.</p>
            <p>The Book, I ſpeak of, is commonly called by the Name of <hi>SWAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM;</hi> it being vulgarly believed to have been compoſed by <hi>Robert Swapham,</hi> a Monk of this Church of <hi>Peterburgh:</hi> But in truth is for the greateſt and moſt antient part of its Hiſtory, the work of <hi>HUGO,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>CANDIDUS,</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> an eminent Monk alſo of the ſame Church; who himſelf, in the very body of the Book, gives an account both when he lived, and that he was the Author of the Hiſtory, which now all paſſes under the Name of <hi>Swapham.</hi> For ſpeaking of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the Church, the principal of which, was St. <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s right Arm <hi>(ſuper omne aurum pretioſum,</hi> as his words are) he ſaith that he himſelf ſaw it, and kiſſed, and handled it with his own hands, when it was ſhown, intire both in the fleſh and skin, to <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and to the whole Convent with many others, <hi>487</hi> Years after the death of St. <hi>Oſwald.</hi> Now he was ſlain in the year <hi>643,</hi> and therefore this was in the year <hi>1130.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it appears that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is out in his account, when he ſaith (in his Preface to the <hi>Decem Scriptores</hi> fol. XLVI.) that this Hiſtory of our Church, vulgarly thought to be <hi>Robert Swapham</hi>'s, was written in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, or thereabouts. He ſhould have ſaid, that then <hi>Robert Swapham</hi> lived (as I ſhall ſhow by and by he did) but he who wrote the greateſt and beſt part of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, lived in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and his <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> And therefore it might more truly have been ſaid to have been written <hi>in the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the Second, or thereabout:</hi> unleſs his words be reſtrained to that particular part of the Hiſtory, which he hath occaſion to mention, which followed immediately upon the death of <hi>HUGO.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is declared more plainly and fully in another place of the Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> in the life of Abbot <hi>ERNULPHUS:</hi> Where mention is made of two famous Sacriſts of this Church <hi>Victricus</hi> and <hi>Remaldus.</hi> The latter of which is ſaid to have made a Brother of his a Monk, when as yet he was but a child, whoſe name was <hi>Hugo:</hi> who always attended upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldus</hi> and ſerved him, <hi>qui etiam hunc libellum collegit, collectum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſcripſit,</hi> who alſo collected this little Book, and having collected it, put it in writing. And then follows a deſcription of him; that in his childhood he fell into a diſeaſe, which made him very weak. For every Year, and that often, he vomited abundance of blood; and once was brought ſo low, by vomiting fifteen Baſons full in one week, that they utterly deſpaired of his life; gave him extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, and were called out of the Chapterhouſe, by <hi>Nicolaus</hi> then Keeper of the Infirmary, to come and commend his Soul to God, he being upon the point of departure. But <hi>Egelbrithus,</hi> a moſt holy man, perſwading them to go into the Church and beg his life of God (who would not deny them one man, as his words were) they did ſo; and he was miraculouſly reſtored: as there is at large related. And he lived a long time, beloved by all the ſucceeding
<pb facs="tcp:61653:3"/>
Abbots, <hi>John, Henry, Martin, William:</hi> under whom he ſerved the Church, having all the buſineſs of the Monaſtery, both withindoors and without, committed to him: till he came at laſt to the degree of <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prior;</hi> firſt under <hi>Martin,</hi> then under <hi>William de Watervile;</hi> in whoſe time he dyed, <hi>Remaldus</hi> his brother being then Prior.</p>
            <p>I have given the larger account of this man, becauſe he is mentioned in many Authors, as an excellent perſon: being known (as our Hiſtory adds) in the neighbouring Monaſteries; nay famed far and near: and no leſs loved, than praiſed, by all that were acquainted with him. And had the name of <hi>Candidus</hi> or <hi>Albus</hi> in all likelyhood, from his pale Complexion; cauſed by his frequent vomitings of blood: as his Brother <hi>Remaldus,</hi> was called <hi>Spiritualis</hi> (our Book ſaith) becauſe he was a very little Man; and miniſtred with much affection to the Elder Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſt. He is mentioned alſo by thoſe Authors as a noble Writer; and ſaid to have left an accurate Hiſtory of this Church of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> and praiſed by <hi>Leland,</hi> (as Voſſius obſerves <hi>L. 2.</hi> de Hiſtor. Lat. C. <hi>56.)</hi> who calls him <hi>luculentus ſcriptor rerum geſtarum:</hi> and yet it is not agreed when he lived, nor whether his Hiſtory be any where remaining; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few or none, have read this Book called <hi>SWAPHAM</hi> with due care and obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>HUGO</hi> flouriſhed in the later end of the Reign of King <hi>John.</hi> In which, I have ſhown, he was miſtaken. And Mr. <hi>Gunton</hi> himſelf, the Writer of this preſent Hiſtory, makes a queſtion (in the end of <hi>Robert de Lyndſay's</hi> life) whether <hi>Hugo</hi>'s Book be not now loſt; though <hi>Leland,</hi> he obſerves, had ſeen and read it. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me to think he principally relied upon what <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Witleſea</hi> hath written about this Church; and did not think it neceſſary to read all the Book called <hi>Swapham:</hi> for that would have informed him, he was reading the very ſame <hi>HUGO,</hi> whom <hi>Leland</hi> read. Eſpecially if he had compared <hi>Leland</hi>'s <hi>Collections</hi> concerning this Monaſtery, with the Book called <hi>Swapham,</hi> as I have done: whereby he would have found that they are word for word the ſame; only abbreviated by <hi>Leland.</hi> Who ends his <hi>Collectanea</hi> juſt where <hi>Hugo</hi>'s life ended, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>William de Watervile;</hi> and goes not one ſtep further: and therefore might well call them, in the Title of them, <hi>Collectanea ex li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro Hugonis Monarchi Petroburgenſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Book indeed, now called <hi>Swapham,</hi> proceeds further, and carries on the Hiſtory, as far as to <hi>William de Hotot;</hi> the Predeceſſor of <hi>John de Caleto:</hi> In whoſe time, or in <hi>Robert Sutton</hi>'s, not long after, or in the Year <hi>1271</hi> (which was the laſt of <hi>Henry 3.)</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Robert Swapham</hi> dyed. For in that year I find a Deed made by <hi>Henry Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger de Quadering,</hi> unto that Abbot and the Convent: which is ſaid to be done <hi>tempore Rob. de Swapham:</hi> Who was then <hi>Celerarius</hi> of this Church: and made a purchace of <hi>Robert</hi> the Father of that <hi>Henry</hi> for the benefit of the <hi>Celeraria,</hi> of which he had the management.</p>
            <p>Whom I take to have been only a <hi>Continuator</hi> of <hi>Hugo;</hi> and but a little way neither: having wrote no more than the Hiſtory of Seven
<pb facs="tcp:61653:4"/>
Abbots. For it doth not appear that he was the Tranſcriber of all the Records, which are, in no good order, put together at the end of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: unto which both Mr. <hi>Gunton,</hi> and my ſelf have had recourſe, for the perfecting of theſe Labours.</p>
            <p>I have peruſed alſo a MS. Chronicle, which that eminent lover of Learning, Sir <hi>John Cotton,</hi> did me the favour to lend me, out of his renowned Library: written, as the Title bears, <hi>per Johannem Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Burgi Sancti Petri.</hi>

            <p>What <hi>John</hi> this was, is the doubt; there being two of that name who may pretend unto it: <hi>John de Says,</hi> and <hi>John de Caleto.</hi> The firſt of them it cannot be; for <hi>ad An. 975.</hi> this Chronicle referrs the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and to <hi>Henry</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon;</hi> whom he mentions alſo both <hi>ad An. 1135.</hi> and <hi>1153,</hi> where are theſe words <hi>Hic finit Chronica Henrici Huntingdon;</hi> as <hi>ad An. 1153</hi> there are theſe, <hi>his finit Chron. Alredi.</hi> Who all three lived about the ſame time; the firſt of them in <hi>1142,</hi> the ſecond <hi>1158,</hi> the third <hi>1145:</hi> all of them after the death of <hi>John de Says.</hi> And therefore I conclude it was written by <hi>John de Caleto:</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Henry 3.</hi> an hundred Year after them. <hi>Voſſius</hi> indeed makes this <hi>Johannes Burgenſis,</hi> to have lived in the time of <hi>Edward 3.</hi> about <hi>1340:</hi> when there was no Abbot here of that name. But he calls him <hi>Vir eruditus &amp; diſertus;</hi> and ſaith he is commended by <hi>Leland,</hi> as one that had digeſted the Annals of <hi>England</hi> in good order.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe two <hi>Johns</hi> there is no Abbot of that name, but <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Deeping;</hi> who died almoſt an hundred Year after that <hi>1439:</hi> long after this <hi>Chronicon</hi> ends. Which is the more likely to be <hi>John de Caleto</hi>'s; becauſe there is no mention at all made when he died, nor who was his Succeſſor: but only of the time when he was made Abbot. After which the Annals were carried on, in all probability, by another hand: who was better acquainted with the affairs of the Church of <hi>Spalding,</hi> than with thoſe of <hi>Peterburgh.</hi> For he ſaith little of <hi>Peterburgh;</hi> but gives a very large account, from the forementioned period, of all the Priors of <hi>Spalding:</hi> who are ſpoken of, in the preceding Part of the Annals very ſparingly.</p>
            <p>I might have been furniſhed with other Records out of the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; which I ſought after, but could not find till it was too late: that is, till the Supplement to this Hiſtory was grown ſo bigg, that it could bear no further enlargement, without great loſs to the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</hi>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF PETERBURGH.</head>
            <p>WHEN this Realm of <hi>England</hi> was divided into an Heptarchy, the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom being one, and the greateſt of them all, had the County of <hi>Northampton</hi> within its Dominion: the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern part of which County being Mooriſh and Fenny, was anciently inhabited by a People called the <hi>Gyrvii,</hi> of the old Word <hi>Gyr,</hi> which ſignified a Fen; and for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and fertility of this place, for its nearneſs both to the high and upland Countrey, and the Fens, it was thought meet for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
            <p>The Village was at the firſt called by the name of <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> from a deep Pit or Gulf, in the River of <hi>Nen</hi> called <hi>Medeſwell;</hi> which ancient Writers of the place affirm to have been of wonderful depth, and ſo cold in the heat of Summer, that no Swimmer was able to abide the cold thereof; and yet in the Winter it was never known to be frozen: Which Properties are now loſt with the Well it ſelf; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tradition hath preſerved a dark memory thereof, adventuring to ſay, It is a little beneath the Bridge that is now ſtanding. But if this Well be loſt, there is another ſunk with it into the Pit of Oblivion, namely S. <hi>Laurence-Well,</hi> of great fame in ancient days, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Hamm. <hi>Annot. in fol.</hi> 695.</note> whither diſpoſed people, according to the Devotion of thoſe times, reſorted (haply for cure of Diſeaſes): which kind of Devotion was reſtrained by <hi>Oliver Sutton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> In what part <note place="margin">Oliver Sutton <hi>was B. of</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln 1280.</note> of the Monaſtery this Well was, I find not; it is probable it was near the Chappel of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> which was at the Eaſt end of the Infirmary, now demoliſhed, only the Chancel of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61653:8"/>
Chappel is yet remaining, and made the Hall of a dwelling Houſe, belonging to one of the Prebendaries.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Story, <hi>Penda</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> at that time reigned, who had five Children, <hi>Peada, Wulfere,</hi> and <hi>Ethelred,</hi> being his Sons, <hi>Kyneburga,</hi> and <hi>Kyneſwitha,</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Penda</hi> being dead, <hi>Peada</hi> his eldeſt Son ſucceeded, who in the year 656, or as ſome ſay 655, founded the Monaſtery of <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> in the Foundation whereof he laid ſuch Stones as that eight Yoke of Oxen could ſcarce draw one of them. But King <hi>Peada</hi> lived not to finiſh his Work, for his Wife <hi>Alfleda</hi> (forgetting the glorious Memory of her Anceſtors, <hi>Oſwald</hi> the martyred King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> her Grandfather, King <hi>Oſwine</hi> her Father, and King <hi>Alfred</hi> her Brother) betrayed him to Death at the Paſchal Feaſt, when he had reigned four Years: Then did his Crown and Kingdom deſcend upon <hi>Wolfere</hi> his next Brother.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Wolfere</hi> was made a Chriſtian by <hi>Finanus</hi> a Biſhop, who came out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (for that Kingdom had Biſhops then, and long before) and being baptized by <hi>Finanus, Wolfere</hi> vowed to purge his Kingdom from Idolatry, to demoliſh all idolatrous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to the utmoſt of his power to promote Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which Vow he likewiſe made the ſecond time, when he was married to S. <hi>Ermenilda,</hi> daughter of <hi>Egbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malmsbury</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conbert.</hi>
               </note> but within a while, giving too much ear to <hi>Werbode</hi> his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, he neglected his Vow, taking no care of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <note place="margin">The life of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menild</hi> is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent M S. of <hi>Ely</hi> now in the hand of <hi>Geo.

               </note> nor of erecting Temples, but committed many Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, ſo that the Chaos of Heatheniſm began to overſpread all again. He had by his Wife S. <hi>Ermenilda</hi> two Sons, the elder <hi>Wulfade,</hi> the other <hi>Rufine; Wulfade</hi> was much addicted to Hunting, and one day purſuing a goodly Hart, which being hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, took Soil in a Fountain near unto the Cell of S. <hi>Chad,</hi> who eſpying the Hart weary, and almoſt ſpent, was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate towards him, that he covered him with Boughs and Leaves, conjecturing, as if Heaven had ſome deſign in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and deportment of that Beaſt. Preſently comes Prince <hi>Wulfade,</hi> and enquired of S. <hi>Chad</hi> concerning the Hart, who anſwered, That he was not a Keeper of Beaſts, but of the Souls of Men, and that <hi>Wulfade</hi> was then, as an Hart to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Brooks, ſent by God to the Fountain of Living Water; which <hi>Wulfade</hi> hearing with aſtoniſhment, entred into further conference with S. <hi>Chad</hi> in his Cell, and was by him baptized; And returning with joy to his Father's Court, he ſecretly told his Brother <hi>Rufine</hi> of all that had paſſed, perſwading him to be baptized alſo; to which <hi>Rufine</hi> conſenting, <hi>Wulfade</hi> brought him to S. <hi>Chad,</hi> who likewiſe baptized this other Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61653:8"/>
This Chriſtian pair of Brothers did often reſort to a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, where they performed their Devotions; but at length being diſcovered to their Father by the Steward <hi>Werbode,</hi> who inſtigated, and inflamed the fire of paternal fury againſt the Sons, King <hi>Wolfere</hi> the Father, watching the time when his Sons were gone to pray, followed them, and entering the Oratory, ſlew both his Sons with his own hand; and he, and <hi>Werbode</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the place, left the bodies of his Sons buried in the rubbiſh. Shortly after this unnatural and bloudy act, <hi>Werbode</hi> the Steward was ſtrangled by the Devil before the Kings houſe, and King <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere</hi> being deeply wounded in conſcience, (the diſtraction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deprived him of all reſt and quietneſs, what through the worm tormenting him within, and S. <hi>Ermenild</hi> his Wife without counſelling him thereto) repaired to S. <hi>Chad,</hi> to whom he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his great offence, and profeſſed an hearty contrition for the ſame, which he was reſolved to expiate with what ever Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance S. <hi>Chad</hi> ſhould impoſe upon him, which was no more, but to reſtore the Chriſtian Religion, and the ruinated Temples thereof, and likewiſe to found new ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Wittleſey</hi> an ancient Monk of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> writing this Story, relates what I will not preſs upon the Readers faith, That S. <hi>Chad,</hi> having prayed with King <hi>Wolfere</hi> in his Oratory, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being ended, S. <hi>Chad</hi> put off his Veſtment, and hanged it upon a Sun-beam, which ſupported it, that it fell not to the ground; which King <hi>Wolfere</hi> ſeeing, put off his Gloves, and Belt, and aſſayed to hang them there alſo, but they preſently fell to the ground, whereat King <hi>Wolfere</hi> was the more confirmed in the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>In the Weſtern Cloyſter of the Church of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> (as ſhall hereafter be more largely related) was the ſtory of this King <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere</hi> curiouſly painted in the Windows, and in the midſt of the quadrangle of the whole Cloyſter, commonly called <hi>The Laurel Yard,</hi> was there a Well, which common Tradition would have to be that wherein S. <hi>Chad</hi> concealed Prince <hi>Wulfades</hi> heart: And if it ſhall be conſidered, that King <hi>Wolfere</hi> the Father did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Speed</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>

                  <hi>Beda</hi> Hiſt. <hi>Angl.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 3.</note> he founded the Cathedral Church, and there lieth buried: And Queen <hi>Ermenild,</hi> having ſearched for the bodies of her Sons, found them out, and giving them burial, built in the ſame place where they were ſlain, a Church of Stone, and called the place <hi>Stanes</hi> or <hi>Stones,</hi> which is known by this name in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> unto this day. There alſo King <hi>Wolfere</hi> founded a Colledge of Regular Canons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61653:9"/>
And now the building of the Monaſtery of <hi>Medeſhamſted</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by King <hi>Peada,</hi> went on a-main through the zealous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of King <hi>Wolfere;</hi> his Brother <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and his Siſters <hi>Kyneburga,</hi> and <hi>Kyneſwitha</hi> aſſiſting him therein, until the ſame was perfected, which he dedicated to the memory of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> beſtowed many large priviledges and immunities upon it, gave many fair poſſeſſions, and eſtabliſhed the bounds of its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction <note place="margin">Vid. Char. in App.</note> from <hi>Croyland</hi> on the Eaſt, to <hi>Walmisford</hi> Bridge on the Weſt, and ſo Northward to <hi>Eſton</hi> and <hi>Stamford,</hi> and all along by the River of <hi>Wiland</hi> to <hi>Croyland</hi> again, as is more at large ſet down in his Charter which he Sealed and Confirmed in the preſence of Kings, Nobles, and Biſhops, in the Year of our Lord 664. and the ſeventh of his Reign.</p>
            <p>The Quarry from whence King <hi>Wolfere</hi> fetched Stone for this Royal Structure, was undoubtedly that of <hi>Bernack</hi> near unto <hi>Stamford,</hi> where the Pitts from their hollow vacuities ſpeak Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and contribution to ſome ſuch great deſign; and I find in the Charter of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, <hi>Anno——</hi>which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Abby of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> that the Abbot of <hi>Ramſey</hi> ſhould give to the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> 4000 Eeles in the time of Lent, and in conſideration thereof, the Abbot of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> ſhould give to the Abbot of <hi>Ramſey</hi> as much Free-ſtone from his Pitts in <hi>Bernack,</hi> and as much Rag-ſtone from his Pitts in <hi>Peterburgh</hi> as he ſhould need. Nor did the Abbot of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> from theſe Pitts furniſh only that, but other Abbies alſo, as that of S. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds-Bury:</hi> In memory whereof, there are two long ſtones yet ſtanding upon a balk in <hi>Caſtor-field</hi> near unto <hi>Gunwade-Ferry;</hi> which erroneous tradition hath given out to be two draughts of Arrows from <hi>Alwalton</hi> Church-yard thither; the one of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> and the other of <hi>Little John;</hi> but the truth is, they were ſet up for witneſſes, that the carriages of Stone from <hi>Bernack</hi> to <hi>Gunwade-Ferry,</hi> to be conveyed to S. <hi>Edmunds-Bury,</hi> might paſs that way without paying Toll: And in ſome old Terrars they are called S. <hi>Edmunds</hi> Stones. Theſe Stones are nicked in their tops after the manner of Arrows, probably enough in memory of S. <hi>Edmund</hi> who was ſhot to death with arrows by the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Wolfere</hi> dying without iſſue, his Brother <hi>Etheldred</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and continued his good affection to the Monaſtery of <note place="margin">

               <hi>Medeſhamſted;</hi> the Royal Founder whereof built alſo an houſe for the Abbot, which upon the diſſolution by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Biſhops-Palace: A building very large and ſtately, as this preſent age can teſtifie; all the rooms of common habitation being built above ſtairs, and underneath were very fair Vaults and goodly Cellars for ſeveral uſes. The great Hall, a magnificent room, had, at the upper end, in the Wall, very high above the ground, three ſtately Thrones, wherein were placed ſitting, the three Royal Founders carved curiouſly of Wood, painted and gilt,

               </p>
               <p>In his time, the glory of the Monaſtery of <hi>Medeſhamſted</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great Eclipſe, through the invaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> deſtroying all before them with fire, and ſword.

                     <hi>Britanuus</hi> a Monk of this Abby, having eſcaped the ſlaughter, wrote lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery in Verſe, An. 807. <hi>Pitfeus.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>On the fourth day after, the <hi>Danes</hi> departed with a great boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of goods and cattel towards <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> where they found many of the Country people retired within the Monaſtery, who with the Monks ſtood upon their guard: The <hi>Danes</hi> making ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſaults, <hi>Tulba</hi> brother of Earl <hi>Hulba,</hi> was by the defendants, mortally bruiſed on the head, with a ſtone caſt from that Tower which he aſſaulted; whereat <hi>Hulba</hi> was ſo enraged, that having entred the Monaſtery, he ſlew all the Monks with his own hand, <note place="margin">Our <hi>Peterburgh</hi> writers call them <hi>Hubba</hi> and <hi>Lubba.</hi>
                  </note> the reſt of the people were ſlaughtered by the Soldiers. The aged Abbot <hi>Hedda</hi> eſcaped not the hands of <hi>Hulba,</hi> but was ſlain with his Monks. Then were the Altars broken down, Monuments demoliſhed, a goodly Library ſet on fire, Charters, Evidences, and Writings (to a great number) all torne in pieces: The Church it ſelf, with all the appendent buildings, was ſet on fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for fifteen days together. The <hi>Danes</hi> (as I find in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuator of <hi>Ingulphus)</hi> with the riches of the Monaſtery, and the cattle of the Country, departing on the fourth day, there were two Earls among them, both called by one name <hi>Sidroc,</hi> the one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61653:11"/>
the elder, the other the younger, who marched in the reer of this devouring multitude, to guard them in their paſſage over ſtreams and rivers; And when the multitude had paſſed over the River <hi>Nen,</hi> theſe two <hi>Sidrocs</hi> being to paſs over with their booty, two Waines, laden with their choiceſt riches, were overthrown, and together with their horſes ſunk into a deep pit, a little beneath the Bridge (which haply was the <hi>Medeſwell</hi> before mentioned.) Now to <hi>Ingulphus</hi> again who proceeds in his own ſtory, That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Monks of <hi>Croyland,</hi> who had ſecured themſelves by flight into the Fens, the <hi>Danes</hi> being gone, they returned to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, cleanſed it from aſhes, and other pollutions as they could, and conſulted to chuſe another Abbot, which they did; <hi>Godricus</hi> a reverend and religious man being he upon whom the election paſſed; to whom there came <hi>Toretus</hi> Prior of <hi>Ancarig,</hi> with his ſub-prior <hi>Tiſa,</hi> deſiring <hi>Godricus</hi> that he would take ſome bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with him, and go over to <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> to give Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an burial to the bodies of thoſe Monks which were there expoſed to beaſts, and birds: <hi>Godricus</hi> embracing the motion, took ſome of his Monks with him, amongſt the reſt, one <hi>Turgarus</hi> of twelve years of age, who being by the younger <hi>Sidroc</hi> ſaved, was by him taken to <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Danes</hi> buſie in getting their carriages out of the River <hi>Nen,</hi> he ſtole away from them, and returned to his Monaſtery of <hi>Croyland.</hi> Abbot <hi>Godricus</hi> coming to <hi>Medeſhamſted,</hi> with much toil and pains, gathered together the bodies of the ſlaughtered Monks, to the number of 84. and laid them all in one large grave, in the middle of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard by the Eaſt front of the Monaſtery, upon the Feaſt of S. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia, (November</hi> 22.) ſetting up over the body of the Abbot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the midſt of his ſons, a pyramidal ſtone, three foot in heighth, three in length, and one in thickneſs, engraven with the <note place="margin">So <hi>Ingulphus</hi> calls it.</note> pictures of the Abbot, and his Monks about him; which ſtone, in memory of the deſtroyed Monaſtery, he named <hi>Medeſhamſted;</hi> and every year after ſo long as he lived, he viſited that place, pitching his Tent over the ſaid ſtone, ſaying Maſs two ſeveral days, for the ſouls of Abbot <hi>Hedda,</hi> and his Monks. The high way then into <hi>Holland,</hi> was through the ſame Church-yard, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that monumental ſtone on the right hand, and a croſs of ſtone over againſt it, erected alſo by Abbot <hi>Godricus,</hi> on the left, that paſſers by, in memory of the ruined Monaſtery, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pray for the ſouls of thoſe there buried; and abſtain from ſacrilegious rapines, and demolitions of that place, for his ſake who was crucified. Thus far <hi>Ingulphus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Croſs is long ſince demoliſhed, and the place where it ſtood, not known, but the ſtone is ſtill remaining, agreeable to <hi>Ingulphus</hi> his deſcription; which, as it was at firſt, called by the name of the place, <hi>Medeſhamſted;</hi> ſo it is now amongſt ſome, known by the name of <hi>Peterburgh:</hi> and there being certain little

holes in the ſides of the ſtone, it was lately a merry cuſtom for ſtrangers, to put their fingers into one of thoſe holes, that they might ſay, they had been at <hi>Peterburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was within theſe few years a door in the Church having the Picture of Abbot <hi>Hedda,</hi> and the King or Captain of the <hi>Danes,</hi> as it were expoſtulating the buſineſs, and underneath were theſe four Verſes written in ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Letters, as if they had been ſpoken by the Abbot:

                     <hi>Ingulphus</hi> fol. 494.</note> lay buried in its own ruines the ſpace of ninety and ſix years, no Abbot, Monk, Government, or Religion there profeſſed in all that time, that is to be found in ſtory; only King <hi>Beorredus</hi> ſeized the Lands of the Monaſtery, giving them to his Souldiers, until <hi>Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woldus,</hi> or <hi>Athelwoldus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (a man very zealous in the building and reſtoring of Churches) laid his hand to the reſtauration of it; for as Writers ſay, he was warned of God in the night, that he ſhould go to the midland <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and repair the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo that taking his journey into theſe parts, he came to <hi>Oundle,</hi> ſuppoſing that to be the place, but being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecond time that he ſhould follow the courſe of the River; he came at length to <hi>Medeſhamsted,</hi> which he found deſolate and forſaken, but preſently with ſuch help as he could get, he fell to cleanſing of it. But ſeeing what a great buſineſs this reſtauration was like to prove, he returned to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to make preparation for ſo great a deſign. And firſt he made his addreſs to God by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers, to encline the hearts of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and his Queen and Nobles, that he might have them ſo propitious, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their aſſiſtances to this work. And being one time at his prayers, the Queen had ſecretly gotten behind the door, to liſten what it was that <hi>Athelwold</hi> prayed, and ſuddenly ſhe came forth upon him, telling him, that God and her ſelf had heard his prayers, and from thenceforth ſhe began to ſolicite the King for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Monaſtery, to which the King aſſenting, applied himſelf thereunto, until he had finiſhed the ſame; which was in the year 970.</p>
               <p>The Monaſtery thus re-edified, King <hi>Edgar</hi> deſirous to ſee it, went thither, with <hi>Dunſtane</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Oſwald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> attended alſo with moſt of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who all approved, and applauded both the place, and work. But when King <hi>Edgar</hi> heard that ſome Charters, and Writings, which ſome Monks had ſecured from the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61653:12"/>
fury of the <hi>Danes</hi> were found; he deſired to ſee them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read the priviledges of this place, that he had a ſecond <hi>Rome</hi> within his own Kingdom, he wept for joy: And in the preſence of that Aſſembly, he confirmed their former priviledges and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the King, Nobles, and Clergy, offering large oblations, ſome of lands, ſome of gold, and ſilver. At this glorious aſſembly the name of the place was changed from <hi>Medeſhamſted</hi> to <hi>Burgh,</hi> and by reaſon of the fair building, pleaſant ſituation, large priviledges, rich poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, plenty of gold, and ſilver, which this Monaſtery was endowed withal, there was an addition to the name, as to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gildenburgh,</hi> though in reference to the dedication, it hath ever ſince been known by the name of <hi>Peterburgh. Malmsbury</hi> would have the nomination of the place <hi>Burgh</hi> to be from Abbot <note place="margin">

               <p>He being Chancellor to King <hi>Edgar,</hi> changed his Court life for a Monaſtical in this place; the reaſon of which change, was this: He had one only Son, whom he and his Wife dearly loved, and they uſed to have him lie in bed betwixt them, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents having over night drunk more wine than was convenient, their Son betwixt them was ſmothered to death. <hi>Adulphus</hi> the father being ſadly affected with this horrid miſchance, was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to viſit S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> after the manner of a penitentiary for abſolution, imparting his intent to Biſhop <hi>Athelwoldus,</hi> who diſſwaded him from it, telling him it would be better if he would labour in the reſtauration of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in this place, and here viſit him: <hi>Adulphus</hi> approving this advice, came with King <hi>Edgar</hi> to <hi>Burgh,</hi> where in the preſence of the King, and the reſt of that Convention, he offered all his wealth, put off his Courtly Robes, and put on the habit of a Monk, and aſcended to the degree of Abbot in the year 972.</p>

               <p>The Writers of <hi>Peterburgh, Swapham,</hi> and <hi>Wittleſey</hi> ſay, That in the time of Abbot <hi>Leofricus</hi> his ſickneſs, this <hi>Egelricus</hi> being at his accuſtomed Evening devotions, the Devil appeared to him, in the ſhape of a boy of terrible countenance, and told him, that ere long he ſhould triumph over the chiefeſt of them (which perhaps was in the death of <hi>Leofricus</hi> Abbot) and that three ſeveral times he would revenge himſelf upon the Monks, and Monaſtery, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him alſo the manner.

And now had <hi>Adelwoldus</hi> the Prior, with the other Monks, a time of returning without ſtealth to his Monaſtery of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> and taking the Abby of <hi>Ramſey</hi> in their way; the <hi>Ramiſians</hi> entertained them kindly for awhile, but at their departure, they detained their Reliques, which afterwards upon the threats of Abbot <hi>Thorold,</hi> they yielded up; yet did not the Monks enjoy their newly recovered Treaſures long, for they being careleſs and drunken, and their Abbot abſent, a fire ſeized upon the Church, and other remaining buildings, from which they reſcued ſome few Reliques, but little of other things. All this while <hi>Turoldus</hi> Abbot abſented himſelf from his Monaſtery, and made his abode at <hi>Stamford,</hi> but <hi>Herewardus</hi> being withdrawn he returned to his Monaſtery, where he found all things in a deſolate condition. He brought along with him 140 <hi>Normans</hi> well armed to ſecure him againſt <hi>Herewardus,</hi> and alſo built a Fort or Caſtle within his Monaſtery, which for many years retained the name of Mount <hi>Thorold:</hi> ſo that now the Monaſtery of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> ſeemed rather a warlike than religious place. Yet for all that <hi>Turoldus</hi> could do for his own ſecurity, he was at length ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Herewardus,</hi> and conſtrained to ranſome himſelf with the payment of thirty marks in ſilver. So profuſe was this <hi>Turoldus</hi> of the goods of his Monaſtery, that at his entrance an eſtimate of the goods thereof amounting to fifteen hundred pounds, ere <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roldus</hi> had done, there remained ſcarce five hundred.</p>
               <p>But his diſpoſing of the Lands (as hath been ſaid) to certain Knights, for their ſervice in theſe Military times, was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and valid in after ages; where I could give a large declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons thus inveſted with the Church-Lands, and what Lands thoſe were, but it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that there were in all forty one men of note, who received thoſe Lands from <hi>Turoldus</hi> to hold upon that condition: but they did not all receive in equal proportion, but ſome more, and ſome leſs; ſome to find and afford the ſervice of ſix Knights, ſome of four, ſome of one,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61653:16"/>
and ſome leſs, as their portions of Land were; yet in all, the number of Knights for which they were to be anſwerable, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſixty eight, and from whence there began a new addition to be annexed unto the name of the place, as to be called, The Honour of <hi>Peterburgh.</hi> But there happened another Act of <hi>Turoldus,</hi> which raiſed his diſcontents higher in himſelf, and brought him lower in the good affection of his Convent, for he received into his Monaſtery two Monks from beyond Sea, who ſecretly ſtole away, and carried many of the Church Goods with them. At length <hi>Turoldus,</hi> weary of his Government here, procured for himſelf the Biſhoprick of <hi>Beavois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whither he tranſported many of the goods of the Monaſtery: but he was not ſo welcome to his new Biſhoprick as to make any long continuance there, for on the fourth day he was expelled thence, and returning again into <hi>England,</hi> he gave the King a great ſumm of Money that he might be ſeated again in his Monaſtery of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> whither he returned, and in all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Government there the ſpace of 28 years, and died <hi>Anno</hi> 1100, or as ſome ſay 1098. being the 10, or 11 year of <hi>William</hi> the Second.</p>

of his Abby Lands, ſome by ſuits in Law, and ſome by force; for, as if he were <hi>Tam Marti quam Mercurio,</hi> as well for the Sword, as the Book; he went ſometimes in perſon armed upon ſuch adventures. His actions at home towards his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, were great, and many: It ſeems the Nave, or body of the Church did not pleaſe him, therefore he built it after a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the Lantern to the Porch as now it is, ſo that the painted Ceiling at the top, which is ſtill remaining, was probably of his doing. He ſet up alſo the Pulpit in the body of the Church, which was but lately taken away. He finiſhed the Chappel of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> which his Predeceſſor had begun. He built a large and goodly Houſe of ſtone for ſeveral Offices which was ſtanding in our age. He built the great gate leading to the Monaſtery, and over it the Chappel of S. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> both which are yet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was much in the Kings favour, that the King, King <hi>Richard,</hi> for his piety, gravity and wiſdom, was wont to call him Father: And when King <hi>Richard,</hi> in his return from the Holy Land, was taken priſoner by Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who detained him, this Abbot <hi>Benedict</hi> (being, in the Kings abſence, made Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor, and Councellor with <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Chancellor of the Realm) Councelled that the Chalices of the Church ſhould be ſold to pay the Kings ranſome, which was done, and the King returned home. Then did King <hi>Richard</hi> confirm to Abbot <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict,</hi> and his Monaſtery the Marſh of <hi>Pekirk,</hi> now commonly called <hi>North-Fenne,</hi> about which there fell out ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Radulphus le Wake,</hi> and the Monaſtery; for <hi>Radulphus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of <hi>Deeping,</hi> claimed Common in the Marſh, as being but on the other ſide of the River, but Abbot <hi>Benedict</hi> impounded his Cattel, alledging that the Marſh belonged only to his Tenants of <hi>Pekirk, Glinton, Makeſhye,</hi> and <hi>Northburgh,</hi> and deſired <hi>Radul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> to enquire into the truth thereof: So <hi>Radulphus</hi> came to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburgh</hi> with ſome others, where being fully informed of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots right, he forbare to treſpaſs any more; <hi>Benedict</hi> alſo reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Marſh of <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Hermitage</hi> of <hi>Singleſholt.</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> alſo granted unto <hi>Benedict</hi> his confirmation of the eight Hundreds, as his predeceſſors had done: And withal his Charter for the holding of a Fair in <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> upon the Feaſt of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>

The ſecond journey was being Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, not to, but towards <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was ſummoned to be at a Council there with the reſt of the Engliſh Clergy (which Council was held there <hi>Anno</hi> 1234. under Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. ſaith <hi>Franciſcus Longus,</hi> though <hi>Gabriel Pratiolus</hi> will have <hi>Innocent</hi> 4. to be then Pope, and <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. to be ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) But <hi>Walter</hi> being on the way thither as far as <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and hearing that the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> had impriſoned <hi>Otto,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legate, with many others, he durſt not proceed on his journey, but ſtaid in the City of <hi>Anvers</hi> 6 months, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to the Monaſtery of <hi>Peterburgh.</hi> But his retreat was ſo ill taken, that preſently the Pope ſends a Mandate to him for the finding of five men, with Horſes and Arms, which at length he took off at the charge of 174 Marks, by the diſpenſation of <hi>Martin</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio.</hi> The third journey to <hi>Rome</hi> was after the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> for thither alſo was he ſummoned, and appeared there, but rather as an offender, than an Aſſeſſor; for he was called to anſwer his contempt, in giving the Church of <hi>Caſtre</hi> according to the Kings order, and againſt the Popes, yet did he regain the Popes favour by obliging himſelf to give to a Nephew of the Popes ten pounds a year. Our Writers of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> ſay no more, but <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> is more copious in <note place="margin">Page 554.</note> the ſtory, or another like it. In the year (ſaith he) 1241. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> deſirous to promote ſome of his Favourites, ſends his Letters into <hi>England</hi> to caſt the burthen of that care upon ſome Churches. There was then ſent to the Abbot, and Convent of <hi>Burgh,</hi> an Apoſtolick Mandate, fraught with intreaties, and threatnings, that they would conferr the Rent of any Church under their patronage, which ſhould yearly be worth one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Marks, and if it were double the value, it would pleaſe him the more: and the Pope would again demiſe unto the Church the ſame Living for the yearly rent of one hundred Marks, and the ſurpluſage ſhould redound to the proper uſe of the Church.

And that the Abbot and Convent might conſent to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion (or rather pernicious compact, Simony and ſecret Fraud) demanded by the Pope, the Pope wrote Letters to certain Foreign Monks then well Beneficed in <hi>England,</hi> that they ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually admoniſh the Abbot and Convent therein, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them, if need were. Theſe Monks coming to <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> called the Monks together, and beſpake them after this manner, Behold, Friends and Brethren, a great Pontifical kindneſs is offered to your hand, for the Pope requires that of you, which, with bended knees, and joyned hands, ye ought to requeſt of him: And when they had explained the buſineſs, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to accompliſh the buſineſs on the Popes part, ſo that the buſineſs might be ſecretly carried without ſcandal. But the Monks of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> anſwered, that they could do nothing without the Kings permiſſion, who was their Patron, and Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Popes Meſſengers inſiſted, that the buſineſs might be done privately, hoping alſo that other Churches would follow their example, and do the like. The Monks of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> would not be circumvented by their Speeches, but deſired reſpite of the buſineſs until their Abbot came home (being then abſent) that they might have his aſſent: In the mean time they ſent to their Abbot, acquainting him with the whole buſineſs: The Abbot ſends a meſſenger to the King, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the danger of ſuch a donation. The King reſenting the buſineſs, and how it would redound to the damage of that and other Churches whereof he was Patron, and Defender, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the ſecret ſnares, and covetouſneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, ſtrictly forbade ſuch an horrid donation.

               <p>Was a Monk, and the <hi>Celerarius</hi> of this Monaſtery, and upon the death of <hi>William</hi> elected Abbot, <hi>Anno</hi> 1299. which was the 27 of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. It ſeems this <hi>Godfrey</hi> was much in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> favour, for at his entrance into his Abbatical government, the King ſent him a fair ſilver Cup, gilt: And when the Treaſurer <hi>Walter de Langton</hi> demanded of <hi>Godfrey</hi> a thouſand Marks for his Confirmation, the King remitted it, and would not ſuffer any more than his Exchequer fees to be taken. In the firſt year it hapned that certain perſons were fled for ſanctuary into the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> whither they were purſued, and, againſt the priviledge of the place, haled out from thence, and ſome bloud was ſhed, ſo that the Chappel for ſome time ſtood ſuſpended, and no ſervice therein to be performed: The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> paſſing that cenſure upon it, until the perſons ſo taken away ſhould again be reſtored to the liberty of the place. At length the Biſhop ſends his abſolution, appointing that the Abbot, and ſome others with him ſhould with the ſprinkling of holy water, and ſinging of the Penitential Pſalms purge the ſaid Chappel, and ſo it ſhould return to its former uſe.</p>

               <p>I find this Abbot <hi>Godfrey</hi> famous for worthy actions, that there was ſcarce his like, either before him, or after. In his third year, ſaith <hi>Wittleſey</hi> (who recounts the actions of every year, but I ſhall name only the principal) he entertained King <hi>Edward</hi> with his Queen, and their ſeveral retinues.

Prince's acceptance of his Robe alſo: whereupon <hi>Peter</hi> ſends to the Prince and bids the Meſſenger ſay, <hi>Volo,</hi> I will that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Abbots gift; which was done accordingly, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot had thanks returned to him.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61653:35"/>
to ſinging and dancing in the Dormitory till 10 or 11 a Clock at Night to the trouble of the reſt.

This <hi>Robert Kirton</hi> had great contention with his Tenants in <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> about Paſturage, in the Fenn called <hi>Burgh,</hi> a little Fenn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the Monaſtery; which, as the Inhabitants alledged, the Abbot had overcharged with 1500 Sheep in two flocks: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining alſo to the King, then <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that he had ſuffered thirty Tenements in the ſtreet called <hi>Boongate-ſtreet</hi> to fall to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and then emparked the ſame ground, and made it a place <note place="margin">The Park.</note> for his own Deer.

He built a Chamber in his dwelling Houſe, calling it Heaven-gate-Chamber, which is extant, and retaineth its name to this day. <note place="margin">Heaven-gate Chamber.</note> He made in his great Hall that goodly Bow window overlooking the Cloyſter, the memory whereof is freſh to this preſent age. He ſet up in the Church the <hi>Crucifixerium</hi> or Rood-loft, now ſtanding at the entrance into the Quire, though placed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lower than it was at its firſt erection. He ſet up the Gate leading to the Deanry which is yet ſtanding, and retaineth the memory of the Builder, in his Hieroglyphick of a Croſier, with the letter R, and a Church or Kirk placed upon a Tun; which muſt be conſtrued with the alluſion thus, Abbot <hi>Robert Kirk-Tun,</hi> and ſo <hi>Kirton.</hi> He beautified the Chappel of S. <hi>Mary,</hi> or The Ladies Chappel with pictures, and gilded work, much of which was lately extant.

               <p>Was born in <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> but what he was, or upon what ſcore made Abbot, Records are wanting to inform us: His advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Abbatical Chair was <hi>Anno</hi> 1528. which might be the 19 or 20. of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. In his firſt year, Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> came to <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> where he kept his <hi>Eaſter,</hi> upon Palm-Sunday he carried his Palm, going with the Monks in proceſſion, and the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following he kept his Maundy, waſhing, and kiſſing the feet of fifty nine poor people, and having dried them, he gave to every one of them <hi>12d.</hi> and three Ells of Canvaſs for a ſhirt, he gave alſo to each of them a pair of ſhoes, and a portion of red herrings. On Eaſter-day he went in proceſſion in his Cardinals Veſtments, and ſang the High-Maſs himſelf after a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which he concluded with his benediction and remiſſion, upon all the hearers.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh year of this <hi>John, Katherine</hi> the firſt wife of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and Mother of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> died at <hi>Kimbolton</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the County of <hi>Huntingdon, Jan.</hi> 8. 1535. and was buried in this Church, betwixt two pillars on the Northſide of the Quire, near to the great Altar, her Hearſe being covered with a black Velvet Pall, croſſed with white Cloth of ſilver, which how it came to degenerate into one of meaner value is unknown to us, yet this changeling was alſo taken away <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. with her <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Scutcheons affixed thereunto.</p>
               <p>Some write, that for her ſake the Church of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> fared <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 18.</note> the better at the diſſolution of Abbys, and was turned into a Cathedral, as if King <hi>Hen.</hi> (like King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who favoured the grave of the Prophet) ſhould favour his Wifes grave in this place. Be it ſo, or no, the goodly ſtructure of the place, convenient ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation for a new erection, with accommodations thereunto, might make a fair plea for a reprieve from the ſtroke of that Ax which cut others down.</p>
               <p>I have not as yet ſeen any Record ſhowing how <hi>John Chambers</hi> demeaned himſelf towards King <hi>Henry,</hi> or complied with him in that great diſſolution of Abbys, that the King ſhould continue him in his place, and not put him to death, as he did ſome, or depoſe him, as he did others: But probable it is, that Abbot <hi>John</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61653:36"/>
to ſleep in a whole skin, and deſired to die in his neſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had lived ſo long, and perhaps might uſe ſuch means, as might preſerve (if not his means to his Church, yet) his Church to poſterity.</p>
               <p>And now, that we are come to thoſe times, wherein that great alteration in the Church, and alienation of her Revenues, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for our more orderly proceeding in the declaration thereof, we ſhall firſt preſent the Reader with an Inventory of the Church-Utenſils, and of the Abbots domeſtick goods, and then take him abroad to view the Mannors, and Lands, that he may underſtand what was taken from, and what continued to, the Church of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburgh.</hi>

               <p>Who was Maſter of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and made Biſhop here <hi>March</hi> 16. 1584. being the 27 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> We have not much to ſay of him, his parts, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but ſhall enlarge this Paragraph of his being Biſhop here, with the ſtory of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotts</hi> her death at <hi>Fotheringhay</hi> Caſtle, and burial in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Peterburgh.</hi> The whole progreſs of her life and actions, from her firſt arrival in <hi>England, May</hi> 16. 1568. to her coming to <hi>Fotheringhay,</hi> with her ſeveral places of removal, and ſeveral keepers, is ſo largely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Mr. <hi>

               <p>Upon the ſeventh day of <hi>February,</hi> 1586. (eighteen years from her firſt arrival) The Commiſſioners for her execution came to <hi>Fotheringhay,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Kent,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Thomas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was <hi>George Talbot,</hi> and E. Marſhal of <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was <hi>Henry Grey.</hi>

                  <hi>Andrews</hi> of——Sheriff of <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> for that year. By theſe the Queen of <hi>Scotts</hi> underſtanding that the Leaſe of her life was not long to laſt, only one day longer, ſhe ſeemed not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with the Meſſage, but told the Commiſſioners, ſhe did not think that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would have conſented to her death; but ſince it was ſo, ſhe would moſt gladly embrace it, and in order thereunto, deſired of the Commiſſioners the benefit of her Clergy, that her Confeſſor might come to her, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners denying, propounded the Biſhop, or Dean of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> which the Queen of <hi>Scotts</hi> refuſed. The Commiſſioners being departed, ſhe gave order for her Supper, at the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe drank to her ſervants, and comforted them, becauſe ſhe ſaw them much troubled for her. After Supper ſhe peruſed her Will, and Inventory: At her uſual hour ſhe went to Bed, ſlept ſome part of the night, and ſpent the reſt in Prayer. Her fatal day being come, ſhe aroſe to prepare her ſelf for her laſt lying down, when calling her ſervants together, ſhe read over her Will

to them, letting them know what Legacies ſhe had bequeathed. Then did ſhe apparel her ſelf after this manner, In borrowed hair, a Bourn, having on her head a dreſſing of Lawn edged with bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and above that, a vail of the ſame, bowed out with wire, and her Cuffs ſuitable: about her neck a Pomander chain, and an <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei</hi> hanging at a black Ribband, a Crucifix in her hand, a pair of Beads at her girdle with a golden Croſs at the end. Her uppermoſt gown was of black Satin, printed, training upon the ground, with long hanging ſleeves, trimmed with Akorn buttons of Jet, and Pearl, the ſleeves over her arms being cut, to give ſight to a pair of purple Velvet underneath; her Kirtle, as her Gown, was of black printed Satin: her Boddies of Crimſon Satin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced in the back, the skirt being of Crimſon Velvet: her Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins of Worſted, watchet, clocked and edged at the top with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and under them a pair of white: Her Shoes of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the rough ſide outward.</p>
               <p>Thus attired ſhe came forth of her Chamber to the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, who were ready in the paſſage to receive her, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her to the Stage whereon ſhe was to act the laſt ſcene of her life, making as yet no ſhow of ſadneſs, until <hi>Melvin</hi> her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant preſenting himſelf on his knees, bewailing not only hers, but alſo his own misfortune, that he was to be a ſad reporter to <hi>Scotland</hi> of her death: then with ſome flux of tears ſhe comforted him, that he ſhould ſhortly ſee the troubles of <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> have an end; ſending by him her commands to her Son, and bidding him tell him, that ſhe had done nothing prejudicial to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then addreſſing her ſelf to the Commiſſioners, ſhe told them that ſhe had certain requeſts to make to them, <hi>viz.</hi> that a certain ſumm of money might be paid to one <hi>Curle</hi> her ſervant, which Sir <hi>Amyas Pawlet</hi> had knowledge of. That her ſervants might enjoy ſuch Legacies, as, by her Will ſhe had bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed unto them. That they might be fairly uſed, and ſafely ſent into their own Country: To the firſt Sir <hi>Aymas Pawlet</hi> gave his teſtimony, and promiſe: The reſt were alſo promiſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Yet ſaid the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> I have one requeſt more to make, that you would ſuffer my ſervants to be about me at my death, to which the Commiſſioners returned a refuſal, the Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> ſaying, that their preſence would be a diſturbance to her, and beſides he feared there would be ſome ſuperſtition practiſed in preſſing to dip their handkerchiefs in her bloud. My Lord, ſaid the Queen, I will paſs my word they ſhall do no ſuch things, Alas poor ſouls, it will do them good to bid their Miſtreſs farwell: Your Miſtriſs (meaning Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> being a Maiden Queen, for womanhoods ſake would not deny me this courteſie, and I know ſhe hath not ſo ſtraitned your Commiſſion, but that you might grant me more than this, if I were of a far meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Whereupon the Commiſſioners conſulted, and granted her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61653:44"/>
the nomination of ſix perſons to be with her: ſo ſhe nominated four men, <hi>Melvin,</hi> her Apothecary, her Chirurgeon, and another old man: And two women which uſed to lie in her Chamber. After this ſhe proceeded towards the great Hall in the Caſtle, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> bearing up her train, two Gentlemen of Sir <hi>Amyas Pawlets,</hi> on each hand one, and Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> the Sheriff going before. The Scaffold at the upper end of the Hall was two foot high and twelve foot broad, hanged with black, and ſhe ſeemed to monnt it with as much willingneſs, as eaſe, and took her ſeat, the Earls of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> ſtanding on her right hand, Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff on her left, and the two Executioners oppoſite before her. Then was the Commiſſion read by <hi>Beal</hi> Clerk of the Council, which ſhe ſeemed as little to regard, as if it had not concerned her at all: After the reading of the Commiſſion Doctor <hi>Fletcher</hi> Dean of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> addreſſed an Exhortation to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> that ſhe would conſider her preſent condition, and withal, the vanity of her Religion, which he beſought her to renounce, but ſhe refuſed, profeſſing her readineſs to die therein. The Lords deſiring her to joyn with them in prayers, ſhe alſo refuſed, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference in their Religions, and ſaying ſhe would pray by her ſelf: But the Dean was by the Commiſſioners deſired to pray, which he did in theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>O Moſt gracious God, and merciful Father, who according to the multitude of thy mercies doſt ſo put away the ſins of them that truly repent, that thou remembreſt them no more; Open, we beſeech thee, thine eyes of mercy, and behold this Perſon appointed unto death, whoſe eyes of underſtanding, and ſpiritual light, albeit thou haſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhut up, that the glorious beams of thy favour in Jeſus Chriſt do not ſhine unto her, but is poſſeſſed with blindneſs and ignorance of heavenly things (a certain token of thy heavy diſpleaſure, if thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy do not triumph againſt thy judgment) yet O Lord our God, impute not, we beſeech thee, unto her thoſe her offences, which ſeparate her from thy mercy, and, if it may ſtand with thine everlaſting purpoſe, and good pleaſure, O Lord, grant unto us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, this mercy, which is about thy throne, that the eyes of her heart may be enlightned, that ſhe may underſtand, and be converted unto thee, and grant her alſo, if it be thy bleſſed will, the heavenly comfort of thy Holy Spirit, that ſhe may taſte, and ſee, how gracious the Lord is: Thou haſt no pleaſure, good Lord, in the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and no man ſhall praiſe thy Name in the pit; renew in her, O Lord, we moſt humbly beſeech thy Majeſty, whatſoever is corrupt in her, either by her own frailty, or by the malice of the ghoſtly enemy: viſit her, O Lord, if it be thy good pleaſure, with thy ſaving health, as thou didſt the offender at the ſide of thy Croſs, with this conſolation, This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe: ſay unto her ſoul, as thou didſt unto thy ſervant</hi> David, <hi>I am thy ſalvation, ſo ſhall thy mercy,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61653:45"/>
                  <hi>being more mighty, be more magnified. Grant theſe mercies, O Lord, to us thy ſervants, to the increaſe of thy Kingdom, and glory at this time. And further, O moſt merciful Father, preſerve we moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech thy Majeſty, in long and honourable peace and ſafety,</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth <hi>thy ſervant, our moſt natural Soveraign Lady and Queen; let them be aſhamed and confounded, O Lord, that ſeek after her ſoul; let them be turned backward, and put to confuſion that wiſh her evil: And ſtrengthen ſtill, Lord, we pray thee, the hand and balance of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice amongſt us, by her gracious government: So ſhall we, both now, and ever, reſt under thy faithfulneſs and truth, as under our ſhield and buckler, and bleſs thy Name and magnifie thy mercy, which liveſt, and reigneſt one Moſt Gracious God, for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>The Queens aſſent and attention to this prayer were withdrawn to her own private Devotions, which ſhe performed after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of her Religion out of her own Portuary, with her Beads, and Crucifix, ſometimes in the <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſometimes in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> tongue; which being ended, the two Executioners with her women, began to diſrobe her, whereat ſhe ſaid with a ſmiling countenance, that ſhe was never ſerved by ſuch grooms before, nor was ſhe wont to put off her cloathes before ſuch a company. Her women with a <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> cloth wrapped up three corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, covered her head and face; which done, they departed, and the Queen was left alone to cloſe up the Tragedy of her life by her own ſelf, which ſhe did with her wonted courage, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kneeling down upon the Cuſhion, and ſaying in <hi>Latin, In te, Domine, ſperavi, ne confundar in aeternum.</hi> Then ſhe groaped for the block, whereon ſhe laid down her head, crying out, <hi>In manus tuas, Domine,</hi> &amp;c. and then the Executioner at two ſtroaks ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated her head from her body, ſaving a ſinew, which a third ſtroke parted alſo: the Executioner took up the head, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the aſſembly, and Dean <hi>Fletcher</hi> cried, So periſh all the Queens enemies, which was ſeconded by the Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> Her head coming clear out of her dreſſing, appeared very gray, as if ſhe had been much elder than ſhe was, it was polled very ſhort, which made her (as hath been ſaid) to wear borrowed hair. The Executioner that went about to pluck off her Stockins, found her little Dog crept under her Coat, which being put from thence, went, and laid himſelf down betwixt her head and body, and being beſmeared with her bloud, was cauſed to be waſhed, as were other things whereon any bloud was. The Executioners were diſmiſſed with Fees, not having any thing that was hers. Her body with the head, was conveyed into the great Chamber by the Sheriff, where it was by Chirurgeons Embalmed until its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Fotheringhay</hi> was at that time by Leaſe from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the hands of Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61653:45"/>
in the ſame County who was one of the Queens Penſioners, who by reaſon of his relation to the place, was ſent to by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners that he ſhould come and guard them in his Caſtle, this was required of him the firſt time that the Commiſſioners came, in <hi>October</hi> before, for the Queens Examination, and Trial: but Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams</hi> refuſing, becauſe he was not ſummoned by order from the Queen; the Commiſſioners procured ſuch order, and by vertue thereof ſummoned him again, which he obeyed: This gave him opportunities of viſiting ſometimes the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and converſing with her, wherein he deported himſelf with ſuch reſpective civility and courteſie, that the Queen a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her death, gave him many thanks, and told him ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to requite his kind uſage withal, but if he pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of her Sons picture hanging at her Beds-head, he ſhould take it, which he did, and his Succeſſors do ſtill enjoy it.</p>
               <p>Thus died <hi>Mary</hi> the unfortunate Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (a woman for her parts, fit to be a Queen) in the ſix and fortieth year of her age, and the eighteenth of her continuance in <hi>England,</hi> in a fair poſſibility of ſpinning the thread of her life to a greater length, had fate been as propitious to her as nature.</p>
               <p>We ſhall follow the remainder of this great Perſonage, her body, to the Earth, and ſo leave her.</p>

Lord let me know mine end,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who ſhall gather them,</hi> &amp;c. In the Prayer, when he gave thanks for ſuch as were tranſlated out of this vale of miſery, he uſed theſe words: Let us give thanks for the happy diſſolution of the High and Mighty Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> late Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of whoſe life and death, at this time, I have not much to ſay, becauſe I was not acquainted with the one, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I preſent at the other: I will not enter into judgment further, but becauſe it hath been ſignified unto me that ſhe truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſaved by the bloud of Chriſt, we muſt hope well of her Salvation: For, as Father <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, many one that liveth a Papiſt, dieth a Proteſtant. In the diſcourſe of his Text, he only dealt with general doctrine of the vanity of all fleſh. The Sermon ended, the offering of the Chief Mourner and hatchments were received by the Biſhop of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> and the offerings of the reſt, by the Dean, which ended, the mourners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; The Ceremony of burial was done by the Dean, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers breaking their Staves, and caſting them into the vault upon the Coffin: And ſo they departed to the Biſhops houſe, where was a great Feaſt appointed accordingly: The concourſe of people was of many thouſands, and after dinner the Nobles departed away every one towards his own home. The Maſter of the Wardrobe paid to the Church for the breaking of the ground in the Quire and making the grave <hi>10l.</hi> And for the blacks of the Quire and Church <hi>20l.</hi>

                           <p>This relation was atteſted in a Church Regiſter by Dean <hi>Fletcher</hi> himſelf, ſubſcribing his name thereunto: to which (eſpecially that of the Sermon) we may give more credit than to <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate,</hi> who, to ſlander the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> with Popery in a railing Pamphlet which he entituled an Epiſtle, charged the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> with praying at this ſolemnity, That his Soul, and the Souls of all the reſt there preſent might be with the Soul of that unrepentant Papiſt departed. Though the Biſhop, as became a charitable Chriſtian, might hope well of her Salvation, yet who but <hi>Martin</hi> again would accuſe him of being ſo credulous, as to bind up his own Salvation in ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent an aſſurance of hers?</p>

               <p>I have now no more to do to the body of our ſtory but to preſent the Reader with a relation of ſome few Monuments with their Inſcriptions, not yet mentioned, and then the ſtory of this Church will arrive at its period.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="destruction_of_monuments">
               <p>But before I give the relation of the Monuments of this Church, I ſhall let the Reader know when, and by whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. In the year 1643. the Town of <hi>Croyland</hi> was, by the inhabitants thereof, made a Garriſon for the King, which they had great reaſon to do, not only to ſhew themſelves good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but good Tenants, they holding their Lands of him. In the month of <hi>April,</hi> on the 18 day, came the Parliament-Forces to <hi>Peterburgh</hi> in order to the beſieging of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and here having ſettled themſelves in their Quarters, they fell to execute their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the Cathedral, deſtroying all things as the malicious Eye of each Sectarian Varlet prompted him to do miſchief, beating down the Windows, defacing the Monuments, tearing the Braſs from Grave-ſtones, plundering of Veſtments, Records, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe came to hand, which nothing could reſiſt: Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, of whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> was one, if not acting, yet not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souldiers in this heat of their fury.</p>
               <p>But ſome two or three days after, a finger of divine vengeance touched <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (although his rabble and he would not ſee it). For, being at that time quartered in the houſe of Mr. <hi>Cervington,</hi> commonly called the Vineyard, at the Eaſt end of the Cathedral, out of the Court of which dwelling, there was a paſſage into the Churchyard (which ſince is mured up) aſcending by 3 or 4 Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (as others did) riding up thoſe ſteps, his Horſe fell under him, and riſing ſuddenly under the lintels of the door, daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his head againſt the lintels, ſo that he fell to the ground as dead, was ſo carried into the houſe, and it was about a fortnight ere he could be recovered: thoſe who were eye-witneſſes affirmed that the blow raiſed ſplinters in his Scalp near a fingers length. But yet the ſiege of <hi>Croyland</hi> went on, and on the 28 of <hi>April</hi> the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61653:53"/>
Town was taken, on the 5 of <hi>May. Cromwel</hi> with his Forces marched to <hi>Stamford,</hi> and other places, leaving the <hi>abomination of deſolation</hi> in this Church behind them. And now I ſhall give an accompt of ſuch Monuments as were in the Church before their coming, and have been added ſince.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="monuments">
               <p>I ſhall begin at the Nave, or body of the Church, where I ſhall omit ſuch as are broken, and worn out, as not to be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendered: Many alſo as bear only names, and dates of burial, which will give but little content to any that ſhould read them.</p>
               <p>As you enter into the Church, high above, on the left hand, ſtands the figure of <hi>R. Scarlet</hi> once a Sexton of this Church, one that was famous in his generation, as may be collected by what is under written.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>You ſee old <hi>Scarlet</hi>'s picture ſtand on high,</l>
                  <l>But at your feet there doth his body lye.</l>

The Epitaph of <hi>W. Ramſey</hi> Abbot near adjoyning, hath been related already, only be it added, that his Rebus on a plate of Braſs was a Ram carrying a W. and ſey written over, which was <hi>William Ramſey.</hi>

               <p>At the upper end of the South Iſle, was an effigies of Braſs faſtned to a Marble with an Inſcription thus, <hi>Hic jacet Johannes de Harwedon quondam Seneſcallus Burgi, Cujus animae propitietur Deus,</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>On either ſide, betwixt the two formoſt Pillars, were two Chappels, but oblivion hath ſequeſtred them from our account. Proceed we now to the Quire, but by the way a ſmall Inſcription ſtays our foot, in the paſſage. <hi>Hic jacet Jornandes de Tringham Prior hujus loci: Cujus animae propitietur Deus.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>The Quire preſents nothing legible in the pavement, more than what hath been already mentioned: only the wooden ſides did very lately retain ſome memorial of their antient ornaments, both paintings and writings, though their defects be now ſupplyed with the gilded ceiling of the Ladies Chappel.

Towards the upper end of the Quire, on the South ſide, a little above the Monument of Abbot <hi>John,</hi> there is a comely ſtructure of white Chalk-ſtone, being alike on both ſides, but it is not known what it was raiſed for, unleſs conjecture may paſs it for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one <hi>Reginald Lolworth</hi> who lieth buried by it, in the South Iſle, on whoſe ſtone this Verſe is legible,
<q>Hic jacet egregius Lolworth Reginaldus humatus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt is worn out. But who this <hi>Reginald</hi> was I know no more than the ſtone, whereon the word <hi>Egregius</hi> is much abated by oblivion of the Perſon.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt ornament of the Quire (and indeed of the whole Church) was the High Altar, a ſtructure of ſtone moſt exquiſitely carved, and beautified with gilding and painting; it was aſcended unto by about a dozen ſteps, and from its baſis reared after the manner of a comely wall ſome ſix foot high, upon which were ſeveral curious Pilaſters ſupporting a fair arched Roof whereon were three goodly Spires reaching almoſt to the top of the Church, the whole frame dilating it ſelf to each ſide, all gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and painted, ſaving ſome void plain places, which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently filled up with Plates of ſilver, as hath been mentioned in the Inventory. I wiſh I could preſent the Reader with the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of it, as Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> hath done that in the Cathedral of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But were it never ſo glorious and beautiful to the eye, for that it had been built and uſed in times of Popery, and ſuperſtition, it was adjudged criminous enough ſo as to deſerve demolition.</p>
               <p>The Altar or Table it ſelf was a goodly free-ſtone, which was long ſince removed, and laid in the pavement adjoyning, and a Table of wood ſet in its place, notwithſtanding which change, the Abbots Chair of ſtone adjoyning to the South end, ſuffered no alteration, but continued to our times. It was, as tradition hath derived it to us, the repreſentative of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, where the Abbot himſelf ſate at appointed times.</p>
               <p>But muſt an honeſt Convert be hanged becauſe he was once a Thief? muſt a regenerate perſon be damned becauſe he was once carnal? might no reformation, purgation, or alienation of this Altar to a more honeſt, and better uſe (as Altars in the Primitive times of Chriſtianity were) reprieve it from the violent hands of an enraged multitude? yet it would not: for in the year 1643 it was beaten down to the loweſt baſe of plain work, and ſo ſtood as a deformed ſpectacle ſome eight years, and then 1651. a private perſon diſliking it becauſe there was not a through reformation, it was ordered that the remainder, with the whole mound whereon it was erected, ſhould be levelled with the pavement of the Quire.</p>

               <p>Beyond the Quire, the moſt Eaſtern part of the Church, is the New Building erected by Abbot <hi>Robert Kirton,</hi> as hath been ſaid. The windows therein are fair, and lately beautified with painted glaſs, which contained no great matter worthy of recital, ſave only the pictures of Saints, largely expreſſed.</p>
               <p>In the South end of this building lie many of the family of <hi>Ormes</hi> interred, Sir <hi>Humfrey Orme, Frances</hi> his Lady with their Children. In the Wall adjoyning was placed a fair and comely Monument, with their Statues: which Monument was firſt ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon the burial of a vertuous Gentlewoman of the ſame name, born in <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire,</hi> whom <hi>Humfrey,</hi> the eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>Humfrey,</hi> had taken to Wife, who, though by her Marriage ſhe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61653:56"/>
changed not her name, yet ſhe did her Countrey, and here died. Under her Figure was written this Epitaph.
<q>
                     <l>Miſtake not, Reader, I thee crave,</l>
                     <l>This is an Altar, not a Grave,</l>
                     <l>Where Fire rak't up in Aſhes lies,</l>
                     <l>And Harts are made the ſacrifice</l>
                     <l>Till time and truth, her worth, and fame,</l>
                     <l>Revive her embers to a flame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot tell, whether this Monument fared the worſe for the Statues, or the word Altar in the Epitaph, but it was defaced, And Sir <hi>Humfrey Orme,</hi> his Lady, and eldeſt Son, lived to ſee the death of what was erected to continue their memories after death.</p>
               <p>Near towards the midſt of this building, lieth interred the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Frances,</hi> Wife to Dr. <hi>John Coſin</hi> Dean of this Church, who died (not long after her Child-birth) <hi>March</hi> 25. 1642. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman well deſerving a Monument to perpetuate her name, and memory, for which purpoſe her honoured Husband made ſome progreſs in one upon the pavement with black and white Marble chequered, but before it could be compleated on the Wall, by a Statue or Inſcription, it was blaſted by an Eaſtern wind. The day of her burial was remarkable in this, that, whilſt the Child (a Daughter Chriſtned <hi>Anne)</hi> was at the Font to be Baptized, the Mother lay by upon the Bier to be carried preſently to her Grave. A pretty accident (if we may call it an accident) fell out the day before. It being the Eve of the Annunciation, (and none making the leaſt queſtion but that this Gentlewoman was in a fair way of recovery after her delivery, and all things prepared for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening of the Child) the Chanter, whoſe Office it was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Anthems, appointed to be ſung that part of the Burial-Service Compoſed by Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon, I am the Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. Dean <hi>Coſin,</hi> being then at Church, and having the Anthem brought him, asked the Chanter, why he appointed this Anthem? The Chanter replied, It is a good Anthem and you have not yet heard it. The next morning this Gentlewoman died, and that day the ſame Anthem was ſung again at her Burial. Dean <hi>Coſin</hi> afterwards obſerved the <hi>Omen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you paſs out of this building on the Northſide of the Church there was lately a paſſage into the now demoliſhed Ladies Chappel, in which paſſage was a little Chappel on the right hand, Archt over with Stone, having a fair Eaſt-window, and on the Northſide lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle windows looking into the Ladies Chappel: Over head, were two Chambers, which common tradition hath told, to have been the habitation of a devout Lady, called <hi>Agnes,</hi> or Dame <hi>Agnes,</hi> out of whoſe Lodging-Chamber there was a hole made a-skew in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61653:57"/>
the window walled up, having its proſpect juſt upon the Altar in the Ladies Chappel, and no more. It ſeems ſhe was devout in her generation, that ſhe choſe this place for her retirement, and was deſirous that her eyes, as well as ears, might wait upon her publick Devotions. I could never yet ſee any Record to inform me who this Dame <hi>Agnes</hi> was: And ſurely, this Church owes the world a better account of her than I can give, in regard ſhe was a great Benefactoreſs to it, giving that, which at this day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known by the Name of Dame <hi>Agnes</hi> Wood, not far from <hi>Peterburgh.</hi> Over againſt this, on the left hand, was a little Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but what, or whoſe, we cannot ſay.</p>
               <p>In the Ladies Chappel were many fair Graveſtones, but few Inſcriptions, only theſe. <hi>Hic jacet Helena nomine Engliſh quondam uxor, Willielmi Gunton, quae obiit</hi> 9 <hi>Octobris</hi> 1613.</p>
               <p>Near unto this was buried <hi>Simon Engliſh,</hi> who was of great eſteem in his generation, for a School-Maſter, under whom the late famous, and learned Antiquary Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> and many others of his time, and quality, received education. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in Braſs upon his Monument, was this. <hi>Simoni Engliſh Archididaſcalo Petriburgi celeberrimo Epiphaniae die, Anno Domini</hi> 1592. <hi>mortuo, Diſcipulus</hi> Thomas Green <hi>Hieronymi filius, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis ergo, poſuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eaſtern window of this Ladies Chappel was the faireſt, and goodlieſt in all the Church, ſcarce a fairer in any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral. It was adorned with painted glaſs, containing many ſtories, amongſt the reſt, of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and theſe two Verſes.
<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At the Weſt end of this Chappel were two ſmall Chappels of wooden incloſure, in one of which (the Northern anciently the Chappel of S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt)</hi> are interred the bodies of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Swinſcoe</hi> Gent. and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife, their Monument of Marble is ſtill extant, but the Inſcription loſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Alice</hi> was a good Benefactoreſs to the poor of the Town. In this Chappel I have often ſeen a Stone in the pavement, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed like a ſhallow Platter, which tradition hath ſaid to have been ſo worn by the frequent kneeling of a devout perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which might be, it being at that end which was next to the Ladies Chappel. But now that ſtone is gone.</p>
               <p>In a Pillar near, was a pretty ſmall Monument of <hi>John Aungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Dr. of Law and Prebendary of this Church, but this Pillar could not ſupport the Monument longer then 1643. Near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to this Pillar, was the Chappel of S. <hi>James.</hi>

Now we are in the North Croſs Iſle, where <hi>W. Parys,</hi> who (as hath been ſaid) built the Ladies Chappel, and Biſhop <hi>Dove,</hi> are interred. At the North end of this Iſle was a Monument of wood affixed to the Wall, letting ſurvivers know that it was in remembrance of <hi>Richard Worm,</hi> whoſe quality and condition may appear by the copious Inſcriptions thereon.</p>

               <p>At the South end of this North Iſle, near the Quire, is a Vault deſcending into the ground by ſtairs of Stone, and at the bottom a low arched paſſage going under the Church, wherein any might go ſome five or ſix yards, and there find the way ſtopped with the fall of the Earth over head, but how far further this Vault went, or to what end it was firſt made, I could never learn.

               <p>Step we now over the Quire to the South croſs Iſle, and there we ſhall ſee on the North end of it next the Quire, the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Trinity, and three little Chappels on the Eaſt ſide, the firſt of S. <hi>Oſwald</hi> where the Heart of Abbot <hi>Robert Sutton</hi> was buried, the ſecond of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> the other of S. <hi>Kyneburga,</hi> who probably was here buried upon her removal from her Church of <hi>Caſtor.</hi>

               <p>On the Weſt ſide of this Iſle ſtands the Chapter houſe, where the Church Records were kept, and ſlept ſecurely until 1643. when they were roughly awakned, or rather caſt into a deeper ſleep of oblivion, moſt of them being torn, and the reſt diſperſed, to the great prejudice of the knowledge of this Churches ancient affairs, and particularly of this our Story. Anciently this place was the Chappel of the <hi>Oſtrie:</hi> As for the old Chapter-houſe that was in the Eaſtern Cloiſter, a goodly building, founded by King <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> but now demoliſhed: In it were buried three of the Abbots, but no Inſcriptions to inform us which they were; their Marble ſtones with their Pourtraitures or Statues exquiſitely carved on them are now to be ſeen removed into the South Iſle, not far off in this Iſle is to be read towards the Cloyſter door, <hi>Hic jacet Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Fraunceys Monachus &amp; natus in Burgo Sancti Petri, quondam Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prior hujus Monaſterii, cujus animae propitietur Deus.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>TRuſty and Well-beloved, We greet you well. We have lately taken the ſtate of our Cathedral and Collegiat Churches into our Princely conſideration, that we may be the better able to preſerve that livelyhood which as yet is left unto them. Upon this Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find that of later times there hath not riſen a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, than by turning Leaſes of one and twenty Years into Lives, for by that means the preſent Dean and Chapter, put great Fines into their Purſes, to enrich themſelves, their Wives, and Children, and leave their Succeſſors, of what deſerts ſoever
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61653:92"/>
to us, and the Church, deſtitute of that growing means, which elſe would come in to help them: By which courſe, ſhould it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, ſcarce any of them could be able to live and keep houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Place, and Calling. We know the Statute makes it alike lawful for a Dean and Chapter, to let their Leaſes for the Term of One and Twenty Years, or three Lives; but time and experience have made it apparent that there is a great deal of difference between them, eſpecially in Church-Leaſes, when men are commonly in Years before they come to thoſe Places. Theſe are therefore to Will and Command you, upon the peril of Our utmoſt diſpleaſure, and what ſhall follow thereon, that notwithſtanding any Statute, or any other pretence whatſoever, you preſume not to let any Leaſe belonging to your Church into Lives that is not in Lives already. And further where any fair opportunity is offered you, if any ſuch be, you fail not to reduce ſuch as are in Lives into Years. And we do likewiſe Will and Require, that theſe Our Letters may remain upon Record in your own Regiſter Books, and in the Regiſtry of the Lord Biſhop of that Dioceſs, that he may take notice of theſe Our Commands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and give us, and Our Royal Succeſſors knowledge, if you preſume in any ſort to diſobey them. And further, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Our late Inſtructions, We have Commanded all our Biſhops reſpectively, not to let any Leaſe after We have named any of them to a better Biſhoprick, but did not in thoſe Inſtructions name the Deans, who yet were intended by Us: Theſe are therefore to Declare unto you, that no Dean ſhall preſume to renew any Leaſe either into Lives or Years, after ſuch a time as We have nominated him either to a better Deanry or a Biſhoprick, having obſerved, that at ſuch times of Remove, many men care not what or how they Let, to the prejudice of the Church, and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. And this is our expreſs Command to you, your Chapter, and your Succeſſors, which in any caſe We require both you and them ſtrictly to obſerve, upon pain of Our high diſpleaſure, and as you, and they will anſwer the contrary at your and their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perils.</p>

            <p>TRuſty and Well-beloved, We greet you well. We are informed that the Dotations and Allowances in our Cathedral Church of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> are very mean both for your ſelves the Dean and Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and for the Petty Canons, Clerks, and other ſubſervient members therein: And further that there is very little left to keep ſo goodly a Fabrick as that Cathedral is, in ſufficient repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore in our Princely Care and Zeal to Gods ſervice, We are ready to take notice of every good Propoſal which may tend to the ſupportation and advancement of the ſame. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much therefore as it is repreſented unto Us by the moſt Reverend Father in God our Right Truſty and Right Well-beloved Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, The Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that a very fair opportunity will within few years offer it ſelf (the like whereof if that be omitted, can hardly at any time after be hoped for in that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61653:93"/>
Church) namely by the renewing the Leaſe of the Mannors of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> and <hi>Sutton</hi> which are the Inheritance of that Cathedral, and are reputed to be clearly worth five hundred and threeſcore pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> or thereabouts over and above the Rents which now are reſerved upon them. In this regard We are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to direct theſe Our Royal Letters unto you, willing and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you the Dean and Prebendaries that whenſoever you ſhall next renew the ſaid Leaſe, ſo as to add any Term of Years thereunto, you ſhall not aim at your own preſent advantage only, but alſo at the future good of that Church in ſucceeding Ages: And ſhall therefore reſerve the full ſumm of Three hundred and Ten pounds <hi>per annum</hi> (over and above the old Rent) upon the ſame: By which increaſe (as We have cauſed it to be apportioned) you ſhall be able to add unto the Deans place, Threeſcore pounds yearly; unto every Prebendary, Sixteen pounds yearly; unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Petty-Canon Six pounds; unto every Clerk, Three pounds ſix ſhillings eight pence; unto every Choriſter, One pound thirteen ſhillings four pence; unto the Maſter and Teacher of them, Three pounds; Unto the Chanter Three pounds, unto the Organiſts Ten pounds; to either of the Sextons forty ſhillings; and toward the repair of the Fabrick of the Church Forty ſix pounds: to the great Improvement of all the ſaid places, and incouragement of all thoſe that from time to time ſhall be employed in Gods Holy Service among you. And Our Royal Will and Pleaſure is, that at the next Chapter to be held by you, after the receipt hereof, you ſhall make a Chapter-Act to this very purpoſe, cauſing alſo theſe Our Royal Letters and directions to be faithfully Regiſtred in your Chapter-Book: And that every ſucceeding Dean, and Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry together with his admiſſion and inſtalment, have notice given him hereof, until theſe our Princely and Pious proviſions for that Church ſhall be accompliſhed and fully perfected. And that after theſe Our Royal Letters ſhall be Regiſtred, you lay them up ſafe among your Evidences, there to be kept as a Monument of Our Care to the Service of Almighty God.</p>

            <head>A SUPPLEMENT To the Foregoing HISTORY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ancient name of this place all agree was <hi>Medeſhamſtede</hi> or <hi>Medeſhamſtud</hi> (as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Symeon Dunelmenſis,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Medeſhamſtudenſis Abbas,</hi> by <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> ad An. 992.) or <hi>Medeſhamſtide,</hi> as it is in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus de Diceto, ad An.</hi> 1051. But whence it had this name is not ſo certain. The deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which Mr. <hi>Gunton</hi> gives of it, is out of <hi>Swapham,</hi> or rather <hi>Hugo</hi> (as I have ſhown in the Preface) who ſaith that as <hi>Eli</hi> had its name from the abundance of <hi>Eeles</hi> taken in the Waters there; and <hi>Thorney</hi> from the Thorns and Buſhes wherewith it was overgrown; and <hi>Croyland</hi> from the <hi>Terra Cruda,</hi> moiſt and moriſh Ground on which it ſtands; ſo this place from that <hi>Vorago</hi> or <hi>Gurges,</hi> (as he terms it) in the middle of the River called anciently <hi>Medeſwell.</hi> Whoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful properties he derives from Springs perpetually bubling up; which kept it from being frozen when the reſt of the River was, and yet made it ſo cold, that when the Sun was hotter than a Chimney fire (as his words are) no Swimmer could endure it. And it muſt be confeſſed that <hi>Bede</hi> derives <hi>Eli ab anguilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum copia,</hi> from the plenty of <hi>Eeles</hi> there; <hi>conſentiens communi notitiae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury (L. ult. de geſtis Pontif. Angl.)</hi> agreeing to the common notion: For it is known to all, there
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61653:120"/>
was ſuch abundance of all other Fiſh, and Fowl alſo in that place, <hi>ut pro uno aſſe,</hi> &amp;c. that for one farthing, five men and more might not only drive away hunger, but fill themſelves to ſatiety. And <hi>Thornei</hi> alſo other Writers will have ſo called <hi>propter dumorum condenſitatem,</hi> from the thickets of all ſorts of Thorns, and Briers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Athelwold</hi> cauſed to be cut up, ſaith the ſame <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> intending in the very beginning of his Epiſcopacy, to go and lead an Hermite's life in that place: Which he magnifies to the Skies. That place alſo which we now call <hi>Crowland</hi> or <hi>Croyland,</hi> is called <hi>Cruland</hi> both by <hi>Hugo</hi> and by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon. John</hi> Prior of <hi>Hexham, Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and many others: And <hi>Crulant</hi> by <hi>Symeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> or rather <hi>Turgotus</hi> ad An. 1075. and <hi>Cruiland</hi> by <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 547. and, more ancient than all this, King <hi>Edgar</hi> in his Charter to our Church of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> calls it <hi>Crulond:</hi> Which may make that derivation probable, from crude Land which <hi>Ingulphus</hi> himſelf, who was Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> gives of it; <hi>crudam terram &amp; coenoſam ſignificat.</hi> But for all this, I ſee no reaſon to think that <hi>Medeſhamſted</hi> had its name from the <hi>Medeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi> there being no ſuch deep pit in the River; and <hi>Hugo</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reporting it, with an <hi>ut dicunt,</hi> as they ſay; and another plainer derivation offering it ſelf, from the fair <hi>Meades</hi> or Meadows, that lie on both ſides of the River <hi>Nen,</hi> upon which this place ſtands. Which in thoſe days were the more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe all the reſt of the Country thereabouts which was not <hi>Fenn,</hi> was <hi>Woods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I find in the Book called <hi>Swapham</hi> fol. CCXCV. that all the <hi>Naſhum,</hi> or <hi>Naſſa</hi> as it was termed, afterward called the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Burgh,</hi> was ſolitary, and full of Woods, without any Inhabitant: And ſo continued till the time of <hi>Adulphus,</hi> who did but begin neither to clear the Country, by cutting down the Woods; and to make Mannors, and Granges. Preſently after which, the place being new built, its name was changed into <hi>Burch</hi> or <hi>Burg</hi> (as ſhall be then more largely ſhown) which during all the time of the firſt Monaſtery, before it was burnt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> had been called <hi>Medeſhamſtede,</hi> and frequently <hi>Medhamſted:</hi> As much as to ſay, the <hi>Ham, i. e.</hi> Village or Houſe, ſtanding upon the <hi>Medes.</hi> And was ſometime ſimply called <hi>Hamſtede;</hi> as I find in <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inrode made by the <hi>Danes,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Hinguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba</hi> in the year 870. and ſhowing how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the North Country, and then paſſed over <hi>Humber,</hi> and ſo went forward till they came to the Fenns, where they burnt the Monaſteries and killed their Inhabitants, he adds <hi>Horum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem nomina Coenobiorum ſunt, Croulandia, Thorneia, Rameſeia, Hamſtede, quod nunc Burgum Sancti Petri dicitur.</hi> Which is no miſtake in the Printed Book; for in a <hi>MS.</hi> now in the Library

of the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I find the ſame words without the leaſt difference, but only the letter <hi>e</hi> in the end omitted, it being written <hi>Hamſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where I doubt not there was another Well, as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves by the way, called St. <hi>Laurence his Well:</hi> and very probably was near the Chappel bearing his name; which was dedicated to the uſe of the Infirmary. As appears by a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Willielmus de Midilton,</hi> a ſervant in the Infirmary, who gave to the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh</hi> and to the <hi>Infirmary</hi> of that place, a <hi>Noble</hi> of annual Rent, <hi>ad ſuſtentationem unius lampadis continue ardentis, in capella Sancti Laurentii ejuſdem Infirmariae;</hi> for the maintaining of a Lamp perpetually burning in the Chappel of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> belonging to the ſame Infirmary. <hi>Swaph.</hi> fol. CLXXXIX.</p>
            <p>The Superſtitious reſort to it, was the cauſe I ſuppoſe of its being ſtopt up, ſo that now there are no footſteps of it. For that moved <hi>Oliver Sutton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to ſend his <hi>Inhibition</hi> to reſtrain that kind of devotion, which (as Mr. <hi>Gunton</hi> obſerves out of Dr. <hi>Hammond)</hi> was uſed both here, and at St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Well in <hi>Oxford:</hi> and, I may add, in other places alſo; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Records of the Church of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> Where the Regiſter of the Acts of this Worthy Prelate, in the ten firſt years of his Government (which was twenty years in all) are loſt; and therewith this Act about the Church of <hi>Peterburgh:</hi> But there ſtill remain the Acts of the other ten; In the firſt of which he condemned that ſuperſtitious devotion, which many people paid at St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Well, in the Fields near St. <hi>Clment</hi>'s-<hi>Church,</hi> without the Walls of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as tending to introduce the error of the Gentiles among Chriſts-worſhippers; and in the laſt the like fooliſh devotion at another Well in the fields of <hi>Lincelad,</hi> in the County of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> Requiring the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons of <hi>Oxon</hi> and <hi>Bucks</hi> ſolemnly to excommunicate all ſuch perſons as ſhould preſume hereafter, to frequent thoſe places, under the pretence of Miracles done there. Both which my worthy Friend, Dr. <hi>James Gardiner,</hi> Sub-Dean of the Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> having at my requeſt, tranſcribed for me, out of the Book of that Biſhop's <hi>Memorandums,</hi> I have thought good to communicate to the Reader; but that I might not too much interrupt the courſe of this Hiſtory, have placed them in the end of this Supplement; together with ſome few other Records</p>
            <p>I ſhall only note here, that there had been long an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the people to this ſuperſtition, appears by the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made in the Council held at St. <hi>Pauls London</hi> MCII. by <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Where among other things it was ordained, that none ſhould dare to give holy reverence to the bodies of dead Men, to Fountains, and other things
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61653:121"/>
(which ſome had done) without Epiſcopal authority. The words are theſe both in <hi>Malmsbury</hi> L. 1. <hi>de Geſtis Pont. Angl.</hi> and <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> L. 3. <hi>Hiſt. Ne quis temeraria novitate corporibus mortuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, aut fontibus, aut aliis rebus (quod contigiſſe cognovimus) ſine Epiſcopali autoritate, reverentiam ſanctitatis exhibeat.</hi> But within a few days almoſt all the Conſtitutions of that Council were broken; <hi>and the principal tranſgreſſors were the Law-makers;</hi> as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s words are, in <hi>MS.</hi> Copy of that Book in Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Library: Which are wholly omitted in the Printed Book among the <hi>Anglicarum rerum Scriptores:</hi> MDCI. <hi>Eadmerus</hi> ſaith the ſame, (without mentioning particularly the prevarication of the Law-makers) in the concluſion of thoſe Conſtitutions. <hi>Et hic quidem Lundonienſis Concilii textus eſt, qui non poſt multos inſtitutionis ſuae dies, multos ſui tranſgreſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in omni hominum genere fecit.</hi> And therefore no wonder <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sutton</hi> found the people ſtill poiſoned with this error, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 200 years after that Council: Which he honeſtly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remedy, by his Epiſcopal Authority.</p>
            <p>But it is time to return to our Hiſtory: And to give a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Founder of this Monaſtery, and the time of its found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The firſt Founder all agree was <hi>Peada</hi> Son of <hi>Penda</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians.</hi> Whoſe ſtory is thus diſtinctly told by <hi>Hedda</hi> Abbot in a <hi>MS.</hi> Relation, ſtill remaining in the Book called <hi>Swapham.</hi> There was a great Friendſhip between <hi>Peada</hi> Son of <hi>Penda,</hi> and <hi>Alhfrid</hi> Son of <hi>Oſwin</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the great King and Martyr <hi>Oſwald)</hi> in ſo much that they made an interchangeable Marriage: <hi>Alhfrid</hi> taking <hi>Kynes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burga</hi> Siſter to <hi>Peada,</hi> and <hi>Peada</hi> taking <hi>Alfeda</hi> (as he calls her) Siſter to <hi>Alhfrid</hi> unto Wife. Whereupon <hi>Peada</hi> by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his faithful Brother-in-Law, and of his own pious Siſter, was made a Chriſtian, and baptized in <hi>Northumberland</hi> by that famous Biſhop <hi>Finanus.</hi> From whom he received alſo four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Preachers of the Goſpel, to carry with him to his own Country; whither he returned, <hi>plus jam gaudens de aeterna ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, quam de petita Virgine,</hi> rejoycing more in the eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in the Virgin he had gotten in <hi>Northumberland. Symeon Dunelmenſis</hi> ſpeaks of this converſion, in the very beginning of his Hiſtory <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and <hi>John Brampton</hi> names the place where he was baptized, <hi>viz. Admurium</hi> (twelve miles from the Eaſtern Sea) together with the four Presbyters which <hi>Finanus</hi> gave him, <hi>Ceadda, Abde, Betta</hi> and <hi>Dunna:</hi> who coming into <hi>Peada</hi>'s Country, converted a great many to the Chriſtian Faith, in two years time; for <hi>Penda</hi> did neither hinder theſe men from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor his people from believing.</p>
            <p>All which is taken out of <hi>Bede</hi> L. III. Eccleſ. Hiſt. C. 21. where he ſaith, that not only <hi>Peada,</hi> but all his Nobles and Knights and every one of his Servants and Attendants were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61653:121"/>
               <hi>in vico Regis illuſtri, qui vocatur Admurum.</hi> And that <hi>Penda</hi> when his Son returned, was ſo far from prohibiting the entertainment of the Chriſtian Religion in his Kingdom, that he hated and deſpiſed thoſe who having received the Chriſtian Faith, did not live accordingly: Saying, <hi>they were wretched creatures, who did not take care to obey the God, in whom they believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things were done two years before <hi>Penda</hi> died; and in his <hi>Epitome</hi> he ſaith <hi>Penda</hi> died <hi>An.</hi> 655, <hi>and the Mercians were made Chriſtians.</hi> And in this year the foundation of this Monaſtery is ſaid to have been laid by <hi>Peada</hi> with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Oſwin</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and of devout peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, newly Baptized, and eſpecially of <hi>Saxulph,</hi> as <hi>Hugo</hi> often ſayes. Though the <hi>Chron. Johannis Abbatis</hi> ſaith it was <hi>An.</hi> 654. They are the very firſt words of it. <hi>Anno Domini</hi> DCLIIII. <hi>fundatum eſt Monaſterium de Burgo Sancti Petri, à Peada Rege Merciorum Saxulfo Comite facto ejus Abbate primo.</hi> But <hi>Hedda,</hi> before mentioned, carries it ſtill higher; for he ſaith this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery was begun five and fifty years after the coming of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> the Monk into <hi>England; ab incarnatione Salvatioris DCL. exacti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Stones, which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> obſerves were laid in the foundation, <hi>Hugo</hi> ſayes he ſaw, when the Monaſtery was burnt, and demoliſhed, <hi>quales octo paria boum vix unum traherent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was only begun; for <hi>Peada</hi> died in the year 656. (as the forenamed Chronicle of <hi>John Abbot</hi> tells us; A. DCLVI. <hi>Peada mortuo Wlferus regnabat ſuper Mercios, &amp; erat Biſſexto,</hi> &amp;c.) and left the Building to be perfected by his Brother <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferus.</hi> Who, as <hi>Hugo</hi> ſayes, was no leſs in love with this work than <hi>Peada</hi> had been: but purſued it with great zeal till he had finiſhed it, by the help of <hi>Saxulfus,</hi> and the aſſiſtance of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ethelred</hi> and his two holy Siſters <hi>Kyneburga</hi> and <hi>Kyneſwitha:</hi> And having indowed it with Lands and other Revenues, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all that <hi>Hugo</hi> ſayes (ſave only what belongs to his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> in whom I find not a word about his revolting from Chriſtianity, or his growing cold in it: nor in <hi>Hedda</hi>'s Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither, <hi>quo modo incipiente Chriſtianitate in regione Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneorum Anglorum initiatum ſit Medeſhamſtedenſe Monaſterium, &amp; ſubſequentibus privilegiis confirmatum,</hi> as the title of it bears. But quite contrary he ſayes King <hi>Wolfere</hi> was ſo flagrant (as his word is, in the worſhip of Chriſt, that he made it his buſineſs, not only to kindle the like affection in his own people, but to bring the <hi>Southern</hi> Kings and people that were ſubject to him, <hi>ad veram Dei ſectam</hi> to Gods true Religion; by ſending them Royal gifts, and inlarging their Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:61653:122"/>
Yet I cannot ſay that <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Wittleſea</hi> deviſed all that ſtory which follows in Mr. <hi>G.</hi> about him, his Steward, his two Sons, and St. <hi>Chad</hi> and the Hart: but he had it no doubt out of antienter Writers. For <hi>Leland</hi> begins his <hi>Second Vol.</hi> of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections out of a Book of an Author without name, but as he gathers, of the Church of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> whoſe title is <hi>De Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Wulfadi &amp; Rufini filiorum Wulferi Regis.</hi> And there is an old MS. in Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Library, intituled <hi>Paſſio Sanctorum Wlfadi &amp; Rufini filiorum Wlferi Regis:</hi> in which the whole ſtory is told more amply, with the Speeches made by all parties concerned in it, as may be ſeen in the 2. Vol. of the <hi>Monaſticon</hi> p. 119. Out of which I ſhall tranſcribe nothing; but only note a few things wherein theſe two Writers agree, and wherein they differ, or which are omitted by the one, but related by the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leland</hi>'s Author ſaith, that <hi>Werbord</hi> was <hi>tanquam ſecundarius in Regno;</hi> prime Miniſter of State, as we now ſpeak. And ſo ſayes the other Writer, but explains it thus; he was <hi>Secretary</hi> to <hi>Wlfere;</hi> having been a Privy Counſellor to his Father <hi>Penda:</hi> who eſteemed him as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and let him govern the whole Kingdom under him, as <hi>Haman</hi> did under <hi>Ahaſuerus.</hi> Which puffed him up ſo much, that they both ſay he aſpired to the honour of marrying the Kings Daughter <hi>Werburg:</hi> only <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Author ſayes, that he Courting her for his Wife, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by the Virgin, by the counſel of her Mother <hi>Ermenild;</hi> the other Writer ſayes, he askt her of the King for his Wife, when ſhe was but a little Child, and the King conſented: But the Queen denyed it; and the two Brothers were ſo incenſed at the mans inſolence (eſpecially becauſe he was a Pagan) that they oppoſed his Petition to his face. From which time <hi>Wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord</hi> meditated revenge, and contrived their ruin; which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in ſuch manner as is related by Mr. <hi>G. Wolfere</hi> (ſayes the Writer now mentioned) being like his Father <hi>Penda,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fierce and prone to anger; and, when the fit was upon him, more furious than any wild Beaſt.</p>
            <p>They both ſay that, upon their being Baptized, both the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſwaded St. <hi>Chad</hi> to remove his Cell nearer to their Fathers Court, at <hi>Wlferceſtre,</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> to give them the advantage of more frequent converſation with him: and that, upon their being ſlain by their cruel Fathers own hand, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to his old Oratory again. But <hi>Leland</hi>'s Author ſayes they ſuffered upon the tenth Kaland <hi>Auguſti;</hi> the other upon the ninth.</p>
            <p>They both agree that <hi>Werbord</hi> ran mad, as one poſſeſſed with a Devil; and the latter of them ſaith, he tore his own fleſh from his arms with his own teeth; and ſo died diſtracted. They agree alſo, that the Queen buried both her Martyr'd Sons, <hi>in</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61653:122"/>
               <hi>uno ſaxeo Sarcophago</hi> in one Stone Coffin; and that in proceſs of time ſhe built a fair Church of Stone, in that place: for a multitude of people coming there to pray, were wont to bring Stones along with them for the building; which gave the place the name of <hi>Stanes.</hi> And the King, when he had in cool blood conſidered of the fact, was pricked in Conſcience, or rather miſerably tormented in mind, like a man upon the rack: and was thereupon admoniſhed to ſeek for eaſe, by confeſſing his Sin to St. <hi>Chad,</hi> and doing whatſoever he enjoyned. Who commanded him inſtantly to deſtroy all Idolatry, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Demons; to build Churches, found Monaſteries, get Clergy men Ordained, cauſe the Laws of Chriſt to be obſerved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he did, and among other things, <hi>illud nobile Coeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium in Medeſhamſtede praediis &amp; poſſeſſionibus ditavit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>quod hodie Petresburch</hi> i. e. <hi>Civitas Sancti Petri nominatur,</hi> ſaith the laſt named Author. By which paſſage it appears, that he lived after the Reſtauration of the Monaſtery by King <hi>Edgar:</hi> and that what follows in <hi>Leland</hi> concerning the <hi>Procurator</hi> of the Colledge at <hi>Stanes</hi> (which <hi>Wolfere</hi> alſo founded for <hi>Canons Regular)</hi> going to <hi>Rome;</hi> to get the two Martyrs <hi>Wulfade</hi> and <hi>Rufinus</hi> put into the Catalogue of the Saints, was done alſo, if the ſtory be true, long after their death. They both ſay, he carried the head of <hi>Wulfade</hi> with him, though much againſt the will (ſaith the latter Writer) of almoſt all the Brethren. For he hoped thereby the more eaſily to obtain his Petition. And to prove their Sanctity, <hi>though the Records of the Miracles done by them, were deſtroyed by the fury of the Pagans,</hi> he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered to paſs through a great fire (made by a pile of Wood) with the head of <hi>Wulfade:</hi> which he ſaid he had brought with him for that very end. But the Pope anſwered as Chriſt did the Devil, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canons did not appoint ſuch trials by fire or water, nor deciſions by ſingle combate; but they were invented by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious men. Yet taking compaſſion upon the great pains he had taken in ſo long a journey; he granted the requeſt; and commanded their names to be put into the Martyrology of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The Procurator and his Companions returning home with great joy, left the head of St. <hi>Wulfade</hi> at <hi>Viterbium</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> as <hi>Leland</hi> concludes the ſtory. Which the other Author explains thus; that in their journey they lay one night in the City <hi>Biterinum</hi> (as he calls it) and, for greater ſecurity, committed the head to be kept for that night, in the Church of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> the Martyr: but in the morning when they came to take it again, they could not with all their might, remove it from the place where they had laid it. And ſo with ſhame and confuſion of face came to their own Country, with the loſs of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61653:123"/>
that Treaſure: it being apparent that their carrying it from Kingdom to Kingdom, through various places (and perhaps for gain, or honour, or favour) was not a thing pleaſing to God and the Holy Martyr <hi>Wulfade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what truth there is in all this, is hard to ſay: <hi>Cedda</hi> or <hi>Chad</hi> being gone from thoſe parts as far as <hi>York,</hi> before <hi>Wul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere</hi>'s Charter to this Church; which, by the ſtory, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been granted immediately upon his going to St. <hi>Chad:</hi> who in his Penance injoyned him, ſayes the laſt Author, <hi>ſub omni celeritate</hi> with all ſpeed, to cauſe Monaſteries to be founded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it bears date DCLXIIII. and <hi>Cedda,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Chronicon Litchfeldenſe</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">MS. in Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Library.</note>, was conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> DCLXIII. Where having governed three year he retired to his Monaſtery of <hi>Leſtingay,</hi> where he had been Abbot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was not ſatisfied, that he had been duly conſecrated. It may be ſuppoſed indeed that before he went to <hi>York,</hi> all thoſe things hapned, between the years DLVI. and DLXIII. But then here is the miſchief of it, that <hi>Jarmannus</hi> (one of thoſe who ſubſcribes <hi>Wulfere</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) was not then Biſhop of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> i. e. of <hi>Litchfield;</hi> for he was made ſo the ſame year <hi>Cedda</hi> went to <hi>York</hi> DLXIII. and yet the ſtory ſayes, that when <hi>Wulfere</hi> was troubled in mind, his Queen wiſht him to be adviſed by the holy Biſhops, <hi>Jermannum &amp; Ceddam.</hi> Which ſuppoſes this to have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cedda</hi> was come back to his old Cell or Monaſtery; that is after the year DLXVI. or in that year: For <hi>Jarmannus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving governed four years, ſaith the <hi>Chronicon Litchfeldenſe,</hi> died, and <hi>Theodore</hi> made <hi>Cedda</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> Anno DLXVII.</p>
            <p>And there is ſtill one difficulty more, that <hi>Cedda,</hi> ſayes the ſtory, commanded <hi>Wulfere</hi> immediately to deſtroy all Idolatry throughout his whole Kingdom: and yet that was not done, if we may believe the Chronicle of our Church <hi>per Johannem Abbatem,</hi> till the laſt year of his Reign DCLXXV. Where his words are <hi>Wlferus Rex Merciorum omnium Ydolorum cultum ex regione fugavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving theſe things therefore in uncertainty, let us paſs to what follows; that <hi>Wulferus</hi> dying <hi>Anno</hi> 675. (as <hi>Bede</hi> ſaith in his Epitome) after he had reigned 17 years; left his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Brother <hi>Etheldred,</hi> or as he calls him <hi>Edilredus:</hi> who Reigning longer, had more time to add what was wanting to the perfecting of this Monaſtery. To which he was the more inclined, becauſe he loved this kind of life ſo much, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his Crown for a Cowl. So Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath obſerved out of <hi>Malmsbury;</hi> and I find the ſame in the <hi>Chron. Joh. Abbatis,</hi> An. DCCIIII. <hi>Ethelredus Rex Merciorum factus Monachus, apud Bardeney.</hi> When he was made <hi>Abbot</hi> of that place it doth not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61653:123"/>
appear: but he tells us that he dyed Abbot the ſame year that <hi>Ethebald</hi> came to the Crown. <hi>Anno</hi> DCCXVI. <hi>Ethelredus quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Rex Abbas de Bardeney obiit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he that contributed the moſt towards the beginning and perfection of this Monaſtery (and indeed towards the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſtianity into theſe parts) was that Noble perſon, who became the firſt Abbot of it,</p>

               <p>Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> calls him <hi>Sexuulfus;</hi> but moſt other Writers <hi>Saxulfus</hi> (or <hi>Saxulphus)</hi> who was ſo far aſſiſting to <hi>Peada</hi> in the foundation of this Monaſtery (which <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith he began to build <hi>per Saxulphum virum potentiſſimum)</hi> that he is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by all ancient Writers <hi>conſtructor</hi> the Builder or at leaſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder of it. In this ſtile the <hi>Chronicon Litchfeldenſe</hi> ſpeaks of him. <hi>Hic erat conſtructor &amp; Abbas Monaſterii de Medamſtede quod nunc Petrusburgh.</hi> And <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> ad An. 680. (ſpeaking of the depoſition of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians)</hi> ſaith that <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ordained in his place <hi>Saxulphum conſtructorem &amp; Abbatem Monaſterii quod dicitur Burch in regione Girviorum.</hi> A great many others ſpeak the ſame Language; and they all have it out of <hi>Bede</hi> L.

Sexuulfus</hi> his ordination to be Biſhop, he gives this character of him, <hi>Qui erat Conſtructor &amp; Abbas quod dicitur Medeſhamſtedi,</hi> &amp;c. And this memory of him continued after the Monaſtery was burnt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> till the time of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored it. For when <hi>Hugo</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Athelwold</hi>'s repairing of <hi>Thornei,</hi> he ſaith he was moved to it, becauſe it had been founded and built by <hi>Saxulf</hi> who was, <hi>primus Abbas &amp; conſtructor Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamſtede.</hi>

               <p>But that which is moſt for the Honour of this Noble perſon, is that he was a great Inſtrument in bringing the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf into the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia.</hi> As appears from the relation of <hi>Hedda,</hi> who lived in or immediately after thoſe times: which ſhow alſo what hand he had in the erection of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'For having told us how <hi>Peada</hi> was converted, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Northern parts, and brought with him hither the <hi>four</hi> Preachers, I before mentioned, he adds, <hi>His acceſſit Comes &amp; Cooperator illuſtris Saxulphus, vir praepotens, &amp; ſeculo &amp; religione, Regiq. &amp; Eccleſiae acceptiſſimus, &amp;c.</hi> To theſe joyned himſelf as a Companion, and Co-worker, <hi>Saxulf,</hi> a very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull man every way, both in Secular and Religious affairs; being no leſs gracious with the King, than acceptable to the Church.

               </p>
               <p>Of what Order theſe Monks were, and under what rule this Monaſtery was founded, I believe no body now can determine. For it doth not follow that becauſe they were <hi>Benedictines</hi> in after ages, they were ſo at the beginning: Nay, it is certain, as I ſhall ſhow in its due place, the Rule of St. <hi>Bennet</hi> was not heard of in <hi>England,</hi> till after the foundation of this Monaſtery. The <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks indeed pretend, for the honour of their Order, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, and his Brethren (who came into <hi>England</hi> between fifty and ſixty years before this <hi>An.</hi> 597) were <hi>Benedictines.</hi> But no ſuch thing appears from any Records, but rather the contrary: for all agree, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was of the ſame Order with him that ſent him, <hi>viz. Gregory</hi> the great: and no leſs man than Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> denies that he was a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine.</hi> It is not certain indeed what Order he was of; for there had been ſo many rules in the World for a long time before him, that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſaith about the year 450, <hi>we ſee almoſt as</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61653:124"/>
                  <hi>many types and rules uſed as there are Monaſteries and Cells.</hi> In <hi>Italy,</hi> it might be eaſily ſhown, there were ſeveral Orders at that very time when <hi>Auſtin</hi> came hither; and had been ſo a good while before that: Out of which great variety they afterward formed the <hi>Regulares Conſuetudines;</hi> which were in ſuch high eſteem, that they always had regard to them, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations which, in proceſs of time, were made in Monaſtical Orders; as ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>All that is proper for this place, is to inquire what Rule was obſerved by the Monks in the North: from whence he came who converted <hi>Peada,</hi> and ſent Preachers to convert the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> Which would prove ſo long a buſineſs, and yet leave us in ſuch uncertainty, that I think fit wholly to omit it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Sexulph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he was advanced to the Epiſcopal Authority the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Author doth not tell us: but we learn it from the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon Litchfeldenſe,</hi> which ſaith it was DCLXXIII. <hi>Sexulfus poſt depoſitionem Winfridi per Theodorum, Epiſcopus Litchfeldiae conſecratus eſt An. Domini DCLXXIII.</hi> which is exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the account given of theſe Matters by V. <hi>Bede</hi> who calls his Predeceſſor by the name of <hi>Winfridus,</hi> whom other later Writers call <hi>Wilfridus,</hi> and <hi>Wolfridus:</hi> who was depoſed, they all ſay, by <hi>Theodore, ob meritum cujuſdam inobedientiae;</hi> but do not tell us what that diſobedience was, which deſerved ſo great a puniſhment. For he was eſteemed a good man, and had been Deacon to St. <hi>Chad,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> tells us: and thought worthy to be his Succeſſor in the Epiſcopal See; to which he was promoted <hi>An.</hi> DCLXX. and within <hi>three</hi> years time removed. <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> indeed ſaith it was not till the year DCLXXX. Where he hath theſe words, <hi>Offenſus Wilfrido Merciorum Epiſcopo per meritum cujuſdam inobedientiae Theodorus Dorobernenſis Archiepiſcopus, Eum de Epiſcopatu depoſuit, &amp; in loco ejus Saxulfum Epiſcopum ordinavit, Conſtructorem &amp; Abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Monaſterii quod dicitur Burch, in regione Girviorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whenſoever this was, it is certain <hi>Sexulfus</hi> was his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; and is reckoned the <hi>Seventh</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> or of <hi>Litchfield.</hi> For <hi>Duina</hi> a Scotch man was the firſt Biſhop of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Lindifararians</hi> (as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks <note n="*" place="margin">Chron. Litchf.</note>) the paucity of Prieſts in thoſe days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to ſet one Biſhop over divers people: who having governed two years, dyed DCLVIII. and had another of the ſame Nation his Succeſſor, called <hi>Cellach;</hi> who left it preſently and returned to his Iſland <hi>Hii</hi> DCLIX. And then came <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi> an Engliſhman, but ordained by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who dyed DCLXII. And then <hi>Jarmannus</hi> who dyed DCLXVII. to whom ſucceeded <hi>Cedda,</hi> or <hi>Ceadda</hi> (as <hi>Bede</hi> calls him) who was the <hi>fifth</hi> Biſhop (not the <hi>firſt</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath it) and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61653:125"/>
dyed DCLXX. And then, as I have ſaid, followed <hi>Winfrid,</hi> and after him <hi>Saxulf,</hi> who <hi>flentibus &amp; moerentibus</hi> (as <hi>Hugo</hi>'s words are) <hi>ejus Monaſterii fratribus, eligitur ad Epiſcopatum Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterraneorum Anglorum, &amp; Merciorum, ſimul &amp; Lindisfarorum.</hi> By which it appears that the people of thoſe different regions ſtill continued under the ſame Biſhop. But in <hi>Saxulph</hi>'s time a great and happy alteration was made, by the increaſe, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of Prieſts; and of ſuch Prieſts as were fit to be advanced to the Epiſcopal charge. For the Biſhoprick of the <hi>Mercians</hi> (to ſay nothing of <hi>Lindsfarn)</hi> was in his days divided <hi>in quinque Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> (into five Dioceſſes, as we now ſpeak) in <hi>Herefordenſem, Wigornenſem, Lichfeldenſem, Legeceſtrenſem, &amp; Lindifienſem.</hi> Two of which, it ſhould ſeem by the forenamed Chronicle, <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulphus</hi> governed, <hi>viz. Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Leogaſtre;</hi> which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided after his death between two, <hi>Hedda</hi> and <hi>Wilfrid:</hi> but upon the death of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> again united in <hi>Hedda</hi> who governed both Dioceſſes. By which <hi>Hedda</hi> the Church of <hi>Lichfield</hi> was built <hi>ſecundo Kal. Januarii An.</hi> DCC. and the body of St. <hi>Chad</hi> tranſlated into it.</p>
               <p>By all which it is evident that paſſage in Mr. <hi>G.</hi> p. 3. muſt be corrected, that S. <hi>Chad was firſt Biſhop of Litchfield, where he founded the Cathedral Church. Bede</hi> ſaith no ſuch thing in the place quoted in the Margin, but rather the contrary; <hi>that he had his Epiſcopal See at</hi> Litchfield, <hi>where he dyed and was buried nigh the Church of St.</hi> Mary, <hi>and afterward, (viz.</hi> by <hi>Hedda</hi> as I have ſhown) <hi>the Church of bleſſed St.</hi> Peter <hi>being built, his bones were tranſlated thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How long <hi>Saxulf</hi> governed this Church is not certain. The forenamed <hi>Chronicon</hi> ſaith he dyed DCLXXIIII. but it ſhould be DCLXXXIIII. I make no doubt. For all agree he was alive when <hi>Edilred,</hi> waſting the Country of <hi>Kent</hi> and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches and Monaſteries, made <hi>Putta</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſeek for ſafety elſe where, and at laſt betake himſelf <hi>ad Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulfum Merciorum Antiſtitem,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> tells <hi>(L. IV. C.</hi> 12.) and this was in the year DCLXXVII. He was witneſs alſo to the Priviledge granted by Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> as I ſhowed before; which was DCLXXX. in which year the forementioned diviſion of the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians</hi> into five Dioceſſes, was made, as we learn from the <hi>MS.</hi> Chronicle of <hi>John</hi> Abbot. Whoſe words are <hi>An.</hi> DCLXXX. <hi>Regio Merciorum in V.

               <p>I obſerved before out of <hi>Hedda</hi>'s relation, how other Convents began to ſpring out of this, as Daughters from a fruitfull Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the time of <hi>Sexulf.</hi> Which grew ſo conſiderable in the time of <hi>Cuthbaldus,</hi> that they could not any longer be well governed by him; but deſired, as many other places did, an <hi>Abbot</hi> to be appointed over them out of this Monaſtery of <hi>Mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamſtede.</hi> So <hi>Hugo</hi> reports it (not as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſays, that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have him for their Abbot, he being ſo already, but) that they thought themſelves happy and bleſſed, who could receive either Abbot or Monk, from their firſt Mother; who might dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inſtruct them and preſide over them. Whence it came to paſs, ſaith he, that from this Monaſtery many others were built, and both Monks and Abbots appointed out of the ſame Congregation, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Ancarig, al.

               <p>Which is not to be underſtood, as if they became wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon this Mother Monaſtery; for they ſtill continued ſubject to it, as the manner was, in after times, for ſmall Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, which had been drawn, as Colonies, out of a greater, to be under the command of that from whence they were derived: being as ſo many Cells, and members of it.

And afterward this Honourable Abbot <hi>Hedda</hi> (as the Book calls him fol.

               <p>The ſame <hi>Hedda,</hi> if I miſtake not, was Abbot alſo of other two places before mentioned, called <hi>Wermundſhey</hi> and <hi>Wokinges;</hi> for I find a Bull of Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s about the Epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over theſe places <hi>fol.</hi> LXXXVI. directed unto him; which I have not room to ſet down at large, but only note that they are both ſaid there to be found <hi>in nomine beati Petri Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoli,</hi> in the name of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> Which makes it probable they were thoſe belonging to this Church, under the Government of this great man <hi>Hedda.</hi> Whom I take to have been the Author of the Relation above named, concerning the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity in theſe parts of <hi>England:</hi> and the next Biſhop that ſucceeded <hi>Sexulf,</hi> in the See of <hi>Litchfield:</hi> who built that Church as I have already ſaid, and dyed DCCXXI.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Cutbaldus</hi> dyed I am not able to affirm certainly; but it was between the year DCCIX. and DCCXVI.

               <p>This great man <hi>Adelwold</hi> was at firſt a Monk in the Abbey of <hi>Glaſtonberry:</hi> where, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> relates <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>, the Abbot had a dream repreſenting to him, how excellent a perſon this Monk would prove. For he thought he ſaw a Tree ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up within the Walls of the Abbey, which ſpread its branches, to all the four quarters of the World; and had all its leaves co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with <hi>Cowles;</hi> a very great <hi>Cowle</hi> being placed at the top of all. At which being amazed, an old man, he thought, told him, that the great <hi>Cowle</hi> was <hi>Athelwold;</hi> and the reſt were innumerable Monks, whom he ſhould attract by his example. Conſonant to which was a viſion his Mother had, when ſhe was with Child of him; with which I ſhall not trouble the Reader, but only note that it ſignified the large extent of his mind in this ſort of Charity: which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no leſs than <hi>forty</hi> Monaſteries, as all our Writers report.

So his words are in the Book before named (of the Acts of the Biſhops of <hi>England)</hi> it might ſeem a wonder he ſhould do ſuch things, <hi>niſi quod Rex Edgar omnino ejus voluntati deditus erat, à quo ſuper omnes infra Dunſtanum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeretur.</hi> And therefore the Abbot of <hi>Rieval</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. de genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.

Which <hi>Athelwold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Malmsbury</hi> L. IV. <hi>de geſtis Potif.

And this account alſo <hi>John Bromton</hi> Abbot of <hi>Joreval</hi> gives of this matter, who having ſaid that King <hi>Edgar</hi> built and repaired above forty Monaſteries, adds, <hi>Inter quae, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio &amp; monitione Sancti Ethelwoldi Wintonienſis Epiſc.

               <p>And here now, it may be fit to note that, in all probability the Monks of this Church were brought under the rule of St. <hi>Benedict;</hi> when it was reſtored, as hath been ſaid, by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and put under the government of <hi>Adulphus;</hi> and not till then.

                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:61653:130"/>
And after the death of <hi>Deuſdedit,</hi> was ſent for by <hi>Ecbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent;</hi> where he went up and down through his Country (ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>C.</hi> 14.) <hi>Et cum regula Benedicti inſtituta Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum benè melioravit,</hi> and very much improved the Orders of the Churches, by the Rule of <hi>Benedict:</hi> which he had learnt beyond Sea, being ſo much addicted to foreign cuſtoms; that he refuſed to be conſecrated by our Biſhops, and deſired to be conſecrated in <hi>France,</hi> when he was to ſucceed <hi>Colman.</hi> This paſſage is much to be obſerved, for it appears thereby the Churches he viſited were already under Rules and Inſtitutions before he came to them: who only bettered them by this Rule of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> but did not bring thoſe Churches under it. And as this was all he did, ſo what he did was in the Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> alone, not all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> over. And ſo as the <hi>Chronologia Auguſtinenſis</hi> is to be underſtood in theſe words<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Inter Decem Scriptores</hi> p. 2232.</note>, <hi>Wilfridus Epiſcopus regulam Sancti Benedicti fecit in Anglia obſervari</hi> ad An. 666. that is, in theſe parts of <hi>England:</hi> for in the midland parts, it was little known for ſeveral years after. As appears by the Bull of Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> An. DCCIX. (the very year wherein <hi>Wilfrid</hi> died) to <hi>Kenred</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians, Offa</hi> his Son, and <hi>Egwin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> for the Monaſtery of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham:</hi> which ſaith the Monks were to live under the rule <hi>Patris Benedicti, quae minus in illis partibus adhuc habetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo it continued to be little known for above two hundred years. For <hi>Oſwald</hi> (whom <hi>Adulphus</hi> ſucceeded in the See of <hi>York)</hi> who had been Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> before he went to <hi>York,</hi> was the man who brought it hither from the Abby of <hi>Fleury</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he had been a Monk. So <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> expreſly teſtifies in his <hi>Third</hi> Book <hi>de geſtis Pontif. Angl.</hi> where, not far from the beginning, he ſaith that <hi>Oſwald,</hi> being Nephew to <hi>Odo</hi> the Archbiſhop, was bred up in his Youth <hi>apud Floriacum in Gallia,</hi> taking upon him the habit of a Monk, as the cuſtom of that time was for all that were piouſly diſpoſed, in the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Convent. <hi>A quo</hi> (viz. <hi>Oſwald) Religionis hujus manavit exordium,</hi> as his words are in the <hi>MS.</hi> Copy, in Sir <hi>J.

Which are the more remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very ſame <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> had a little before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> bragging that he was the firſt who commanded the rule of St. <hi>Bennet</hi> to be obſerved by the Monks.</p>
               <p>But after all this there was no general Conſtitution for our Monaſteries, till the <hi>Second</hi> Reformation of the ancient Engliſh Monkery, which was in the Council of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> An. 965. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>Edgar</hi> the great reſtorer, as hath been ſaid, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries. When there was framed a general Conſtitution; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Rule of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and partly out of the <hi>antient cuſtoms</hi> before mentioned; which was called <hi>Regularis Concordia Anglicae Nationis,</hi> and may be found in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s <hi>Spicilegium</hi> to <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> both in <hi>Saxon</hi> and in Latin.

was called <hi>Oſwald</hi>'s <hi>Law</hi> (as Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> obſerves) he being then Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> (to which he was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the inſtance of St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> An. 960 <note n="*" place="margin">

And immediatly ſent for ſome Monks of <hi>Fleury</hi> and from <hi>Gent,</hi> to adviſe withal about this matter: who, as Bees ſuck their honey out of ſeveral Flowers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed theſe Conſtitutions out of ſeveral former Rules. And more particularly took care about the ſinging uſed in Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>All which conſidered, I look upon it as highly probable, that this Monaſtery of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> now became ſubject to this Rule, being one of thoſe reſtored by King <hi>Edgar.</hi> And yet it was not the very Rule of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> which was eſtabliſhed in this Council; but many ancient Orders and Cuſtoms, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that Rule and accommodated to his Precepts.</p>
               <p>For long after this when there was a <hi>Third</hi> Regulation of Monaſteries under <hi>Lanfranc.</hi> An. 1075 in the Council of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> when ſeveral things were reſtored (as the words are) which had been defined by ancient Canons, the Council (after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Epiſcopal affairs) decrees concerning Monks, <hi>ex Regula Benedicti, Dialogo Gregorii, &amp; antiqua Regularium loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conſuetudine,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> obſerves: From which Sir <hi>John Marſham</hi> judiciouſly concludes (in his large Preface before the <hi>Monaſticon)</hi> that even in the <hi>Norman</hi> times, the Monaſtical Laws were mixed; and that the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Rule was not ſo admitted, as that the antient cuſtoms of the Monks were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abrogated.</p>
               <p>I have noted already the day and year when <hi>Adulphus</hi> dyed; but there is a miſtake I ſince find in the day; which if the Records of our Church be true, was <hi>June</hi> 5. when he was ſolemnly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61653:131"/>
in this Monaſtery: and is the very firſt Abbot of whom there is any mention made in the <hi>Kalender</hi> of this Church; which is ſtill preſerved in the Library of his Grace the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> of which I ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in its proper place.

               <p>The Character which <hi>Hugo</hi> gives of this Abbot (who was choſen by the unanimous conſent of the Friers, and the favour of King <hi>Edgar)</hi> is that he was, <hi>Flos literalis diſciplinae, torrens eloquentiae, decus &amp; norma rerum divinarum &amp; ſecularium;</hi> which was the cauſe of that general concourſe from all parts <hi>ad ejus Magiſterium;</hi> which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath obſerved.

               <p>That he ſurrounded the Monaſtery with a Wall, is certain: but that it was thence called <hi>Burch</hi> or <hi>Burgh</hi> as <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Malmſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> writes, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> juſtly doubts: For King <hi>Edgar</hi> in his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calls it upon its reſtauration, by this name of <hi>Burch.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this name <hi>Burh,</hi> and <hi>Burgh,</hi> and <hi>Byrigh,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any place which was walled about, and particularly a City, or Caſtle (from the Saxon word <hi>Deorgan,</hi> which ſignifies to defend, or take into ſafety) <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> might mean that the place did not deſerve the name of <hi>Burch</hi> till this time.

Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath related how he laboured to inrich this Church with Reliques (and <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith, many other ways) but is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken I think in his conjecture about his procuring the Arm of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> to be brought hither.

               <p>How they came to have his Arm at <hi>Bebbeburch</hi> (a place in the North) I cannot imagine, if it be true which the MS.

               <p>St. <hi>Pege,</hi> as <hi>Ingulphus</hi> informs us, was Siſter to St. <hi>Guthlac,</hi> a perſon deſcended of a noble Stock, both by the Father and Mother (as <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> writes) who being in love with a ſolitary life, ſetled himſelf in the Iſland called <hi>Croyland,</hi> where no body durſt dwell: becauſe they were terrified, as his words are, with phantaſies of Devils there inhabiting.

For though the Church of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> had the greateſt intereſt in that place (and ſtill hath the Mannor and Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Peykyrke)</hi> yet the Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> alſo had ſome Land there by an antient right. Which appears from an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made between <hi>John de Says</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> and <hi>Godfrey</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> in the year MCXVI. <hi>in coemiterio de Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirche,</hi> in the Church-yard of <hi>Peykyrke:</hi> where there were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints on both ſides <hi>de Sochemannis.</hi> For the Abbot of <hi>Croylande</hi> had antiently (as the agreement acknowledges) a certain Court in that Village, in which were his Houſes, <hi>de qua nulla ſoca Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Sancti Petri de Burgo reddi debebat.</hi> But all the reſt of the Land in the Village, <hi>de ſoca Sancti Petri de Burgo erat, &amp; conſuetudines ſocae Abbati &amp; Monachis reddebat.</hi> Now the Monks of <hi>Croylande</hi> complained that ſome did unjuſtly <hi>intra ſepta ſuae curiae hoſpitari,</hi> whereas they ought to have in that Court, <hi>octo hoſpitum domos quietas, &amp; ſine ſoca.</hi> And therefore they came at laſt to this concluſion, that it was acknowledged upon Oath, that all the Land was <hi>in ſoca Sancti Petri</hi> (except that antient Court, and the eight houſes therein) the Houſe of the Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> himſelf not excepted.

                  <hi>John Brompton</hi> places this reſignation in the year 1057. (the very year <hi>Leofricus</hi> was made Abbot) which agrees with <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Dunelmenſis</hi> (who ſhould beſt know) who ſaith after he had been Biſhop <hi>fifteen</hi> year, he returned to his Monaſtery;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61653:135"/>
whither he had ſent his Gold and Silver, and other Goods of the Church of <hi>Durham</hi> before. The Gold and Silver, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, was found as he was digging very deep to lay the foundation of a Church of Stone, in honour of St. <hi>Cutberd,</hi> which before was of Wood: but he ſaith it had been formerly hidden there by the Church of <hi>Durham,</hi> becauſe of the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tyranny of <hi>Sephelmus.</hi> And therefore though he did good Works with this money (which he immediately ſent away to <hi>Burgh,</hi> intending to follow it himſelf) making Highways with Wood and Stone in the fenny Countries; building Churches, and other things; yet in the Reign of the Conqueror he was accuſed for carrying away this Treaſure, which he would not reſtore; and being brought up to <hi>London</hi> and committed to cuſtody, there he died <hi>in captione Regis,</hi> as <hi>Symeon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> tells the ſtory <note n="*" place="margin">

The Character he gives of him is this; that he always lived like a Monk, moſt abſtemiouſly and Holily. So that when his Clergy, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily had a ſplendid Table, he contented himſelf with coarſe and Barly Bread; and with the viler ſort of meat and drink. And walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot from Town to Town, Preaching and giving Alms, he often went bare-foot: and commonly travelled in the nights, that he might avoid vain-glory.

               <p>The mention of him puts me in mind of another of that name who was bred in this Monaſtery; and therefore ought not to be here omitted.

For that very year (1069) the <hi>Danes</hi> returned to infeſt <hi>England,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Suenus</hi> (Abbot <hi>John</hi> ſaith the Sons of <hi>Swane)</hi> their King, with a very great Army. Part of which under <hi>Osbern</hi> came to <hi>Eli,</hi> and was preſently re-inforced by <hi>Hereward de Wake</hi> and his aſſociates, who came and joyned with them. He was a very great man, called by one of our beſt Hiſtorians, <hi>vir Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reniſſimus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Walſingham.</note>; who at his return out of <hi>Flanders</hi> (where he had been for a while) hearing how much his Family and Kindred had ſuffered by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and finding <hi>Ivo Talbois</hi> the Conqueror's Siſters Son, poſſeſſed of his Eſtate (the Conqueror having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Ivo</hi> large poſſeſſions in <hi>Holland)</hi> was extreamly inraged thereat: and reſolved by force of Arms to recover his own, though with the havock and ſpoil of other people. I cannot ſay that this place felt the firſt effects of his fury, but here he diſcharged it after a moſt terrible manner, as <hi>Hugo</hi> relates the ſtory. For he it was that invited and incited alſo <hi>Osbern</hi> and his <hi>Danes</hi> to go and plunder this Abby: where he heard the Abbot his Uncle was dead, and the place filled with a <hi>Norman</hi> (whom he accounted an intruder) and he a very ſevere man; who lay then with ſome Souldiers at <hi>Stamford.</hi> They came therefore with great ſpeed; though not ſo haſtily, but the Monks of <hi>Burgh</hi> had ſome notice: ſo that the Sacriſt, called <hi>Ywarus,</hi> by the Counſel of the Monks carried away all that he could, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Texts of the Goſpel, with the Cheſibles, Copes, and Albes,</hi> &amp;c. and went with them to the Abbot <hi>Turoldus</hi> at <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The very ſame morning came <hi>Hereward</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Boats; againſt whom the Monks maintained the Cloſe ſo ſtoutly (as is obſerved out of him by Mr. <hi>G.)</hi> that he had no way but to ſet fire to the Houſes near the Gate; by which means his Forces entred, and burnt all the Offices of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery and the whole Town, except the Church and one Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:61653:138"/>
The Monks therefore beſought them to be favourable to it; but they, not regarding their cries, entred armed into it, and indeavoured to carry away the great Croſs, but could not. Yet they took the golden Crown from the head of the Crucifix; with the pretious Stones, and the Footſtool under its feet, made of pure Gold and Gemms: together with <hi>duo aurea feretra</hi> (two golden or gilded <hi>Bears</hi> whereon they carried the Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and other ſuch like things in Proceſſion) and <hi>nine</hi> Silver ones, and twelve Croſſes, ſome of Gold, ſome of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And beſides all this, went up into the <hi>Tower</hi> and took away the great Table, which the Monks had hidden there; which was all of Gold and Silver and pretious Stone, and wont to be before the Altar: with abundance of Books and other pretious things, which were invaluable; there being not the like in all <hi>England.</hi> And they pretended to do all this, out of faithfulneſs to the Church; for the <hi>Danes,</hi> they told them, would preſerve theſe things for the uſe of the Church, better than the <hi>Franks</hi> would do. Nay, <hi>Hereward</hi> himſelf was <hi>Homo Monachorum</hi> a lover of Monks, and therefore ſome believed what they ſaid; and he alſo afterwards ſwore, that he did all this with a good intention; becauſe he thought <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror would get it all. Away they went therefore with their Booty, and made all the haſt they could to their Ships; fearing the <hi>Normans</hi> might fall upon them: and coming to <hi>Eli,</hi> they committed all their ſpoil into the hands of the <hi>Danes</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>What became of it, Mr. <hi>Gunton</hi> hath largely enough rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Hugo.</hi> Which doth ſo little agree with what I find in the life of <hi>Hereward de Wake,</hi> that we muſt ſuppoſe all this to have been done (if he was not miſtaken in his ſtory) in the year 1070. and that he came again and ſpoiled this Church after the Goods, which remained were reſtored; as I ſhall ſhow preſently, when I have finiſhed the foregoing Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. Which ſaith that <hi>Turoldus</hi> came to the Abby the very ſame day the <hi>Danes</hi> went away, with an hundred and ſixty <hi>Normans</hi> well armed; hoping to meet with the Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they carried off their prey: but found no body there, and the place laid deſolate; all being burnt both within and without, except the Church. Inſomuch that the City not long ago, called <hi>aurea,</hi> was now made <hi>pauperrima.</hi> But the Abbot being come, the Monks, who had been ſcattered, returned; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed divine Offices, which had been diſcontinued <hi>ſeven</hi> dayes.

               </p>
               <p>This I learn out of a Treatiſe at the end of <hi>Swapham,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>de geſtis Heruuardi inclyti militis,</hi> gathered out of ſuch frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as could be found of a Book written in the Engliſh tongue, by <hi>Alefricus Diaconus,</hi> who was <hi>Hereward</hi>'s Prieſt at <hi>Brun.</hi> Who ſays this great Army gathered out of thoſe ſeverai Counties, was lead by <hi>Turoldus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burch,</hi> and <hi>Yvo Talbois;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed <hi>Hereward</hi> and his men ſo ſtrictly, that they greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed them.

This he continued to do, after ſeveral manners, all the day long, till he had tyred the oppoſite Army, and made them raiſe their Siege. And then <hi>Hereward,</hi> with all his men, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out upon their Rere all at once, put them into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that he took many of them Priſoners; and among the reſt Abbot <hi>Turoldus.</hi> Whom he kept in Cuſtody till he redeemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and other conſiderable perſons with the ſumm of <hi>three thouſand</hi> Marks of Silver.

But the next night (if we may believe this Writer) <hi>Hereward</hi> thought he ſaw in his dream an old man, of ineſtimable beauty, and in brighter habit than he had ever beheld or imagined, with a terrible countenance, threatning him (with a great Key he held in his hand, and with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful voice) that he ſhould immediately reſtore all he had taken out of the Church, if he loved his life. Whereupon he roſe up the very ſame hour, and carrying back all that he had pillaged, immediately departed from <hi>Burgh.</hi> But loſt his way in the night, and wandred up and down in the Woods, not knowing whither he went; till a vaſt Wolf appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who marched before them like a houſhold Dog, and led them into their right way: As they ſaw by lighted Candles which appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every mans Shield; which none of them could pull off or blow out. But when morning appeared, both Wolf and Candles vaniſhed, and they came whither they deſired beyond <hi>Stamford.</hi>

               <p>He relates many other wonderful atchievements of this famous War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior (who was accounted the <hi>Hector</hi> of his time) and at laſt ſhows how he was reconciled to the King, and ſerved him faithfully: having all his Fathers Lands and Poſſeſſions reſtored to him; and living comfortably and peace ably with his Countrymen and Friends, dyedin peace, after he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many Years. Other Writers ſay, he having taken <hi>Ivo Talbois</hi> in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, would not deliver him, until the King (to have his Nephew preſerved) promiſed by Oath unto <hi>Hereward</hi> Reconciliation, Pardon, his former dignity, with full reſtitution of all that had been his. Which was done in the year 1076. Until which time from the death of <hi>Brando,</hi> not only this Monaſtery but others alſo ſuffered very much. For in the year 1070. many Abbots as well as Biſhops by the Kings procurement, were depoſed or ejected, upon ſlight ſurmiſes, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be deprived of all dignities. So <hi>John</hi> Abbot; who after he had related how <hi>Stigandus</hi> was depoſed, to make way for <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> adds, <hi>Plures eo anno tam Epiſcopi quam Abbates vel nullis vel levibus ſuſpitionibus depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur, aut ejiciuntr; procurante Rege, ut Angli nullis dignitatibus poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur.</hi>

               <p>What became of him afterward I do not find.

He was thought to have the Spirit of Prophecy; being able to tell before hand when any of the Monks would dye, and having had other things to come, ſhown him by Viſions, which they took to be from God. Particularly, one night he thought he was in the Porch of St. <hi>Andrew (adhuc ſtante vetere Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterio)</hi> and that two honourable perſons appeared to him, and ſat down there; clothed in <hi>Albes,</hi> and <hi>Chiſibles,</hi> and having on Epiſcopal <hi>Palls,</hi> and <hi>Miters</hi> upon their Heads. Who called to him, and named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Kynſinus</hi> and <hi>Elfuricus</hi> (who as I noted before lye buried together) bidding him call thither ſeveral of the Seniors of the Church; <hi>Adelwoldus</hi> the Prior by name, and then divers other, all honourable perſons: (whom <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith he himſelf had ſeen) who being come before them, they bad <hi>Remaldus</hi> go out, for he could not yet come to them. And all thoſe who were thus called, dyed, one after another, in the ſame order wherein he had ſeen them come to them.</p>
               <p>Other Stories he tells of like nature, and then returns to <hi>Ernulfus,</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had not been ſo much beloved: for by this means they loſt him, and he was preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in the year 1115. Abbot <hi>John</hi> in his MS. <hi>Chron.</hi> ſaith 1114. and they agree well enough; he being choſen one year and Conſecrated the following. So I learn out of <hi>Symeon Dunelmenſis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De geſtis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Angliae.</note>; who ſaith, <hi>ad An.</hi> 1114. that on the day of the Aſſumption of St. <hi>Mary, Arnulphus Abbas de Burh, ad Hrofen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem Eccleſiam eligitur Epiſcopus</hi> (where, by the way, it may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this way of writing <hi>Roffenſem,</hi> cauſed the miſtake in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hiſtory of <hi>Hoveden,</hi> which ſaith he was choſen in <hi>Herefordenſem Epiſcopum).</hi> And then <hi>An.</hi> 1115. the ſame <hi>Symeon</hi> ſaith, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ordained this <hi>Arnulphus</hi> Abbot <hi>de Burh, ad Hrofenſem Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am die Sancti Stephani Martyris,</hi> in Chriſts Church at <hi>Canterbury. Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> ſpeaks of the ſame Conſecration, and calls him <hi>Abbatem Burchorum</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 110, 111.</note>, and <hi>Abbatem de Burcho.</hi> And by comparing this with what was now ſaid by <hi>Symeon,</hi> we may obſerve that <hi>Burh,</hi> and <hi>Burch,</hi> and <hi>Burg,</hi> are uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently when Writers ſpeak of this place.</p>
               <p>In this year wherein he left this place, 1114. it was that he got a Charter from King <hi>Henry,</hi> I. for the holding a great many Lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſpecified; and in the ſame right, and with the ſame Cuſtoms and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61653:142"/>
wherein they were held, <hi>die ipſo quo Thuraldus Abbas vivus fuit, &amp; mortuus habuerit:</hi> from whoſe time little had been done by any Abbot till now. This was ſeconded with many other Grants full of great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: and at laſt in a diſtinct Charter he gives to the Abbot, <hi>Mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium ſuum de Pichelee, quod Galfridus Ridellus de eo tenuit, cum tota inſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione quae in manerio erat, die quo fuit vivus &amp; mortuus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was confirmed by King <hi>Stephen</hi> (that I may put all belonging to this matter together) in following times; that they ſhould have their Mannor <hi>de Pichelle, quod Henricus Rex eis reddidit &amp; conceſſit, &amp; charta ſua confirmavit, quod oculis meis vidi,</hi> &amp;c. And afterwards <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame in theſe words, <hi>Sciatis me conceſſiſſe Eccleſiae &amp; Abbati de Burgo Manerium ſuum Pihtiſlea, quod Galfridus Riddel de eo tenuit, ſicut Charta Henrici Regis avi noſtri teſtatur,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Two years before this, there was an alteration made in the Churches and Chappells built by the <hi>Milites</hi> in the time of <hi>Turoldus.</hi> For now, in the year 1112. ſome of them (whoſe profits had hitherto been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intirely by the Monaſtery) were aſſigned to the uſe of thoſe that miniſtred in thoſe Churches, and ſerved in the Chappels. Who were there appointed to adminiſter the Eccleſiaſtical Sacraments to the people; it being too far for them to come to <hi>Burg,</hi> and the ways alſo dangerous. But there were referred to the Church of <hi>Burg,</hi> two parts of the predial Tythes of thoſe <hi>Milites;</hi> and ſaved to the ſame Church the Sepulture of the aforeſaid <hi>Milites,</hi> their Wives and their Children, and a certain portion of their Goods thereupon: ſaving alſo to the Church of <hi>Burg,</hi> from ſome of the Churches ſo indowed, certain Penſions which had been paid to it from the Foundation.</p>
               <p>Then followed the Convention made before <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> between <hi>Ernulphus</hi> and the Monks, and the <hi>Milites</hi> of the ſame Church, that every Knight ſhould give two parts of his Tythes to the <hi>Sacriſtry</hi> of <hi>Burgh:</hi> and when he dyed, <hi>tertia pars ſubſtantiae ſuae ad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulturam, cum militaribus indumentis, tam in equis quam in armis;</hi> which were to be brought to his Funeral with him. And then a Solemn Proceſſion was to be made by the whole Convent before him; and a plenary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice celebrated, for him by all; and he was to partake, both himſelf, and his Wife, and their Children, of the benefits of the place for ever: <hi>viz. in Eleemoſynis, in celebratione Miſſaram, in jejuniis, in vigiliis, in Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiis, &amp; in caeteris bonis quae, Deo annuente, uſquequaque in Eccleſia Sancti Petri fiant.</hi> In like manner their Wives and their Children, it was agreed, ſhould be brought, with their ſubſtance belonging to them, to the ſame Church in the end of their life: And the Divine vengeance they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might light upon them, who made void this agreement.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year the dedication of the Church of <hi>Turleby</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Gunton,</hi> was made by the ſame Biſhop: In whoſe preſence and in the preſence of the whole Pariſh, <hi>Bencelina,</hi> Mother of <hi>Ralph de la Mare,</hi> granted to that Church, for the health of her own Soul and of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>dimidiam bovatam terrae, &amp; unam acram prati,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He lived after he went to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſome days above <hi>Nine</hi> years, and dyed leaving many Monuments of his vertue, in the 84. year of his age.

               <p>This Abbot (whom our Writers call <hi>John de Sais,</hi> or <hi>Says)</hi> was no ſooner appointed by the King to ſucceed <hi>Ernulphus,</hi> but he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury (Radulphus)</hi> to fetch his Pall from Pope <hi>Paſchal.</hi> So <hi>Hugo</hi> (or <hi>Sawpham,</hi> as it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought) expreſly tells us; and names two perſons who were ſent with him, <hi>Guarnerius,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Archidiaconus,</hi> Nephew to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop: which makes it the more ſtrange that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſhould overlook this paſſage, ſo as not to find to what end he was ſent. <hi>Eadmerus</hi> alſo relates the ſame, from whom we learn alſo why he was called <hi>John de Says:</hi> for he calls him <hi>Johannes Monachus Sagii,</hi> who being elected and Conſecrated <hi>Abbas Burchorum,</hi> was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Warnerius</hi> a Monk of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Clericus</hi> Nephew to the Archbiſhop, upon the buſineſs before named. Which they effected in little more than a years time; for <hi>Radulphus</hi> was Conſecrated (as <hi>Radulph. de Diceto</hi> informs us) on the 6. of the Kal. of <hi>May,</hi> and received the Pall on the 5. Kal. of <hi>July.</hi> Agreeable unto which, <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith, the Abbot returned to the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the next year after he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> One reaſon I believe why he was choſe to be ſent upon this errand, was, that he had been an old acquaintance of the Archbiſhops, bred in the ſame Monaſtery; where <hi>Radulphus</hi> had been Abbot, as <hi>John</hi> had been Monk. For ſo I find him called by <hi>Gervaſius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Actus Pontif. Cantuar.</note>, <hi>Radulphus Abbas Sagienſis:</hi> and by <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> alſo <hi>ad An.</hi> 1104. Where he ſpeaks of the body of St. <hi>Cutbert</hi> being found incorrupt (after he had been buried above 400. years) <hi>a Radulfo Sagienſi Abbate, poſtmodum Hrofenſi Epiſcopo, &amp; deinde Cantuarienſi Archiepiſcopo</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">De geſtis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Angliae.</note>. From this place, I doubt not that is from <hi>Say</hi> or <hi>Says</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> he had the name of <hi>Says</hi> or <hi>Sais:</hi> and is by miſtake called <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which they fancied was contracted into <hi>Sais.</hi> This muſt be corrected therefore in Mr. <hi>G.</hi> for <hi>Sagiuſn</hi> is not <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> but <hi>Say:</hi> where he was bred, and perhaps born. And it is very likely was the Author of that contract of mutual Friendſhip, which was between this Monaſtery and that of <hi>Sais.</hi> For ſo I find in our Records <hi>fol.</hi> CCLXXIV. among divers Conventions which were made between the Friers of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Burch,</hi> and a great many other Churches, there is one <hi>cum fratribus noſtris de Sais.</hi> Wherein they ingaged when any Monk dyed in either Church, three plenary Offices ſhould be ſaid for him by the other Church; and every Prieſt ſhould ſing three Maſſes for him: and they that did not ſing Maſs, ſhould ſay the whole Pſalter.</p>
               <p>The next year after his return, <hi>An.</hi> 1116. I find he cleared the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of the yearly payment of forty ſhillings, which <hi>Azeo Wardeden</hi> had long unjuſtly claimed from it. For upon a full hearing of the difference between them, before King <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Bramton,</hi> the Biſhop and Barons then preſent in Court, judged that <hi>Azeo</hi> had no right to the aforeſaid forty Shillings; and ſo <hi>Abbas Johannes diſraiſniavit</hi> (as the word is) <hi>apud Bramtonam in curia Regis, quadraginta ſolidos quod Azeo Wardeden</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo <hi>Wardede) diu injuſte habuerat,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">

I have obſerved before, in the life of <hi>Elfinus,</hi> how the ſame year 1116. he made an end of a controverſie with the Church of <hi>Croyland:</hi> where there is the ſame phraſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61653:143"/>
                  <hi>diſrainiatum fuit,</hi> for diſproving; and by ſhowing the contrary to clear the Abby from pretended claims.</p>
               <p>But before this year ended, that dreadful fire hapned, which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Mr. <hi>G</hi> out of <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Witleſea:</hi> who doth not tell the ſtory ſo exactly as it is in <hi>Hugo.</hi> From whom we learn that it burſt out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond of the Nones of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (as the <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot alſo relates) in the Vigils of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> King and Martyr after this manner.</p>
               <p>The Friers having been in the <hi>Refectory</hi> that morning to mend the Tables, the Abbot not liking what they had done, fell a Curſing; and ſtraightway went out <hi>ad placitum apud Caſtre,</hi> to keep a Court at <hi>Caſter.</hi> And one of the Servants in the Bakehouſe making a Fire, which he could not kindle ſo ſoon as he deſired, in an angry fit, curſed alſo; and ſaid, <hi>Come Devil and blow the fire.</hi> Whereupon the flame inſtantly broke out and ran to the very top of the houſe, and through all the Offices, to the neighbouring Town: which <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; but Abbot <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon</hi> ſaith, only a great part of it, <hi>Magna pars villae adjacentis,</hi> &amp;c. And thus was fulfilled the <hi>ſecond</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of <hi>Elricus</hi> (mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> in the life of <hi>Leofricus)</hi> who ſaid the Church ſhould be ſet on fire. Let us all therefore, ſaith <hi>Hugo</hi> (in whoſe time theſe things hapned) deprecate the Divine diſpleaſure, that the <hi>third</hi> may not come to paſs. And let every one of us walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, and bridle his anger, and contain his hands, that he do no evil: not calling the Enemy to do any thing, nor commending any thing to him, for he is alwayes ready to do miſchief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which pious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he proceeds to relate how the fire continued burning in the Tower of the Church <hi>Nine</hi> days: and on the night of the <hi>ninth</hi> day, a furious wind ariſing, blew the fire and live coals upon the Abbots houſes: ſo that we thought, ſaith he, all the remaining Offices would have been conſumed.

               <p>But the next year upon the <hi>eighth</hi> of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Abbot laid the foundation of a new Church MCXVIII. <hi>An. ab incarnatione Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Milleſimo centeſimo octavo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hugo.</hi> It ſhould be MCXVII. even by his own computation; for he brought the Pall from <hi>Rome</hi> 1115. the next year the Monaſtery was burnt; and the next he began to build it. And ſo the <hi>Chronicon Johannis Abbatis</hi> expreſly ſaith, that he began to build it again 1117.</p>
               <p>In which year alſo he recovered <hi>duos ſochemannos apud Caſtre,</hi> which were unjuſtly detained from the Church by one <hi>Leofwine:</hi> who came into the Chapter houſe, and openly acknowledged that they belonged to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Burch,</hi> and accordingly quitted to God and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and Abbot <hi>John</hi> the two aforeſaid <hi>Sochemans</hi> (whoſe names were <hi>Willielmus filius Leoffi Lickadiſc &amp; Leofricus avunculus ipſius)</hi> with all that they held in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Village: and from thence forward held them of the Abbot.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Leofwinus</hi> requiring from this Abbot <hi>five</hi> Shillings from the houſes beyond the River of <hi>Stanphord,</hi> which he pretended to have a grant of from Abbot <hi>Ernulphus</hi> and other Abbots; he came into Court the next year 1118. and it was adjudged that he ſhould loſe theſe <hi>five</hi> Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.

               <p>What other good Acts he did I do not find, but <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith, he laboured much in the reſtauration of the Church, though he could not finiſh it: and governed the Church and the Abbey well all his time, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Lands.

               <p>His ſtory is told more perfectly by <hi>Hugo</hi> in this manner. He was firſt of all Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and afterward made a Monk and Prior of <hi>Cluni;</hi> and then Prior of <hi>Savenni.</hi> After which, becauſe he was Coſin to the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Count of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> the ſame Count gave him <hi>Abbatiam Sancti Johannis Angeli,</hi> from whence he took his denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And he being crafty, cunning and ingenious, afterward got the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Beſenſcun:</hi> but ſtaid there no more than three days. For he had not yet enough, but got the Biſhoprick <hi>de Senites:</hi> where he ſtaid about <hi>ſeven</hi> days. And out of this preferment as well as that of <hi>Beſenſcun,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Cluni</hi> got him expelled. He got therefore, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quiet, to be Collector of <hi>Peter-pence</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Where he obtained this Abbey of <hi>Burch;</hi> by pretending he was very old, paſt labour and toil, unable to bear the Wars and Troubles of his own Country, and would quit his Abbey there of St. <hi>John de Angeli</hi> (and that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Pope and the Abbot of <hi>Cluni)</hi> and would here take up his reſt. There was another thing alſo that had a great ſtroke in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, for beſides he was near of kin to the King, and that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named diſcourſe ſeemed to have truth in it, he was the principal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make Oath, in a difference between the Kings Nephew, the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Daughter of the Count of <hi>Anjoy.</hi> Upon all theſe ſcores the Abby was beſtowed upon him in the year mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> Abbot alſo in his <hi>Chron.</hi> MS. <hi>An.</hi> MCXXVIII. <hi>Henricus Abbas Andagavenſis, precibus optinuit à Rege Henrico Abbatiam Burgenſem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Witleſea</hi> ſaith of Spectres ſeen that year he came to the Abby, he had out of <hi>Hugo,</hi> who ſaith: <hi>Hoc non eſt falſum: quia plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi veraciſſimi homines viderunt; &amp; audierunt cornua.</hi> He ſtaid one year in the Monaſtery, and received homage and money of the <hi>Milites,</hi> and of the whole Abbey, but did not the leaſt good: for he ſent and carried all to his Abbey beyond Sea, whither he went by the Kings licence. And having ſtaid there a whole year he returned hither; and ſaid he had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely quitted his other Abbey, for good and all, as we ſpeak. The ſame year came <hi>Petrus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cluni</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received by the Kings command in all the Monaſteries. Particularly here at <hi>Burch,</hi> whither he came to ſee <hi>Henry:</hi> who complemented him highly, and promiſed he would procure the Abbey of <hi>Burch</hi> to be made ſubject to that of <hi>Cluni;</hi> with which hopes <hi>Peter</hi> went home. The next year <hi>Henry</hi> got together a great ſumm of money, and went beyond Sea again; where the King then was. Whom he made believe that he was commanded by the Abbot of <hi>Cluni</hi> to come and reſign his Abbey of St. <hi>John de Angeli</hi> to him: and then he would return free from that care into <hi>England.</hi> So he went thither, and there ſtaid till the Feaſt of St. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> And the next day after the Monks choſe another of their own body into his place, and inſtalled him; ſinging <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and doing all other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61653:145"/>
for that end: expelling <hi>Henry,</hi> by the help of the Count of <hi>Anjoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> with great diſgrace, and detaining all that he had there. Where he had done no more good, than in other places, all the <hi>five and twenty</hi> years that he had governed them.</p>
               <p>Being thus caſt out he went to <hi>Cluni,</hi> where they kept him priſoner; the Abbot and Monks being very angry with him; ſaying he had loſt the Abby of St. <hi>John</hi> by his folly. Nor would they let him ſtir out of Doors, till by his craft he again deceived them, with promiſes and Oaths; that if they would permit him to return into <hi>England,</hi> he would ſubject the Abbey of <hi>Burch</hi> to them, and, as <hi>Hugo</hi>'s words are, <hi>ibi conſtrueret Priores, &amp; Secretarios, &amp; Cellerarios, &amp; Camerarios, &amp; omnia commendaret in manibus eorum, intus &amp; foris.</hi> By which agreement he got into <hi>England,</hi> whither the King alſo returned out of <hi>Normandy.</hi> Unto whom <hi>Henry</hi> came, and accuſed the Monks of <hi>Burch</hi> to him very heavily (though with out any truth) in order to his end of ſubjecting them to <hi>Cluni.</hi> The King in great anger ſent for them to <hi>Bramtun;</hi> where a Plea was managed againſt them with ſo much art, that the King was almoſt deceived. But God ſtept in to help them, by the Counſels of the Biſhops there preſent (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Lincoln)</hi> and the Barons; who underſtood his fraud. Yet he would not deſiſt; but being thus defeated, indeavoured to make his Nephew <hi>Gerardus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burch:</hi> that what he could not do by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, might be effected by him. All which made the lives of the Monks very uneaſie, till the King at laſt underſtood his knavery; and, ſending for him commanded him to ſurrender his Abbey and be gone out of his Realm. Which he did in the year MCXXXII. So <hi>John</hi> Abbot, <hi>Henricus Abbas de Burgo quem dimiſit, ad Andegavenſes redit.</hi> With which <hi>Hugo</hi> agrees; who ſays he recovered his Abbey of St. <hi>John de Angeli:</hi> and that notwithſtanding all his faults, <hi>bonus Eleemoſynator omnibus diebus fuit,</hi> he was good to the poor all his days. And therefore he made a good end; not living long after he returned thither.</p>
               <p>There is no memory of this Abbot in the <hi>Kalander</hi> of the Church; no more than of <hi>Kenulphus,</hi> and <hi>Godricus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> being gone, the King gave this Abbey (by the conſent of the Monks, ſaith <hi>Hugo)</hi> to a religious Monk, <hi>Martinus de Bec,</hi> the Prior of St. <hi>Neots:</hi> who was here inſtalled upon the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with great honour, and with the joy of the whole Convent, and all the people: <hi>An.</hi> MCXXXIII. Where <hi>Chron. M. S. Johannis Abbatis</hi> ſaith: <hi>Martinus de vecto in Abbatem Burgi eſt electus, &amp; in die Sancti Petri receptus.</hi> The next year, the day after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula,</hi> the King croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Seas again: when about ſix a clock, the Heavens were on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo darkned, that the Sun, ſaith <hi>Hugo,</hi> lookt like the Moon (I ſuppoſe by a great Ecclipſe) and for three or four hours the Stars appeared: which many took to portend ſome great thing. And ſo it did; for that year the King dyed; and all ancient and wiſe men of the Land fell with him: and ſo the Land was darkned, becauſe peace and truth and righteouſneſs were taken away from it. The ſame year 1135. King <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> Nephew to the former King, a Prince of a mild and low Spirit, got the Crown: and with him, (as <hi>Hugo</hi> goes on) Young men, who were very wicked alſo, got into power; and troubled the Land. The Church eſpecially was in great tribulation all <hi>England</hi> over: and among the reſt this of <hi>Burgh;</hi> whoſe Abbot ſuffered very much, and kept his
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61653:145"/>
Abbey with great difficulty. And yet, for all that, he provided all things neceſſary for his Monks, and for Strangers: there being great love among them, and the Monks being aſſiſtant to him.</p>
               <p>He went on alſo with the building of the Monaſtery, and of the Church: the Chancel of which he finiſhed; and brought in <hi>cum magno honore,</hi> the holy Reliques and the Monks into the new Church, upon the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> in the year of our Lord <hi>One thouſand one hundred and forty; three and twenty</hi> years after the burning of the place. It ſhould be <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> years after, if we may belive the MS. <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot; which ſaith, MCXLIII. <hi>Conventus Burgi hoc anno intravit in novam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam,</hi> that they did not go into the new Church till 1143.</p>
               <p>At this great ſolemnity of bringing the Reliques and Monks into the new Church, the Arm of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> was produced, before <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Abbots of <hi>Ramſey, Thorney, Croyland,</hi> many Barons, and a vaſt number of people (as it had been once before brought forth to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Matthias</hi> Abbot) and ſhown intire, in its ſleſh, skin, Nerves, and every thing elſe. The ſtory of this Arm is in ſhort related by Mr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Reliques of this Church. To which <hi>Will.</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> gives no great credit: for though he ſaith there was ſhown here at <hi>Burgh</hi> the hand of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> with the Arm, and devoutly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the people, being kept <hi>loculo argenteo &amp; deaurato in Eccleſia Beati Petri;</hi> yet he adds that too much credit is not to be given to it, for <hi>fides dictorum vacillat, ubi nihil auditor viſu explorat</hi>

                  </note>. Which he doth not ſay, he pretends, becauſe he doubted of the thing; but he would not too haſtily affirm that his Arm was in this place.</p>
               <p>But waving this doubt of his, <hi>Hugo</hi> ſaith he ſaw it, and kiſſed it, and handled it with his own hands, at this time: and relates a great many wonderful cures, which were performed merely by the water wherein it was waſhed; with which I ſhall not trouble the Reader. He ſaith it had been ſhown before this to ſatisfie <hi>Martin</hi> himſelf; who deſired to ſee it either out of curioſity, or becauſe he doubted of its being uncorrupted. And a <hi>Third</hi> time, he adds, it was ſhown to King <hi>Stephen,</hi> who came to <hi>Burgh:</hi> and offered his Ring to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath obſerved.

               <p>But leaving this, let us take ſome account of his benefactions to this Church, which were very many. <hi>Hugo</hi> ſays indeed that by the inſtinct of the Devil, and by ill Counſel, he was guilty of imbezzling the Treaſure of the Church, in the beginning of his Government: but he made amends afterward, giving a whole Town called <hi>Pileſgate</hi> to the Church, with all the Tythes and Offerings, and many poſſeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By his Charter alſo in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> (I ſuppoſe the <hi>firſt,</hi> for he dyed juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>ſecond</hi> came to the Crown) he gave with the conſent of the King a great deal of Land, and Rents and Services in ſeveral Towns (which are therein named) for the uſe of the Sacriſt, and for the Building and Repairing of the Monaſtery <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> fol. 100.</note>. This was in the beginning of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: when <hi>Richard</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Caſtre,</hi> having a mind to change his life and take upon him the habit of a Monk, prevailed with this Abbot, by his own and others intreaties, to receive him into the Monaſtery of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61653:146"/>
                  <hi>Burch.</hi> Accordingly he came on a day appointed 1133 (which was the firſt year of <hi>Martin)</hi> into the Chapter-houſe and there before the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and all the Monks made it his humble Petition, that they would receive all he had, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Caſtre,</hi> which he then held: with all belonging to it, both in Lands and in Tithes, and in other things, which he gave to God and to St. <hi>Peter</hi> for ever. Whereupon the Abbot granted what he deſired, on condition, that he ſhould come into Court, <hi>coram Baronibus ſuis,</hi> and there confirm what he had now done in the Chapter-houſe, which he performed accordingly. For the aforeſaid <hi>Richard</hi> Prieſt, came into the Abbots Chamber, and there, before the Abbot of <hi>Thorney,</hi> and <hi>Will. de Albeni,</hi> and <hi>Richard Baſſet,</hi> and many other <hi>Barons</hi> of the Abbey, and divers other perſons who came with <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> reſtored his Church of <hi>Caſtre</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Peter de Burch, de quo prius exierat.</hi> Which his Brother <hi>Galfridus</hi> hearing, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it; affirming that Church was <hi>de feodo ſuo, &amp; ſervitium, ſicuti de alio feodo ſuo in ſe habuiſſe.</hi> Whereupon the Abbot impleaded him about this and about other forfeitures: and he fearing the penalties, if judgment went againſt him, came and made the ſame ſurrender his Brother had done: and diſclaimed all intereſt in this Church, which he had pretended to be his Fee, and as <hi>Hugo</hi>'s words are, <hi>clamavit ſolutam &amp; quietam de ſe &amp; haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus ſuis in perpetuum: ac in manum Abbatis per quandam virgam reddidit &amp; dimiſit.</hi> His heirs alſo, <hi>Turoldus</hi> and <hi>Robertus</hi> did the ſame in open Court, which was very full: and the aforeſaid <hi>Galfridus</hi> begged the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots pardon, which he obtained. The Abbot alſo, before the above named perſons, freed him from the ſervice <hi>dimidii Militis;</hi> and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſeven Marks of Silver <hi>de relevamine ſuo.</hi> All which was done on the day that the Abbot <hi>Martin</hi> received the Homages of his Tenents: which ſhows it was in the entrance of his Government.</p>
               <p>The ſame year <hi>Pampelina,</hi> Wife of <hi>Osbern,</hi> holding certain Lands unjuſtly, in <hi>Burch, Withrington,</hi> and <hi>Glinton,</hi> for which ſhe could ſhow no right, came into the Abbots Court at <hi>Caſtre,</hi> and ſurrendred them all into his hands; declaring them to be free from her and her Heirs; and begging with many prayers the Abbots pardon. Who took compaſſion upon her, when he underſtood her poverty, and reſtord her the Land of <hi>Wither de Witherintona</hi> (which ſhe ſaid her Husband <hi>Osbern</hi> had bought) to hold it of him for ſixpence a year Rent, inſtead of all ſervices owing to the Abbot. And becauſe ſhe was Niece to his Predeceſſor <hi>John,</hi> he pardoned her ten ſhillings ſhe owed him, for the ſervice of her Land.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other ſuch Acts of his, of the ſame year: which ſhow he was not unmindful of the good of the Church in the very entrance of his Government.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Caſtre</hi> after this was ſupplied by a Chaplain, whoſe name was <hi>Robert:</hi> as I find in a Grant made of this Church (but it doth not appear in what year) by the Abbot and the Convent to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Northampton in Eleemoſynam,</hi> with all its appurtenances in Tithes and Lands, either Wood or Paſture, Meadow or Arable; For which he was to pay every year one Mark of Silver, for the ſervice of the Altar: and if he either dyed, or took upon him a Religious habit, it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the right of the Monaſtery freely and quietly, <hi>ſalva Epiſcopali dignitate.</hi> They granted him alſo <hi>plenariam ſocietatem in capitulo:</hi> So that they would give him the habit of a Monk, if he would live among them; or if he dyed in another place and in another habit, obſequies ſhould be made for him, as for one of their Monks. Whereupon <hi>Robert,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61653:146"/>
of <hi>Caſtre,</hi> proclaimed with a loud voice in the Chapter-houſe, the Church of <hi>Caſtre</hi> to be free and quiet from all claim that he had hitherto had unto it, and delivered the Charter which he had received, to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon.</p>
               <p>I do not find what was done in the following years till 1140. when <hi>Radulphus filius Arconbi de Glinton,</hi> being mindful of the ſalvation of his Soul, and repenting of his ſins, came to <hi>Burgh,</hi> and ſtanding before the great Altar (many ſtanding about him) offered to God and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for the ſalvation of his Soul and forgiveneſs of his ſins, <hi>unam culturam terrae de ſuo dominio in Peychirche quae jacet pro ſex acris.</hi> In teſtimony of which Donation, he demiſed his Knife in the very Church, laying it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar: and <hi>Martin</hi> the Abbot, on the other ſide, gave, from the Charity of St. <hi>Peter</hi> one Mark of Silver to the aforeſaid <hi>Radulphus;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to make him the more cheerful in this Donation.</p>
               <p>That form of confirming a grant, by the donors laying his Knife up on the Altar, was uſual in thoſe times. For in the year wherein King <hi>Stephen</hi> was taken Priſoner (the next I think after that now mentioned) upon the Feaſt of the invention of the holy Croſs, <hi>Guido Malfet,</hi> with <hi>Adelize</hi> his Wife, came into the Chapter-houſe of <hi>Burg;</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to God and to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Monks of the Church, <hi>ad lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare Altaris,</hi> two parts of all the Tythes of the Land he held of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> for the Souls of his Father and Mother; and for his own Soul, his Wives and Childrens: which Tythes he had, in part, formerly kept wrongfully from the Church. And after he had done this in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe, he went to the Altar of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and there finally granted and confirmed what he had done in the Chapter-houſe <hi>per cultellum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per altare ab eodem poſitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1150. alſo I find that <hi>Ingelramus Wardeden</hi> came to <hi>Burgh</hi> with his three Sons; and there made a ſolemn acknowledgment, that the thirty ſhillings, which he yearly claimed from the Abbey, had been unjuſtly and to the peril of his Soul received by him. And therefore before the High-Altar, in the preſence of the Convent, he both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed amendment of his fault (which he acknowledged) by laying his Knife on the Altar, and alſo diſclaimed all right in the premiſe, by the ſame Knife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo the words are, <hi>Et de culpa ſua quam timuit &amp; recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novit cultellum ſuper illud pro emendatione poſuit; &amp; omne rectum quod in eiſdem tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta ſolidos hactenus clamaverat, de ſe &amp; haeredibus ſuis, natis &amp; innatis, &amp; de omni progenie ſua, per eundem cultellum, reddidit, &amp; quietum clamavit.</hi> After which they all took their Oaths alſo upon the Altar, that they would never pretend to theſe thirty Shillings, in time to come.</p>
               <p>There were more memorable things than theſe done in the year before mentioned 1140. When King <hi>Stephen</hi> granted a great many Charters to this Church. The firſt of which directed to the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Chancellor, Juſtices, Barons and all his Subjects, declares that he had granted <hi>in perpetuum Eleemoſynam,</hi> to God and St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> and the Church of St. <hi>Peter de Burgh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. for the Soul of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Uncle, and other Kings his Anceſtors, and for the health of his own Soul, of <hi>Matildis</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Euſtachius</hi> his Son, and his other Children, <hi>omnia aſſarta quae Abbas &amp; Monachi de Burgo &amp; homines ſui fecerunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> all the Woods grubbed up (which was a great offence) by the Abbot, Monks and their Tenants, in the Lands of the Abbey of <hi>Burgh,</hi> untill the day that he came to <hi>Burgh,</hi> in his return from <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> when he had newly finiſhed his Caſtle at <hi>Caſtre</hi> in <hi>Lindſey,</hi> viz. <hi>Septimo idus Junii An. MCXL. &amp; à paſſione Oſwaldi Regis &amp; Martyris quingenteſimo primo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:61653:147"/>
Another Charter he granted about the Liberties of the Village of <hi>Pileſgate;</hi> a ſecond concerning Land in <hi>Northorp;</hi> a third about Eſſarts <hi>in Naſſo de Burgo:</hi> with three more, which I ſhall not mention.</p>
               <p>In the year 1145. <hi>Ivo</hi> Monk and Sacriſt of this Church, being deſired by his two Brethren <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Walter</hi> Sons of <hi>Alſwarchus de Burch,</hi> came together with them before the great Altar, on the Feaſt of the Chair of St. <hi>Peter, ante introitum Majoris Miſſae,</hi> and there gave to God and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the preſence of the Reliques of the Saints, for the uſe of the Church and the ſervice of the Sacriſt, the inheritance of their Father: which was <hi>twenty</hi> Acres of Arable Land, and <hi>four</hi> Acres of Meadow.</p>
               <p>The next year, or in the end of this, he went to <hi>Rome</hi> and was there honourably received by Pope <hi>Eugenius;</hi> who was newly advanced to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> So <hi>MS.

Some Workmen imployed about mending the Roof of the Church, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ceiling, taking up a board (faſt nailed down juſt over the High Altar) which it was neceſſary to remove, found this Bull under it: much defaced indeed by time, and worm-eaten in many places, but with a very fair Seal to it, which I have cauſed to be repreſented in this Figure of it.</p>

My conjecture is that in the Inſurrection of <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and his partakers, ſome Monk, fearing all their Records might be deſtroyed, reſolved to ſecure this, which was of great value, by hiding it on the top of the Church; where, by his ſudden death per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, or by forgetfulneſs, it ever after remained. For ſome of thoſe Miſcreants (our Hiſtorians obſerve) ravaged as far as the Iſle of <hi>Ely:</hi> So <hi>Henry de Knyghton</hi> informs us <note n="*" place="margin">L. V. de Eventibus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae.</note>, that the Tenants of the Abbot of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61653:147"/>
                  <hi>Peterburgh</hi> and their compatriots, roſe up againſt that Abbey, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy it. Which they had done without remedy; if God had not unexpectedly ſtretched out his reſiſting hand. For <hi>Henry le Spencer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> coming to the aſſiſtance of the Monaſtery, with a ſtrong power, forced the Villains to deſiſt from their enterpriſe: Nay, diſperſed them, and took ſome of them, and killed others. The reſt taking the Church for Sanctuary, which they intended to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, were there run through with Lances and Swords: ſome of them hard by the Altar, others by the walls of the Church, both within and without. The like did this valiant Biſhop in divers places in the Counties of <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon.</hi> And thus, ſaith he, <hi>God returned to them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what they deſigned againſt others: they came to deſtroy the Church and Churchmen, and they deſerved to periſh in the Church, and by a Churchman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which, by the way, may ſatisfie the doubt which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> raiſes (in the life of <hi>Henry Overton)</hi> about the manner of the pacification of thoſe commotions: which he might have found in the Author he there quotes. The cauſe of them alſo it is viſible, was their hatred to Churchmen; whoſe riches they envied, and deſired to get to themſelves.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Martin</hi> returned from <hi>Rome</hi> he was received by all the Convent with great honour and joy. And preſently after <hi>Richard</hi> the Prior of this Church (a very wiſe and provident perſon, to whom <hi>Martin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the care of all things in his abſence) was choſen Abbot of <hi>Whitby; Benedict</hi> their former Abbot being depoſed. The Archbiſhop propoſed him with two other Monks of St. <hi>Albons</hi> to the choice of the Convent, that they might take which they pleaſed. In which they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doubtful a great while, till one night a little Boy had a viſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch things were repreſented to him, that when the Brethren heard it, they immediately concluded this <hi>Richard</hi> was the man they ought to chuſe: which accordingly they did; and ſent to the Abbot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Burgh</hi> that they would part with him. Which they did unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but being overcome with prayers and reaſons, they condeſcended to it: and he was received there with wonderful joy, in a great proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not only of the Monks, but of the Canons, and Clergy, and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, Noble and Ignoble. The Archdeacon alſo, and the Legates of the Archbiſhop attended him; and placed him in his Seat. Where he ſo governed their affairs, that they who were very poor before, became now very rich: till God who ſuffered <hi>Job</hi> to be tempted, tried him alſo. For on a ſudden a Navy arrived from <hi>Norway</hi> in the port of <hi>Whitby,</hi> which ſpoil'd them of all, and left nothing behind them. But God who reſtored to <hi>Job</hi> double for what he had loſt, ſo bleſſed the Abbot (who comforted them in their diſtreſs, and beſeeched them with patience to give God thanks, and hope for better) that in a ſhort time they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with all things, and he lived in great ſplendor.</p>
               <p>In the next year after his return from <hi>Rome</hi> 1147. <hi>Rob. de Torpell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very weak, came to the Hoſpital of the Infirm in <hi>Burch, apud Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellam Sancti Leonardi,</hi> and there before many Witneſſes, gave himſelf, Body and Soul, to God and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the Church of <hi>Burch,</hi> with all his Lands in <hi>Codeſtock,</hi> and <hi>Glapetorp,</hi> both in Wood and Arable and Meadows <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> XCII.</note>. The Charter runs thus, To the Archdeacon of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton</hi> and all others. <hi>Sciatis me conſecraſſe Eccleſiam de Carltona, quae fuit capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſubjecta Eccleſiae de Cottingham; &amp; hoc feci requiſitione dominorum Carlton, &amp; proborum virorum ejuſdem villae. Et Osbertus de Cottingham conceſſit ut praedicta Eccleſia Carlton cum ſuo coemiterio conſecraretur,</hi> &amp;c. The condition of this was, that <hi>Robert</hi> Son of <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould give to the ſame Church one <hi>Oxegang</hi> of Land; <hi>Walter Ponhar</hi> another; <hi>Ralph de Pippewell,</hi> half an <hi>Oxegang;</hi> and the people of the Village XV. Acres, &amp; a dwelling houſe for the Prieſt. Which conditions if they were not fulfilled, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was to return to its former ſubjection unto <hi>Cottingham. Osbert</hi> was to have the right of <hi>Patronage;</hi> and to find a fit Clerk to ſerve God, and the Pariſhioners there.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> made a compoſition between the Church of <hi>Burch</hi> and of <hi>Spalding;</hi> about the Church of <hi>Haltbarge, viz</hi> that the Monaſtery of <hi>Spalding</hi> ſhould pay yearly to the Abbot of <hi>Burch</hi> ſixteen ſhillings and four pence, out of the Church of <hi>Haltbarge,</hi> and out of the Lands they had in that Pariſh, and out of one <hi>Oxegang</hi> of Land in <hi>Walcote.</hi> And the ſame Monaſtery conſented that the Abbot of <hi>Burch</hi> might erect a Chapel in <hi>Walcote,</hi> and conſecrate a burying place belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: yet ſo, that the Monks of <hi>Spalding</hi> ſhould preſent the Prieſt, that ſerved in that place; and none ſhould be buried there without the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent of the Prior and Monks of <hi>Spalding.</hi> The Abbot of <hi>Burch</hi> alſo ſtood bound to aſſign and give in a commodious place, <hi>unam manſuram terrae,</hi> for the dwelling houſe of the Prieſt which there officiated.</p>
               <p>It would be too long to mention all the Lands which he recovered, that had been held by rich and potent men from the Church; ſome of which are taken notice of in <hi>Hugo:</hi> and all the Ordinances he made, among which this was one; that in the principal Feſtival of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, ſeven</hi> Wax Candles ſhould be lighted before the Altar, and <hi>four</hi> upon it, <hi>à principio matutinorum ad finem</hi>

               <p>The ſame day that <hi>Martin</hi> dyed, all the Monks met together, that they might chuſe one of their own body, to be their <hi>Pater, Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Cuſtos:</hi> fearing leſt, by delay, ſome ſtranger might get in by money, and domineer over them. The manner of it was this; they choſe twelve of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61653:148"/>
Seniors and Wiſemen out of their whole number, to make an Election for them; it being very hard for a multitude to agree in one man. But they firſt made them ſwear upon the holy Goſpels and the holy Reliques, that they would act ſincerely; and be moved in their choice neither by love nor hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which they all did; <hi>Hugo</hi> the Eldeſt (whom I take to have been the Author of this Hiſtory) beginning to take the Oath; and all the reſt following: after which the whole Convent ſwore that they would chuſe him in whom thoſe 12 ſhould agree. This being done the 12 went into the Abbot's Chamber; and the Prior, with the reſt that remained in the Chapterhouſe, ſung the <hi>Seven</hi> Pſalms, and prayed God to direct them by the grace of his holy Spirit: which the 12 alſo begged by ſinging <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus:</hi> and then conferred among themſelves. And it was agreed that <hi>Hugo</hi> the Eldeſt of them, ſhould hear every one of them confeſs, and tell what God had put in their heart: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done he asked them if they would know what every mans opinion was ſingly. They ſaid no, but he ſhould declare in whom the Major part of them agreed: to which he replied, that they were all in a manner agreed in one man, <hi>William de Waterville;</hi> and if any one were againſt it, he had liberty ſtill to contradict it. But they were ſo far from oppoſing it, that they all conſented: and entering into the Chapterhouſe, and there declaring what they had done, the whole company praiſed God. And the day after, having performed the Obſequies of the deceaſed Abbot, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldus</hi> the Prior, and <hi>Hugo,</hi> with the Abbot Elect went to the King <hi>(Henry</hi> II.) then at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Who upon inquiry finding the Convent really deſired it, confirmed the Election by his Charter.</p>
               <p>After which <hi>Te Deum</hi> being ſung, and prayers made, the Abbot did his homage to the King; and then repaired to <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln:</hi> who prefixing him a day and place, gave him his benediction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was inſtalled at <hi>Burch</hi> on the Sunday called <hi>Sexageſima,</hi> with a ſolemn proceſſion of Abbots, Monks, Clergy and Laymen.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the inſuing <hi>Lent</hi> he found there was a great want of Proviſions in the Monaſtery: which he preſently began to buy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo to do, both Wheat and Malt, Oats and Beans, Fleſh, Cheeſe and Wine, with all other things neceſſary till the Feaſt of St. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> This was a very great expence: and yet he moreover diſcharged all the Debts of his Predeceſſor; which were 300 Marks of Silver; beſides 60 more owing the King for intereſt, which he got him to pardon. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered alſo the fee and the ſervice of <hi>Galfridus de la Mare,</hi> for a hundred Mark, which he gave the King, To whom he alſo gave an hundred Marks more, for the confirmation of <hi>Nine</hi> Knights Fees, which had been held by Earl <hi>Simon.</hi> At the ſame time he built a Nunnery at <hi>Stanford</hi> in honour of God and St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and both founded and built the Church there: in which he placed no leſs than <hi>forty</hi> holy Virgins. Who were to pay yearly to the Chantery of <hi>Burgh,</hi> a Noble of Silver as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement: with ten Shillings to the <hi>Sacriſtry</hi> out of the Church of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> which this Abbot purchaſed.</p>
               <p>It would be too long to mention particularly all the Land, Rents, or Penſions, which this Abbot bought, at <hi>London, Irtlingborough, Hargrave, Eaſton, Warmington, Paſton, Walton, Cambridg</hi> and ſeveral other places. I will name only one; he purchaſed all the Village on this ſide the Bridge of <hi>Stanford:</hi> and redeemed for a ſumm of money, fourteen houſes, with the ground belonging to them, beyond the Bridge: which a certain Knight claimed as his Inheritance. He increaſed the Rents of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket and Town of <hi>Burgh,</hi> and built uſeful Offices in all the Mannors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61653:149"/>
to the Church; and did a great many other good things (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe mentioned in Mr. <hi>G.)</hi> and had done more and greater; if he had not been hindred, by great misfortunes and diſturbances which were given him; both by falſe domeſticks, and by ſome other rich men. Who accuſed him to the King, and to the Archbiſhops, <hi>Theobald, Thomas a Becket,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> (who ſucceeded them) ſo that at laſt he was, by the anger of the King, depoſed in the Chapterhouſe of <hi>Burgh</hi> by <hi>Robert</hi> Archdeacon; before a multitude of Abbots and Monks: being neither convicted of any crime, nor confeſſing any, but privily accuſed to the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> by ſome Monks.</p>
               <p>This is all that <hi>Hugo</hi> (if he lived to write the end of this great man) ſaith concerning his depoſition. <hi>Gervaſius</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon</hi> ſaith more, that the Archbiſhop himſelf came to the Abbey of <hi>Burgh</hi> and depoſed <hi>Will. manifeſtis culpis accuſatum &amp; convictum;</hi> but ſaith not what they were. Nor doth <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> give any account of them, but only ſaith <hi>multis impetitus notoriis,</hi> being charged with many notorious crimes and convicted of them, in the preſence of the Archbiſhop, he received the ſentence of depoſition 3. <hi>Kaland. Novembris.</hi> Nay <hi>Gervaſe</hi> in another place (in the life of <hi>Richard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> ſaith not ſo much, but only that he depoſed the Abbot of <hi>Burgh certis ex cauſis,</hi> for certain reaſons. <hi>John Bromton</hi> indeed (who ſaith the Archbiſhop came hither a little before <hi>Chriſtmas)</hi> and <hi>Roger Hoveden,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath obſerved) aſſign the reaſons; which I cannot contradict: though it ſeems ſomething ſtrange that a man, who was brought in with ſuch an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal kindneſs of the ſociety, and did ſuch abundance of good, ſhould be guilty of the violence which the firſt of them mentions; and of ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge alſo as is ſcarce credible. And it is leſs credible that he who inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Monaſtery ſo vaſtly as it hath been already ſaid, ſhould impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and oppreſs it, as he is accuſed to have done, in the account they gave to the Pope of this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>For I muſt let the Reader know that <hi>William</hi> thinking himſelf wronged by this ſentence, appealed to Pope <hi>Alexander:</hi> Who, upon mature hearing of the Cauſe, confirmed the depoſition and commanded him ſilence for ever. So we are told in a Bull of his Succeſſor Pope <hi>

For in the ſame Bull it is ſaid, that <hi>William Norman</hi> Procurator for the Abbot, having taken up great ſumms of money in the Abbots name, for which he ſtood bound, deſired ſatisfaction. But the money appearing to have been borrowed, <hi>non pro utilitate, ſed pro gravamine Monaſterii,</hi> Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> abſolved the Monaſtery, <hi>ab impetitione tam creditorum, quam fidejuſſorum,</hi> freeing them from all obligation to pay the money ſo borrowed; as appears, the Bull ſaith, by the writing of Pope <hi>Lucius.</hi> Whereupon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> being induced by theſe reaſons, and moved by the deſire of King <hi>Henry,</hi> again confirmed the depoſition, as <hi>Alexander</hi> had done: and again abſolved them from that debt, of which they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in the judgment of his Predeceſſor <hi>Lucius.</hi> Thinking it but reaſonable that a debt which was remitted them <hi>communis juris aequitate,</hi> ſhould be relaxed alſo, <hi>ſpeciali Apoſtolicae ſedis indulgentia.</hi>

But whatever his crimes were, for which the King was incenſed againſt him, he had been once very much in his favour; and procured from him a confirmation of all the priviledges granted by the Kings Grandfather. Two of his Charters are very remarkable, which run in the form of precepts. One is, <hi>omnibus militibus Abbatis de Burgo;</hi> whom he commands without delay, <hi>quod faciatis Abbati de Burgo ſervitium ſuum quod ei facere debetis:</hi> and that not only in the preſent ſummons to ſerve in the Army in <hi>Wales</hi> but in all other intirely and fully. Which if they did not do, he tells them his <hi>Sheriffs</hi> ſhould proceed againſt them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, <hi>Vicecomites mei, in quorum balivis terras habetis, juſtificent vos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other is to all his Juſtitiaries, Sheriffs, and Miniſters, <hi>Praecipio quod Willelmus Abbas de Burgo teneat bene &amp; in pace, &amp; libere &amp; quiete &amp; juſte &amp; honorifice.

And upon every <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day, inter tertiam,</hi> the whole Convent being preſent, he was to bring the Key of the Chapels, and lay it upon the Altar, from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it: there to receive it again from the Sacriſt, if he had well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf.

               <p>All agree he was made Abbot in the year MCLXXVII. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which I find him ſtill Prior of <hi>Chriſts-Church.</hi> For <hi>William Thorn</hi> in his <hi>Chron.</hi> hath ſet down a compoſition made between the Monks of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Church of the Holy Trinity: which begins thus. <hi>Benedictus Prior &amp; Conventus Eccleſiae Chriſti Cant. univerſis Chriſti fidelibus ſalutem,</hi> &amp;c. and then, relating how he and <hi>Roger</hi> Elect of the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had changed certain Lands one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which are there particularly mentioned) it concludes thus, <hi>Facta eſt autem haec compoſitio vel conventio, anno ab incarnatione Milleſimo CLXXVII.</hi> ſeven year after the Murder of <hi>Thomas a Becket</hi> in his Church. Where, by the way, it may be obſerved, that this <hi>Roger</hi> had himſelf been a Monk of the Church of the Holy Trinity (where <hi>Benedict</hi> now was <hi>Prior)</hi> and was keeper of the Altar, where <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſlain.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Benedict</hi> was here ſetled, he ſtraightway indeavoured to deſtroy the ill Cuſtoms, which had crept into the Monaſtery; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore regular diſcipline; and then to free the Church from the debts left by his Predeceſſor: of whom the <hi>Romans</hi> and many in <hi>England</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted 1500. Marks. The Ornaments of this Church alſo were diſperſed and pawned in ſeveral places: which was ſuch a burden to this Abbot, that, out of the load of grief he had upon his mind, he went to <hi>Canterbury</hi> with one Monk alone, and there ſtaid many days.</p>
               <p>When he had a little eaſed, and freed himſelf, not without much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, from thoſe demands and vexations, he returned hither and gave his mind to Meditation in the holy Scripture. They are the words of <hi>Swapham,</hi> who ſaith he compoſed himſelf <hi>unum egregium volumen,</hi> one moſt excellent volume (as they then accounted it) <hi>de paſſione &amp; miraculis Sancti Thomae:</hi> and cauſed a great many others to be tranſcribed for the uſe of the Monaſtery; which are thoſe ſet down by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> out of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſea,</hi> who did in this but tranſcribe <hi>Swapham.</hi> Who tells us of a great many benefactions beſides thoſe named by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> eſpecially in precious Ornaments beſtowed upon the Church; which made his memory deſerve, as his words are, to remain in benediction for ever. The principal were <hi>three</hi> rich Palls, and ſix <hi>Cheſibles:</hi> the laſt of which were black Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Golden Trees before and behind; and full of pretious Stones from the top to the bottom. He acquired alſo many Reliques of <hi>Thomas a Becket, viz.</hi> his Shirt, his Surplice, and a great quantity of his Blood, in two Cryſtal veſſels; with two Altars of the Stone upon which he fell, when he was murdered. Whoſe Chapel begun by <hi>William de Waterville,</hi> he finiſhed, together with an Hoſpital, adjoyning to it. From whence I gather that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is miſtaken in his opinion, about the place of it; which was not in the middle Arch of the Church-Porch, but at the gate of the Monaſtery; and is now, as I conceive, the <hi>School-houſe.</hi> For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about

               <p>He procured a large Charter from <hi>Rich.</hi> I. in the firſt year of his Reign, dated at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> confirming to them all their Lands and Poſſeſſions in the ſeveral Counties of the Realm (which are particularly enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) <hi>in perpetuam Eleemoſynam.</hi> And thereby it appears that <hi>Benedict</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the aforeſaid Lands in <hi>Sutton,</hi> with the Mill and appurtenances, from <hi>Thorald</hi> Son of <hi>Anketillus,</hi> who reſtored them to the Church, as part of its <hi>Demeans.</hi> And afterward alſo purchaſed of the Nephews and Heirs of the ſame <hi>Thorald, Pileſgate, Badigtune</hi> and <hi>Bernack</hi> and other Lands, which <hi>Gaufridus</hi> Son of <hi>Gaufridus</hi> gave to the Monaſtery: with a great many other things, worth the remembering, if I had room to inſert them. I will name only the laſt, <hi>Concedimus etiam pro amore Dei &amp; Sancti Petri, &amp; ob reverentiam beati Oſwaldi Regis &amp; Martyris, quod praedicti Monaſterii Milites, qui Guuardam ſuam faciunt in Caſtello noſtro de Rokingam ſint quieti; ſolvendo ſingulis annis tempore pacis de feodo militis</hi> 4. <hi>ſolidos, ſicut facere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebant tempore Henrici R. avi noſtri,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is a Charter of the ſame year, bearing date 22. <hi>March</hi> from <hi>Roan,</hi> confirming all their Liberties, particularly the 8. <hi>Hundreds</hi> (for which he afterwards granted a ſpecial Charter by it ſelf) Which Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being loſt when he was Priſoner in <hi>Germany,</hi> he renewed it and in ſome things inlarged it, in the Xth year of his Reign.</p>

The Charter mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> granted by King <hi>John,</hi> while he was only Earl of <hi>Mortaing;</hi> runs thus: <hi>Kariſſimo amico meo Benedict.

               <p>The Counſel he gave about the Kings redemption is thus related by <hi>Swapham.</hi> Many of the Nobles being of opinion that <hi>ten</hi> of the beſt Cities of the Kingdom ſhould be ſold, and with that money his Ranſome paid, this Abbot being extreamly afflicted to think of the diſgrace and damage it would be to the Realm, humbly adviſed them to have all the <hi>Chalices</hi> in <hi>England</hi> prized; and gathering their price, as his words are, into one ſumm, that ſhould be given for his redemption, <hi>ſine gravamine alicujus.</hi> Which Counſel was approved and confirmed by all preſent; and it was done accordingly.

               <p>The Character <hi>Swapham</hi> gives of him is, that he was a man of great Religion and Authority, as well as age: and being very mild and peaceable, made it his indeavour to plant and eſtabliſh peace and tranquillity in his flock. He gave (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> obſerves) the two Towns of <hi>Alwalton</hi> (or <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woltone)</hi> and <hi>Fletun</hi> to the Kitchin of the Convent, but with exception of the <hi>auxilia ad feſtum Sancti Michaelis.</hi> Which his Succeſſor remitted, and aſſigned alſo to the Monks Kitchin by his Charter.

And when the <hi>Celleraria,</hi> upon a time, wanted Proviſion, he fed the whole Convent, from the Feaſt of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Feaſt of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> at his own charge. And cauſed the Mill of <hi>Athelwalton</hi> to be repaired, the Land to be ploughed and Sown, and the Corn gathered: which he cauſed to be brought into the <hi>Cellerary.</hi> And out of his pitty to the infirm Monks, who had no where to take the comfort of the air, he gave them, of his own accord without asking, a part of his Vineyard: where <hi>Rich. de Scoter</hi> afterwards planted a garden.</p>
               <p>He alſo bought houſes, hard by St. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> which coſt him above two hundred and fifty Marks; and in ſeveral of the Mannors belonging to the Church, cauſed Halls, Chambers, and other edifices to be built: as the Hall at <hi>Scottere,</hi> the Hall at <hi>Fiskertune,</hi> and divers other places which <hi>Swapham</hi> mentions. He gave two hundred Marks to King <hi>John</hi> for his Charter of Liberties, which is ſtill remaining: and diſcharged the houſe of above a thouſand Marks, in the Exchequer.

               <p>There had been a Petition preferred by the Almoner of <hi>Burgh</hi> (in his Predeceſſors time) to Pope <hi>Clement;</hi> ſhowing that he having no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical benefice belonging to the Almonry, whereby he might be able to keep good hoſpitality, was willing to aſſign the Church of <hi>Makeſeia</hi> to that uſe, if the Abbot and Convent, who had the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation would conſent. Whereupon the Pope moved <hi>Hugo</hi> Biſhop
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61653:153"/>
of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to uſe his Authority to perſwade them to grant the ſaid Parſonage, to that uſe: which <hi>Hugo</hi> did, and Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Grant of the Church of <hi>Makeſeia</hi> and <hi>Normanby</hi> with all their appurtenances unto the uſe of the Almonry. After which <hi>Acarius,</hi> by the Petition and advice of the Convent ſetled all the Tythes of all their Lands, for the maintenance of Hoſpitality; except of thoſe two Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors <hi>de Stanewig, &amp; de Irtlingburgh.</hi> Which was afterward confirmed by <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who recites the whole Charter of <hi>Akarius</hi> in his <hi>Fol.</hi> XCIII.</p>
               <p>He granted alſo, out of reverence and reſpect to this Church of <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeia,</hi> and at the Petition of <hi>Galfridus</hi> Son of <hi>Radulphus de Halone,</hi> one of the <hi>Milites</hi> of <hi>Burgh,</hi> and at the deſire of the Pariſhioners, that they would hereafter have no paſſage through the Church-yard of <hi>Makeſeia,</hi> for their <hi>Horſes, Oxen, Cows, Hoggs</hi> or other Animals; nor by themſelves nor Servants lay any thing in the Church-yard, which might diſcolour, or diſhonour it; ſaving to themſelves only the herbage of the Church-yard and liberty to mow it, &amp;c. <hi>Galfridus,</hi> on his part giving the <hi>Eleemoſynary</hi> of the Church of <hi>Burgh</hi> two Acres of Arable Land in the field of <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeia;</hi> ſo that the Church yard might be freed from all that filth, which was cauſed by the Carriages of the Procurators of the <hi>Eleemoſynary.</hi> Both theſe Charters are remaining <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Swaph.</hi> fol. CIII.</note>.</p>
               <p>In another Charter this Abbot granted to the ſame <hi>Eleemoſynary,</hi> the offerings of the Chapel before mentioned of <hi>Tho. a Becket</hi> (called there <hi>Capella Sancti Thomae ad Portam)</hi> for the uſe of the Hoſpital, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it. Yet ſo, as that on Feſtival days, when the Pariſhioners of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> were bound to make their Oblation at that Church, none ſhould be admitted to hear Maſs in the Church of the Hoſpital, to the prejudice of the ſaid Church of St. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> But if any man were ſo weak in Body, that he could not go ſo far as the Pariſh-Church, and therefore made his Oblation in the aforeſaid Chapel, two parts of three of ſuch Oblation ſhould be given to the <hi>Sacriſt,</hi> and the remaining third, to the Chaplain of St. <hi>J. Baptiſt.</hi> Upon other days, if any body came out of devotion, to this Chapel, and made his offerings here, they ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to the uſe of the Hoſpital. In like manner if Strangers came to pray there, whether on Feſtival or other days, and offered any thing, or if any Legacy were given to the Hoſpital, all ſhould be intirely applied to the uſes of the poor people there <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. CIV. and fol. CC.</note>. And accordingly an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made and drawn in writing, between the <hi>Sacriſt,</hi> the <hi>Chaplain of St. John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Almoner. In which the Feſtivals are expreſſed, on which the Pariſhioners of St. <hi>J. Baptiſt</hi> were wont to offer, and might not be admitted, unleſs in caſe of weakneſs, to hear Maſs in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Hoſpital, <hi>viz. All-Saints, All-Souls, Chriſtmas, Circumciſion, Epiphany, Purification, Good-Friday, Eaſter, Aſcenſion, Whitſunday,</hi> St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> and the <hi>Nativity</hi> of the Bleſſed Virgin, and Saint <hi>Giles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Abbot did many other memorable things, for the benefit of the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> and of the Monks <hi>Chamber:</hi> and many things were done by others in his time (particularly <hi>Robert de Tot,</hi> by the will and aſſent of <hi>Akarius,</hi> whom he calls his Lord, gave ſeven acres of Arable Land in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> to the Chapel <hi>beatae Mariae de Parco)</hi> which I cannot ſet down; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inlarging this Supplement too much beyond the bounds, to which I am confined.</p>
               <p>One thing done in his time I muſt not forget: which is a Bull ſent from <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>IXth.</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and him (the Abbot of <hi>Burgh)</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:61653:153"/>
importing that the Abbot had repreſented to him, how ſome Monks of his Church had incurred the ſentence of Excommunication, for laying vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands one upon another, and upon other both Secular and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, and Secular Clergy, and other Monks were under the ſame ſentence for denying due obedience to the Abbot, when they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by him; others becauſe they had entred the Monaſtery by <hi>Simony;</hi> and how ſome of theſe Excommunicated Perſons, had preſumed to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate divine Offices, not having obtained abſolution; For whoſe Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Abbot being ſolicitous, had petitioned the ſaid <hi>Gregory,</hi> that it might not be neceſſary for them to come to the Apoſtolical See for the benefit of abſolution and diſpenſation; he, in confidence of his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, granted him power to abſolve them in all the forenamed caſes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch enormous exceſſes in laying hands on any body, as might ſeem fit to be referred to the See Apoſtolique) after ſatisfaction made to thoſe who had been injured: And that he ſhould proceed againſt the Simoniacal Monks according to the conſtitution in a General Council; and ſuſpend thoſe who, in contempt of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiated in the Church during their Excommunication, for two years <hi>à ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum executione ordinum.</hi> Which being finiſhed, he might mercifully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with them, if they were of an honeſt Converſation and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life.</p>
               <p>Several compoſitions alſo made by him I muſt omit; and conclude as <hi>R. Swapham</hi> doth, that this good man governed the Monaſtery for about X. years; and was ſuch an example to all of order, honeſty, kindneſs, and bounty, that from him poſterity might learn how to behave themſelves, both in the cloyſter and in the World. And particularly he was extroardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kind to the Convent; unto whom he ſent meat every day from his own Table, for the conſolation of the Brethren: which the Prior divided among them. The like he did to the <hi>domus infirmorum;</hi> ſending fleſh-meat to thoſe who were weak: and would often ſay in the Convent, <hi>Domini, Domini, niſi per quoſdam veſtrum ſtetiſſet,</hi> &amp;c. My Maſters, my Maſters, had not ſome of you hindred, I had done much good to you. Which ſaying (ſaith <hi>Swapham,</hi> from which we may gather he lived in this time) was not underſtood by us then; but after his death we perceived why he ſaid this, and knew of whom it was meant. But it is no matter, ſaith he, <hi>they are gone; they lifted up themſelves, and the Lord hath caſt them down.</hi> As for this good man, he never rendred evil for evil to any man; but ſtudied more to be loved than feared: and out of mere reſpect to piety took in <hi>two and twenty</hi> Monks: by whoſe merits, and the merits of all the Saints, he prayes the Lord to grant this Abbot pardon, and eternal joy.</p>

Thus he; who adds that hereupon the <hi>Interdict</hi> which had continued upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom VI. year, III. months and XVI. days was taken off: <hi>viris Religioſis non facta reſtitutione bonorum,</hi> but without any care that the Religious ſhould have their Goods reſtored to them. So much did <hi>Pandulphus</hi> favour the Kings inclination.</p>
               <p>This Abbot, with whom this Church was happily provided (but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Kings Nomination or no I find not; for the <hi>Chron.</hi> before named ſaith, ſome Abbeys proceeded immediately to chuſe their Abbots, that the King might not obtrude one upon them) was a wiſe, diſcreet, and honeſt man; in all things very provident; as <hi>Swapham</hi> hath delivered his Character to us. Who relates a great many worthy things he had done, and gifts he had beſtowed on the Church, while he was only <hi>Sacriſt.</hi> Among which that of making <hi>thirty</hi> glaſs Windows, which before were ſtuffed with Reed and Straw, was one of the leaſt. He made one Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow alſo of Glaſs in the <hi>Regulare Locutorium;</hi> another in the <hi>Chapterhouſe;</hi> on the ſide where the Prior ſat; nine in the <hi>Dormitory;</hi> and three in the Chapel of St. <hi>Nicolas.</hi> He made the whole Chancel of <hi>Oxney</hi> and a Table with the Image of the Bleſſed Virgin upon the Altar. He augmented alſo the <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and made private Chambers: and then built a Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hard by the Kitchin, for the uſe of the <hi>Celerarius.</hi> Which ſolicitous goodneſs of his, moved the Convent with one conſent to raiſe him to a higher ſtation, by chuſing him for their Abbot: whom they preſented to King <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> upon the day of the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of St. <hi>Mary.</hi> Being kindly received by him, he went to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and there on St. <hi>Barnaby's</hi> day received from <hi>Hugh</hi> 2. Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln, ordinationis ſuae benedictionem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as he returned home, he offered a rich Cope and a Pall: and then made it his buſineſs to deliver the Country from that grievous ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage they were in, by the Forreſters and the Beaſts; which at that time domineered over men. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath given ſome account of it; I ſhall only add that this <hi>deafforeſtation</hi> was made in the year 1216. as appears by the agreement made between this Abbot, and the <hi>Milites</hi> and <hi>Francolani,</hi> who had any intereſt in the <hi>Naſſe</hi> of <hi>Burgh:</hi> which is annexed to the <hi>Deſcription</hi> of all the woods, and their names, and the names of thoſe to whom they belonged, when it was diſafforeſted. In the year before which (1215.) King <hi>John</hi> had granted his Charter confirming all the liberties of the Church: which was confirmed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, as may be ſeen in <hi>Matth. Paris;</hi> and there is the very ſame in our Records at the end of <hi>Swapham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides the benefactions mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> (the firſt of which was only covering the Abbots Hall with lead <hi>verſus clauſtrum,</hi> in that part next the Cloyſter) I find divers others, no leſs memorable. For he gave four Marks of Silver to the Infirmary: and eight Shillings <hi>cuſtodi Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> to buy Matts and other neceſſaries for his Office: and got a Bond out of the bands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for five and thirty Mark; upon which they demanded a vaſt ſumm of money, it being an old debt. He freed alſo the Tenants of this Church in the Mannor of <hi>Stanwig, à ſecta <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n. dredi de Hecham,</hi> for a ſumm of money which he gave to the Earl of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:61653:154"/>
He purchaſed likewiſe the Advowſon of the Church of <hi>Clopton,</hi> and gave two Marks of Gold, and his own Silver Cup, <hi>ad feretrum Sanctae Ky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neburgae.</hi> He made the new inward gate, and the new Stable for the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Horſes; and the <hi>Vivarium</hi> near the Church-yard. He built not only the Hall of <hi>Collingham,</hi> but of <hi>Stowe;</hi> which <hi>Martin</hi> Abbot afterward changed: and a Chamber at <hi>Tinewell,</hi> another at <hi>Cottingham,</hi> a Summer-houſe at <hi>Stanwick;</hi> with a Chapel, and almoſt finiſhed the Chapel at <hi>Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring.</hi> Barns he built in ſeveral places, and erected the great building beyond the Bakehouſe and Malthouſe: and by a plea againſt the Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> obtained the power of incloſing as much as he pleaſed of the common Paſture, in the Marſh of <hi>Pykirke,</hi> and made it ſeparate: and, finding the Church-yard too ſtrait, he gave to the honour of God and of his Church, a part of his own Vineyard to inlarge it; for the Burial of the Monks, and of their Parents and Friends: which he ſurrounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with a ſtrong and high Wall.</p>
               <p>Anciently the Abbot and Convent received 60. Marks of Silver yearly from <hi>Fiskertune</hi> and <hi>Scoter,</hi> for their Clothes and Shoes: which he finding to be too little, added 20. Mark more. And twenty ſhillings alſo for the celebration of three Feaſts in Copes; <hi>viz.</hi> the Transfiguration of our Lord, the Tranſlation of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the birth day of St. <hi>Hugh.</hi> For <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> who dyed in the year 1200. was canonized a Saint by Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> 2. in this <hi>Robert</hi>'s time <hi>An.</hi> 12200.

               <p>In his time the Monaſtery petitioned Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9. repreſenting the danger they were in, to loſe ſome Tythes, which they had held from the very Foundation of the Church; becauſe ſome Deeds concerning them were loſt, or could not be found: and therefore deſiring that he would command ſome very old men to be examined about this matter, before they dyed; leſt they ſhould loſe all poſſible proof of their right. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Pope ſent his Apoſtolical Letters to the Priors of <hi>Deeping,</hi> and St. <hi>Leonard</hi> in <hi>Stamford,</hi> and to the Dean of <hi>Stamford,</hi> that they ſhould hear and examine ſuch Witneſſes as the Abbot and Convent could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; and cauſe their teſtimony to be Recorded, and to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inſtrument thereof. <hi>Datum Laterani</hi> 7. <hi>Kaland.

               <p>And here it may be fit to mention the Council of <hi>Laterane,</hi> unto which there was a general citation, ſaith <hi>Swapham,</hi> thoughout Chriſtendom: in ſo much that there were aſſembled 400.

                  <hi>tem Eleemoſynae,</hi> that their conſtant allowance might not be diminiſhed, the Abbot ordained, that what was wont to be provided for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they ſhould have at Dinner.</p>
               <p>While the Abbot was at <hi>Rome</hi> King <hi>John</hi> demanded the whole mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſervice of the Abbot. Whoſe Attorneys complaining that they could not <hi>juſtitiare milites libertatis Burgi</hi> (make theſe men do their duty) the King commanded their fees to be deſtrained. Which when the Attorneys ſaid they could not do, the King gave away the Land of <hi>Nic. de Baſſingburn</hi> to <hi>Baldwinus de Gynes;</hi> and the Land of <hi>Roger de Torpel,</hi> to <hi>Will.

And commanded <hi>Will. de Aundres</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Rockingham</hi> that he ſhould deſtrain all the military feods: and that he ſhould not meddle with the demeſne of the Abbot, but let it be undiſturbed, <hi>utpote liberam Eleemoſynam Domini Regis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>feods</hi> I ſuppoſe were reſtored, upon their ſubmiſſion, for I find in a Marginal Note <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Swaph.</hi> fol.

               <p>Before his time there had been great diſcord and murmuring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and envy frequently happened among the Brethren, <hi>propter mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutionem,</hi> about blood-letting (which was very neceſſary ſome time to thoſe ſedentary people, who were ſubject to repletion) And no wonder, becauſe no body could, <hi>accipere minutionem,</hi> be let blood, without an Order from the Prior: who let ſome have it oftner, others more rarely; ſome after <hi>five</hi> weeks, others after 6. and others not till after 8. or 10. or 15. or perhaps half a year. To take away therefore all trouble out of their minds about this matter, this Abbot ordered that the Convent ſhould be divided into <hi>ſix</hi> parts, and upon the day of letting blood, he that was the Senior of that part, whoſe turn it was to have the benefit of it, ſhould ask <hi>licentiam minuendi</hi> (and that under his hand) for his Brethren from the Prior.</p>
               <p>In the Margin of the Book there is this Note. That in Abbot <hi>Walter</hi>'s time this mode of <hi>minution,</hi> was thus far altered; that they ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>five</hi> parts, and then <hi>minuerentur modo ſupradicto.</hi> For <hi>Robert Groſteſte</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in his Viſitation had forbidden the eating of fleſh altogether, unto the Monks every where; except only in the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> or in the Abbots Chamber: which was accounted by them an unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table burden. It is further alſo noted, that the Convent in former times, had liberty at three ſeaſons in the year, to eat as much fleſh as they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a houſe deputed for that purpoſe; and in the <hi>domus Hoſpitum,</hi> houſe where they entertained Strangers; and in all places where they eat out of the <hi>Refectory,</hi> they might eat fleſh. Which liberty was quite taken away by the above named Inhibition of the Biſhop. They who were <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuti</hi> let blood, were formerly refreſhed in the <hi>Refectory</hi> three times a day, with a regular diet; as appears by the <hi>antient Cuſtomary</hi> of this Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Swapham</hi> obſerves, that he found LXXII. Monks here when he came to the Convent: and ſo many, I have noted before, King <hi>Henr.</hi> I. found here, when he took an account of all belonging to the Monaſtery, upon the death of <hi>John de Sais.</hi> And therefore what is ſaid of <hi>Akarius</hi> his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in XXII. Monks, muſt be underſtood, I think, of ſupernumeraries, whom
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61653:155"/>
he maintained for his time at his own charges, <hi>ex intuitu pietatis,</hi> as the words there are.</p>
               <p>For the maintenance of theſe, the Lands in <hi>Alwalton</hi> and <hi>Flettun</hi> had been given by <hi>Andreas:</hi> but were not ſufficient to ſupply the <hi>Kitchin</hi> with proviſions, though it had other Rents beſides; which are all diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in a Charter of his <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Swaph.</hi> fol. CV.</note>, wherein he gives thoſe Mannors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the <hi>Celerary,</hi> with all that had been reſerved out of them to the Abbot, at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> This Abbot <hi>Robert</hi> therefore gave other Revenues, not only for the recreation, as the word is, of thoſe 72 Monks; but for the increment of eight Monks more: whereby the whole Number was made LXXX. And particularly <hi>Belaſiſe,</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> obſerves, to find thoſe 8. with Bread and Beer. Which Corn and Malt was afterward changed into money, in Abbot <hi>Walters</hi> time, becauſe the <hi>Celerarius</hi> of the Abbot and his Servants, would receive none but the very beſt; which was the occaſion of great quarrels.</p>
               <p>In the Charter wherein he ſettles thoſe Lands, he makes mention of the obſervation of his own <hi>Anniverſary:</hi> the expences of which were to be born out of them. <hi>Andreas</hi> I noted before began this cuſtome, as far as I can find, aſſigning an annual Penſion for the celebrating of the Anniverſary of <hi>Benedict</hi> his Predeceſſor. After which I find no mention of it till this Abbots time; who took care not only of his own, but both of <hi>Andreas</hi> his, and of his Succeſſors <hi>Akarius.</hi> For after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Akarius</hi> directing how the ſour Stone of Wax from <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſhould be imployed; there follows immediately a Statute of this Abbot <hi>Robert;</hi> ordaining that upon the Anniverſaries of <hi>Andreas</hi> and <hi>Akarius,</hi> the <hi>Celerarius</hi> ſhould provide <hi>four</hi> good diſhes of meat for the Convent, together with Wine if it could be had, or elſe good Beer; and that the <hi>Eleemoſynary</hi> ſhould diſtribute to the Poor that came on thoſe dayes, a convenient portion of Bread and Ale.</p>
               <p>What the Religious part of the obſervation of theſe days was in this Church, I have not yet found: but in other Churches it appears to have been very ſolemn and great. Particularly in that of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> (where they were of the ſame Order with the Monks of this Church) Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries were about this time kept in all regards, very magnificently. For example, Abbot <hi>Walter</hi> (who dyed not long before <hi>Rob. Lyndſey</hi>'s days <hi>An.</hi> 1191.) gave the Mannor of <hi>Padington</hi> to that Church, and totally deputed it, to this uſe, for the celebration of his Anniverſary, on the Feaſt of St. <hi>Coſmas</hi> and <hi>Damianus.</hi> On which day he requires the Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to provide for the whole Convent, <hi>Simnella, Gaſtella, Canaſtella, Brachinella</hi> and <hi>Wafras:</hi> and to every one of the Brethren one Galon of Wine, <hi>cum tribus bonis pitanciis,</hi> with three good diſhes of Meat (called <hi>pitancias</hi> from the word <hi>Piety,</hi> and thence alſo called <hi>Miſericordias,</hi> now called in the Colledges <hi>exceedings)</hi> and alſo good Ale in abundance before the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at all the Tables, as upon other Feaſts and Anniverſaries it was wont to be found by the <hi>Celerarius,</hi> in the great Tankard of five and twenty Galons. For the ordinary gueſts, who ſhould that day dine in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory,</hi> he requires him to provide <hi>two</hi> diſhes of Meat, with Bread and Wine, and Ale honourably and abundantly: and for the more honou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable perſons make the ſame proviſion, as for the Convent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, find for all comers whatſoever, from the hour that the Table con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Anniverſary was read in the Chapterhouſe, untill the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletorium</hi> of the next day, both in Meat and Drink, Hay and Oats all things neceſſary: nor was entrance to be denyed to any perſon, whether Footman or Horſeman. He was to make proviſion alſo for the Nuns of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61653:156"/>
                  <hi>Holborn,</hi> for the Servants of the Monaſtery, and for <hi>three hundred</hi> poor; every one of which was to have a loaf of Bread, (of the ſame weight with the Bread of the Convent) and a pott of Ale: and they who had no Veſſels might drink <hi>pro voluntate,</hi> as much as they pleaſed. And, to omit the reſt, there was after all, <hi>Mede</hi> to be provided, for the Convent <hi>ad potum charitatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Religious part of the Ceremony, it was after this manner. On the vigils of the forenamed day, the <hi>Prior</hi> and the Convent ſang, <hi>Placebo</hi> and <hi>Dirige,</hi> with <hi>three</hi> leſſons; as on other principal Anniverſaries they were wont, with ringing of Bells: two Wax-Candles burning conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at his Tomb (which was on the South ſide of the Cloyſter) from the ſaid Vigils, to the end of the Maſs <hi>da Requem,</hi> which was ſung the next day.</p>
               <p>On the Anniverſary of <hi>Richard de Crokeſley,</hi> who dyed as long after this time, as the other did before it (1258.) there was a far greater ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: for which he gave the Mannors of <hi>Hampeſtede</hi> and of <hi>Stoke</hi> with other Rents. It began with ringing of Bells, the evening before, for which they received xiii <hi>s.</hi> iiii <hi>d.</hi> and the next day after Maſs, there were Alms given to a <hi>thouſand</hi> poor people: and for ſix days following to <hi>five hundred</hi> every day; to every body a peny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he ordained that four Monks ſhould every of thoſe days ſay Maſs for his Soul at four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Altars: four Wax Candles burning at his Tomb, during the Maſs, if he was buried in the Monaſtery; if without it, then two of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles were to burn at the Altar of the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> the other two at the Altar of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. Provided that upon his <hi>Anniverſary</hi> four Wax-Candles ſhould burn all day about his Tomb, or before the Altars now named, for which he aſſigned three pound, &amp;c. This was agreed in the Chapterhouſe on the <hi>Friday</hi> after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Barnaby</hi> 1256. and he got a confirmation of it from <hi>Alexander</hi> 4. But ten year after his death they obtained a Modification of this Anniverſary from Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> IV. according as the Abbot of <hi>Waltham</hi> and other Delegates appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this buſineſs, ſhould think fit to moderate it. I omit many others, which are in a MS. Hiſtory of that Church written by <hi>John Fleete</hi> a Monk of that Church: which he collected out of better writers than himſelf.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſuch manner no doubt, Anniverſaries were obſerved in this Church of <hi>Burgh:</hi> for I find that in <hi>Akarius</hi> his time, <hi>Hugo de Longo Campo,</hi> Son of <hi>Henry de Longo Campo,</hi> out of reſpect to God and the Salvation of his Soul, granted all his Land in <hi>Eyliſwurthe,</hi> viz. <hi>quadraginta ſex ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidatas terrae in liberam puram ac perpetuam Eleemoſynam,</hi> for the making of his Anniverſary, <hi>cum debita ac ſolita ſolemnitate,</hi> with due and with uſual ſolemnity. Which Charter of his was afterward confirmed by <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Swaph.</hi> fol. XC.</note>.</p>
               <p>Immediately after that Statute about the forenamed Anniverſaries, there follows a Conſtitution (which I ſuppoſe therefore was made by this ſame Abbot <hi>Robert)</hi> directing what was to be done when any part of the Body or Blood of our Lord in the Sacrament, by negligence fell upon the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. Fol.</hi> CCLXIII.</note> Ground, or upon a Matt, Carpet, or the like. Concerning which two other Conſtitutions follow; with verſes comprehending the ſenſe of them: which I have tranſcribed and put in the Appendix.</p>
               <p>This Abbot lived in evil days (which makes the many good things he did beſides theſe the more commendable) there having been great diſcord, as <hi>Swapham</hi> obſerves, between the King and the Church, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Kingdom was interdicted for above ſix years: after which followed cruel and moſt ſhameful Wars between the King and his Nobles;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61653:156"/>
in which Charches were broken down and deſtroyed, and what was in them was pillaged and carried away. After he had governed <hi>Nine</hi> year and ten months he dyed, in the Feaſt of <hi>Criſpinus</hi> and <hi>Criſpinianus.</hi> It ſhould be <hi>eight</hi> year, for he began to govern in the year 1214. and all agree he dyed in the year 1222. So the <hi>MS. Chron. Johan. Abbatis.</hi> An. MCCXXII. <hi>obiit Rob. de Lyndeſey Abbas Burgi, cui ſucceſſit Alexander Abbas.</hi> And ſo <hi>Swapham</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>In which year, I find in the ſame <hi>Chronicon</hi> there was a Council held at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Church of <hi>Oſney,</hi> by <hi>Stephen</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where the Biſhops and other Prelates being generally preſent, ſome of the Inſtitution made in the forenamed Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> with ſome additions, for the reformation of the Clergy and people, were recited. Two of the moſt Noble of which (as he calls them) he ſets down. The <hi>firſt</hi> concerning the <hi>Prelates;</hi> that all of them both Biſhops and Abbots ſhould be bound to change every year, thoſe that waited on them in their Chambers; <hi>ut plures haberent teſtes ſuae Sanctimoniae &amp; caſtitatis.</hi> The other belonging to Subjects; that all Monks and Nuns who were under a Rule, ſhould every year, openly in the Chapterhouſe, recite their profeſſion before the whole company; <hi>ut ſemper illius memores ſiant ad Deum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votiores.</hi>

               <p>He was commemorated here on the day after <hi>Symon</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Kalander: where over againſt that day, I find <hi>Depoſuio Domini Roberti de Lyndſey:</hi> which doth not agree with <hi>Swapham</hi>'s account, who places his death on the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi>

They were ſo linkt together, as to account themſelves one and the ſame Convent: ſo that if one of the Abbots dyed, the ſurvivor being deſired, was immediately to go to his Convent; and there before him they were to make a Canonical Election; or if already made, they were to declare it in his preſence. If the Friers of either place were by any neceſſity driven from their Monaſtery, the other was to receive them, and afford them a familiar refuge and aid: with a place in their Quire, Chapterhouſe and <hi>Refectory, ſecundum converſionis ſuae tempus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Abbot among others ſigned the confirmation of the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Charter de Foreſta</hi> in the <hi>9th</hi> year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the great Biſhops and Abbots and Earls are witneſſes, and among the reſt <hi>Abbas de Burgo Sancti Petri</hi> (but he is not named) in the <hi>Annales Burton</hi> ad An. 1224.</p>
               <p>But that which was moſt memorable concerning this Abbot is, the care he took about the VIII. Monks augmented by his Predeceſſor, which I find in a Charter by it ſelf, in theſe terms, <hi>

               <p>Wherein, out of his paternal care to provide well for thoſe eight Monks, which <hi>Robert</hi> his predeceſſor had added to their wonted number, and at the Petition of the Convent, he granted and confirmed to the <hi>Celerary,</hi> all the new <hi>aſſarts</hi> belonging to the Monaſtery in <hi>Naſſo Burgi</hi> ſc. <hi>Belaſis</hi> with all its appurtenances, <hi>Glintonhawe,</hi> and the aſſart of <hi>Eſtuude</hi> and <hi>Franehawe,</hi> of the purchace of the forenamed <hi>Robert</hi> Abbot, of <hi>Will. de Ginniges,</hi> and all the Meadow in <hi>Norburch,</hi> to find fifty ſeam of Wheat and threeſcore of Barley; and 80. of Oates, for the drink of thoſe VIII.

               <p>The next year 1228. the ſame <hi>Chronicon</hi> tells us the Pope ſummoned a Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the ways were ſtopt by the Emperor, both by Sea and Land, to hinder any from coming to it. Two Cardinals, many Prelates, both Biſhops and Abbots, and other Clergymen, eſpecially thoſe that went by Sea, were taken by the favourers of the Emperor. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Pope Excommunicated him, and abſolved all the Barons of <hi>Germany</hi> from their Allegiance. Thus that <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Martin</hi> got thither or no I do not find, but it was in this year, as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath related, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth granted to this Monaſtery that which they have intituled <hi>Magnum privilegium,</hi> bearing date <hi>Anno gratiae Milleſimo ducenteſimo viceſimo octavo, quarto idus Januarii.</hi> In which beſides that priviledge mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> there are theſe among others remarkable; that he frees them from paying any Tythe of the Land which they kept in their own hands, and Ploughed or Fed themſelves. And that there ſhould be <hi>libera ſepultura</hi> in this place, for any that deſired in their laſt Will or otherwiſe to be here buried, which none ſhould preſume to hinder, except he were an excommunicated perſon, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or exerciſed publick Uſury; and ſaving alſo the rights of other Churches, from which the dead bodies were brought.</p>
               <p>In the year 1230. he aſſerted the liberties of the Church in <hi>Alwalton</hi> and <hi>Fletton</hi> againſt the pretences of the Abbot of <hi>Thorney,</hi> as I find in an old record; which begins thus, <hi>Anno ab incarnatione Domini MCC.

               <p>The next year as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> obſerves, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> viſited this Church, the next day after the Feaſt of St. <hi>Laurence:</hi> where a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things were agreed on by the common conſent of the Abbot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and confirmed by the Epiſcopal authority, under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. One was that the Abbot ſhould not borrow any money upon Uſury, of the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor of any Chriſtians, <hi>cum aliqua poenae adjectione,</hi> without the conſent of the Convent: nor, in that caſe, ever ingage the Monaſtery, or the Goods of the Monaſtery moveable or immovable. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that the Sacriſt of the Church ſhould have, as had been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Horſes and all other things, with the bodies of the <hi>Milites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. With this moderation, that if any Horſe of a deceaſed Knight was worth more than four Mark, the Abbot ſhould have him: and his Arms, or the price of them, ſhould be laid up in ſome ſafe place, by

               <p>In this year alſo an <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was made by his Order, into all the Mannors belonging to the Church: and the Lands, Tenements, Tenants, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are particularly ſet down, belonging to every one of them.

               <p>I have not room to inſert ſeveral compoſitions and agreements made by him.

               <head>WALTER de S. Edmundo.</head>
               <p>This man though born at St. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> was bred up here, as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> relates; and as <hi>Swapham</hi> tells us (who gives a large account of his life) was choſen Abbot by the unanimous conſent of the Monks. At his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallation, he offered a great Pall Flowred with <hi>Peacocks;</hi> with a rich Cope, and many other things of value. And then applied himſelf to inlarge both the Buildings and the Revenue of the Church: for he made the entrance of the new Refectory with great expences; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great buildings below his Palace: eſpecially that great Houſe, in which were two Horſe Mills and a Barn for Hay: and the Kitchin of the Abbot <hi>apud Grangias Burgi,</hi> one new Grange, and <hi>Boveriam novam</hi> covered with Stone. He renewed the Grange at <hi>Thorp,</hi> and made a new <hi>Bovaria</hi> at <hi>Caſtre,</hi> at <hi>Warmington</hi> and at <hi>Owndle;</hi> and a great many other places which <hi>Swapham</hi> mentions: where he ſaith he built an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Barns,</hi> or <hi>Granges,</hi> or <hi>Oxſtalls,</hi> or <hi>Summer-houſes;</hi> beſides Lands which he purchaſed.</p>
               <p>He augmented the Revenue of the <hi>Infirmary</hi> with the increaſe of fifty ſeven Shillings, out of a certain Rent at <hi>Stamford</hi> which he bought. The Rents alſo of the <hi>Hoſpitalary</hi> he increaſed: and both procured ſeveral grants of Lands from other devout people, and ſetled thoſe that had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given. For I find that <hi>Henry</hi> Rector of <hi>Paſton,</hi> for the health of his Soul, and in gratitude for the Benefice he had received from <hi>Walter</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> and the Convent there, gave, with his body, all the Lands he had in <hi>Paſton,</hi> in <hi>Burgh,</hi> in <hi>Wermington,</hi> &amp;c. to this Church <note n="*" place="margin">Fol.

And <hi>Galfridus de Northbruc</hi> made a very great gift of a Capital Meſſuage of his, with all the Lands, Rents, Tenements, and all appurtenances, in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruc,</hi>

               <p>He took an account of all the expences of the Granary, and of the ſtipends of Servants and Officers; and eſpecially the expences on the ſeveral great Feaſts of the Church: which ſtill remain under this Title; <hi>explanatio liberationis &amp; expenſae de granario Burgi per annum, &amp; de diverſis menſuris ejuſdem, &amp; de ſol.

               </p>
               <p>There aroſe in his time a great controverſie between this Church, and the Canons of <hi>Landa</hi> about the Church of <hi>Pitheſle:</hi> and after a long ſuit the Canons yielded it to <hi>Burgh;</hi> whereupon Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> confirmed the Church of <hi>Burgh</hi> in the poſſeſſion of it. I find agreements made between him and <hi>Rich. de Dumar</hi> about Woods, and the bounds of them in <hi>Eſton;</hi> and between him and <hi>Rob. de Burnebu,</hi> and others about <hi>Eſſarts</hi> in the ſame Woods; which I can but juſt mention.</p>
               <p>He was one of the Witneſſes to the great Charter of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> in the XIX. year of his Reign, upon the <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>January.</hi> After the mention of which, there follows in our Records that ſolemn Excommunication (which was made eighteen year after 1253.) of all thoſe that infringed this Charter. It is in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 866.</note>: only in our Book there are theſe words added, which are not in him. <hi>Qui omnes teſtes audierunt cum Dominus Rex, non coactus, ſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria voluntate petiit quod omnes Archiepiſcopi, Epiſcopi &amp; Abbates excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municent ipſum Henricum nomine, ſi ipſe unquam veniret contra aliq' articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum iſtius Chartae, &amp; omnes alios venientes contra eandem chartam.

               <p>Two years after 1237. followed the ſolemn dedication of this Church of <hi>Burg:</hi> Which <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> places in the next year 1238. when he ſaith that ſeveral noble Monaſteries in the Dioceſe of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> within the Fens were dedicated, by the venerable Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> viz. <hi>Ramſey, Burgh</hi> and <hi>Sautrei,</hi> and that the Church of <hi>Burgh</hi> was dedicated <hi>quarto Calendar' Octobris.</hi> But the <hi>Chron. Johan. Abbatis Burgi</hi> makes this to have been done, as I ſaid, the year before, and not on the <hi>4th</hi> of the <hi>Kalends,</hi> but of the <hi>Nones,</hi> and by two Biſhops. <hi>An. MCCXXXVII. quarto No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum Octobris, dedicata eſt Eccleſia de Burgo, à duabus Epiſcopis,</hi> viz. <hi>à Sancto Roberto Lincolnienſi &amp; Exonienſi Epiſcopis.</hi> And ſo ſaith <hi>Swap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not naming the Biſhops, <hi>Ipſe etiam dedicare fecit Eccleſiam Noſtram à duobus Epiſcopis, magnis ſumptibus, &amp; propriis.</hi> This <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Linc'</hi> was <hi>Rob.

Whoſe Sanctity as the <hi>Chronicon</hi> before mentioned celebrates, ſo it gives this Character of his learning, <hi>Iſte er at in omnibus VII. artibus liberalibus eruditiſſimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What this dedication meant Mr. <hi>G.</hi> doubts: but it is explained by a paſſage in <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who follows <hi>M. Paris</hi> and uſes his very words about this buſineſs of the dedication of theſe Churches; but then adds that it was done, <hi>juxta Statuta Concilii London celebrati,</hi> in obedience to certain Conſtitutions, which had been made in a Council at <hi>London.</hi> Which extended further than to the Churches before named, for he ſaith the Church of St. <hi>Paul London</hi> was dedicated 1240. <hi>die Sancti Remigii.</hi> What the ground of that conſtitution was I have not now opportunity to ſearch: but it was ſo famous a thing, that the day of its Dedication was made an <hi>Anniverſary,</hi> and this Abbot gave the ſumm of <hi>forty</hi> Shillings a year, <hi>ad feſtum dedicationis Eccleſiae noſtrae annuum uberius procurandum,</hi> for

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. And this Feaſt is mentioned in another Charter of his, in which for Gods ſake, and with reſpect to peace, as his words are, he grants, that inſtead of the aſſiſe of Corn which the <hi>Celerarius</hi> was wont to pay him, out of <hi>Belaſiſe,</hi> he ſhould hereafter pay him ten Pound ſix Shillings and three Pence <hi>per annum,</hi> quarterly, <hi>viz.</hi> inſtead of 28.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. CVI.</note>. And there is this Note in the Margin, that before the time of this Abbot, till the making this Charter, the Abbots were wont to pay the <hi>Celerarius</hi> for the celebration of the principal Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals eight Pound; to which this Abbot added forty Shillings, for cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the dedication of the Church, which was in his time: in all ten Pound. So that the ten pound before mentioned, the <hi>Celerarius</hi> received back again: and it is to be noted, that this Aſſiſe of Corn was firſt gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe of the increment of eight Monks augmented by Abbot <hi>Robert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which eight Monks this Abbot <hi>Walter</hi> added thirty more: which made the number in all an hundred and ten. But I ſuppoſe it was an act like that of <hi>Acharius</hi> (who maintained <hi>two and twenty</hi> beſides the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al number) which laſted for his own time only. <hi>Swapham</hi>'s words are that he received them out of Charity, by divine Inſpiration, to ſerve Chriſt perpetually. <hi>Recepit itaque Domino inſpirante, Caritatis intuitu XXX Monachos, Jeſu Chriſto perpetue famulandos.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> I muſt add, to make this Feaſt of the Dedication the more ſolemn, granted an indulgence; wherein ten days of Penance injoyned are relaxed to all thoſe, who confeſſing their ſins and being truly penitent, ſhould come to viſit the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Burgh,</hi> on the Feaſt of Dedication, for devotion ſake. It is in the end of the Appendix.</p>
               <p>In the next year all the Abbots of this Order were ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>London</hi> in order to their Reformation, as the <hi>Chron. Joh.

               </p>
               <p>In what year he took his firſt journey to <hi>Rome</hi> I do not find: nor ſhall I add any thing about it or the other two, but what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In his firſt journey he procured certain priviledges for the Church, which <hi>Swapham</hi> only mentions, but tells not what they were. When he returned from his <hi>ſecond,</hi> in which he went no further than <hi>Anvers,</hi> he offered two pieces of rich Silk; Of which two Copes were made by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Holderneſs,</hi> the Subſacriſt. The <hi>third</hi> time he was called by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Mandate, to anſwer the contempt with which he was charged, of granting the Church of <hi>Caſtre</hi> according to the Kings commandment, contrary to the Proviſion of the Pope. For which he was not ſo ſhent as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> relates, if we may believe <hi>Swapham;</hi> but procured his favour by that gift of ten pound a year out of his Chamber to the Popes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew: inſomuch that he got a great priviledge at that time for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church, which begins thus; <hi>Innocentius Servus, &amp;c.</hi> and another, that none belonging to the Monaſtery, ſhould be forced to go <hi>ultra duas dietas</hi> above two days journeys, in any cauſe before the Judge-delegates: and ſome others. At his return he offered a precious Pall of <hi>Baldekine,</hi> with the Image of the bleſſed Virgin, and her Son in her Arms. This was in the year 1244. for then that large Charter of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>IVth</hi> bears date, called <hi>Magnum Privilegium</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. LXXXII.</note>. The Council at <hi>Lyons</hi> was held
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61653:159"/>
the year after 1245. as the <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot informs us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath out of <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> belongs not to this time.</p>
               <p>In that very year which he mentions, the eighth year of his Abbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (which was 1241.) the <hi>milites</hi> of the Abby were ſummoned to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropesbury,</hi> to go to <hi>Wales</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. CCLXX.</note>: whither the Abbot himſelf went; and ſome Knights with him. Who earneſtly inſiſting to have their expences, Horſes and Arms from the Abbot, he would by no means grant it: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, by the Fealty they owned to the King and to him, to follow the King to <hi>Cheſter;</hi> which they did. The Abbot alſo came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they again made the ſame demands; pretending that <hi>Stephen de Segrave</hi> had given judgment for them <hi>apud Lehayetayle.</hi> Of whom when the Abbot had diligently inquired, he declared before him, and his family, that it was falſe; and ſaid the Knights ought to defend the Abbot at their own charge, with Horſes and Arms. Then they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Marſhal of the Army, who determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter againſt them: and the Abbot commanded them, that at the ſummons of the Marſhal, they ſhould be inrolled; which they refuſed. But the Abbot <hi>ad cautelam</hi> cauſed <hi>Radulph. de Ayſton</hi> and <hi>Hugo de Bernack</hi> to be inrolled, and two Servants of his family <hi>pro uno milite:</hi> And ſo the Abbot returned with good grace from the King; and his Knights, neither going nor coming could recover one farthing of him. The Steward of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and other Prelates did the ſame. And by the diligence of the Abbot, he received from the Kings Exchequer, <hi>plenarie ſcutagium ſuum, ſc. de quolibet ſcuto X L. Sol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, in the time of <hi>John de Calceto</hi> he had <hi>ſcutagium ſuum plenarie de dictis militibus:</hi> And when they complained to the King and the Magnates, that the Abbot ought to pay that <hi>ſcutagium</hi> out of his own Chamber, the Abbot made it appear that he ought not.</p>
               <p>In that grand Priviledge of <hi>Innocent</hi>'s, there is the ſame grant, which is mentioned in <hi>Greg.</hi> the <hi>IXths;</hi> that they might ſay divine Service with a low voice, in the time of a general Interdict; the gates being ſhut, no Bells rung, and all Excommunicated and interdicted perſons excluded. Many other Bulls there were of his, as I noted out of <hi>Swap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſome of which remain. One of them imports, that by his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date they ſtood bound to pay to <hi>Opizomus</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Parma,</hi> a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fifteen Mark yearly, untill they had provided him with ſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Benefice, worth forty Mark of Silver yearly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more. But he now granted them this indulgence for the future, that they ſhould not be bound to provide any perſon with a benefice for the future, againſt their wills; nor receive any Letters Apoſtolical to that purpoſe; unleſs they made expreſs mention of this Indulgence, and ſaid that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Apoſtolical Indulgence they muſt do it. Afterward Letters A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical were directed from another Pope, to ſeveral Priors therein named, to ſee his Abſolution executed, which he had granted to the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh,</hi> from the payment of ſuch Penſions; when the perſon who received them would not accept of the Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, to which they offered to preſent them, when they fell. Which ſome refuſed; becauſe they had benefices already, but no diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hold another: and ſo would have kept their Penſions, when a Benefice was provided for them, to the great grievance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</p>
               <p>Another of <hi>Innocent</hi>'s, is dated from <hi>Lyons</hi> on the <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of his Pontificate, which was a little before his death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61653:160"/>
they having repreſented their Monaſtery to be built in a cold place, ſo that they could not without danger, in Winter time eſpecially, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form divine Offices with heads uncovered; he grants them a licence, <hi>utendi pileis ipſorum ordini congruentibus,</hi> to uſe Capps ſuitable to their Order; according as the Abbot in his diſcretion ſhould think fit.</p>
               <p>Another is, that they having repreſented to him how great a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance it was to their devotion, to have cauſes frequently referred to them by the See Apoſtolical, he grants them this Indulgence, that they ſhould not be bound, againſt their wills, to take Cognizance of any cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, by the ſame See for the future: unleſs in the Letters of Reference, expreſs mention were made of this Indulgence.</p>
               <p>There is a Statute made by this Abbot, but I do not find in what year, with the conſent of the Chapter, that on the Feaſt of the Dedication of their Church, (as upon the principal Feaſts of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul)</hi> ſeven Candles ſhould burn before the Altar, <hi>ſuper baccas,</hi> and four upon the Altar, <hi>à principio Matutinorum, uſque ad finem totius ſervitii:</hi> and that the Arm of St. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> as I noted before, ſhould be carried in proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on on this feſtival, unleſs it had been carried on his own day.</p>
               <p>Out of a Meadow in <hi>Peykirk,</hi> which he bought of <hi>Roger</hi> Son of <hi>Paganus de Helpſtona,</hi> he gave forty Shillings, to the celebration of his own <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> viz. twenty Shillings for the recreation of the Brethren, and the other for the refection of the Poor, upon the day of his death. This Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>William</hi> his Succeſſor, made over to the Convent intirely, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants it to them; that he and his Succeſſors might be freed from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that forty Shillings.</p>
               <p>At the laſt time of his croſſing the Seas, he gave ſeveral pretious things, <hi>feretris trium Virginum</hi> (viz. <hi>Kiniburge, Kiniſwith,</hi> and <hi>Tibbe)</hi> and a great number of Veſſels and Jewels, when he dyed; which were all brought into the Chapterhouſe, and there diſpoſed according to the pleaſure of the Convent. He was not well before he went; and the infirmity of his body was increaſed by his journey: ſo that he dyed not long after his return, <hi>An.</hi> 1245. For whom <hi>Swapham</hi> makes this prayer; <hi>The Lord grant he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy eternal life and joy in the Land of the living; by the merits of the Mother of God, and of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> St. Benedict, <hi>and all the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was pious and merciful to all; did nothing without the advice of his Brethen of the better ſort; exacted nothing unduly of his Tenants, whether rich or poor: But if any poor Man or Woman made their neceſſities known to him, he would burſt out into tears and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon them.</p>
               <p>In ſome things he acted <hi>tepide,</hi> which he bewailed all his days: but he left the Abbey abounding in all good things; ſtored with Horſes, Oxen, Sheep, and all Cattle in great multitudes, and Corn in ſome places for three years. But after his deceaſe, <hi>Magiſter R. de Goſebek,</hi> to whom the King committed the cuſtody of the Abbey, waſted, and ſold, and, in a manner, carried all away.</p>
               <p>There were found in his Chamber when he dyed, a great many Cupps of Gold and Silver; whoſe weight and worth are ſet down in <hi>Swapham,</hi> with ſix ſilver Plates, twenty nine Spoons, thirty gold Rings; and a great deal of Riches beſides. Which is the more wonderful ſince he was ſo very charitable, and frequently gave Preſents, and Jewels of Gold and Silver, to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> his Queen, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> their Son, and to the Nobles and great Men of <hi>England</hi> (beſides what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> mentions) and all for the peace and tranquillity, and defence of the Liberties of the Church.</p>

Who lays the blame upon this Abbot; becauſe he hindred the Abbot of <hi>Croyland</hi> in their Fair time, from taking Toll, or making Attachments upon <hi>Crowland</hi> Bridge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This he ſaith was in the year 1240. Which cannot be, for then <hi>Walter</hi> was Abbot: it ſhould be therefore 1246. in the very beginning of <hi>William</hi>'s time. Who the next year made a compoſition about this matter 1247. as I find in our Records, at the end of <hi>Swapham</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Fol.

               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year 1247. <hi>Robert de Taterhille</hi> Phyſician made his laſt Will and Teſtament, and thereby gave to the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> his Body, with his Palfrey; to the Fabrick of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church V. Shillings, and to the Church of St. <hi>Mary de Oxney</hi> two Shilling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and four Acre of Arable Land <hi>apud Rumpele</hi> to find two Wax-Candles before the Altar of the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>in Eccleſia majori de Burgo,</hi> as long as the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> lived. And if his Wife <hi>Ailice</hi> out-lived him, ſhe was to enojoy that Land, and the houſe he alſo gave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for her life, if ſhe remained a Widow, and to find four Wax-Candles: After both their deaths, all to go to the <hi>Cuſtos luminaris beatae Virginis,</hi> to find ſo many lights before her Altar as that Land, Houſe and Meadow would furniſh.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year likewiſe (An. 2. <hi>Will. 2di.

                  <note place="margin">Fol. CVII. </note>This <hi>William</hi> in the year 1248. obliged himſelf and Succeſſors, to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral things very profitable for the Convent.

And leſt in proceſs of time, the condition of the Convent ſhould be worſted, he granted and promiſed, that neither he nor his Succeſſors, would diminiſh their allowances, nor procure them to be diminiſhed. And that the Parents, and acquaintance of the Monks ſhould be competently and ſufficiently provided, with better bread and beer than ordinary, out of the <hi>Celerary</hi> of the Abbot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which he ſet his Seal, and the Chapter theirs. </p>
               <p>In the ſame year he granted out of his mere liberality to the <hi>Celera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the Church, his Mannor of <hi>Goſdkirk,</hi> with all the appurtenances; and all the Tenement called <hi>Belaſiſe,</hi> with the appurtenances, for the eight pound Sterling, in which he and his Predeceſſors ſtood bound at the four quarters of the year, for the celebration of the principal Feaſts: and for the forty Shillings which <hi>Walter</hi> his Predeceſſor gave, for cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Feaſt of the Dedication of the Church.

And the damage they complained of was not ſo great, but he had an honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration in the Church after his death, which was on the ſixth of <hi>January.</hi> Which was <hi>Depoſitio Willielmi de Hotot Abbatis, &amp; Anniverſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Richardi de Watervill, &amp; Johan. filii ejus.</hi> And ſuch was the regard that his Succeſſor <hi>John de Kaleto</hi> had to him, that he ordained there ſhould be a diſtribution to the Poor <hi>ſine impedimento,</hi> after Maſs was ſaid for them, on this day: and the like on all Anniverſaries.</p>

               <head>JOHANNES de Caleto.</head>
               <p>He is as oft called <hi>Joh. de Calceto,</hi> as <hi>de Caleto:</hi> and it appears by a Charter of his concerning his Anniverſary wherein he relates what good deeds he had done for this Church) that the Abbey was kept vacant for ſome time, before he was promoted. It begins thus, <hi>Omnibus Chriſti fidelibus praeſens ſcriptum viſuris vel audituris, Johannes de Kaleto Divina permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>one,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſenſe of it follows thus in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Be it known to all, that we, though unworthy, being intruſted by the providence of the Divine goodneſs, with the Government of the ſaid Church, found it in Debt: the moveable Goods of it, in the hands of the Kings Bailiffs, who had the cuſtody of it, in the time of the vacancy, being in danger to be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: In ſo much that it lay upon us intirely to provide both for our ſelves, and for our Brethren, and for the Servants, and for all Strangers, all things neceſſary from the Feaſt of the Purification of the bleſſed Virgin, till the time of the next Harveſt. For which reaſon, and becauſe we indeavoured with all our might to preſerve the liberties of the Church (for the renewing and acquiring of which liberties contained in a Charter of King <hi>Henry,</hi> Son of King <hi>John,</hi> we paid to the King and his Courtiers five hundred and ſeventy Marks, beſides Jewels given, by the by, to the Kings Miniſters) and becauſe we diſcharged the Church of a Debt of 520 Mark, wherein the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> ingaged our Church to the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in a manner freed the Church from all Debts whatſoever, as much as was poſſible in ſuch a time; Therefore our beloved Children the <hi>Prior</hi> and the Convent of the ſaid Church devoutly and humbly deſiring to give ſome reward, according to their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to our labour and diligence; and not willing that theſe nor other our benefits, though ſmall, ſhould be hereafter forgotten, but be called to mind perpetually by our Succeſſors, ſerving God in the ſame Church, have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly granted that the day of our Depoſition, ſhall be made an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; and be kept <hi>curialiter</hi> out of the goods of the Church. We therefore have given and aſſigned to the <hi>Celerarius</hi> of the Convent for ever, that Land which <hi>de Biffleto</hi> near <hi>Caſtre</hi> Wood, we have cauſed to be turned into Paſture and Ploughed: that he who is in that office for the time being, may, as far as that Revenue will extend, feed and refreſh the Poor, who come hither on that day; giving every one of them Bread and Beer: and provide three good diſhes of Meat, more large than ordinary, for the Convent, that they may do their devotion more cheerfully, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt more vigorouſly in divine Service. The <hi>Pitanciarius</hi> alſo ſhall find Wine, as on other principal Feaſts, for the Convent that day, out of thoſe five Hogſheads of Wine, which we have given to the uſe of the Preſident in the Refectory, and of the Prieſt that attends Weekly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In what year this Charter was made it doth not appear, but it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the year 1256. when, on <hi>Palmſunday,</hi> he made that Grant of the five Hogſheads of Wine: as I find in a particular Charter, confirmed in Chapter, which he made, he ſaith, out of his Paſtoral care of the Poor and Strangers, and for the honour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and of the Saints whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques lay in this Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherein he provides that the Preſident of the Refectory, whoſoever he was, ſhould have of his gift one galon and a half of Wine every day in the year, to be diſtributed among the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61653:162"/>
and Gueſts, who eat there that day: and this both when the Ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bot was abſent, and when he was preſent: And in like manner the Prieſt who ſaid high Maſs ſhould have one galon of the ſame Wine. Which that it might be abundantly provided, he gives the ten Pound out of the Mannor mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> which was purchaſed in his time. Which Land he therefore requires ſhould be kept in the hand of the Abbot, that without any delay or difficulty the money might be paid on the Octaves of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to the Procurator, who ſhould be eſpecially deputed by the Prior of the Convent: So that out of the aforeſaid ten Pound he ſhould buy five Hogſheads of Wine; to make the aforeſaid pittance in the Refectory and no where elſe. And he adds that out of this Wine proviſion ſhould be made for the whole Congregation, and for all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Strangers, according to the cuſtom, on his Anniverſary as on the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of <hi>Benedict</hi> it was to be more plentifully. Unto which Deed his Seal, and that of the Chapters was ſet. How the Church of <hi>Polebroke</hi> out of which that <hi>ten</hi> Pound was paid, came to be his ſhall be ſhown in its due place.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned this about his Anniverſary in the firſt place, becauſe it recites many of his benefactions, from the beginning of his Abbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: which I do not know how to place in the particular years where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were done.</p>
               <p>There is a Charter of his in the year 1251. in this Stile, <hi>Joh. de Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceto Dei gratia Abbas de Burgo Sancti Petri,</hi> &amp;c. which I do not meet with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for they are wont to ſay <hi>divina permiſſione.</hi> But afterward I find ſome other Abbots imitated him. He grants therein the annual Rent of ſixteen Shillings a year, out of his houſes in the Suburbs of <hi>London, in Parochia Sancti Sepulchri.</hi> Eight Shillings of which were for the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; the other half for the Hoſpitalary. Other houſes this Church then had in <hi>London;</hi> for <hi>William de Colonia</hi> granted him and the Convent (I find not in what year) all his Land in <hi>London,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> over againſt the houſes of the Dean of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> they paying year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly five Florins to that Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a bond of <hi>Peter de Howm</hi> to him, for the paiment of five Shillings Rent yearly unto <hi>Burgh,</hi> for a houſe in <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>Skin-market:</hi> lying between his own houſe on the North, and the houſe ſometime belonging to <hi>Leo Judaeus,</hi> on the South part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1253 <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> granted an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to this Church, relaxing to thoſe who out of devotion to St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> came to offer in this Church, and were truly penitent and confeſſed, <hi>forty</hi> days of Penance that had been injoyned them. And he alſo confirmed ſuch Indulgences as had been granted by any of his <hi>Suffragans.</hi> It bears date from <hi>Croyland</hi> the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There had been the like Indulgence granted a little before by <hi>Hugo Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi> Biſhip of <hi>Ely,</hi> to thoſe who out of devotion went piouſly to viſit the Arm of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> and other Reliques in this Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom he grants 30. days relaxation of Penance. Dated 11. <hi>Kalend. Sept.</hi> 1253. Another there is of <hi>Will.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi> granting ten days Indulgence, as I noted before to thoſe that viſited this Church on the Feaſt of the Dedication before mentioned. All which ſhow the true nature of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> which were only relaxations of Penance: and that other Biſhops granted them as well as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> as they alſo ſometimes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized a perſon for a Saint. I have tranſcribed them all, and ſet them down in the <hi>Appendix</hi> together with an <hi>Indulgence</hi> of <hi>Oliver Sutton</hi> ſome
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61653:162"/>
years after, wherein he grants a merciful relaxation to all thoſe that on certain times, ſhould devoutly come to the Altar of the bleſſed Virgin, in her Chapel in the Monaſtery of <hi>Burgh,</hi> which he had newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Boniface</hi> on the ſame day and year directed his Letters to the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> mentioning a Conſtitution of the Council held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which Excommunicated all thoſe, who either violated or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Eccleſiaſtical rights and liberties: which he being deſirous to maintain, by theſe preſents, commands that all the diſturbers or violaters of the rights and liberties of the Church of St. <hi>Peter de Burgo</hi> (which had been granted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or any other perſons) ſhould publickly and ſolemnly, in general and by name be Excommunicated; when it appeared they were guilty of ſuch diſturbance or violence.</p>
               <p>About this time I ſuppoſe, it was that <hi>Polebroke</hi> before mentioned (out of which the ten pound for finding the five Hogſheads of Wine was paid) was purchaſed by this Abbot. The whole Hiſtory of which is related in the <hi>Monaſticon,</hi> out of a Regiſter of this Church in Sir <hi>Joh. Cotton</hi>'s Library. Which ſaith that <hi>Euſtachius Vicecomes,</hi> Founder of the Church of St. <hi>Mary de Huntingdon,</hi> held two <hi>Fees de Honore Burgi,</hi> in <hi>Clopton, Polebroke, Catworth, &amp;c.</hi> Which Eſtate came afterward to one <hi>Will. de Lovetot;</hi> and then to his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who held theſe two <hi>Fees</hi> in King <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt's time: as appears by his Charter in the firſt year of his Reign, which confirms to the Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> among other Lands, <hi>duo feoda in Clopton &amp; pertinentiis,</hi> which were held by <hi>Richard de Lovetot.</hi> Who had two Sons <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Nigell;</hi> and three Daughters, <hi>Amicitia, Roſia</hi> and <hi>Margeria. William</hi> dying without Iſſue, the Eſtate came to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;</hi> who being a Beneficed Clergyman, it came upon his death to the three Siſters. The two Eldeſt of which, though married, had no ſhare in theſe Fees; but they fell to the youngeſt, who was married to <hi>Richard Patrick:</hi> and by him had a Son and a Daughter; <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>Margery.</hi> She married to <hi>Will. de Vernon;</hi> and her Brother <hi>William</hi> gave all his ſhare in the Eſtate (which was in the hand of <hi>Hugo Fleming</hi> and <hi>Tho. Smert</hi> and their Heirs who did homage to <hi>Will. Patrick</hi> for it) to his Siſter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</hi> Who after his death, in her free Widowhood gave and granted all the Homages and Services of the aforeſaid <hi>Fleming</hi> and <hi>Smert</hi> and their Heirs to <hi>John de Caleto</hi> Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> by her Deed. And afterward <hi>Rob. Fleming feofavit praedictum Johannem Abbatem, de omnibus terris &amp; Tenementis quae habuit in Polebroke per Chartam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Charter I find in our Records here remaining; wherein <hi>Rob. de Flemenk</hi> gives to <hi>John de Caleto</hi> his Tenement in <hi>Polebroke,</hi> and the Advou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Church.</p>
               <p>In this year King <hi>Henry</hi> granted the very ſame Charter to this Church, which <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt had done; confirming all their Lands in the ſeveral Counties of the Realm by name. It bears date at <hi>Windſor</hi> 12 <hi>Junii, Anno Regni ſui</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>The like for their Liberties (in which is the Fair for eight days and the eight Hundreds, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and for their Woods.</p>
               <p>In the next year 1254. three neighbouring Abbots dyed as I find in the <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot, <hi>viz. Thomas de Wells</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland, David</hi> Abbot of <hi>Thorney;</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ramſey.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the IV. dyed alſo. And in this year there was an aid granted to the King <hi>ad primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genit. fil. ſuum Militem faciend.</hi> for the making Prince <hi>Edward</hi> a Knight <hi>An. Regis Hen.</hi> 38. <hi>ſc. de quolibet ſcuto de Honore Burgi XL. Sol.</hi> every Knights Fee of the Honour of <hi>Burgh</hi> paying forty Shillings: which was received by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61653:163"/>
one of the Friers <hi>Rich. de London.</hi> So the Title of this account runs in our Book. <hi>fol.</hi> CCCLXXI. <hi>Recept. fratris R. de Lond. de denariis Auxilii Domini Regis H.</hi> &amp;c. And then follow the names of all the Knights and their payments: the firſt being <hi>Galfridus de Sancto Medardo</hi> who payd twelve Pound, and therefore had ſix Knights Fees: the ſecond <hi>Radulph. de Kameys,</hi> who paid as much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have not room for the reſt; who are two and fifty in all: ſome of which had but half Fees, and others leſs.</p>
               <p>In this year it was alſo, that the King ſent his Juſtices into many places in <hi>England,</hi> to do right to every man, and to free the Country from Thieves and Highwaymen, <hi>Quorum unus fuit Abbas de Burgo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Matth Paris,</hi> one of which Juſtices was the Abbot of <hi>Burgh;</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath obſerved.</p>
               <p>In the year 1257. there was a power granted to this Abbot, to diſtrain both of his Knights and of all other Freeholders, who owed him ſervice, but had not done it; that he might be able to perform the ſervice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtood bound to the King; for his aſſiſtance in his War then in <hi>Wales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For the Abbot ſtood bound to the King; for <hi>Sixty</hi> Knights Fees, which he had not performed: and therefore a diſtreſs was granted againſt him, upon all the Land he held of the King in that ſervice, without any prejudice to what the Church held <hi>in perpetuam eleemoſynam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next year I find a final agreement made between him and <hi>Ralph Crumbwell,</hi> Son of <hi>Rob. Crumbwell;</hi> about <hi>ſixty</hi> Acres of Meadow in <hi>Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> A confederation alſo between him and the Prior of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they engaged their Churches in ſuch a mutual ſociety and Friendſhip, as I mentioned before between <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Abbot of St. <hi>Edmunds:</hi> and ſeveral other things which I cannot find in what year they were done. Particularly a Charter made by <hi>Steven de Horbiling,</hi> wherein he gives to him and the Convent a Capital Meſſuage in <hi>Burgh,</hi> in the Street called <hi>Tugate:</hi> and another hard by it, and three Acres of Arable Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 34. that he found no mention of the Rule of St. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> in this Monaſtery, till this Abbots time. Which is ſomething ſtrange, when in the life of <hi>Martin de Ramſey</hi> P. 30. he takes notice of the <hi>Grand Priviledge</hi> granted by <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>IXth</hi> to this Church. For in that Bull there is an expreſs command for the obſervation of it for ever: Nay, it is the very firſt thing in it after the Preface. <hi>Imprimis ſiquidem ſtatuentes, ut Ordo Monaſticus qui ſecundum Deum, &amp; beati Benedicti regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam in eodem Monaſterio eſſe dignoſcitur inſtitutus, perpetuis ibidem temporibus inviolabiliter obſervetur.</hi> Where he ſpeaks of it as a Rule already inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Monaſtery, before that time; which was in the year 1228.</p>
               <p>And the only thing I have yet met withal, to make one think this Rule was here introduced ſooner than I have before ſaid <hi>(viz.</hi> in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>'s time) is the mention of it in the Charter of <hi>Ethelbaldus</hi> (which I have ſince taken notice of) Founder of the Church of <hi>Croyland An.</hi> 716. Where he calling it the Monaſtery of Black Monks ſerving God <hi>ſub norma Sancti Benedicti</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ingulphus</hi> p. 3. <hi>Edit. Oxon.</hi>
                  </note>: it may thence be probably conjectured, that this Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monaſtery, (then called <hi>Medeſhamſtede)</hi> was under the ſame Rule at that time: which was when <hi>Egbaldus</hi> was Abbot here; who is one of thoſe that ſigns that Charter of <hi>Croyland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no account given in the <hi>MS. Chron. Johannis Abbatis Burgi,</hi> of the time of this Abbot's death, nor when <hi>Rob. de Sutton</hi> was choſen: though the memorable things are ſet down, which hapned in the following years: which makes me think <hi>John de Kaleto</hi> was the Author of that <hi>Chronicon.</hi> But <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Wittleſea</hi> hath informed us, when he dyed, which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath noted. And the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> I have often mentioned, tells us he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61653:163"/>
departed this Life on the firſt of <hi>March:</hi> which was <hi>Depoſitio Joh. de Calceto Abbatis &amp; Anniverſarium Ivonis ſuperioris.</hi> On which day they were to pray for the Souls of the Father and Mother of this <hi>John</hi> Abbot.</p>
               <p>There are two memorable Statutes of this Abbots which ought not to be omitted, becauſe they explain the cuſtoms of this Church.</p>
               <p>One is that when a Monk had been four years compleat in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery (which in their Language is <hi>quatuor annos converſionis ſuae impleverit)</hi> he ſhould from that time receive out of the Chamber, <hi>coopertorium &amp; tunicam; &amp; ſimiliter caputium &amp; ſtragulam:</hi> which it ſeems he provided before at his own charges.</p>
               <p>The other is, that every Monk ſhould have <hi>coradium ſuum plenarie</hi> for a whole year after his deceaſe; as if he had been alive, except only the <hi>pitanciae. Inſuper Pelliciam, Soculares, Caligas &amp; Pedules,</hi> together with his <hi>Pilch</hi> (or Shirt) his Boots, Breeches, Socks (or Stockings) which the <hi>Prior, Camerarius</hi> and <hi>Eleemoſynarius,</hi> were to ſee done, and faithfully diſtributed to the Poor. Both theſe were enacted in Chapter, with the full conſent of the Convent.</p>

               <head>ROBERT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S de Sutton.</head>
               <p>The year before he dyed he made a Deed like that of <hi>John de Caleto</hi>'s, beginning after the ſame manner; wherein he grants to the Convent one Mark a year, out of certain Lands of <hi>John de Sermoney,</hi> and forty Shillings of annual Rent, for the making the day of his death an Anniverſary: But he doth not expreſs how he would have it kept. He ſet only his own ſeal to it, <hi>datum apud Burgum An.</hi> 1273, upon the <hi>Munday</hi> before the Feaſt of the <hi>Chair</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>In which year, on the 11. of the <hi>Kal.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> I find an agreement made between the Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Sawtry,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Secta Curiae de Caſtre,</hi> which the Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> challenged from him of <hi>Sawtry,</hi> from three Weeks to three Weeks, for certain Tenements which he held in Fee of the Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> in <hi>Catteworth</hi> and <hi>Wynewick.</hi> Which the Abbot of <hi>Sawtrey</hi> acknowledged to be due from him and his Convent, to the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh:</hi> who remitted the ſame ſute for the future, upon payment of five Shillings Rent yearly, to the Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> &amp;c. which if it was not paid he had power to diſtrain upon the Tenements by his Bailiffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alicia de Scotere</hi> Widow gave a great deal of Land to the Church in his time, which ſhe had in <hi>Burgh, Dodeſtorp, Paſton,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nicolaus de Cutyller</hi> renounced all his right and claim in a Meſſuage of twelve acres of Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a great many more Grants I find, made to the ſame <hi>Rob.

               <p>The <hi>Chron.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Abbot, as its title bears, being carried on by ſome other hands: and having related how a Council was held at <hi>Lyons</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> X. in the year 1274; wherein was determined what Order of <hi>Mendicants</hi> ſhould continue, and what ſhould ceaſe; adds: <hi>obierunt ibi multi Praelati in redeundo de Concilio.

               <p>There were two Agreements, I find, made by this Abbot at his very entrance: one between him and the Abbot of <hi>Thornholm;</hi> another with the Abbot of <hi>Swinſhened</hi> (neither of which are named) dated at <hi>Burg</hi> 1275. on the Feaſt of the Purification.</p>
               <p>After which follows in our Records, <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. CLXV.</note> a Deed of <hi>Galfridus de Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> Knight, which he made <hi>Richardo de London Abbati de Burg Sancti Petri,</hi> &amp;c. Of which <hi>Galfridus</hi> he bought the Mannor of <hi>Gunthorp,</hi> and ſettled it upon the Eleemoſynary, <hi>an.</hi> 1277.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Year, upon the Feaſt of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> died <hi>Rob. de Wreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:</hi> whereupon <hi>Will. de Wodeford,</hi> then Sacriſt of <hi>Burg. St. Reter,</hi> came and claimed his Body to be buried in the Church of <hi>Burgh.</hi> But the Friends of the deceaſed being very inſtant with him, that with his leave it might be buried in the Church of <hi>Vengirſt;</hi> and the fore-named Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſt conſidering, the inundation of Waters which then was, and many other dangers in the ways, and moved by their Prayers, buried the Corps himſelf in the aforeſaid Church, <hi>de gratia ſua ſpeciali</hi> of his ſpecial grace and favour; as the words are in the <hi>Memorandum</hi> left of it in our Book <note n="*" place="margin">Fol. CLXI.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nor far from which I find another <hi>Memorandum,</hi> of a thing of like nature, which hapned two year before. When there was a controverſie aroſe between the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh</hi> on the one part, and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a'e Nevile</hi> of <hi>Scottun</hi> on the other part: about the burial of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Philip de Nevil,</hi> Father to the ſaid <hi>Rob.</hi> and the <hi>Mortuary</hi> which the Monaſtery challenged, as due to the Church from one of their Knights. Which was thus at laſt compoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the aforeſaid <hi>Rob.</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly petitioned the Abbot and Convent that they would permit the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of his Father, which had been already made at <hi>Scottun, hâc vice,</hi> for this time: and that in like manner they would be pleaſed <hi>hâc vice</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Mortuary due to them. And accordingly the Abbot and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, with reſpect to the love which the aforeſaid <hi>Robert</hi> bare to them, did for that time allow the Burial and releaſe the Mortuary, <hi>de gratia &amp; liberalitate ſua. Dat. apud Burgh in Craſtino Sancti Barthol. An. Dom. MCCLXX. Quinto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year <hi>MCCLXX Octavo</hi> there was the like caſe with the firſt, only with this difference, that <hi>Emma</hi> the Wife of <hi>Galfridus de Sancto Medardo</hi> died about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> at the Mannor of <hi>Oſgoteby,</hi> and the ſame <hi>W. de Wodeford</hi> Sacriſt of <hi>Burg,</hi> preſented himſelf: being ready to defend the right of the Church to have the Body of the ſaid Woman, to be buried at <hi>Burgh;</hi> according to an agreement made long before between the Monks and the Knights of the ſaid Church, before the Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln:</hi> but ſhe having deſired to be buried at <hi>Stanford,</hi> at their devout requeſt, the fore-named Sacriſt out of ſpecial grace and favour conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended for that time (ſaving the rights of <hi>Burgh)</hi> to let her deſire be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>This Abbot recovered many Rents belonging to the Church; and many grants were made to it in his time; but I do not find in what years, nor have I room to mention them particularly. But one muſt not be forgotten, which was the Gift of a whole Street in <hi>Burgh,</hi> by <hi>Will. de Wauton</hi> or <hi>Walton,</hi> Son of <hi>William,</hi> Son of <hi>John de Wauton:</hi> who ſays, <hi>dedi &amp; conceſſi, &amp; hac preſenti carta mea confirmavi, Dominis meis Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardo</hi>

               <p>There was an agreement made between him and <hi>Oliver</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> about ſome things in difference; but they are not mentioned in the MS. <hi>Chron. Johan.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tfangthef</hi> in all his Hundreds and Demeaſnes, and ſo he avowed his Gallows: and complained againſt the Biſhop for taking two Horſes and ſix Cows at <hi>Newark,</hi> and driving them to his <hi>Parc</hi> or Pound, and there detaining them. To which the Biſhop replied, That he held his <hi>Wapentak</hi> of the gift of the King, within which were the two Towns of <hi>Collingham,</hi> which the ſaid Abbot held, and for which he ought to make ſuit at the ſaid <hi>Wapentac,</hi> by three Men of each Town: which he not doing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took the Horſes and Kine. The Cauſe went againſt the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot: and he was conſtrained to ſubmit, and pull down his Gallows.</p>
               <p>It was this Abbot, I ſuppoſe, who bound himſelf and whole Convent, and all their Goods to certain Merchants for a ſumm of Mony for the Kings uſe: who made over to them his Mannor <hi>de Graham</hi> and all the Appurtenances, until the Debt was ſatisfied, with all damages and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. For I find Letters Patents of this King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, unto the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh</hi> making mention of this, and of the Writings on each part under their Hands and Seals: and how the Debt being paid, the Abbot and Convent had reſtored to the King his part with his Seal; but he could not find their Counter-part. Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he declared by theſe Letters to be <hi>caſſa &amp; vacua &amp; penitus nullius valoris in perpetuum,</hi> and ſhould be reſtored to the Abbot when it could be found.</p>
               <p>There is a Petition alſo to this King from the Abbot that they might enjoy the right they had, <hi>per cartas omnium Regum Angliae à tempore Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liemi Baſtardi uſque ad nunc,</hi> to the Tithe of all the Veniſon <hi>(decimam totius venationis)</hi> taken in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> by whomſoever taken: in poſſeſſion of which they had always peaceably remained. Which the King confirmed by two Charters: and the Queen alſo ſent her Letters about it.</p>
               <p>In this Year (14 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.) <hi>William Parys</hi> died, who built, as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> obſerves, the Chappel of the Bleſſed Virgin, adjoyning to the Church on the North-ſide of the Quire.

This Chapel was finiſhed ſix year before, being conſecrated, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved before, by <hi>Oliver Sutton</hi> in the year 1290. There was a Chapel of the bleſſed Virgin belonging to this Church before, called <hi>Capella beatae Virginis de Parco,</hi> as I noted in the life of <hi>Akarius:</hi> becauſe it ſtood I ſuppoſe in the <hi>Park,</hi> belonging to this Monaſtery.

               <p>How this Abbot came to be engaged for him, or what relation he had to him I do not find; nor have I room for any further account of him: but only this.

               <p>In his ſecond year, the 37. of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 1369. all the Monks of the black Order held a General Chapter at <hi>Northampton</hi> (where <hi>Thomas</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Alban</hi> preſided) in which it was decreed, among other things, that they ſhould make a perpetual and continual memory, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their whole Order, for the Quick and the Dead, every hour of the day and night: as <hi>Walſingham</hi>

               <p>There are certain Conſtitutions I find made by him 1398. and others in the years 1401. and 1406. which I can but mention.</p>

               <p>All that I find of him, are ſome Statutes which he made 1409. about the right obſervations of certain Feſtivals: and others made by him in the year 1420.

Who met ſeveral times, and inſpected the Evidences on both ſides, but after much time and expences, could not agree to determine any thing: but reſolved to throw the matter upon the Abbots themſelves, to make an end of it. Who met at <hi>Ibury</hi> a Mannor of the Abbot of <hi>Burgh,</hi> with the <hi>Priors</hi> of each Monaſtery; and heard from one of the Arbitrators, what it was which they would not determin, without the expreſs conſent of both parties: but after much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between them, they could come to no agreement; nor was the controverſie ſetled till many years after.</p>

But the moſt remarkable thing in this Abbots time, is the pains he took in the regulation of Divine Service in this Monaſtery: about which he made many <hi>Ordinances,</hi> with the conſent of all the Convent: and drew up a <hi>Guſtomary,</hi> out of the ancient uſages of the Church, for all the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days from the Octaves of <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> to the firſt Sunday in <hi>Advent.</hi> All which are yet extant, in his Grace's, the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi>'s Library at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in two Volumes: One written by <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Yarwell,</hi> as he tells us in ſix verſes at the beginning of the Book: the other by <hi>John Trentam;</hi> who concludes it with the like verſes. By this Cuſtomary they were directed how to ſing their Offices, longer or ſhorter, every day: as is expreſſed in the laſt Rubrick of it. Before theſe Books is prefixed the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Kalendar</hi> (which I have had occaſion frequently to name) at the ſide of which, are ſet down thoſe Feſtivals, or Anniverſaries which were peculiar to this Church and their neighbour; as follows.</p>

               <p>There is once mention made, the Reader may obſerve, in this Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, of celebrating <hi>cum Cappis,</hi> or <hi>Capis;</hi> that is in Copes: which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very much to the ſolemnity. As appears by what I find in a <hi>MS.</hi> Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> written by <hi>John Fleet</hi> a Monk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Who tells us that <hi>Radulphus Papilyon</hi> who was made Abbot 1201. obtained the conſent of the Chapter, for the celebrating the Feaſts of four Saints, whom he much loved, <hi>in Capis,</hi> viz. St. <hi>Laurence, Vincent, Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> and <hi>Tranſlatio Sancti Benedicti.</hi> And he ſets down the Charter wherein this was granted, at his inſtance, for the keeping theſe Feaſts, <hi>in Capis, proceſſionibus, cum vinis &amp; pitanciis honorabilibus.</hi> That is, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were obſerved only with Ale, and a ſimple pitance; but after this with Wine, and more honourable allowances; as the Charter it ſelf explains it. <hi>Richard of Berking</hi> afterward ordained that on three days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>tranſlation of King Edward,</hi> Maſs ſhould be ſaid ſtill in <hi>Capis:</hi> for the greater honour of that Saint. And <hi>Richard de Crokeſly</hi> ordained out of reverence to the bleſſed Virgin, that the <hi>Annunciation</hi> ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at her nativity, <hi>in quinque Capis.</hi> And thus, I obſerved before, it was in this Church of <hi>Burgh:</hi> where <hi>Rob. Lyndeſay</hi> ordained, the Feaſts of our Lords Transfiguration; the Tranſlation of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the birth of St. <hi>Hugh</hi> to be celebrated in <hi>Copes.</hi> Much more, if it were proper in this place, I could add to this purpoſe. But I haſten to explain the meaning of the <hi>Convention</hi> or agreement between this Church, and that of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> which was to be read the firſt week in <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already obſerved that Friendſhip was wont to be contracted, between ſome Churches with others; as <hi>John de Kaleto</hi> I ſhowed made <hi>confederationem inter Eccleſiam Burgi &amp; Wigorn.</hi> the particulars of which are ſet down, in the Charter yet remaining <hi>Fol.</hi> CLXXV. Such was this with the Church of St. <hi>Victor;</hi> which I find expreſly mentioned afterward,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61653:171"/>
Fol. CCLXXIV. where an account is given of the Churches with whom this Church had made Confederations, and what they were. At the bottom of which Page, there are theſe words; <hi>Eadem Conventio facta eſt item inter nos &amp; Canonicos de Sancto Victore,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the ſame that was between this Church and the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Gisburn:</hi> which was this: That in the firſt Week of <hi>Lent,</hi> there ſhould be an Office performed in the Church of <hi>Burgh,</hi> for all the Brethren of <hi>Gisburn,</hi> who were dead. And on the morrow a Maſs in the Convent; every Prieſt celebrating one Maſs, and the reſt, who were in inferior Order, ſinging 50. Pſalms. The like to be done at <hi>Gisburn</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Burgh: Et Cibus ea die ponatur ad menſam;</hi> though it was the beginning of <hi>Lent.</hi> The ſame was done for thoſe of St. <hi>Victor</hi> on the firſt vacant day, in the firſt week of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbey of St. <hi>Victor de Caleto</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> had ſeveral Mannors in <hi>England,</hi> with great Liberties, confirmed by the Charter of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. as I find in the <hi>Monaſticon.</hi> Vol. 2. P. 1002. A Relique of this St. <hi>Victor</hi> I find alſo given to the Church of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Radulphus de Diceto</hi> Dean of that Church: who inriched it with many others alſo; particularly of St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> King and Martyr, vid. 3. Vol. p. 332.</p>
               <p>It would be too long here to name all the other Churches, with whom this of <hi>Burgh</hi> made the like <hi>Confederations:</hi> which ſhall be put in the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix: having this further to note; that it appears by the forenamed <hi>Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,</hi> a piece of the Croſs was preſented to them all to kiſs, in Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week; and that there being <hi>Sixty four</hi> Monks in this <hi>Richard Aſhton</hi>'s time, there hapned ſo great a mortality among them, that <hi>thirty two</hi> or more, of the beſt Monks in the Monaſtery died. So that Divine Service could not be performed according to the Statutes then made: but they were forced to omit ſome things, which in thoſe Books were appointed.</p>

               <p>It appears by a Record at the end of thoſe <hi>Lambeth</hi> Books, that in the year 1483. <hi>John Ruſſel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſummoned the Convent to come and attend him at <hi>Bugden,</hi> in his Viſitation <hi>adhuc pendente:</hi> and there gave them Injunctions about their behaviour, one towards another, and towards the Abbot <hi>William.</hi> Who was ſtill ſubject to the Epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, notwithſtanding his Mitre; as all his Predeceſſors had been. For there had been anciently a Decree in a Synod held near <hi>Cloveſhom,</hi> in the year 747. (and that in obedience to the Letters of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> which were publickly read in the Aſſembly, for the reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) that the Biſhops ſhould viſit their Dioceſes every year, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh both Abbots and Monks to live regularly; as <hi>William of Malmsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> informs us. In purſuance of which this Monaſtery had been often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, and Injunctions given to them: as I could eaſily ſhow, had I room for ſuch Diſcourſes. I ſhall content my ſelf only with the account I find in our Books, of the Viſitation of that famous Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln, Robert Groſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:</hi> who viſited <hi>tam domus Religioſas, quam Eccleſias Parochiales.</hi> And among others required the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Burgh,</hi> to ſhow what Right they had to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Stamford;</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> there upon the Bridge; and the Houſe of the <hi>Lepers:</hi> to all which they pretended. And they making it appear, that they were Patrons of them, and that their Conſent was requiſite to the choice of a Prioreſs of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and that they were in the quiet poſſeſſion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>Cuſtodes</hi> to hear the Confeſſion of the Nuns in that place (a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation being made of them to the Biſhop) and of placing <hi>Cuſtodes</hi> alſo
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61653:171"/>
in the <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> and in the Houſe of <hi>Lepers;</hi> and that the Nuns in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and the Friers in the Hoſpital, and in the Houſe of the Lepers, were not received but by conſent of the Abbot, who had right to enter into the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and to make <hi>Moniales profeſſas</hi> (which Poſſeſſion he ſhowed he had time out of mind, by Witneſſes, and by Letters of <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who had alſo here viſited, and by Letters of the Nuns themſelves) thereupon the forenamed <hi>Robert Groſtehead,</hi> having ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by him for his aſſiſtance, his Official <hi>R. de Cadencia,</hi> and many other perſons, pronounced that the Abbot (who was there preſent) was in the quiet poſſeſſion of all the aforeſaid, <hi>ſalvo jure uniuſcujuſque.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The contention about the Fenn <hi>de Alderlond</hi> was renewed in the ſame year 1483. between <hi>Richard</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and <hi>William Ramſey</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Burgh;</hi> which had hung long, as the Continuation of <hi>Croyland</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory obſerves, <note n="*" place="margin">Page 569.</note> but was comprimiſed by <hi>Thomas Rotheram,</hi> formerly Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and Ordinary of the Place, now Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi> Yet it was not finally determined and ſettled till two or three years after; when, both parties ſubmitting themſelves to the Archbiſhop, he Decreed, under the penalty of a thouſand pound, that the Abbot and Convent of <hi>Croyland,</hi> ſhould pay an annual Penſion of ten pound a year to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Burgh:</hi> until they had at their own charge purchaſed Land of that yearly value to be delivered in perpetual poſſeſſion to the Monaſtery of <hi>Burgh;</hi> or had at their own like expence appropriated and united to the ſaid Monaſtery of <hi>Burgh</hi> the Church of <hi>Brynkehurſt,</hi> or <hi>Eſton</hi> in the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> which belonged to the Patronage of the ſaid Monaſtery. Whereupon <hi>Edmond Thorp</hi> then Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> choſe to do the latter: and accordingly the Church of <hi>Brynkehurſt</hi> was appropriated for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſes of the Monaſtery of <hi>Burgh;</hi> and Letters Patents from the King were obtained for Licence to do it <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 577.</note>.</p>
               <p>And by another Continuation of the ſame Hiſtory it appears that <hi>John Ruſſel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> before mentioned, came to <hi>Croyland,</hi> and ſtaid there a whole Month, with twenty other perſons (for whom as well as himſelf he gave them ſuch ſatisfaction, as contented both Parties) in which time, after conference with the Abbot of <hi>Burgh</hi> at <hi>Singleſholt,</hi> the Union and Appropriation, was made judicially by the Epiſcopal Sentence, which is there at large ſet down <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 582. and 587.</note>: with all other proceedings in that Buſineſs. The broad Seal alſo was procured for the confirmation of it: which was to put an end to all Controverſies, whereby both Abbeys had received much damage; as the Reader may find <hi>p.</hi> 588, 589, 593. to which I muſt referr him.</p>
               <p>It was in this Abbot's days alſo that <hi>John Wysbeck</hi> Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> by his induſtry, and gentle management; procured an exchange of that 4. Stone of Wax which was yearly paid by them to the Church of <hi>Burgh</hi> on St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, in the nature of a <hi>Service,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Homage</hi> (as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuator of that Hiſtory ſpeakes p. 560) into a yearly Penſion of twenty ſhillings in money, that more ſincere Love might be preſerved between the Brethren of each Monaſtery for the future. This was in the year 1477.</p>

               <p>The Contention which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> mentions, between him and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> makes me think he was the Abbot who Petitioned the King againſt certain of the Towns-men, who ſeditiouſly oppoſed his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and his appointment of Officers there. Which Petition was among our Records concerning the Mannor of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> (as I find in a

               <p>There is this traditional ſtory goes, concerning the preſervation of this Church at the diſſolution of Abbeys; that a little after Queen <hi>Katherine</hi>'s Interment here (which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> mentions) ſome Courtiers ſuggeſting to the King, how well it would become his Greatneſs, to erect a fair Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her; he anſwered, Yes, he would leave her one of the goodlieſt Monuments in Chriſtendom; meaning this Church, for he had then in his thoughts the demoliſhing of Abbeys, which ſhortly after followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Chambers</hi> alſo preſerved himſelf in favour, by making a Reſignation of his Abbey, as many did, under the common Seal, into the Kings hands. Which though I cannot find in <hi>the Augmentation Office,</hi> yet there is a Grant there made by King <hi>Henry</hi> to Abbot <hi>Chambers,</hi> which confirms me in this opinion. It bears date 1 <hi>March, An.</hi> 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. which was 1540. (before the Biſhoprick was erected) by which it is expreſſed, that the Monaſtery of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> being diſſolved, the King out of his Grace and Favour did grant to the ſaid late Abbot <hi>Chambers Two hundred and ſixty pound, thirteen ſhillings and four pence per annum,</hi> during his life: with an hundred Load of Wood, out of the Woods called, <hi>Eaſtwood,</hi> and <hi>Weſtwood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were Letters (which are now loſt) ſent from the Duke of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> and others of the Council 1548. to examine the matter in Controverſie between the Biſhop of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> and one <hi>Acton;</hi> concerning words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſpoken againſt the Sacrament; and concerning Images in the Church undefaced, with Plate ſold out of the Town-Church. How it ended I cannot find: nor have I any thing to add about <hi>David Pool,</hi> who was made Biſhop in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>Of Biſhop <hi>SCAMBLER</hi> I might ſay much more than is in Mr. <hi>G.</hi> but have not room for it. For before thoſe Articles mentioned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> there were <hi>Injunctions</hi> or <hi>Ordinations</hi> given to the Dean and Chapter by <hi>Thomas Yale</hi> Dr. of Law, and <hi>Edward Leeds</hi> Licentiate, and <hi>John Porey,</hi> Dr. in Divinity, being Viſitors and Commiſſaries authorized by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to exerciſe his Metropolitical Viſitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were in number, <hi>Nine, publicatae &amp; traditae octavo die Januarii</hi> 1560. <hi>in domo Capitulari Eccleſiae Cathedralis Petriburg.</hi> The <hi>Injunctions</hi> alſo, and <hi>Articles</hi> of Inquiry in ſeveral Triennial Viſitations of Biſhop <hi>Scambler</hi> are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the years 1561, 1564, 1567. (in which year I find 21 <hi>Injunctions</hi> of his to the Dean and Chapter and other Miniſters) and 1570.</p>
               <p>In the next Viſitation 1573. he delivered no Articles to be enquired of, nor more Injunctions, but only commanded them to keep their Statutes, which were not againſt the Queens Majeſty's Proceedings, nor her Viſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the laſt of theſe Viſitations but one, it was that the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles were taken down in the Ladies Chappel, which was not done till the 12. of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How this Biſhop paſſed away the Lands of the Biſhoprick, wherewith King <hi>Henry</hi> had indowed it, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> hath related in part.

And this conſideration of that our Preacher, cannot but worthily condemn the Apologiſts of partial prejudice, who choſe rather to be informed concerning that Sermon, by (as they confeſs) a reproachful traducer and libeller, than (which they might eaſily have done) by teſtimony of a thouſand temperate and indifferent hearers, then preſent.</hi>

               <hi>A Short and True</hi> NARRATIVE <hi>of the Rifling and Defacing the Cathedral Church of</hi> PETERBURGH <hi>in the Year</hi> 1643.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Cathedral Church of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> was very famous formerly for three remarkable things; a ſtately Front, a curious Altar-Piece, and a beautiful Cloiſter. The firſt of the three doth ſtill remain, a very goodly Structure, ſupported with three ſuch tall Arches, as <hi>England</hi> can ſcarce ſhow the like. The two laſt are ſince deſtroy'd by Sacrilegious hands, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remaining, but only the bare memory of them. In this place, I think I may ſay, began that ſtrange kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Reformation, which afterward paſſed over moſt places of the Land, by robbing, rifling and defacing Churches. This being one of the firſt which ſuffered in that kind. Of which you may take this following account, from an eye witneſs, and which, I ſuppoſe, is ſtill freſh in the memory of many ſurviving Perſons.</p>
            <p>In the year 1643, about the midſt of <hi>April,</hi> there came ſeveral Forces to <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> raiſed by the Parliament in the Aſſociated Counties, in order to beſiege <hi>Croyland,</hi> a ſmall Town ſome ſeven miles diſtant, which had a little before declared for the King, and then was held a Garriſon for Him.</p>
            <p>The firſt that came was a Foot-Regiment under one Colonel <hi>Hubbart</hi>'s command: upon whoſe arrival, ſome perſons of the Town, fearing what happen'd afterward, deſire the Chief Commander to take care the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did no injury to the Church: This he promiſes to do, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have the Church doors all lockt up. Some two days after comes a Regiment of Horſe under Colonel <hi>Cromwel,</hi> a name as fatal to Miniſters, as it had been to Monaſteries before. The next day after their arrival, early in the morning, theſe break open the Church doors, pull down the Organs, of which there were two Pair. The greater Pair that ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a high loft, over the entrance into the Quire, was thence thrown down upon the ground, and there ſtamped and trampled on, and broke in pieces, with ſuch a ſtrange furious and frantick zeal, as can't be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but by thoſe that ſaw it.</p>
            <p>Then the Souldiers enter the Quire, and there their firſt buſineſs was, to tear in pieces all the Common-Prayer Books that could be found. The great Bible indeed, that lay upon a Braſs Eagle for reading the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61653:174"/>
Leſſons, had the good hap to eſcape with the loſs only of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</p>
            <p>Next they break down all the Seats, Stalls and Wainſcot that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, being adorn'd with ſeveral Hiſtorical paſſages out of the Old and New Teſtament, a Latin Diſtich being in each Seat to declare the Story. Whilſt they are thus employed, they chance to find a Great Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Book behind the Cieling with ſome 20 pieces of Gold, laid there by a perſon a little before, as in a place of ſafety, in thoſe unſafe and dangerous times. This encourages the Souldiers in their work, and makes them the more eager in breaking down all the reſt of the Wainſcot, in hopes of finding ſuch another prize.</p>
            <p>The Book that was depoſited there, was called <hi>Swapham,</hi> the Lieger Book of the Church, and was redeemed afterward of a Souldier that got it, by a perſon belonging to the Minſter, for ten Shillings, under the notion of an old Latin Bible.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a great Braſs Candleſtick hanging in the middle of the Quire, containing about a Dozen and half of Lights, with another Bow Candleſtick about the Braſs Eagle: Theſe both were broke in pieces, and moſt of the Braſs carried away and ſold.</p>
            <p>A well diſpoſed perſon ſtanding by, and ſeeing the Souldiers make ſuch ſpoil and havock, ſpeaks to one that appeared like an Officer, deſiring him to reſtrain the Souldiers from ſuch enormities. But all the anſwer he obtained, was only a ſcoffing reply, to this purpoſe, <hi>See how theſe poor People are concern'd to ſee their Idols pulled down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Inhabitants of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> at that time, were accounted by theſe Reformers, both a malignant and ſuperſtitious kind of People.</p>
            <p>When they had thus defaced and ſpoiled the Quire, They march up next to the Eaſt end of the Church, and there break and cut in pieces, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward burn the Rails that were about the Communion Table. The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſelf was thrown down, the Table-Cloth taken away with two fair Books in Velvet Covers, the one a Bible, the other a Common-Prayer Book, with a Silver Baſon gilt, and a Pair of Silver Candleſticks beſide. But upon requeſt made to Colonel <hi>Hubbert,</hi> the Books, Baſon and all elſe, ſave the Candleſticks, were reſtored again.</p>
            <p>Not long after on the <hi>13th</hi> day of <hi>July</hi> 1643 Captain <hi>Barton</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hope</hi> two Martial Miniſters of <hi>Nottingham</hi> or <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> coming to <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> break open the Veſtery and take away a Fair Crimſon Satten Table Cloth and ſeveral other things, that had eſcaped the former Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hands.</p>
            <p>Now behind the Communion Table, there ſtood a curious Piece of Stone-work, admired much by Strangers and Travellers; a ſtately Skreen it was, well wrought, painted and gilt, which roſe up as high almoſt as the Roof of the Church in a Row of three lofty Spires, with other leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Spires, growing out of each of them, as it is repreſented in the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed draught. This now had no Imagery-work upon it, or any thing elſe that might juſtly give offence, and yet becauſe it bore the name of the High Altar, was pulled all down with Ropes, lay'd low and level with the ground.</p>
            <p>Over this place in the Roof of the Church, in a large Oval yet to be ſeen, was the Picture of our Saviour ſeated on a Throne, one hand erected, and holding a Globe in the other: attended with the four Evangeliſts and Saints on each ſide, with Crowns in their hands; intended, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for a Repreſentation of our Saviours coming to judgment. Some of the company eſpying this, cry out and ſay, Lo this is the God theſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61653:174"/>
People bow and cringe unto; This is the Idol they worſhip and adore. Hereupon ſeveral Souldiers charge their Muskets, (amongſt whom one <hi>Daniel Wood</hi> of Captain <hi>Ropers</hi> Company was the chief) and diſcharge them at it: and by the many ſhots they made, at length do quite deface and ſpoil Picture.</p>
            <p>The odiouſneſs of this Act gave occaſion (I ſuppoſe) to a common Fame very rife at that time, and whence <hi>Mercurius Ruſticus</hi> might have his relation, <hi>viz.</hi> That divine Vengeance had ſignally ſeiſed on ſome of the principal Actors, That one was ſtruck blind upon the place by a Re-bound of his Bullet; That another dyed mad a little after; neither of which I can certainly atteſt. For, though I have made it my buſineſs to enquire of this, I could never find any other judgment befal them then, but that of a mad blind Zeal, wherewith theſe perſons were certainly poſſeſt.</p>
            <p>And now I am engaged in telling the ſtory of their impiety and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> 'twill be no great excurſion to ſtep out to <hi>Yaxley</hi> a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Town, and mention one thing done there. Which was This: on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1643. ſome of Captain <hi>Beaumont</hi>'s Souldiers coming thither, They break open the Church doors, piſs in the Font, and then baptize a Horſe and a Mare, uſing the ſolemn words of Baptiſm, and ſigning them with the ſign of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>But to return to our reforming Rabble at <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> when there was no more painted or carved work to demoliſh, Then they rob and rifle the Tombs, and violate the Monuments of the dead. And where ſhould they firſt begin, but with thoſe of the two Queens, who had been there interr'd: The one on the North ſide, the other on the South ſide of the Church, both near unto the Altar. Firſt, then they demoliſh Queen <hi>Katherin</hi>'s Tomb, <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth his repudiated Wife: They break down the Rails that encloſed the place, and take away the black Velvet Pall which covered the Herſe: overthrow the Herſe it ſelf, diſplace the Graveſtone that lay over her Body, and have left nothing now remaining of that Tomb, but only a Monument of their own ſhame and villany. The like they had certainly done to the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> but that her Herſe and Pall were removed with her Body to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, when He came to the Crown. But what did remain, they ſerved in like manner, that is, her Royal Arms and Eſcutcheons which hung upon a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar near the place where ſhe had been interr'd, were moſt rudely pulled down, defaced and torn.</p>
            <p>In the North Iſle of the Church, there was a ſtately Tomb in memory of Biſhop <hi>Dove,</hi> who had been 30 years Biſhop of the place. He lay there in Portraicture in his Epiſcopal Robes, on a large Bed under a fair Table of black Marble, with a Library of Books about him. Theſe men that were ſuch Enemies to the name and Office of a Biſhop, and much more to his Perſon, hack and hew the poor Innocent Statue in pieces, and ſoon deſtroy'd all the Tomb. So that in a ſhort ſpace, all that fair and curious Monument was buried in its own rubbiſh and Ruines.</p>
            <p>The like they do to two other Monuments ſtanding in that Iſle; the one the Tomb of Mr. <hi>Worm,</hi> the other of Dr. <hi>Angier,</hi> who had been Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of that Church.</p>
            <p>In a Place then called the new Building, and ſince converted to a Library, there was a fair Monument, which Sir <hi>Humphrey Orm</hi> (to ſave his Heir that charge and trouble) thought fit to erect in his own life time, where he and his Lady, his Son and Wife and all their children were lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Statues, under which were certain Engliſh verſes written, mention'd before in this Book.

                     <hi>This is an Altar not a Grave,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which two words <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> 'tis ſaid, did ſo provoke and kindle the Zealots indignation, that they reſolve to make the Tomb it ſelf a Sacrifice: and with Axes, Poleaxes and Hammers deſtroy and break down all that curious Monument, ſave only two Pilaſters ſtill remaining, which ſhew and teſtifie the elegancy of the reſt of the Work. Thus it hapned, that the good old Knight who was a conſtant frequenter of Gods publick Service, three times a day, outlived his own Monument, and lived to ſee himſelf carried <hi>in Effigie</hi> on a Souldiers back, to the publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, there to be ſported withall, a Crew of Souldiers going before in Proceſſion, ſome with Surplices, ſome with Organ Pipes, to make up the ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>When they had thus demoliſhed the chief Monuments, at length the very Graveſtones and Marbles on the Floor did not eſcape their Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hands. For where there was any thing on them of Sculptures or Inſcriptions in Braſs, Theſe they force and tear off. So that whereas there were many fair pieces of this kind before, as that of Abbot <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> whoſe large Marble Graveſtone was plated over with Braſs, and ſeveral others the like, there is not any ſuch now, in all the Church, to be ſeen; though moſt of the Inſcriptions that were upon them, are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Book.</p>
            <p>One thing indeed I muſt needs clear the Souldiers of, which <hi>Mercurius Ruſticus</hi> upon miſinformation charges them with, <hi>viz.</hi> That they took away the Bell-Clappers and ſold them, with the Braſs they plucked off from the Tombs. The miſtake was this: The neighbourhood being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſturbed with the Souldiers jangling and ringing the Bells au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as though there had been a ſcare-fire, (though there was no other, but what they themſelves had made) ſome of the Inhabitants by night took away the Clappers, and hid them in the Roof of the Church, on purpoſe only to free their ears from that confuſed noiſe; which gave occaſion to ſuch as did not know it, to think the Souldiers had ſtolen them away.</p>
            <p>Having thus done their work on the Floor below, they are now at leiſure to look up to the Windows above, which would have entertained any perſons elſe, with great delight and ſatisfaction, but only ſuch Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots as theſe, whoſe eyes were ſo dazled, that they thought they ſaw Popery in every Picture and piece of painted Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Now the Windows of this Church were very fair, and had much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of workmanſhip in them, being adorned and beautified with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtorical paſſages out of Scripture and Eccleſiaſtical ſtory; ſuch were thoſe in the Body of the Church in the Iſles, in the new Building and elſewhere.</p>
            <p>But the Cloiſter Windows were moſt famed of all, for their great Art and pleaſing variety. <hi>One</hi> ſide of the Quadrangle containing the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament; <hi>another,</hi> that of the New; a <hi>Third</hi> the Founding and Founders of the Church; a <hi>Fourth,</hi> all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the firſt <hi>Saxon</hi> King. All which notwithſtanding were moſt ſhamefully broken and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:61653:175"/>
And amongſt other things thus demoliſht in the Windows, there was one thing Fame had made very remarkable, and that was the ſtory of the Paſchal Pickeril. The thing was this; Our Saviour was repreſented in two places, in the Cloyſter and in the great Weſtern Window, ſitting at his laſt Supper with his twelve Apoſtles; In one place there was a ſingle Fiſh, in the other three Fiſhes in a Diſh, ſet before him. This occaſion'd that diſcourſe and common Talk, I remember, I have often heard, of the <hi>Paſchal Pickeril</hi> at <hi>Peterburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what ſhould be the meaning of this conceit, is left to every one to conjecture. The Account that I have had from ſome was this, That it was the device of ſome devout and ignorant Artiſt, from a Notion he had of the time this laſt Supper muſt needs be in, that is of <hi>Lent,</hi> and that our Saviour himſelf was a ſtrict obſerver of <hi>Lent,</hi> and eat no Fleſh all that ſeaſon: and therefore He took liberty, to ſubſtitute a Fiſh inſtead of the Paſchal Lamb.</p>
            <p>Whatever it was, the matter of Fact was certain: and that particular piece of Glaſs wherein the Three Fiſhes are portray'd happend to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the great Devaſtation, and was committed to my truſt by the Author of the foregoing Hiſtory, from whom I had this Relation, and is yet to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; notwithſtanding all the Art and curioſity of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip theſe Windows did afford, yet nothing of all this could oblige the Reforming Rabble, but they deface and break them all in pieces, in the Church and in the Cloyſter, and left nothing undemoliſht, where either any Picture or Painted Glaſs did appear; excepting only part of the great Weſt window in the Body of the Church, which ſtill remains entire, being too high for them, and out of their reach. Yea to encourage them the more in this Trade of breaking and battering Windows down, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> himſelf (as 'twas reported) eſpying a little Crucifix in a Window aloft, which none perhaps before had ſcarce obſerved, gets a Ladder, and breaks it down zealouſly with his own hand.</p>
            <p>But before I conclude the Narrative, I muſt not forget to tell, how they likewiſe broke open the Chapterhouſe, ranſack'd the Records, broke the Seals, tore the Writings in pieces, ſpecially ſuch as had great Seals annexed unto them, which they took or miſtook rather for the Popes Bulls. So that a grave and ſober Perſon coming into the Room at that time, finds the Floor all ſtrewed and covered over, with torn Papers, Parchments and broken Seals; and being aſtoniſht at this ſight, does thus expoſtulate with them; Gentlemen (ſays He) what are ye doing? They anſwer, We are pulling and tearing the Popes Bulls in pieces. He replies, ye are much miſtaken: for theſe Writings are neither the Popes Bulls, nor any thing relating to him. But they are the Evidences of ſeveral mens Eſtates, and in deſtroying theſe, you will deſtroy and undo many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with this they were ſomething perſwaded, and prevailed upon by the ſame perſon, to permit him to carry away all that were left undefaced, by which means, the writings the Church hath now, came to be preſerved.</p>
            <p>Such was the Souldiers carriage and behaviour all the time during their ſtay at <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> which was about a Fortnights ſpace: They went to Church duly, but it was only to do miſchief, To break and batter the Windows and any Carved work that was yet remaining, or to pull down Croſſes whereſoever they could find them: which the firſt Founders did not ſet up with ſo much zeal, as theſe laſt Confounders pulled them down.</p>
            <p>Thus in a ſhort time, a fair and goodly Structure was quite ſtript of all its ornamental Beauty and made a ruthful Spectacle, a very Chaos of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61653:176"/>
Deſolation and Confuſion, nothing ſcarce remaining but only bare walls, broken Seats, and ſhatter'd Windows on every ſide.</p>
            <p>And in the time of this publick Confuſion, two other things hapned not unworthy of relating. The one for the ſtrangeneſs, the other for the ſadneſs of the Accident.</p>
            <p>The firſt was this; when now the Church doors lay open to all comers, without locks and bars, and none to look after them, thoſe ſpecially that lead up to the Leads above.</p>
            <p>Two young Children not above five years old, had got up the Steeple by themſelves, and having loſt their way down, come to the place where the great Bells hang. Here there was a large round ſpace left purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Arch, when firſt built, for the drawing up Bells or any other things, as there ſhould be occaſion. This place uſed to be ſafely cloſed before, but now it lay wide open, and was between thirty and forty yards off from the ground. The two children coming hither and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this paſſage, One, out of his childiſh ſimplicity was for jumping down: No, (ſaies the other) let us rather ſwarm down, there being a Bell rope then hanging down through that place to the Clockhouſe below. Now this laſt they did; And a Gentlemen walking there beneath at that time, ſees two children come with that ſwiftneſs down the Rope, like Arrows from a Bow, who were both taken up for dead, on the place. This hapned on a Sunday ith' afternoon, in Sermon time. The news com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Pariſh-Church, that two children falling off from the Minſter were ſlain, The Congregration was exceedingly diſorder'd, ſo that the Preacher could not go on for a time, every Parent fearing it might be their own childrens caſe; till at length they underſtood the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all. For it pleaſed God by a ſtrange and wonderful providence to preſerve both theſe children, having no hurt but only their Hands galled by the Rope, and their Feet a little ſtunted by the fall from the Clock-houſe, where they were thrown off, the Rope being faſtned there, and this ſome four or five yards high. The Perſons, I ſuppoſe, are both living ſtill; and one of them, (whoſe Father was then one of the chief Tradeſmen of the Town) ſince a grave Miniſter, and Rector of a Pariſh in <hi>Northamptonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other thing that hapned of more fatal conſequence was this. It being that time of the year, when young Lads are buſie in rifling Jack-Daws Neſts to get their young, a Scholar of the Free-School, ſon to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Officer, was got upon the Top of the Minſter about this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who going along the Cieling in the Body of the Church, and treading unwarily on ſome rotten Boards, fell down from thence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Loft where the Organ now ſtands, having his Pockets filled with thoſe inauſpicious Birds, and with the Fall from ſo great a height, was ſlain outright and never ſtirred more.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things hapened much about the ſame time, &amp; in the time of that publick Confuſion and Diſorder. But to proceed in our intended Narrative.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have related before, were indeed the Acts of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons only, men of wild intemperate zeal, and who had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for what they did, but what was owing to the Swords by their ſides. Yet notwithſtanding all theſe things ſeemed afterward to be own'd and approved by the Powers then in being, when they ſold all the Churches Lands, and many fair Buildings adjoyning to the Minſter, were likewiſe pulled down and ſold by publick Order and Authority, ſuch were the Cloyſters, the old Chapterhouſe, the Library, the Biſhops Hall and Chapel at the end of it: The Hall was as fair a Room as moſt in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:61653:176"/>
and another call'd the <hi>Green-Chamber,</hi> not much inferior to it. Theſe all were then pull'd down and deſtroyed; and the materials, Lead, Timber and Stone expoſed to Sale, for any that would buy them. But ſome of the Bargains proved not very proſperous; The Lead eſpecially that came off the Palace was as fatal as the Gold of <hi>Tholouſe:</hi> for to my knowledge, The Merchant that bought it, loſt it all, and the Ship which carried it, in her Voyage to <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Church continued ruined and deſolate and without all divine Offices for a time: till at length by the favour of a great Perſon in the Neighbourhood, it was repaired and reſtored to ſome degrees of decency again; and out of the aſhes of a late Cathedral, grew up into a new Parochial Church, in which way it was employ'd and uſed ever after, untill the Kings happy Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Oliver St. John</hi> Chief Juſtice then of the Common Pleas, being ſent on an Embaſſy into <hi>Holland</hi> by the Powers that govern'd then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted this Boon of them at his Return, that they would give him the ruin'd Church or Minſter at <hi>Peterburgh;</hi> this they did accordingly, and he gave it to the Town of <hi>Peterburgh</hi> for their uſe, to be employ'd as a Parochial Church, their own Pariſh-Church being then very ruinous and gone to decay.</p>
            <p>Now the the Town conſidering the largeneſs of the Building, and the greatneſs to the charge to repair it, which of themſelves they were not able to defray, they all agree, to pull down the <hi>Ladies Chapel,</hi> as it was then called, an additional Building to the North ſide of the Minſter, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ruinous and ready to fall) and to expoſe the materials thereof, Lead, Timber and Stone to Sale, and to convert the mony that was made of them, towards the Repairs of the great Fabrick.</p>
            <p>All this they did, and appointed certain perſons to overſee the Work, and expended ſeveral ſumms thus in Repairs, mending the Leads, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Roof, Glazing ſeveral Windows, and then fitting up the Quire, and making it pretty decent, for the Congregation to meet in. And this they did, by taking the Painted Boards that came off from the Roof of the Ladies Chapel, and placing them all along at the back of the Quire in ſuch manner, as they continue to this day.</p>
            <p>When the Place was thus fitted up, and the Devaſtations which the Souldiers had made, in ſome meaſure repaired, one Mr. <hi>Samuel Wilſon</hi> School Maſter of the Charter-houſe in <hi>London,</hi> was ſent down by the Committee of Plundred Miniſters, as they were then called, to be Preacher, with a Sallary of 160 <hi>l. per an.</hi> in which employment he continued untill the Kings Return.</p>
            <p>Then Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> the antient Dean of the Church, after almoſt 20 years Exile in <hi>France,</hi> return'd and re-aſſumed his Right again, in the year 1660 about the end of <hi>July.</hi> He then after ſo long an Interval renew'd the antient uſage, and read divine Service firſt himſelf, and cauſed it to be read every day afterward, according to the old Laudable uſe and Cuſtome, and ſetled the Church and Quire in that order wherein it now continues.</p>
            <p>But though the Church was thus delivered from publick Robbers and Spoilers, yet it was not ſafe from the injuries of private hands. For ſome ten or twelve years after, certain Thieves in the dead of the Night, broke into the Church and ſtole away all the Plate they could find, <hi>viz.</hi> a fair Silver Baſon gilt, and the Virgers two Silver Rods, and a Linnen Table-Cloth to wrap them in, which were never heard of to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:61653:177"/>
This was the ſame Baſon that had been plunder'd by the Souldiers, and recovered again, but irrecoverably loſt now. Yet both theſe loſſes were ſoon repaired, one by Dr. <hi>Henſhaw</hi> Biſhop then of the Place, who gave a fair new Silver Baſon gilt: the other made up by Dr. <hi>Duport</hi> then Dean; who furniſht the Virgers again with the Enſigns of their Office, by buying two new Silver Maces, for the Churches uſe.</p>
            <p>And thus is this Hiſtory brought down at length within our own knowledge and remembrance; where we have ſeen what various fortunes this Antient Church has had, which now reckons at leaſt 1000 years from its firſt Foundation. It has been often ruinated and as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified. Once it was deſtroyed by <hi>Danes,</hi> twice conſumed by Fire; It eſcaped the general downfal of Abbies in <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth's time, though not without the loſs of ſome of her faireſt Mannors; And yet what that King took away in revenues, he added to it in Dignity, by converting it, from an Abbey into a Cathedral Church. But the worſt miſchief that ever befel it, was that in the late Rebellious times, when the Church it ſelf was miſerably defaced and ſpoiled, and all the Lands for the maintenance thereof quite alienated and ſold. And yet through Gods eſpecial goodneſs and favour we have lived to ſee, the one repaired, the others reſtored, and the Church it ſelf recovering her ancient beauty and luſtre again.</p>
            <p>And that it may long thus continue, flouriſh and proſper, and be a Nurſery for vertue, a Seminary for true Religion and Piety, a conſtant Preſerver of Gods publick worſhip and ſervice, and free from all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious hands, is the earneſt and hearty Prayer, wherewith I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Diſcourſe.</p>

Et finitis Pſalmis dicetur Kyrieleſon &amp; dominica oratio, &amp; capitula ab Abbate. Ne reminiſcaris domine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licta noſtra. Fiat miſericordia tua. Dominus vobiſcum. Oremus.

Et haec ſententia teneatur hoc ordine pro illa negligentia de qua frater cui acciderit dubitare non poterit. Si vero levior fuerit culpa neque ſic aperta, ex judicio Abbatis addetur levior ſententia fratri: imprimis avertetur aſperitas judicii quod ante al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare debere ſuſcipi diximus.

Si autem perviderit aliquis bonus circa tantam rem merito ſolicitus ut quolibet alio quam ſupra deſcripto modo poſſit corrigi ſanctius qualis vel quantacunque videatur offenſio tam ſanctiſſime rei, illum melius cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigentem imitari non dedignamur.
