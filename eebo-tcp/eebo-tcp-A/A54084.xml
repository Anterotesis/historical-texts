            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And the Method I ſhall take here, ſhall be <hi>firſt</hi> to ſet down what I find in his later Books, and <hi>then</hi> confront him out of his former; and that the rather, for that in his <hi>Serious Appeal,</hi> (Printed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1692.) p. 21. he ſaith, <q>Let but the Reader ſee my own Words in my Printed Books, and well conſider them, and if he have but a little ſound Judgment, he will eaſily find, I have not contradicted my ſelf in ANY THING.</q> Upon this Iſſue, I am willing to leave it with the <hi>Conſiderate</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> (though perhaps <hi>G.

                  <q>By this Manifeſtation of God in the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> (adds he) our Adverſaries deny that the Goſpel, or any Manifeſtation, that is of a SAVING Nature,</q> is underſtood [to which a little lower, he thus replies] <q>If it were not <hi>Evangelical</hi> and the <hi>very Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, in an inward Miniſtration, it would quite render the Words of the Apoſtle impertinent, and contrary to the purpoſe he treats of: For <hi>Paul</hi> is here ſhewing what the <hi>Goſpel was,</hi> and what was revealed in it, both to the Juſt and the Unjuſt; and becauſe the Unjuſt among all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Nations, had not the Goſpel out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adminiſtred, he ſhews <hi>they had it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> God having ſhewed it unto them, p. 21.</q> Doth this agree with his Aſſerting the Law within made nothing perfect, till the Faith of Chriſt, <hi>the one Offering,</hi> come to be revealed?

               <p>But the foregoing he corroborates by a fourthly thus, <q>This Manifeſtation is ſaid to be that which may be known of God, which he had ſhewed unto them, therefore it is of an <hi>Evangelical</hi> and <hi>Saving</hi> Nature.</q>
                  <hi>—5thly.</hi> 
                  <q>By this Manifeſtation, here mentioned, they did CLEARLY ſee the Inviſible <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> even his ETERNAL POWER and Godhead, p. 22.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>There was a Time (ſaith <hi>G. Keith)</hi> when God dwelt in their [the <hi>Gentiles]</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby they knew him, through what he had made manifeſt of his Eternal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

 in them, p. 24.</q> Was <hi>God known through</hi> the <hi>Eternal Power</hi> made manifeſt in them, and the Holy Ghoſt <hi>not received?</hi> What Confuſion doth he run himſelf into?</p>
               <p>Deſcanting upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. he tells us, <q>By the <hi>things that are made</hi>—may be underſtood thoſe things which are inwardly made, thoſe MARVELLOUS Works of the Lord, which are wrought in Mens Hearts, both of Judgment and Mercy, through the Appearance of God, and the Revelation of his Almighty Arm and Power, in that Heavenly and Divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his own Seed, by which indeed the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Things</hi> of him are <hi>clearly ſeen.</hi> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a Man come to ſee the Lord, in the things that are made of him, in himſelf, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him, in the things that are made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; which gave occaſion to many of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philoſophers, to bid People, <hi>ſeek God within themſelves,</hi> p. 26.</q> Now I query, Are theſe <hi>marvellous Works of Judgment and Mercy</hi> wrought in Mens Hearts, and the Holy Ghoſt <hi>not received?</hi> Or is the Divine Principle of his own Seed <hi>ſeparable</hi> there from? This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to <hi>divide Chriſt.</hi> But a little lower he tells us what <hi>this Seed is</hi>—<q>This Seed and the Birth thereof, by the Springing up of theſe Heavenly Powers and Vertues, can and <hi>doth</hi> truly repreſent the Divine Power and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> being the expreſs Image of God, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </q> Will he, upon ſecond thoughts, divide the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from the <hi>Godhead,</hi> as he muſt do, if Men be allowed to have the <hi>one,</hi> not the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> That the Seed, which truly repreſents
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93417:10"/>
the Divine Power and Godhead, ſhould ſpring up in Men, and they without the Holy Ghoſt in the mean while? Again, By Vertue of <hi>what Covenant</hi> had the <hi>Gentiles</hi> this Priviledge? Of that which <hi>made not the comers thereunto perfect?</hi> Or of that, whereby <hi>Grace and Truth came?</hi> And what was the Effect of this Viſitation to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before Chriſts Incarnation, where embraced would it bring them no further, than the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> to be Sons of <hi>Hagar?</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>To an Objection, <hi>How can the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be either rewarded or puniſhed, ſeeing they have had no Law given them,</hi> he ſaith, <q>The Apoſtle Anſwers, that they had the Law <hi>inwardly,</hi> though not as the <hi>Jews</hi> had it, in an <hi>outward Adminiſtration;</hi> and according to <hi>this Law,</hi> they ſhould be Judged, and Accuſed or Excuſed, according to their evil or well doing—they had that <hi>inwardly made manifeſt</hi> in them, which <hi>God had ſhemed</hi> unto them, whereby they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned who did Evil, and <hi>juſtified</hi> who did Well, p. 28.</q> [And a little lower] <q>It is Evident, that this Inward Principle was the <hi>very Principle of the Goſpel</hi> in them, in that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93417:10"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God will render to every Man according to his Deeds, in the Day when God ſhall Judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel,</hi> i. e. the Goſpel which he Preached.

               <p>
                  <q>Moreover the Apoſtle proceedeth to ſhew how the <hi>Gentile,</hi> who followed not after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, had attained to Righteouſneſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that of FAITH, and yet the <hi>Jews</hi> miſſed of it, p. 36.

               </p>
               <p>In p. 25. <q>He <hi>deſires the Reader to obſerve,</hi> that the Grace held forth, both in this place, and all others aforeſaid, is the very Grace that is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> being the Word of Faith, and the Light which is to be believed in.</q> [And what is Evangelical, is perfecting, I hope: For I read not, that the Goſpel was <hi>weak,</hi> though the Law was.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive</hi> WITH <hi>Man,</hi> he renders IN Man, calling it, <q>The very Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferous Spirit of God himſelf which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, and ALONE hath Power to <hi>ſave</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> him, p. 52. and p. 53.</q>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93417:11"/>
ſaith <hi>G. Keith,</hi> p. 28. Query, Whether it be his Faith now? Who muſt either diſtinguiſh between the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Grace, and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and ſo make them two, which are but one; or elſe retract his ſaying, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had not the Holy Ghoſt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in Chriſt crucified and raiſed again.</p>
               <p>Now I come to his Book of <hi>Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> 1676.</note> &amp;c. Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1668. and Reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an <hi>Appendix, Anno</hi> 1676. which tells us, <q>The Light reveals the <hi>whole</hi> Will of God—he needs not go forth to ſeek a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, the Word is near in his Heart, and in his Mouth; and this is the Word of Faith, to which <hi>Moſes</hi> pointed the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> p. 77.</q> It ſeems then it was <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Word of Faith, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was before Chriſt came in the outward, and <hi>Paul,</hi> who was after his Aſcenſion, pointed to; &amp; the <hi>Work the ſame,</hi> viz. it <hi>revealed the</hi> WHOLE <hi>Will of God:</hi> And ſurely what reveals the whole Will of God, doth it not enable to perform it, according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. and is not that <hi>Saving</hi> and <hi>Perfecting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he Queries, <q>What was this FOUNDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION of the Church of God, before ever the Scripture was writ, before <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp;c? Was it not Jeſus Chriſt the Word, which was in the Beginning? Had it A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NY OTHER Foundation? And what <hi>gave them the Knowledge</hi> of this Foundation, and <hi>builded</hi> them upon it, when they had no Scripture? And whereupon was their Faith founded? By the hearing of what Word did they come by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93417:12"/>
their Faith, ſeeing then the Scripture was not writ? It was even (ſaith <hi>G. Keith)</hi> the Word which came from God himſelf, and taught them immediately, p. 103.</q> I may now Query, Had the Church then a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Were they built upon it, even in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> Days? And was that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Jeſus Chriſt the Word? And did they by hearing it come by Faith in Chriſt, before the Scripture was writ? And yet did they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghoſt? Could not that Law, that Command, that Word make Perfect? Had Men Faith in Chriſt, and could not that Faith ſave <hi>in their Days? Monſtrum horrendum!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 105. He tells us, that <hi>Moſes falls a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring concerning the New Covenant,</hi> Deut. 30. <hi>from</hi> ver. 11, to 16. the Probation whereof he gives in the next Page, both from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And in p. 107. thus hath it, <q>The <hi>Jews</hi> and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who lived in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Time, and were SAVED, it was through Faith in this Word, in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, raiſed up in them, in their Hearts, not at a diſtance, but nigh; <hi>the Word is nigh in thy Heart.</hi> And this is Chriſt in them, the Hope of Glory, the Myſtery hid from Ages and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but was EVER made manifeſt in his Saints, but in the latter Days more clearly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 107, 108.</q> Query, Had Men Faith in Chriſt, the Word? Was the Myſtery <hi>ever</hi> made manifeſt in the Saints; and yet was the Law within in ſufficient to make perfect, till ſince Chriſt was offered up in the outward?</p>
               <p>Having tranſcribed many verſes in 119
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93417:12"/>
                  <hi>Pſalm,</hi> concerning the Word, he queries, p. 109. <hi>What Word this is, whether the Letter of the Scripture, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Keith queries, <hi>Is not her crying,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the ſame with</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>his ſtanding at the Door,</hi> &amp;c. p. 113. And I query, Whether to them that <hi>opened</hi> unto him, even during that Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he did not <hi>come in</hi> and <hi>Sup</hi> with them, for <hi>G. Keith</hi> immediately quotes <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. to adapt it to <hi>Solomons</hi> ſaying? <hi>2dly,</hi> Whether ſuch had the Holy Ghoſt? And <hi>3dly,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law within ſuch made them perfect, in that Age?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. Keith</hi> goes on thus, <q>The Goſpel was Preached unto <hi>Abraham—Abel, Enoch, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and to ALL BELIEVERS, who lived before Scripture was writ in a Book, and it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into their Hearts by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Saints who then lived and were inſpired of God, <hi>preached the Goſpel,</hi> and the Goſpel is the <hi>ſame</hi> in all Generations, for it is the Everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6. But now the Declarations, Diſcoveries, and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of this one Goſpel; have been many and different, under the Law; more darkly in the Time of the Prophets, more manifeſtly in the Time of the Apoſtles. Yet more manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and yet all ONE GOSPEL, and we preach no other, but the ſame Everlaſting Goſpel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</q> See p. 213. Now hence I query, Whether the Goſpel Preached unto <hi>Abraham, Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c? Were the Law within <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c? And whether it made them perfect? <hi>2dly.</hi> Whether theſe Believers, who lived before Scripture was writ in a Book, who had that inſpeaking into their Hearts by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93417:13"/>
the <hi>Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> partook of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs,</hi> of Adoption or Sonſhip; or of the Spirit of Fear and Bondage only? Were they Sons of <hi>Hagar</hi> or <hi>Sarah?</hi> Of <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Second</hi> Covenant? <hi>3dly,</hi> Whether thoſe inſpired Men, who preached the Goſpel, which he allows to be the ſame in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had ALL OF THEM the Doctrinal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith of Chriſt Crucified, and preached it to others? And this I the rather urge, for as much as <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 42. he denies that <hi>Paul</hi> means the <hi>Goſpel is the Power of God,</hi> ſimply and abſtractly conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Doctrine</hi> and doctrinal <hi>Knowledge</hi> and Faith of Chriſt Crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All Saints have the ſame Spirit and Word of Prophecy in ſome meaſure, more or leſs, that the Prophets had, who ever directed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the ſame Spirit and Word in their Hearts, from which they ſpake, that they might in themſelves hear the ſame Word and Spirit, whereby the true Faith comes, p. 221.</q> Is this Spirit and Word ſaving? Is it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>all Ages?</hi> Can a Man hear it and obey it, and yet be without the Holy Ghoſt? But hear him again.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is called the <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> by whoſe quickning Vertue, the Souls of ALL the Holy Men and Women were made and kept alive unto God, as truly <hi>before he came</hi> in the Fleſh, <hi>as after, for they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat,</hi> &amp;c. Which was Chriſt; yea they did eat his Fleſh, and drink his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93417:14"/>
Blood as TRULY &amp; REALLY in meaſure BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE he came in that Body of Fleſh, as the Saints have done ſince, p. 227.</q> To the ſame purpoſe he expreſſeth himſelf in p. 258. and in <hi>Way caſt up,</hi> p. 95. and in <hi>Rector Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> p. 95. This ſhews what he once thought of the Holy Men and Womens Condition in thoſe firſt Ages of the World, who then only placed the difference in Degree not in Kind; now will not allow more then <hi>Gentile</hi> Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Righteouſneſs, where Faith in Chriſt crucified is not revealed, as well as that he concludes all, before Chriſt was viſibly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under ſuch an inward Law, as made not perfect? How he will reconcile ſuch a State to that of <hi>eating his Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his Blood,</hi> let him look to. In the mean while, as he queries <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 184. in his query, 10. <q>Can any Eat the Fleſh of Chriſt and drink his Blood, who have not the Faith of him, as he GAVE his Body of Fleſh to be broken, and his Blood to be ſhed for us?</q> So I query, Could any do thus before it was <hi>given</hi> or <hi>broken?</hi> Or had <hi>all thoſe Holy Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> (he ſpoke of even now) ſo much as the Faith or Knowledge that it ſhould be broken?</p>
               <p>Having offered what Citations I at preſent propoſed out of this Book, the next that comes <note place="margin">

By any thing leſs than God's Holy Spirit? <hi>3dly</hi> That <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> claſſed ſuch an one with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and calls him a Chriſtian. <hi>4thly</hi> That here he boggleth not at the appellation, in this Book, Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1677. Though he doth afterwards, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1694. Saying in <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 46. <hi>If they were real Chriſtians, they had ſome Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt the Meſſiah, as he was to come in the Fleſh.</hi> But now the Man being <hi>altered,</hi> no wonder that his Expreſſions <hi>vary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Saints, before Chriſt came outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fleſh, had not Eat of the Fleſh of Chriſt, and Drank of his Blood, they could not have had Life by him, but they had Life by him, and therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 95. [Chriſt] hath Lived in all Saints, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came in the Fleſh, as to his outward

 Birth, as ſince, p. 100.</q> Did he <hi>Live</hi> in them, and did they Feed on him, even <hi>before</hi> his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Birth, and yet the Law within <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> not make perfect till <hi>after</hi> it?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though the outward coming of the Man Chriſt was deferred, according to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Birth in the Fleſh, for many Ages, yet from the BEGINNING this Heavenly Man, the promiſed Seed, did inwardly come into <note place="margin">☞</note> the Hearts of thoſe that believed in him, and <hi>Bruiſed the Head of the Serpent,</hi> and <hi>deſtroyed</hi> him that had the <hi>Power of Death,</hi> that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the <hi>Stronger Man entering</hi> the Houſe, and <hi>diſpoſſeſſing the ſtrong Man, and Caſting him out,</hi> p. 99.</q> When the Head of the Serpent is bruiſed, the Power of Death (the laſt Enemy) deſtroyed, the Devil Diſpoſſeſſed and caſt out, and the ſtronger enters, Hath not the <hi>perfect</hi> Law, the Law which <hi>doth make</hi> perfect, taken place?</p>
               <p>Again, <q>Thus the Word was made Fleſh, even <hi>from the beginning,</hi> and <hi>dwelt</hi> in us, as in ALL AGES, and they beheld his Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 103.</q> Is this <hi>Indwelling,</hi> where the <hi>Glory is beheld,</hi> without the Holy Ghoſt, or unable to perfect the Work?</p>
               <p>Now I come to his Book Stiled, <hi>Way to the City of God,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1678. where he <note place="margin">

               <p>He tells us, <q>We are not <hi>too nicely</hi> to make a difference betwixt the <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward Sufferings,</hi> but to underſtand them in a <hi>perfect Conjunction,</hi> and that the End of his Sufferings in <hi>both</hi> was this, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93417:16"/>
it ſeems they had the ſame Spirit the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had. How ſhould this be, if the Holy Spirit was Peculiar to the latter Days, to them who believed in Chriſt Crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For that not being done, the benefits Annexed and Apropriated thereto, could not be received. Again, that theſe generally had ſo much as a belief that the <hi>Meſſiah ſhould</hi> come, and ſuffer, and riſe again, is what will ſtick hard upon him to prove, if he dare aſſert it, eſpecially conſidering that the Diſciples, who converſed with Jeſus, were even after his Reſurrection, ſo far from believing it, either <hi>Explicitely</hi> or <hi>Implicitely</hi> (a late phraſe of his) that they <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed</hi> it, and it <hi>ſeemed to them as idle Tales, Lu.</hi> 24. 11. Yet if that were granted, that all theſe had this belief of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that he ſhould come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet if he will believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (which he hath ſmall cauſe to do, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his windings and twiſtings of late) they could not have that holy Spirit which the Chriſtians had, that Holy Spirit being (as he ſaith) peculiar to believers in Chriſt <hi>Crucified,</hi> (not in Chriſt <hi>to be</hi> Crucified.)</p>
               <p>In the ſame Page he quotes a ſaying of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> thus, <hi>There is a Holy Spirit in us, that Teacheth us, as we Treat him.</hi> So here's a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then hath outſtript <hi>G.

               <p>Again, <q>God gave his Holy Spirit to inſtruct them; and the Spirit in the Jews made them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93417:16"/>
to believe in Chriſt, as well before he was Born in the Fleſh, as ſince, and therefore he is called the Spirit of Faith, as being the Author of it, in all them that believe, p. 150.</q> Is this Conſonant to his ſaying, <hi>(Truth Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> p. 70.) <hi>Nor is it any where to be found, that any received that Holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt promiſed particularly to the Believers in him, but ſuch only who believed in him, even Chriſt Crucified and Raiſed again?</hi> Will he diſtinguiſh between Gods Holy Spirit, and the Holy Ghoſt, or make two Holy Ghoſts.</p>
               <p>He queries, <q>Was not the Spirit of Chriſt in <hi>Moſes?</hi> And Chriſt the Lord was that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught, p. 187.</q> Now I query, Seeing Chriſt was not then offered up, whether that Spirit were the Holy Ghoſt or no?

                  </q> the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, <hi>the Lord is that Spirit,</hi> p. 170 (And in p. 107. he tells us, <hi>Paul Expounds</hi> Deut. 30. 14. <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus and others of the Fathers ſo underſtood thoſe words of</hi> Moſes) if ſo, the Jews by having Chriſt for their Rule, had the Holy Ghoſt for their Rule, even before he was Crucified and Roſe again. This he inforceth in what follows.</p>

                  <q>If <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> had the Spirit to be a Rule unto them, it is no leſs a Rule unto all now, who have the SAME FAITH which they had, ſeeing the SAME SPIRIT is given to Believers now, which they had, which Spirit is one, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared: And it is moſt Rational, that as the Faith is one IN ALL AGES of the World, and the Spirit ONE, So the Principal Rule of Faith ſhould be one alſo, p. 114.</q> If the Spirit be one, the Faith one, the Rule one, in all Ages of the World, How came <hi>Cornelius</hi> not to have the Holy Ghoſt, when his <hi>Prayers and Almes came up for a Memorial before God?</hi> Or had he that one Spirit, Rule and Faith, which <hi>Enoch, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and that one Spirit not the Holy Spirit, not the Spirit of Holineſs, not the Spirit of Adoption or Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Is not this to make <hi>two?</hi> And to the <hi>Levites,</hi> P. 121. He allows the <hi>Spirit of God to the right interpreting the Scripture:</hi> Now Chriſt not being yet Cruciſied and Raiſed again. I <hi>query,</hi> Whether that Spirit were ſomething beſides the Law within, which of late he hath ſaid, made nothing Perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>His Commanding them to tarry at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> until they received the promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was the Spirit (to wit in GREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER MEASURE than formerly it was given unto them) did not oblige, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> p. 141. Had he kept to this diſtinction in his latter Writings, he would not have told of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not having the Holy Ghoſt, before they had Faith in Chriſt Crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

A more <hi>plentiful Effuſion</hi> of the Spirit being no part of the Controverſy, but granted: But ſtill it is the ſame Spirit, ſame Faith, ſame Rule, as himſelf once acknowledged, and was inſtanced even now.</p>
               <p>In the next place (he having of late aſſerted, that the Law within did not make perfect, till, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Let us hear how he here defineth perfection, <q>He who is Faithful in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the meaſure of Grace which he hath received, is indeed a <hi>perfect</hi> Man, and doth pleaſe God, although he be not equal in his attainment unto others, who have more given them, ſaith <hi>G. Keith,</hi> p. 212.</q> But can any one be <hi>perfect,</hi> by vertue of a Law that doth <hi>not make</hi> perfect? And if there were this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, even in the Law within, during the firſt Covenant Adminiſtration, how could any be perfect then? And yet to ſhew that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Contradictions, he hath allowed it to <hi>many,</hi> as in above-cited <hi>Way to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God,</hi> p. 125. which I made the Title of this firſt Part.</p>
               <p>And now I come to <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Book of <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1684. which I Read not till of late, by means of his <note place="margin">

Speaking of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he ſaith, <q>Do not <hi>Peters</hi> words plainly imply, that there were many ſuch good honeſt Men, who were acceptable to God through Chriſt, although they had not heard of Chriſt as yet outwardly Preached?</q> See, p. 26. 27 Again, <q>

               <p>Again, <q>We no where Read in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>Noah</hi> Preached to all Mankind in the Old World, but we find expreſly that God, by his Spirit, did ſtrive in thoſe Men, which moſt plainly ſheweth that they had ſome inward teaching given them from the SPIRIT OF GOD, for againſt what did they Sin, but that Law Publiſhed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in their Hearts, ſeeing they had no written Law?—They had that inward Law, which as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmed, the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. See, p. 54. The word of God was rare in reſpect of its being outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preached, yet it was near and within, in the Hearts of both Jews and Gentiles, as <hi>Paul</hi> did affirm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</q> compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. p. 55. Whence I <hi>Query,</hi> What Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit this is? What Law Publiſhed thereby? What word this that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> Speak of? And whether they that received it and obeyed it received the Holy Spirit, and were thereby made perfect, eſpecially ſeeing he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, p. 79. <q>All the Faithful under the Old Covenant were immediatly taught of God, yet not by vertue of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but of the New, which New Covenant in ſome degree had place in the time of the Old, and was to be further revealed in Goſpel Daies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Surely if the New Covenant had place in ſome degree, in the time of the

Old, the New Teſtament promiſed <hi>(I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> Ezek. 36. 27.) had alſo a place during the Old Covenant Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even where the word of Faith was cloſed with: And what Spirit is this, if not the Holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>In p. 55. After having deſended <hi>R.

                  <hi>[Qu.</hi> Were the Gentiles, who did by nature the things Contained in the Law, none of theſe?] <q>For if at any time the outward Preaching was little or none—God did ſupply that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defect inwardly by his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </q> Now compare this with what himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 46. up on this very aſſertion of <hi>Jus;tin Martyr</hi>'s, viz. <q>If they were real Chriſtians, and were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that Honourable Name, they had ſome Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> &amp;c.</q> As he was to come in the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c</hi> So one while this wavering Man reſtricts Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to a belief in Chriſt come, Crucifie and Raiſed again, and allows the appellation to <hi>Socrates</hi> and the reſt, only upon Condition that they ſo knew and believed in Chriſt, nother while admits them to be Chriſtians part, conform to the Divine Word, while ſuppoſeth them not to have had that Kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In his <hi>Plain Short Catechiſm,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1690. He ſaith by way of <hi>Question</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>

               <p>As in p. 27. he had interpreted the <hi>Coats of Skins, wherewith God cloathed</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>after the Fail, to be a cloathing the Soul with the Righteouſneſs of the Lamb, and the Body with the Skin and Fleſh of this frail, mortal and corruptible Body</hi> (on which I made my Obſervations in my laſt Book, called, <hi>People called Quakers</hi>

the Fleſh that is groſs, mortal and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, is not that Fleſh, that ſhall be raiſed up immortal and incorruptible, p. 113.</q> This not only contradicts his own ſaying <hi>(Teſtimony againſt that abſur'd Opinion,</hi> p. 3.) <q>That which riſeth is the MORTAL, that putteth on immortality, and the corruptible which putteth on incorruption,</q> but even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>this mortal ſhall put on immortality,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54. Now from what I have quoted above, I demand proof of him. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the frail, mortal and corruptible Body, which <hi>Adam</hi> had after the Fall, was not the Body he had before the Fall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Body he had after the Fall riſeth not, but that which he had before the Fall; for we muſt not take things upon truſt from ſo unſtable an Author.</p>
               <p>In p. 115. he tells his Reader, where the <q>Separation is made between the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Part, and that <hi>droſſy</hi> Part in Mans Body <hi>[viz.]</hi> In the Myſtical and Inviſible <hi>Machpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> or Sepulchre in <hi>Hebron,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

               <p>Again, he ſaith, <q>The Graves that ſhall be opened at the Reſurrection of the Dead, are not any viſible Places on this Globe of the Earth [How will he prove that?</q> I am ſure his Friends he would now creep in with, are of another Mind] <q>but certain in viſible places to

Is it that very Numerical Body that dyeth (without Belly, Guts and Draught) which he ſaith elſewhere, Man was cloathed with <hi>after</hi> the Fall. Or is it that Body, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends is proper to Man as Man, and received <hi>before</hi> the Fall? Again, What is that Bone, he ſpeaks of?

If he will needs ſet up for a <hi>new Sect,</hi> between the received Opinion of the ſame Body of Fleſh, Blood and Bones ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and our ſticking to Scripture Words, that <hi>it is ſown a natural Body, raiſed a ſpiritual Body,</hi> let him explain his terms.</p>

Keith,</hi> wherein
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93417:29"/>
he declares himſelf <hi>greatly injured, and badly and unjuſtly reflected on,</hi> in my Book entituled, <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called</hi> Quakers <hi>cleared,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>gives notice</hi> that <hi>after our Anſwer to his late Narrative</hi> (which he <hi>ſuppoſes,</hi> and might well ſuppoſe we would Anſwer) <hi>he purpoſeth, God willing, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate another Meeting (with leave of Authority) at</hi> Turners-Hall, <hi>to Anſwer the Book, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>the ſeveral groſs Perverſions and abuſive Wreſtings therein.</hi> But like a Man, that never knows how to hold long of one Mind, he at length puts it upon another (tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more <hi>proper)</hi> iſſue, where I now meet him.</p>
               <p>His Book, as by <hi>Title Page,</hi> is divided into three Parts, 1. An Anſwer to <hi>Caleb Puſey.</hi> 2. To me. 3. Poſtſcript to the Pious and Learned in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and among other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters. I ſhall a little invert the Order, and begin with what affects my ſelf, it being Relative to what precedes above, where having placed my Quotations according to their Dates and Pages, and the Title Pages of the Books in the Margin, the Reader may more eaſily recurr to them, when referred to in what follows.</p>
               <p>He begins with me, p. 21. and entitules that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 21.</note> part, <hi>Some Remarks upon</hi> J. Penington<hi>'s late Book, Entituled,</hi> The People called <hi>Quakers</hi> cleared, <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>his Poſtſcript, ſhewing ſome of their groſs Perverſions, falſhoods and groundleſs Calumnies againſt</hi> G. Keith.</p>
               <p>The Charge is high, now let us ſee how the Proof will anſwer. To my ſaying, that to the Meeting he appointed (at <hi>Turners Hall)</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:93417:30"/>
our Conſent was neither ſought nor made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, he anſwers, <hi>They got timely notice, a Month before hand, and were deſired to be preſent.</hi> Anſ. That proves not, that our <hi>Conſent was either ſought or made neceſſary,</hi> for upon the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Summons he leaves no room for that, but declares his full Intention to be there, and make good his Charge, whether we come or no (ſee <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> p. 2.) nor doth his <hi>deſiring us in former Prints, to conſent to Time and Place,</hi> as alledged by him, evince that THIS Meeting was not appointed without our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſought or made neceſſary. What the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our refuſal to meet him were, hath been already made publick, even by my ſelf in my REFLECTIONS upon his <hi>Advertiſment,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I referr, and proceed.</p>
               <p>To my telling him (he ſaith <hi>their,</hi> in the Plural, as if he ſcorned to engage me ſingle) that two Books lye upon him unanſwered, to which he gave grounds to expect an Anſwer, he ſaith, <hi>Firſt, Some of their own Church have ſufficiently anſwered to ſhew the badneſs of their Cauſe, in that cenſure they gave againſt</hi> T. Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this were true, that ſome had done ſo, for they are <hi>nameleſs,</hi> and at moſt give but their own Cenſure, and that but to a Paſſage or two, have they anſwered the Book in Print? Or if they had, would that excuſe <hi>G. Keith?</hi> How willing is he to <hi>ſhift,</hi> when pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to <hi>lay hold of any Twig, like a drowning M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

voce, <hi>at a Meeting,</hi> alledging <hi>there is no end of anſwering them in Print,</hi> that <hi>few will be at the Pains to compare Book with Book,</hi> and that <hi>the Charge is too great for him.</hi> But why did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then with Printing, and not rather have exhibited his Charge at firſt <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> if he eſteemed that the beſt Method of Debate? But to do it now when he hath drawn us into the Preſs, and to expect we ſhould do ſo too, is prepoſterous. Nay, why doth he now anſwer me in Print, ſeeing ſo few will be at the pains of comparing Book with Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, and that he ſo lately propoſed a <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> vindicating himſelf againſt me, in his <hi>winged</hi> ADVERTISEMENT tagg'd to the Tail of <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> but that he is ſo hampered with a bad cauſe, that he knows not which way to turn?</p>
               <p>My Quotations, in the Book he now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Anſwer, were 1. His vindicating our Principles from our common Adverſaries. 2. His Contradictions in ſeveral Doctrinal Parts. To the firſt, he Anſwers, <hi>Such as I did think were their Principles, I did formerly vindicate.</hi> Nay, this will not ſhelter him, it was ſuch as he KNEW to be ſo, and that from twenty eight Years Converſe both Publick and Private, with the moſt Noted and Eſteemed among them, in many Places of the World in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> as he told <hi>C.

p. 12. <hi>Then the Inward to be Preached before the Outward.</hi> And this is a Contradiction.</p>

                  <hi>But for the better underſtanding of the Caſe, the Diſtinction betwixt General Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is to be conſidered, which Diſtinction I have uſed</hi> (adds he) <hi>in my Book, called,</hi> Divine Immediate Revelation and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>&amp;c. Anſw.</hi> I am beholden to him for this Reference, out of a Book I had not read before; for it not only helpeth me to freſh Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in General, but even here it makes for me, not for him. For in p. 45. he ſaith, <q>The Scriptures do witneſs abundantly concerning ſuch an experimental and ſpiritually ſenſible Knowledge of God, which is perceived in a moſt inward Union and Communion of the Soul with God, and in a certain intellectual and ſpiritual Contact, or Touch, of which not only <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plotin,</hi> and others among thoſe called Philoſophers, but the Apoſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians, have largely made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Hence I query, What Religion theirs was, that of <hi>Plato, Plotin</hi> and the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers? <hi>General</hi> Religion, or the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion? Again, what the moſt inward Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Souls with God, that ſpiritual Contact, or Touch, that ſpiritual, ſenſible Knowledge of God, he allows them to have witneſſed; was it with or without the Holy Ghoſt, ſeeing as yet Jeſus was not ſo much as born in the Outward?</p>
               <p>In p. 23. He ſaith, <hi>It moſt evidently appears from the expreſs Words of my Book of</hi> Univerſal <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 23.</note> Grace, p. 120. <hi>That I did not then hold, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93417:32"/>
the Light within was ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe, as without Chriſts outward Coming,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It will ſufficiently appear, to them who duly conſult the place, that (even according to <hi>G. Keith)</hi> 
                  <q>the other Nations <hi>[viz.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles]</hi> were not deſtitute of the main and principal thing, even of the Manifeſtation of the Light and Spirit of the Son in their Hearts, and that thoſe that did improve it, did both know the Lord and his Laws, and were JUSTIFIED through Faith in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And it will alſo appear to ſuch as will caſt an Eye upon what he hath ſaid, no longer ago than in the Year, 1691. in his <hi>Presb.</hi> and <hi>Ind. Chur.</hi> p 116. that he <hi>then</hi> held, that <q>It is no leſs than real Blaſphemy, to ſay, that the Light within is not ſufficient, to give that Knowledge of God that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto Salvation.</q> Now if this doth not depretiate the bleſſed Effects of Chriſts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coming, when delivered by <hi>G. Keith</hi> (which is the Scope of what he offers in the Page under my Conſideration) why muſt it be rendred ſo to do, when delivered (as he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts) by us, except to gratifie his rancour, who will allow that Expoſition to his own Words, he denies to others?</p>
               <p>In page 24. He makes my Charge to be, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>That he did formerly hold that Chriſts inward coming ſaves, where the outward is unknown,</hi> in which he renders me guilty <hi>of groſs Forgery and Perverſion</hi> (for he ſeldom Charges <hi>lower</hi> in any thing that affects himſelf) of <hi>Forgery, ſeeing I cite no paſſage out of any of his Books,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93417:33"/>
where he expreſſeth theſe words, Where the outward is unknown,</hi> &amp;c. But is it Forgery to give his words without a Citation? If ſo, it is his own beloved Crime. Yet had he but turned over the next Leaf in my Book, and minded what he read, he might have found, that I bring him in ſaying, The <hi>outward Coming, ſufferings and Death of Chriſt, may have and hath a true and real influence, upon them who know it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly.</hi> Again, <hi>Why may not many receive an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Chriſt, the ſecond</hi> Adam's <hi>Obedience. even in the</hi> outward, <hi>who never knew it expreſly,</hi> &amp;c. This might have ſhut his Cavil out of Doors, had it not been ſo Natural to him to Wrangle.</p>
               <p>He adds, <hi>They</hi> (for that is the word he uſeth, when he brings any thing out of my Book) <hi>are guilty of groſly Perverting my words and ſenſe, as if I did hold, that Chriſts inward coming ſaves, with Eternal Salvation, without all Knowledge of Chriſts outward coming.</hi> What means he by the tearm, <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> (which yet were none of my words) are not all that are ſaved here, ſaved with <hi>Eternal Salvation?</hi> Or muſt they be fitted in Purgatory, or in ſome other Revolution.?</p>
               <p>But he is offended that the words <hi>explicit</hi> and <hi>implicit</hi> (which I find not but in his late Books) <hi>are by me called a late Diſtinction,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The place of his Book, cited by me, ſaith no ſuch thing,</hi> yet acknowledgeth, <hi>that in divers of his late Books he hath diſtinguiſhed betwixt the expreſs and implicit Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. But hath he made that diſtinction formerly? if not it is a late di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93417:33"/>
His alledging that it <hi>is implyed,</hi> that <hi>though not expreſt, yet was really underſtood by him,</hi> is idle, for it is not what he underſtands, but what he gives us to underſtand, what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that is properly called <hi>his Diſtinction.</hi> But he Vindicates it, as what all true <hi>and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians hold</hi> (though he names none) as well as infers it from <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6. Which is wide from the purpoſe. The Apoſtle tells, <hi>v.</hi> 5. That <hi>it was not made known as it is now.</hi> How? Not <hi>expreſly,</hi> but <hi>implicitely?</hi> That he ſaith not, although <hi>G. Keith</hi> doth, who in p. 25. from <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. queries, <hi>Now what is made manifeſt, but Expreſs? And what is kept ſecret, but Implicit?</hi> So then, if the Reader <note place="margin">
                     <hi>page,</hi> 25.</note> would know what <hi>implicit</hi> means, <hi>G. Keith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves him, it is <hi>what is kept ſecret.</hi> I thought it had not deſerved to be called <hi>Knowledge,</hi> while kept ſecret, while not manifeſt, but that the opening, the unvailing, the revealing a thing gives me to know it; but this <hi>Profound Myſtick</hi> hath got a new knack of expounding words, and interpreting the Scriptures, as if Men were ſaved by a knowledge kept ſecret from them.</p>
               <p>He queries, <hi>Why will they not allow it</hi> (the tearm <hi>implicit) as well with reſpect to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt without us, as of Chriſt within us? Anſwer,</hi> I gave him no occaſion thus to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet reply, becauſe the knowledg of Chriſt within, is immediate, by a divine ſenſation; the other not always ſo.</p>
               <p>Now from my following words, That <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s diſtinction was to <hi>ſerve a turn</hi> (which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93417:34"/>

Thus much o the <hi>expoſition,</hi> Now to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it ſelf. Is it true Doctrine that the Life Cleanſeth? <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath ſaid it; the Friend hath ſaid it.

was more general than his outward, that what was in it ſelf more general they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo (which <hi>G.

               <p>To my Queſtion, <hi>Whether any Prayer is

Whence had he this? Or how doth he prove, that Mens Souls are not in Union with the Spirit, when helped to pray by the Spirit? Surely, as there are Degrees of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, ſo there are Degrees of Union, and Degrees of Acceptance, <hi>Diverſities of Gifts, but the</hi> SAME <hi>Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 4. But he goes on, <hi>And were not my Adverſaries extream blind and ignorant, they might underſtand how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth one and the ſame Spirit, the Spirit of Servitude, and the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom 8. 15.

               <p>He goes on, <hi>Theſe Mens arguing that Men may be Eternally Saved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who have no Faith or Knowledge of Chriſt without them, do ſufficiently declare what Heathens they are, and of what little value they make the Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt Crucified, and that their Religion is nothing but

Deiſm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not believe that, that Faith is not neceſſary to Salvation to us, to whom the means of knowing it, is offered, but the contrary: But that, where it is <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, it is not of Neceſſity unto Salvation,</hi> G.

               <p>In his Fourthly, he cites a Paſſage of mine imperfectly, out of <hi>Rector Corrected,</hi> p. 150. and then makes his flouriſh. To a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of the <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>Arrow, whether the Light within ſufficiently tells us,</hi> that <hi>the Meſſiah is come,</hi> born, had real Fleſh, dyed, <hi>&amp;c. G.

(See my p. 22.) Upon this I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued (and <hi>G.

Even in what I have cited above, and he hath craftily left out. He goes on, <hi>Did I ever ſay, That Men may believe in the Light, or Chriſt within, and never at any Time, from firſt to laſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93417:41"/>
believe in Chriſt without, either explicitely or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely? For this they bring no Proof, and I believe they cannot,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was not the <hi>Rectors</hi> Queſtion, Whether they that dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and had it not at <hi>firſt,</hi> ſhould have it at <hi>laſt,</hi> in ſome other Revolution? Perhaps nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them dreamt of that Diſtinction, when the Book was wrote. Nor whether they ſhould have it <hi>explicitely</hi> or <hi>implicitely,</hi> but whether the Light doth ſufficiently tell it? He ſhould in his Anſwer have made that Diſtinction, if he would have it allowed him now; but inſtead of that, to an indefinite Queſtion, he gives an indefinite Anſwer, aſſerting there are Truths as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that it doth teach, and that they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light [believe theſe neceſſary Truths thus revealed] believe in Chriſt, and are accepted.</p>
               <p>I having in my p. 25, 26. cited <hi>G. Keith</hi> [That Eternal Life and Salvation is only to be had through the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt Crucified—that this Faith is indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all—The Work of Sanctification aſcribed in Scripture to Chriſts Blood and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as well as to his inward Appearance, and to both indiſpenſibly neceſſary, and to Faith therein.] I oppoſed them, p. 26, to 31. to his former ſayings, <hi>G.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93417:41"/>
my Friends Sentiments either way (that I had done before, p. 11.) but oppoſed <hi>G. Keith</hi> to <hi>G. Keith:</hi> Yet may now tell him, We do not place all upon Chriſt within, nor all upon Chriſt without; we do not divide Chriſt, but believe it was neceſſary that he ſhould come, as well as that it was afterwards expedient, he ſhould go away, and that the belief of both is a Duty, even <hi>in order to Salvation,</hi> where the means of having it, are afforded. And himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>The Knowledge of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the outward, is not of neceſſity to Salvation, ſave only where it is revealed:</hi> Which as it was one of the places among many other I cited (ſee my p. 30.) in Contradiction to the three Paſſages above; ſo had he no Reaſon to ſay here, <hi>But wherein I have contradicted that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhew not;</hi> for I both ſhewed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Reader to fourteen contradictory Aſſertions out of his Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> from my p. 26, to 31. and declared p. 26. (immediately after the Quotation he brings) that I ſo brought them.</p>
               <p>In his Sixthly, he creeps in at the Tail of a Citation of Mine [Nor is the outward Name that which ſaveth, but the inward Nature, Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> thus, <hi>But they no where ſhew how I contradict this.</hi> Anſw. That is falſe, for it is one of theſe <hi>fourteen</hi> I mentioned even now. He goes on, <hi>I ſay ſtill, it is not the outward Name either of God or Chriſt, that ſaveth without the inward Nature, Vertue and Power, which dwelt and dwells in all fulneſs in the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Here he falſifieth his own Quotation, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93417:42"/>
if there were no difference between ſaying, It is not the outward Name that ſaveth, BUT the inward Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſaying, It is not the outward Name that ſaves WITHOUT the inward Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So little doth he regard, what becomes a fair Adverſary. Had he took my Sentence entire his Contradiction had been obvious. In Order to clear an Objection himſelf had raiſed, <hi>That there can be no Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Faith in Chriſt, but theſe</hi> Gentiles <hi>had not Faith in Chriſt, therefore,</hi> &amp;c. he Anſwers <hi>by denying the ſecond Propoſition,</hi> thus, <q>If they did cleave unto, and believe in the Light they believe in Chriſt, for he is the Light nor is the outward Name that which ſaveth but the inward Nature, Virtue and Power ſignified thereby; which was made manifeſt in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> So that here he aſcribes Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the <hi>inward</hi> Work, who, according as ſtated on the Objection, were ſuppoſed not to have Faith in Chriſt, but they believing in the Light, he ſaith, they have, and ſo contradicts that other ſaying, alledged above, that the <hi>Faith of both</hi> the inward and outward coming, <hi>is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He often laies to my Charge, that <hi>I bring no place to prove where he contradicts himſelf;</hi> but that is not true: He leaps over my Proofs, that he may not ſee them, picking here and there a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in reading over many Pages, and perhaps chuſeth ſuch, as lye moſt remote from my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, wherein the Contradiction lies. So here (in his <hi>Seventhly)</hi> upon my quoting him, <hi>That theſe</hi> Gentiles (he leaves out, <hi>who did call
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93417:42"/>
upon the Name of the Lord, and were ſaved,</hi> and adds, which was not there, <hi>had the Goſpel Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, who</hi> goes on) <hi>were not under any outward Adminiſtration of the Goſpel:</hi> And then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, I bring no place to prove where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts this Aſſertion.

what a ſlippery Chapman will theſe Men have of him? But to go on, from his adding of theſe Sincere Profeſſors, that they <hi>held the Head, and Build on the true Foundation, and yet differ in ſome leſſer Matters:</hi> I obſerved, that at the ſame Time no Epithets were (with him) black enough upon his <hi>quondam</hi> Friends, whom he ſometimes boaſts he hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of thirty Years amongſt. <hi>G.

               <p>Now let us hear what a kind of <hi>Retractation</hi> he makes. The Reader may perhaps expect ſome great matter, if he be enformed, what large Notice he hath given before hand, above a twelve Month ago, and how he beſpoke his own Praiſe in the being free to do it. For in his Book, called, <hi>True Copy</hi> (Dated in the third Month, 1695.) in Order to introduce what he called, <hi>A ſhort Liſt of the Vile and groſs Errors of</hi> G. Whitehead, J.

All he gives is this, <hi>I am not aſhamed</hi> (ſays he here, p. 34, 35.) <hi>to own my general Miſtakes, I have been under, concerning divers Places of Scriptures, particularly Relative to Water-Baptiſm and the Supper, as</hi> Mat. 28. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>And ſome other Places of Scripture, relative to ſome other Matters, eſpecially in the Miſapplication of ſome Places, to prove certain Truths, which theſe Places did not prove—And I am ſo far from being aſhamed to Publiſh this Confeſſion, that I have great Peace and Joy in it.

But the time was not long betwixt their Fall, and their Reſtoration, ſo far as they had acceſs to Chriſt, ſignified by the Tree of Life.

Or is AEthereal and Heavenly, the ſame in Subſtance, with a Body of Fleſh, Blood and Bone? How is this reconcileable?</p>
               <p>To his poſitively denying the expreſs Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſts becoming Man, and Suffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be of Neceſſity to Salvation, the Friend queried. How is it now, that he ſaith, that expreſs Knowledge is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to Salvation, or perfect Juſtification, for which they both quote <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> p. 133. and <hi>G.

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93417:55"/>
                  <hi>His fallacy lyeth in this, that I ſay, the expreſs Knowledge is not univerſally neceſſary, but ſome Knowledge, if not expreſs, yet implicite, is, and this</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is no Contradiction. Anſw.</hi> That Page hath nothing in it of that tendency, but what is, is in p. 111, 112. So that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in <hi>C. Puſey</hi>'s Book, in <hi>Print</hi> or <hi>Tranſcript, G. Keith</hi> hath followed in his, without amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. This <hi>G. Keith</hi> did either eſpy, or he did not eſpy. If he did eſpy it, why not alſo give warning of it, except he deſigned to lead his Reader Hoodwinkt, that he might impoſe upon him? If he did not eſpy it, how could he pretend to detect a fallacy, in what he had not compared? Take it either way, it makes not for <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Credit. Now to return to the Quotation, the <hi>fallacy</hi> is in <hi>G. Keith;</hi> for as the Queſtion was concerning Salvation and PERFECT Juſtification, ſo the Aſſertion whence it was deduced, was thus, <q>It may be very ſafely concluded that the expreſs Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified, is not of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and indiſpenſible Neceſſity, unto the BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINNING of a Mans Salvation, although it is really of abſolute and indiſpenſible Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto the finiſhing and PERFECTING of it, ſaid <hi>G. Keith, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> p. 111.</q> By this the Reader may give a gueſs, why <hi>G. Keith</hi> was willing to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf under a miſpaged Quotation; for had the place been examined, it would have diſcovered the Friends Inference to have been genuine, reſtricted not to <hi>ſome Knowledge</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, but to a <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93417:56"/>
And if any pleaſe to trace him yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will find it was ſuch a Knowledge, as who had not, WHEN LIVING, might (according to <hi>G. Keith)</hi> have <hi>at their Death, to wit, in the paſſing through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, according to</hi> Pſalm 23. 4. <hi>Even when they are not able to demonſtrate unto the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what is then revealed unto them,</hi> See <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> and <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> p. 112. Which as it is a perverſe Expoſition of that Scripture, <hi>(David</hi> ſpeaking there of a Condition here up on Earth, <hi>The Lords preparing a Table for him in the preſence of his Enemies, anointing his Head with Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall follow him all the days of his Life;</hi> ver. 5, and 6. Not of a State after Death, when Men are not able to demonſtrate unto the Living, what is then revealed unto them) ſo it renders him a Favourer of the Notion of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> as well as that it is worſe than miſapplying Scriptures to prove certain Truths, which thoſe places did not prove (an Error he would pretend to have Retracted, p. 35.) this tending to defend <hi>untruths,</hi> and unſound Notions, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do diſavow.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>C. Puſey</hi> his querying, <q>Seeing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>G.

Keith</hi> citing him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from where he ſaith [the Word only] infers, that <hi>he placeth all on the Light within, ſo that the Man Chriſt Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>without us is nothing of Chriſt,</hi> and calls it a <hi>blaſphemous Aſſertion and Conſequence, which follows not from his Words. Anſw.</hi> The Friend gave <hi>G.

Or whether <hi>G. Keith</hi> had ground from hence to inſult, that his Opponent <hi>had neither Learning nor good Exerciſe of humane Reaſon, but had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kept working at his Mill?</hi> as well as that I may put <hi>G.

               <p>
                  <hi>G. Keith</hi> goes on, <hi>Seeing that he would infer from my Words, That</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>cannot be ſomething elſe than the Light, Power and Spirit within, it is plain, that it is both their Senſe and his, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>is nothing at all of Chriſt without us, which is a plain Contradiction to themſelves, and to himſelf in the following Words.</hi> Thus far <hi>G. Keith.</hi> But how will he prove our Senſe and his to be, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is nothing at all of Chriſt without us, if that ſenſe be ſo immediately Contradicted in the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93417:57"/>
following words? This ſhews he wants <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> and would take things by the <hi>worſt</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to faſten an imputation, not only upon the Friend himſelf, but his Brethren alſo, which he confeſſeth is contradicted by him: Who, had he not ſought an occaſion to miſrepreſent us mought have entituled <hi>us at leaſt,</hi> to what he calls the contradictory Senſe. Now <hi>C. Puſey</hi> his Words were theſe, upon <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>The Light is Chriſt, but the Man Chriſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe,</hi> he queried, <hi>Whether the Man Chriſt be become ſomething elſe beſides Chriſt?</hi> And adds, <hi>but to wave ſuch Compariſons,</hi> which ſhews his were not <hi>Aſſertory,</hi> but <hi>argumentative ad hominem,</hi> a Compariſon <hi>G.

To this I ſay, The Man Chriſt, who <hi>was made</hi> (or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came) <hi>Fleſh,</hi> John 1. 14. who ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am come a Light into the World,</hi> Chap. 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 46. is not ſomething elſe beſides Chriſt.

without us, as unduly aſperſed by <hi>G. Keith,</hi> hear him in his <hi>Modeſt Account,</hi> p. 16, 17. where he thus hath it, <q>Though we cannot yield to <hi>G.

Keith</hi>'s own Words, who ſaith the Light is God) is not able to ſave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we believe, <hi>Beſide him there is no Saviour,</hi> yet we do not in the leaſt Queſtion, but dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own and acknowledge and believe the Way and Means, that the Lord was pleaſed, out of his infinite Love and good Will to Mankind, to take, in order to redeem him from Sin and Death, as ſending his only begotten Son into the World, not only as a Light—but alſo as Man, in the prepared Body to offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a moſt acceptable Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, which Offering the Lord was pleaſed to accept of, and by his Spirit and Power it is made Effectual for the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Salvation of all thoſe that repent of their Sins, and truly believe in his Name. And that God doth not ſave any without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that great Offering, we all grant and truly believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> This as it is a full Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Friend, that he did not underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but highly prize what Chriſt hath done without us; ſo it needs no further Comment, than a Reflection upon his Adverſaries Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, who kept this back, while he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuggeſt the contrary thereto, as the Friends ſenſe and ours.</p>

For whereas the Friend had ſaid, [And that God doth not ſave any without reſpect to that great Offering, we all grant and truly believe: For, as <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſaith, The Lord having ordained it ſo to be, how can or dare we ſay therefore, That he was or is not Sufficient, by his Light, Power and Spirit, to ſave without ſomething elſe? Surely this ſeems to me too Preſumptuous an Expreſſion; for was not that Body prepared of God? And what was done in it? Is it not ſaid, God did it by him?] <hi>G.

But <hi>whether antecedently to Gods purpoſe, he would have ſaved us without the Death of his own Dear Son, a thing</hi> (he tells us <hi>Exact Narrative,</hi> p. 25.) <hi>is above Mans Capacity,</hi> and that <hi>he wholly waves that Diſpute,</hi> is what I ſhall wave inſiſting on, yet with this Caution, which the Friend alſo gave him in his, p. 18. <hi>viz.</hi>

But we have no need to recurr to this Notion, that of Purgatory or of Revolutioniſm to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our Principles, though he ſeem at laſt willing to allow, it is not altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſaying, <hi>It hath the ſame Probability in the one Caſe, as the other,</hi> to ſlide himſelf off from the imputation of Revolutioniſm.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93417:62"/>
might make the Scriptures as ſelf-Inconſiſtent, as himſelf is: It was <hi>ſown in Corruption, in Diſhonour, in Weakneſs, a Natural Body; raiſed in Incorruption, in Glory, in Power, a Spiritual Body;</hi> See, <hi>v.</hi> 42, 43, 44, But <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, That which riſeth is the Mortal, and then again, The Fleſh that is Mortal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not the Fleſh that ſhall be raiſed Immortal, as <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath done.</p>
               <p>To Vindicate his other aſſertion, <hi>viz. That which riſeth is a pure, Noble part that Conſumeth not, he bringeth in the Similitude of a Grain of</hi> Corn, p. 11. thus, <hi>All but Fools and Idiots know, that as there is a Grain of Corn that Corrupteth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page,</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and turneth to Earth or Duſt, ſo there is another part in it, that is more noble, that Corrupteth not, but by the Corruption of the other part—Gets a new Life. Anſwer,</hi> This Simile will not hold, even among them that are not Fools &amp; Idiots, for that very noble part may Corrupt, and the Induſtrious Husband Man have no Crop, as G. <hi>Keith</hi> himſelf, who is neither Fool nor Idiot, allows, in the very ſame page. Again, that more noble part in the Seed, is proper to the Seed, as Seed: And the leſs noble is a neceſſary Appendix to the more noble, which is not ſo in this Caſe, G <hi>Keith</hi> himſelf being Judge. For Man had a Body before the Fall, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had its radix (elſe how could it <hi>multiply its Speices,</hi> according to G <hi>Keith</hi> in <hi>Truth Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</hi> p. 28.) the which Body G. <hi>Keith</hi> ſaith, was not Naked before the Fall, ibid, p. 24. On the other hand the Skin and Fleſh of this Frail, Mortal and Corruptible Body, he ſaith,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93417:63"/>
is not proper to Man as Man, but a Cloathing he received ſince the Fall, See, ibid. p. 113. and 27. But is this predicable of a Grain of Corn? So that all his noiſe of <hi>Sadduceiſm, Atheiſm,</hi> &amp;c. Terminates in a diſpute whether the Man's Cloaths ſhall riſe or no? <hi>viz.</hi> That which, according to him, is not proper to Man as Man, not ſo much as to his Cloathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, but was added by means of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion? A Reſurrection of the Body, of ſuch a Body as God ſhall pleaſe to give. we own, and that he knows full well; but his uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Wavering, Notional, Abſurd, Incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Unſcriptual Expoſitions we reject (as particularly what he ſaid even now, that <hi>that which riſeth is the Mortal,</hi> and yet again, <hi>that which riſeth is a pure noble part, that conſumeth not)</hi> and this makes him uneaſy.</p>
               <p>As a further Indication of his inſtability, let us hear what <hi>true Philoſophy, right Reaſon, and ocular Experience teacheth,</hi> as himſelf giveth it us, <hi>viz. The Generation of one thing followeth the Corruption of another, yet there is ſomething in the new Generated thing, that was in the old Corrupted thing,</hi> &amp;c. Whence I query, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this SOMETHING in the new generated thing, which was in the Old Corrupted thing, be that which riſeth <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Corruptible,</hi> as he ſaid even now? For if Mortal and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, how comes it to be a pure noble part, which conſumeth not, nor corrupteth, with the old Corrupted thing? Are theſe Terms converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? That predicable of the one, which is of the other? Or is it not rather a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93417:63"/>
that in ſtead of being taught by true <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> &amp;c. He is now Plunged into the <hi>Ditch</hi> of Philoſophy, as he called it, whence this blind Leader of the Blind cannot help himſelf out? As well as that theſe Sentiments, whereby the Fleſh, Blood and Bones are Termed the Old Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing, that the New Generation hath not, but only SOMETHING that was in it, <hi>(The Fleſh that is Mortal and Corruptible,</hi> being by him denied to be <hi>the Fleſh that ſhall be raiſed up Immortal and Incorruptible,</hi> p. 10.) do no ways accord with thoſe of thoſe, whom he now appeals to, againſt us; and would ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf among, for they aſſert the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame Body of Fleſh, Blood and Bones, that Dyed and was laid in the Grave; he here denieth it. So that after all his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with us, rendring us <hi>Atheiſts, Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees,</hi> &amp;c. And Labouring to Provoke the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt us, to ſuppreſs our Books; himſelf is no leſs <hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi> (while <hi>abiding</hi> by what he here ſaith) to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of the Reſurrection, than we are, when our belief is rightly ſtated.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>G. Keith</hi> his diſtinction of <hi>Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> with reſpect to Body and Soul, the Friend argues, firſt, with reſpect to the Body, thus, <q>If the Corruptible be laid aſide, and that which Corrupteth not, but is ſeparated (as <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſaith) in about a Years time, more or leſs, and laid by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in ſome certain Inviſible place, till the Reſurrection; How then doth it receive the change meant by him in the Text, at the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93417:64"/>
Reſurrection? <hi>viz.</hi> If it be Incorruptible before the Reſurrection (for he ſaith, it Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth not) and the Change muſt be a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation from one thing to another; muſt it not then needs be from an Incorruptible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to an Incorruptible Body, and what change is that? For if it be a Tranſmutation, what is it which is Tranſmuted? It cannot be the noble and pure part, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is our Vile Body,</hi> and according to <hi>G. Keith,</hi> it cannot be that which Corrupteth, becauſe he ſaith, That which riſeth, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth not.</q> Thus far <hi>C. Puſey</hi> p. 32. 33. which G. <hi>Keith</hi> gives not his Reader, though he makes his perverſe inference therefrom, ſaying of his Opponent, <hi>He cannot conceive how there can be an Incorruptible part lodged or placed in the Corruptible Body, and how the Body can have any Incorruptible part in it before the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer, The debate is not about an Incorruptible part, being lodged in a Corruptible Body; but what that is that is changed, whether the vile Body, or that which Corrupteth not; and again, whether ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tranſmutation muſt be from one thing to another, what Change is that, from an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body to an Incorruptible Body? So that he hath, to avoid the force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only not given the Citation, but miſ-ſtated it, and then inſults, ſaying, <hi>ſhall I ſend him to his Mill, or own Trade of Grinding, or Sawing Timber, for further Inſtruction?</hi> And yet this Miller hath ground him ſo, he cannot get fairly off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93417:64"/>
And therefore, in the next place let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine G. <hi>Keith</hi> his Philoſophy, <hi>When a Man cateth Corn with the Husk, and ſwalloweth down at leaſt a good quantity of the Husk or Bran, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Food that is mixed with it, doth the Husk become any Part of his Body? Or rather, doth it not belong to the excrement, with other groſs parts of the Food,</hi> ſaith he, p. 12. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page,</hi> 12.</note> by way of retortion, the Swine that feed on Husk only, and the Prodigal Son who did the like; if all went into excrement, and none into nouriſhment, what did they live on? He ſaith again, <hi>Is there not in all Food one more noble part that becometh not excrement, but is Tranſmuted into real Fleſh, in Man?</hi> But the Husk being not allowed by him to be the more noble part, I ask, What is Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into real Fleſh, where the Food is only Husk? Yet he ſo values himſelf upon his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious</hi> and <hi>Husky</hi> Philoſophy, that hence he further argues, <hi>Did not what our Saviour Eat, turn into his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

hath thus Changed the Soul, retaining the ſame Subſtance, can and will change the low Body of a Saint, and faſhion it like the Glorious Body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> As he miſapplies what was ſaid by <hi>Paul,</hi> of the Natural Body, to the Change or Transformation of the Soul; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do his Parallels hold: For the Soul that is Immortal, is of nearer affinity to Spiritual, than the Mortal which puts on Immortality, and the addition it receives of Beauty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do not Change its Subſtance: But what is this to the vile low or Corruptible Body, which is as diametrically oppoſit to Glorious and Eternal and Incorruptible, as any thing can be?

               <p>This indeed he would fain have us grant, and in the next Paragraph pretends to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, how a natural and Corruptible ſubſtance hath been Changed into a Spiritual one,</hi> he ſhould have added, <hi>and yet the ſubſtance not Changed,</hi> for that is the matter in debate, and whereupon <hi>C.

               <p>A ſecond thing I obſerve in that very Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, p. 14. is, that he cites <hi>Malice of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Agent,</hi> p. 17. which he aſſigns to <hi>G.

               <p>The Friend having ſhewed that <hi>G.

And how is Man in Scripture, called Corruptible Man?</q> See his p. 32. This <hi>G. Keith</hi> calls <hi>Wrangling and Quibling from his own groſs Miſunderſtanding of ſome places of Scripture</hi> [but he doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him better, though he adds] <hi>if he will take theſe Scriptures ſtrictly and litterally, he muſt as much contend againſt the Immortality of the Soul, as the Reſurrection of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. But why ſo? Doth <hi>G. Keith</hi> manifeſt wherein? Or give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proof that theſe Scriptures are not to be taken ſtrictly and litterally? Nothing leſs. They were pat and <hi>argumentum ad hominem</hi> to him, the enervating whereof he ſhifts by huf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing.

               <p>In p. 18. <hi>G. Keith</hi> makes a general Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to what <hi>C.

And upon the whole ſaith, he <hi>remains in the ſame Mind ſtill, that he would have nothing urged, nor preſſed as Articles of Faith, but what is delivered to us in plain expreſs Scripture Words, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is the Subſtance of that large Citation. Anſw.</hi> The Subſtance of that Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more comprehenſive than ſo, as who ſo pleaſe to read it in the Original cited above, may find, wherein he declares that Charity and makes thoſe Propoſals of Concord with the otherwiſe Minded, as ſuits not with his late Actions. Yet from what he hath here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93417:71"/>
as the Subſtance of that large Citation, the Friend Objects, p. 53. that <hi>this Advice could not find Place with</hi> G. Keith, <hi>when ſo often deſired,</hi> and queries, <q>What Uncharitableneſs is this, when we offer to expreſs our Faith in Scripture Words, for you to ſay, we have another Senſe than what we ſpeak, ſee his p. 54.</q> 
                  <hi>G. Keith</hi> makes Anſwer, <hi>It is falſe in him to ſay, that this was ſo often deſired, but could not find Place—I ſaid again and again, We ſhall take your Confeſſion in Scripture Words, provided ye will condemn your Errors, that are contrary to expreſs Scripture Words—But this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they would never do.</hi> And perhaps they held no ſuch Errors, as he charged them with, and ſo had none to condemn, ſay I: However this being true, that ſuch an offer was made by Friends, and thus replied to by him (which is ſo far from <hi>never refuſing,</hi> that it includeth a refuſal, in tying them to ſuch Terms, as no Innocent Man can comply with, without an implicit acknowledgment of Guilt) the next thing I obſerve is, that whereas his Opponent queried, <hi>How know ye that we have a Senſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture Words,</hi> G. Keith Anſwers, <hi>They have ſufficiently diſcovered it, not only by one or two unſound Expreſſions, but Multitudes of them, as their Letters, and Manuſcripts there, and the Printed Books here,</hi> ſufficiently prove. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Reference is wide enough: What is in their Letters and Manuſcripts there, we know not, nor are we like, for ought I ſee, though he hath long threatned us with them? Again, what Printed Books here, doth he mean? What
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93417:71"/>
is their Title? In what Page? Who the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? Surely he thinks his Credit is great, that the Reader muſt take all from him, upon truſt, without Examination. But at length he comes to one particular Caſe, by which we may give a gueſs of the reſt. It is <hi>in haec verba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We need go no further for a Proof</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than the moſt groſs and Antichriſtian Expreſſions and Sayings of</hi> Caleb Puſey <hi>himſelf, in this very Treatiſe, for whereas he hath plainly affirmed</hi> p. 15. ad finem, <hi>That</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>cannot be ſomething elſe than the Light, Power and Spirit within. Now can there be any thing more contrary to expreſs Scripture, than this Aſſertion: Was not</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>a real Man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily?—And is that Body, and that Soul, and that fulneſs nothing elſe but the Light within us? O abominable Non-ſenſe, and Perverſion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Scripture, and all true Reaſon! Anſ.</hi> By that Time I have given <hi>C. Puſey</hi> his Words, I doubt not but to make appear that <hi>G. Keith</hi> is a Man <hi>nullius fidei,</hi> not to be truſted: For this he calls a <hi>plain Affirmation,</hi> was but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or Deduction from what <hi>G. Keith</hi> had laid down, and no ways deſigned, as here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be both God and Man. <hi>C. Puſey,</hi> p. 15, 16. thus hath it, <q>Seing <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> implies, that the Light, Power and Spirit within, is Chriſt the only Mediator and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that ſo to aſſert is not to aſſert another Chriſt than <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> then ſurely <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> cannot be ſomething
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93417:72"/>
elſe than the Light, Power and Spirit within, becauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the ONLY Chriſt, Mediator and Saviour, and SO is the Light, Power and Spirit within acknowledged to be.</q> And if the ſame, then not any thing elſe. Thus far <hi>C. Puſey,</hi> now where is <hi>G. Keith</hi> his Inference? Where the <hi>Antichriſtianiſm?</hi> Where the <hi>abominable Non-ſenſe, Perverſion and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Scripture,</hi> &amp;c? Where doth the Friend deny him to be a real Man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, or that he is our Mediator and Saviour? Nay if applicable to either of them, it muſt be to <hi>G. Keith</hi> himſelf, whoſe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is; not to <hi>C. Puſey</hi> for citing it, and arguing from it <hi>ad hominem.</hi> He that will ſo palpably abuſe a Man to <hi>his Face,</hi> as I may ſo ſay, when Evidence ſo near to be produced, what will he do <hi>behind his back?</hi> But perhaps he thought every Reader would not ſcan it, and ſo it might have paſſed.</p>
               <p>From <hi>G. Keith</hi> his having in that Book of <hi>Truth's Defence</hi> urged, that nothing ſhould be preſſed as Articles of Faith, but what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in plain Expreſſions of Scripture Words, the Friend put ſeven Queries to him, from p. 56, to 59. wherein he demands expreſs Words of Scripture for ſeveral of <hi>G. Keith</hi> his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof <hi>G. Keith</hi> takes no notice (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the third Query, about the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pieces of Silver <hi>Abraham</hi> Purchaſed the Burying Place with, which I have remarked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſecond Head) but gives him ſix Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by way of Retortion.

upon his own theſis, whereby he ought to be bound, I may give an anſwer to his, which as ſtated, are not our Principles, but his own unfair deductions.</p>
               <p>He goes on, p 19. <hi>Though I remain ſtill in the ſame mind, that no Article of Faith ſhould</hi>

                  <hi>be urged, on any, but what is Contained in plain expreſs words of Scripture, or ſo agreeable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture, as the common ſenſe of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that hears Scripture words, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Yet I ſee not why I ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to expreſs Scripture words, in things that I require no man to own or believe, as Articles of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. And towards the bottom, <hi>For there are many things, both in my Book called</hi> Truth Advanced, <hi>and in many other of my Books, wherein I may poſſibly differ from others in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I leave them to their Liberty to diſſent, as I deſire to be left to my Liberty, to believe as I judge God hath perſuaded me. Anſwer,</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the additional Terms [ſo agreeable to expreſs Scripture, as common ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> wherein he is likely enough to make himſelf the Judge, what is and what is not ſo, I tell him, Of what kind many of his are, even with reſpect to Articles of Faith, hath in part been manifeſt, and have been Communicated in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of this my treatiſe; yet we deny him not a Liberty to diſſent, as perſuaded in himſelf, ſo long as his Diſſent affects himſelf only, and he is not quarrelſom with us, ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing us as <hi>Atheiſts, Sadducees, Sadducean Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> &amp;c. As he hath done, upon account of doctrines himſelf allows to be Articles of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93417:73"/>
Chriſtian Faith, yet therein hath run ſo wide from Scripture Terms and Expreſſions, as hath been ſhewed. But we would, if poſſible, hold him to his own rule, that if it be only ſafe to keep cloſe to Scripture words and expreſſions, he ſhould do it, at leaſt in Articles of Faith, of which that of the Reſurrection is one. And in as much as he urgeth upon us, p. 39. That Scripture (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15.) of being ready to give an anſwer of the reaſon of the hope that is in us, ſurely it cannot be amiſs in us to demand the like of him, as well as to ſhew the reaſon of our diſſent from him, where we find him incongruous and abſurd, as well as Unſcriptural.</p>

               <p>In his Book called, <hi>Help in time of need</hi> (Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1665.) he thus ſaith, <q>Away with the education of Youth at Univerſities and Colledges of Philoſophy, ſo called. I may ſay of them, which <hi>Luther</hi> ſtuck not to call them in his Day, that they are the <hi>ſtews of Antichriſt,</hi> p. 75. 76. Again, p. 76. 'And the Philoſophy, ſo called, which is taught them, is but meer <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Pedantry,</hi> which even I came to ſee,</q> when among them—And towards the bottom, <q>I certainly know the Human Wiſdom or Learning is one of the MAIN Bulwarks of Antichriſt againſt the Revelation, and ſetting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in the Earth, and becauſe this is ariſing, and ſhall riſe, down muſt the other go, and all who ſeek to uphold it, <hi>ſhall fall</hi> therewith.</q> Surely then <hi>G.

               <p>In his Book of <hi>Immediate Revelation</hi> (Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Anno.</hi> 1676.) he ſaith, <q>Then down ſhould all the PROUD, LORDING, LOFTY CLERGY, with their many degrees of DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTORSHIPS, LORDSHIPS and MASTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIPS, paſs, who being Strangers to the true knowledge—are vainly puffed up in

their Fleſhly minds, by the form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Letter, <hi>as I was my ſelf,</hi> whilſt among them, and thought all Men <hi>Idiots</hi> and <hi>Unlearned,</hi> who were not Skilled in that litteral knowledge; but the Lord, by his Grace, brought me to ſee the Vanity of all that knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 137.</q> 
                  <hi>But</hi> [now] <hi>it is happened unto</hi> [him] <hi>according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own Vomit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. And what God once brought him to ſee the Vanity of, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain become his Glory, ſo that he again thinks ſuch to be Idiots and Fools, who are not Skilled in that Pedantry himſelf formerly was (and of late is) vainly puffed up by, though if he will believe himſelf <hi>(Truths De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> P. 69.

                  <hi>G. Keith) that while ſo many pious and Learned Men are Judged to be found in this Nation, not only of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>but among the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93417:74"/>
Diſſenters and Non-Conformiſts, there are found</hi> ſo <hi>few among them all, that do imply their gifts to oppoſe ſuch</hi> Vile Errors, <hi>as are holdly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowedly promoted among a ſort an</hi> GANG <hi>of the People called Quakers, not only as bad as</hi> ANY <hi>Popery, but</hi> MUCH WORSE <hi>than the</hi> WORST <hi>of Popery, in divers reſpects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> What thoſe Principles of ours are, which he counts <hi>much worſe than the worſt of Peopery,</hi> he is ſo far from proving upon us (though he exclaims as virulently, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of Old, who ſaid, <hi>Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>help, This is the Man that teacheth all men every where, againſt the People, and the law, and this place,</hi> Act. 21. 28.) that he doth not ſo much as name them. The Papiſts Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, of Purgatory, of Invocation of Saints (which is at leaſt a tacit rejecting of Chriſts Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) and their deifying the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as the Saviour of Mankind, with attributes to God and Chriſt, are ſo bad in my Judgment, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are in his, that there need none <hi>worſe.</hi> And if our Principles had really been <hi>much worſe</hi> than the <hi>worſt</hi> of theſe, methinks his Pious and Learned Men (of all Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) ſhould not have been ſo ſupine theſe 40. Years, that they need now to be ſtirred up, to creep in at the Tail of an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> to do his Drudgery for him, and that ſuch an one, who not only makes ſuch poor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it, but (perhaps for 25. Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) hath defended us and our Principles againſt them, and particularly in his <hi>Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſs for Proteſtants,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1674. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93417:75"/>
to <hi>make it appear</hi> (as he gives out, in the Title-Page) <hi>that the Quakers are the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Proteſtants, becauſe</hi> (as he there ſaith) <hi>their Teſtimony agreeth with the Teſtimony of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Proteſtants, in the moſt weighty things,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas he denominateth us a <hi>gang,</hi> I would fain know what Gang he is of now? And I was going to put a harder Queſtion to him, what Gang he intends to be of next, but that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he cannot reſolve me, neither knowing his own Mind, nor who will truſt him. Yet by what follows, he bids fair for the Papiſts, as if he had an Aking Tooth after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am Confident,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if ſuch Antichriſtian Errors and Hereſies were but the</hi> TENTH PART <hi>ſo avowedly broached in the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any where elſe in Popiſh Countries, theſe eſteemed Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among them, would be more alarmed to oppoſe them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then moſt among Proteſtants do.</hi> There's a Box on the Ear for ſuch as will not be at his Beck. Methinks he rates his betters, as if he had got a Benefice already: But ſtay, <hi>Ad huc tua ſeges in herba eſt,</hi> he muſt learn more Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his Benefactors, if he expect Promotion, who, if he be thus malapert now, what will he be, when he hath caught the Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Now to make ſure Work of it, he labours yet further to incenſe the <hi>National Miniſters</hi> againſt us (and anon the <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> yet would fain Men ſhould think, <hi>It is farr from him to deſire the leaſt Sufferings to come on our Perſons or Eſtates,</hi> as he pretends in the next Page: But as the <hi>Dutchman</hi> ſays, <hi>Dit gaet zo verre als hy voeton heeft,</hi> it goes as far as it hath Legs to ſtand on) in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93417:75"/>
whereto, he layeth before them, <hi>That we have provoked ſuch as have differed from us, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſputes</hi> Viva voce, <hi>and have oft gloried over them, who refuſed to anſwer us, that their cauſe was Bad,</hi> &amp;c. He knows who hath ſaid, <hi>Deceit lurks in Generals:</hi> Wiſh he aſſign Time, Place and Perſon, perhaps he may be anſwered, for Circumſtances of things much vary the Caſe. They may have detracted us behind our backs <hi>Vivâ voce,</hi> they may have inſulted over us, when abſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with more that I might inſiſt on. But if he will accuſe, let him deſcend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; till then wonder not (Reader) that I reject ſuch Evidence. The Caſe with him, which Galls him, and makes him wince ſo, is that when he had defamed and falſly aſperſed us in Print, to which we anſwered by Print, we could not be drawn to quit that Defence, by a <hi>Vivâ voce</hi> debate, to which he had ſummoned us. Now not being gratified here, and we objecting the inequitableneſs of ſuch a procedure, the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of the Man (where of this preſent <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> is a ſufficient Indication) and the unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the time, with reſpect to the Publick Peace of the Nation, he burſts out into this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy, as if he deſigned that Men of all Ranks ſhould be let looſe upon us.</p>
               <p>In Order whereto he applies himſelf in the next Place to the <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> telling them, p. 41. <hi>It would be a commendable and praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>

                  <hi>thing, to enceurage ſuch a Practice throughout the Nation, that Men of true Piety and Solid Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might beallowed and countenanced to refute theſe vile and abominable Errors, of theſe chief Leaders
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93417:76"/>
and Teachers among the</hi> Quakers, <hi>at the end of their Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to give Order, that all ſuch Books of them called</hi> Quakers, <hi>as can readily be found (as great ſtore of ſuch there are,</hi> he ſaith) <hi>that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch vile and abominable Errors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and witneſſed againſt by publick Authority. Anſw.</hi> I doubt not but this Work would pleaſe him well, eſpecially if he might have an <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> place of it, whereby he might both gratifie his revenge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and alſo pick up ſome little income to help him againſt that <hi>ruine and want,</hi> which <hi>W. Penn</hi> his calling him <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> tended to <hi>expoſe</hi> him to, as himſelf complains, <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> p. 4. Yet two things I would put him in Mind of, firſt, that he even now Propoſed, that <hi>with what meaſure we have met to others, with the ſame to mete to us again.</hi> Would he have been willing to have been thus ſerved, by the Powers of this Nation, when he termed <hi>Prelacy a Limb of Antichriſt, and declared how he had vowed to God againſt it, which vow we have kept to</hi> (ſaith he to the <hi>Presbyterians) ye have ſhrunk from</hi> (ſee <hi>Help in time of need,</hi> p. 37, 39. Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665.) or by a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſtry and Magiſtracy, whoſe <hi>Form of Church Diſcipline, Order and Government,</hi> he hath repreſented <hi>(Ibid.</hi> p. 52.) <hi>nothing upon the Matter better than the Epiſcopal,</hi> as well as told a Preacher of that Communion, he was <hi>better skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Art of Railing (a black Art to be ſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>G. Keith, too familiar to the Tribe of Black Coats) than in the way of Diſputing (Way caſt up,</hi> p. 169.) Doth he think theſe are not reputed <hi>Vile Errors</hi> and Slanders by the Men of that way on which he hath thus reflected? And though perhaps he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93417:76"/>
would now turn both <hi>Coat</hi> and <hi>Colour,</hi> and no more talk thus ſawcily of <hi>black Art,</hi> and <hi>Tribe of black Coats,</hi> provided he might be Dignified with ſome Eccleſiaſtical Preferment; yet theſe are what he hath not yet <hi>retracted</hi> at leaſt in Publick, as well as that I from hence Appeal to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have been ſo ſerved himſelf, as he now animates others to ſerve us? The ſecond thing I would mind him of, is that this, however palliated by him, is <hi>Perſecution,</hi> for it excites the Magiſtrate, not only to ſuperviſe, but alſo SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESS, what he ſhall call <hi>vile and abominable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> of which it makes him <hi>Judge,</hi> which how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable it would be to the Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in general, to have their Books thus come under the Scrutiny, and be liable to be expoſed to the judicial cenſure of their Antagoniſts, I leave to them to conſider. Yet I think it is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the Buddings of Reformation, in any Age, were never due to ſuch Courſes, for it muſt ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate to be ſtill in the right, whether the Government be <hi>Papiſtical, Prelatical, Presbyterian, Indepenpent, Baptiſt,</hi> yea or <hi>Quakers,</hi> if that were ſuppoſeable, as well that it had been a ready way to have ſuppreffed the ſpreading of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> by <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> in the firſt Promulgation of the Goſpel, and of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bible ſince the Reformation from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, it not being to be doubted, but the Men <hi>then</hi> in Authority were as likely to brand thoſe Holy Writings, or the Tranſlations at leaſt, with as opprobrious Names, as <hi>G. Keith</hi> now beſtows upon us; and if they might have been allowed to be both <hi>Judge and Jury,</hi> no Queſtion but they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93417:77"/>
would have made quick diſpatch. But that a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Proteſtant (yea one who hath valued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Quaker, for 33 Years together, and hath not as yet renounced the Name) ſhould adviſe the preſent Powers (who have given us a larger and better founded Liberty, than in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reigns) to ſuppreſs the Religious Tracts of ſuch, whom he once reputed as Brethren, and whoſe Doctrines he defended againſt them as Orthodox, for ſo many Years together, is what I need not aggravate: It ſpeaks for it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the Occaſion of this Fury is ſoon explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>viz.</hi> After he had been litigous in <hi>America,</hi> he or ſome of his Agents Laboured to Tranſmit the difference hither, by ſending over ſeveral Contentious Books of <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s, which ſome Friends here, both deſiring <hi>G. Keith</hi> might be reſtored into Unity again, and himſelf come to ſee and acknowledge his Evil therein, and alſo to prevent that difference dilating it ſelf to the ſcandal of our Profeſſion, and the ſtumbling of the weak, bought up ſeveral of thoſe Books, and kept them from being diſperſed. This is what he calls giving LARGE MONEY (whom he compares us to, by the Expreſſion, is eaſie to gueſs) and this heats him to that degree, that he would fain irritate the National Clergy and Powers to diſturb our Meetings, as well as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Books, who then might Scribble and Scribble again, and never be peſtered with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that he is ſo clamorous againſt the ſecond Days Morning Meeting at <hi>London</hi> (to whom himſelf formerly (at ſome times) hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93417:77"/>
himſelf, when he had Books to Print, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, thoſe Books called <hi>Light of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation,</hi> were <hi>read</hi> and <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> there, as he confeſſeth, p. 5, and 22.) for he ſaith in his p. 3. <hi>They aſſume a Power to licenſe and approve of all Books that are to be Printed by any of their Party, and have approved this Book falſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a</hi> Modeſt Account, <hi>and all the late ſcandalous Books of</hi> Tho. Ellwood <hi>and</hi> John Penington <hi>come forth againſt me</hi> [Ay that's their crime, that they approve of Books, which detect him] <hi>and claim Authority over all other Meetings (the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps excepted) ending out their Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to all other Meetings, in all Parts of the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Shall Men of different perſwaſions from us be empowered to inſpect our Books, ſtamp their <hi>Cum Privilegio</hi> upon the one, and ſuppreſs the other; and ſhall not we, among our ſelves, have the Liberty to ſuperviſe what we can ſtand by, what not, before expoſed to the view and cenſure of Men otherwiſe Minded? He is willing we ſhould have the reproach, obloquy and Sufferings due (in his Judgment to <hi>vile and abominable Errors,</hi> while he reflects upon our care to prevent both the one and the other, by firſt ſuperviſing our own Books, our ſelves, that as what comes forth he would make to affect the whole Society, ſo it may be overlooked by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and approved Men of that Society. O unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man! Yet would he be ingenious, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by his own Example formerly, that it is not ſo much our Order, and Practice, as our Judgment relating to him and his late envious Pieces, under which he is ſo uneaſie, that he goes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:93417:78"/>

He adds, <hi>The which Meeting may be fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Conclave of</hi> Cardinals <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>but who is the Metropolitan at preſent, of this new erected Hierarchy at</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>is not certainly known, as whether</hi> W. Penn <hi>or</hi> G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> among the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are little beholden to <hi>G. Keith,</hi> to ſet them upon ſuch a VVork, which in us he upbraids as fitly comparable to the <hi>Roman Hierarchy:</hi> Surely their Piety and Learning might be better employed. To the reſt, I aſk him, when he knew us to have a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> among us; and if we had one now, whether it were likely he could be ſo ignorant, as not to know which of the two, it was, whether <hi>W. Penn</hi> or <hi>G. Whitehead:</hi> But <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath worded it <hi>cautiouſly,</hi> as well as <hi>malitiouſly;</hi> ſeeing what never was, can never he certainly known. Might he himſelf have been a Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, I doubt not but he would have been willing to have continued longer among us: For he cavilleth at what he <hi>(Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otrephes</hi> like) coveted for himſelf, and proveth quarrelſom becauſe we could not allow him, the preheminence he ſought after: For we have none ſuch among us, nor do we own any Head but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And now Reader, having traced the Man through his <hi>Contradictions,</hi> through his <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> through his <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> here expoſed, and having defended my Self and Friends from the <hi>empty Cavils</hi> of the Book under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I ſubmit the foregoing to thy Impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be weighed by thee in that Ballance, which giveth rightly to judge, both as a Man, and as a Chriſtian, and bid thee farewel.</p>
