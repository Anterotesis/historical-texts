         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE frequent and late dealings
you have had in the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Witches,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
of one that hath a very
particular Honour for you,
have brought you the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of some <hi>Considerations</hi> on the <hi>subject,</hi> which
<hi>though</hi> they are the careless and hasty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of a sitting or two, may yet, I hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
you some not unreasonable accounts
of the odd <hi>phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Fasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
and contribute to the <hi>Defence</hi> of the
Truth and certainly of Matters which you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49942:3"/>
               <hi>know</hi> by <hi>Experiments</hi> that could not <hi>deceive,</hi> in
spite of the <hi>little exceptions</hi> of those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to believe nothing in affairs of this
nature.</p>
            <p>And if any thing were to be much <hi>admired</hi> in
an <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Wonders,</hi> not onely of <hi>Nature</hi> (which
is a <hi>constant Prodigy</hi>) by of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi>
it would be to me matter of <hi>Astonishment,</hi>
that <hi>Men,</hi> otherwise <hi>witty</hi> and <hi>ingenious,</hi> are
fall'n into the conceit that there's <hi>no such thing</hi>
as a <hi>Witch</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> but that these are the
<hi>creatures</hi> of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> foster'd
by <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>design;</hi> which, comparing the
<hi>confidence</hi> of their <hi>disbelief</hi> with the <hi>evidence</hi>
of the <hi>things denied,</hi> and the <hi>weakness</hi> of their
<hi>grounds,</hi> would almost suggest, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are <hi>argument</hi> of what they <hi>deny:</hi> and
that so confident an Opinion could not be
held upon such inducements, but by some
kind of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Fascination</hi> in the <hi>Fancy.</hi>
And perhaps that <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> whose <hi>influences</hi>
they will not allow in Actions ascribed to
such Causes, hath a greater hand and interest
in their <hi>Proposition</hi> that they are aware of.
For that <hi>subtil</hi> Enemy of Mankind (since <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
will not permit him to mischief us
without our own <hi>concurrence</hi>) attempts that
by <hi>stratagem</hi> and <hi>artifice,</hi> which he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49942:3"/>
effect by <hi>open</hi> ways of acting; and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of all <hi>wiles</hi> depending upon their <hi>secrecy</hi>
and <hi>concealment,</hi> his <hi>influence</hi> is never more
<hi>dangerous</hi> than when his <hi>agency</hi> is least <hi>suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</hi>
In order therefore to the carrying on
the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>hidden designs</hi> he manageth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our Happiness, and our Souls, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect to advantage himself more, than
by insinuating a belief, <hi>That there is no such
thing as himself,</hi> but that <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi> make
<hi>Devils</hi> now, as they did <hi>Gods</hi> of old. Nor
can he ever draw the assent of men to so <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>
an assertion, while the <hi>standing sensible</hi>
evidences of his <hi>existence</hi> in his practices by
and upon his <hi>Instruments</hi> are not discredited
and removed.</p>
            <p>'Tis doubtless therefore the interest of
this <hi>Agent</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> to have the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the <hi>notion</hi> they have of him is but a
<hi>phantome</hi> and conceit; and in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
That the stories of <hi>Witches, Apparitions,</hi>
and indeed every thing that brings tidings of
another world, are but <hi>melancholick Dreams</hi>
and <hi>pious Romances,</hi> And when men are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
thus far, to think there are no <hi>diabolical
contracts</hi> or <hi>apparitions,</hi> their belief that there
are such <hi>Spirits,</hi> rests onely upon their <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Reverence</hi> to the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49942:4"/>
we have little reason to apprehend so great in
such assertors, as to command much from
their assent, especially in such things in which
they have <hi>corrupt interests</hi> against their <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
So that he that thinks there is no
<hi>Witch,</hi> believes a <hi>Devil gratis,</hi> or at least upon
such inducements which he is like to find
himself disposed to deny when he pleaseth.
And when men are arrived to this degree of
<hi>diffidence</hi> and <hi>infidelity,</hi> we are beholden to
them if they believe either <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Spirit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
of the <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Immortality</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi>
These things hang together in a <hi>Chain</hi> of
<hi>connexion,</hi> at least in these mens <hi>Hypothesis;</hi>
and 'tis but an happy chance if he that hath
lost <hi>one link</hi> hold another. So that the vitals
of Religion being so much interressed in this
subject, it will not be impertinent particularly
to discourse it.</p>
            <p>And in order to the proof that there have
been, and are <hi>unlawfull confederacies</hi> with <hi>evil
spirits,</hi> by vertue of which the <hi>hellish accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices</hi>
perform things above their natural
powers; I must premise, that this being <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>Fact,</hi> is only capable of the evidence of
<hi>authority</hi> and <hi>sense:</hi> And by both these, the
being of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>diabolical contracts,</hi> is
most abundantly confirm'd. All <hi>Histories</hi> are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49942:4"/>
full of the exploits of those <hi>Instruments</hi> of
<hi>darkness,</hi> and the <hi>tesimony</hi> of all <hi>Ages,</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi> but of the most
<hi>civiliz'd</hi> and <hi>polish'd</hi> world, brings tidings of
their strange performances. We have the <hi>atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi>
of thousands of eye and ear-witnesses,
and those not of the easily deceivable vulgar
onely, but of wise and grave discerners, and
that when no interest could oblige them to
agree together in a common <hi>Lie:</hi> I say, we
have the light of all these <hi>circumstances</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
us in the belief of things done by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of despicable power and knowledge,
beyond the reach of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>ordinary Nature;</hi>
standing publick <hi>Records</hi> have been kept of
these well attested Relations, and <hi>Epocha</hi>'s
made of those unwonted events. Laws in
many Nations have been enacted against
those vile practises; <hi>those</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> and
our <hi>own</hi> are <hi>notorious;</hi> such cases have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
determined near us, by <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>reverend
Iudges,</hi> upon clear and convictive evidence:
and thousands in our own Nation have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
death for their <hi>vile compacts</hi> with <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
spirits.</hi> All these I might largely prove
in their particular instances, but that 'tis not
needful, since those that deny the being of
<hi>Witches,</hi> do it not out of ignorance of these
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49942:5"/>
Heads of Argument, of which probably
they have heard a thousand times, but from
an <hi>apprehension</hi> that such a <hi>belief is absurd,</hi> and
the things <hi>impossible.</hi> And upon these presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they contemn all demonstrations of
this nature, and are hardned against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.
And I think, those that can believe
all <hi>Histories</hi> are <hi>Romances</hi> that all the <hi>wiser</hi>
world have agreed together to <hi>juggle</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
into a common belief of <hi>ungrounded fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
that the <hi>sound senses</hi> of <hi>multitudes</hi> together
may deceive them, and <hi>Laws</hi> are built upon
<hi>Chymera's;</hi> that the <hi>gravest</hi> and <hi>wisest Iudges</hi>
have been <hi>Murderers,</hi> and the <hi>sagest</hi> persons
<hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>designing Impostors:</hi> I say, those that
can believe this <hi>heap</hi> of absurdities, are either
more <hi>credulous</hi> than those whose <hi>credulity</hi> they
reprehend, or else have some <hi>extraordinary
evidence</hi> of their perswasion, <hi>viz. That 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and impossible there should be a Witch or Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition.</hi>
And I am confident, were those <hi>little
appearances</hi> remov'd, which men have form'd
in their fancies against the <hi>belief</hi> of such
things, their <hi>evidence</hi> would make its way to
their <hi>assent,</hi> without any more arguments
than what they know already to enforce it.
There is nothing then necessary to be done,
in order to the establishing the belief I would
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49942:5"/>
reconcile to men's minds, but to endeavour
the removal of those prejudices they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
against it, the chief of which I shall
particularly deal with; and I begin with that
<hi>bold Assertion,</hi> That</p>
            <p>(1) The <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>impossible</hi>
and <hi>contradictious,</hi> and consequently so is that of
<hi>Witches,</hi> the belief of which is founded on that
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>Objection</hi> I <hi>answer,</hi> (1) If the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of a <hi>Spirit</hi> be so <hi>absurd</hi> as is pretended, that
of a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Soul, distinct</hi> from <hi>matter</hi> and
<hi>immortal,</hi> is likewise an <hi>absurdity.</hi> And then
that the world was <hi>jumbled</hi> into this <hi>elegant</hi>
and <hi>orderly Fabrick</hi> by <hi>chance;</hi> and that our
<hi>Souls</hi> are onely <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> that came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
we know not <hi>whence,</hi> nor <hi>how;</hi> and
shall again shortly be <hi>dissolv'd</hi> into those <hi>loose
Atoms</hi> that <hi>compound</hi> them; That all our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
are but the <hi>thrusting</hi> of one part of
<hi>matter</hi> against another; and the <hi>Idea's</hi> of our
minds meer <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>casual motions;</hi> These
and a thousand more the grossest <hi>impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>absurdities,</hi> consequents of this <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
That the notion of a</hi> Spirit <hi>is absurd,</hi> will
be <hi>sad certainties</hi> and <hi>demonstrations.</hi> And with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49942:6"/>
such Assertors I would cease to discourse about
<hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and address my self to
obtain their assent to truths infinitely more
Sacred.</p>
            <p>And yet (2) though it should be granted
them, that a <hi>substance immaterial</hi> is as much a
<hi>contradiction</hi> as they can fancy; yet the <hi>Air</hi> and
all the <hi>Regions</hi> above us may have their <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intellectual Agents,</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> like unto our
<hi>Souls,</hi> be <hi>that</hi> what it will; and some of them
at least as much <hi>degenerate</hi> as the <hi>vilest</hi> and
most <hi>mischievous</hi> among <hi>Men.</hi> This, I say,
may reasonably enough be supposed, though,
as I intimated above, the <hi>Atheist</hi> hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>chain</hi> of <hi>consequences.</hi> And this <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
will be enough to secure the <hi>possibility</hi> of
<hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions:</hi> and that all the <hi>upper
Stories</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi> are furnish'd with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,</hi>
'tis infinitely reasonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the <hi>analogy</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> Since we see
there is nothing so contemptible and vile in
the world we reside in, but hath its living
creatures that dwell upon it; the <hi>Earth,</hi> the
<hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>inferiour Air;</hi> the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi>
the <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>skin,</hi> the <hi>entrails;</hi> the <hi>leaves,</hi> the
<hi>roots,</hi> the <hi>stalks</hi> of <hi>Vegetables;</hi> yea and all kind
of <hi>Minerals</hi> in the <hi>subterraneous Regions:</hi> I say,
all these have their <hi>proper Inhabitants;</hi> yea, I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49942:6"/>
suppose this Rule may hold in all distinct
kinds of bodies in the world, That they have
their <hi>peculiar Animals.</hi> The certainty of which
I believe the improvement of <hi>microscopical obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
will discover. From whence I infer,
That since this little <hi>spot</hi> is so <hi>thickly peopled</hi> in
every <hi>Atom</hi> of it, 'tis weakness to think that
all the <hi>vast spaces</hi> above, and <hi>hollows</hi> under
ground, are <hi>desert</hi> and <hi>uninhabited.</hi> And if both
the <hi>superiour</hi> and <hi>lower Continents</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi>
have their inhabitants also, 'tis exceedingly
<hi>improbable,</hi> arguing from the same <hi>analogy,</hi> that
they are all of the meer <hi>sensible nature,</hi> but that
there are at least some of the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>
Orders. Which supposed, there is good
foundation for the belief of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
though the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> should prove
<hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unphilosophical.</hi> And so this first Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
comes to nothing. I descend then to
the second <hi>Prejudice,</hi> which may be thus form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in behalf of the <hi>Objectors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) There are <hi>Actions</hi> in most of those <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
ascribed to <hi>Witches,</hi> which are <hi>ridiculous</hi> and
<hi>impossible</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>things;</hi> such are
(1) their <hi>flying</hi> out of <hi>windows,</hi> after they have
annointed themselves, to remote places. (2) Their
<hi>transformation</hi> into Cats, Hares, and other <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
(3) Their <hi>feeling</hi> all the <hi>hurts</hi> in their own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49942:7"/>
               <hi>bodies</hi> which they have received in <hi>these.</hi> (4) Their
<hi>rasing Tempests,</hi> by muttering some nonsensical
words, or performing some little ridiculous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
And (5) their being <hi>suck'd</hi> in a certain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
place of their <hi>bodies</hi> by a <hi>Familiar.</hi> These
are presumed to be actions inconsistent with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Spirits,</hi> and above the powers of those poor
and miserable Agents. And therefore the <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
supposeth them performed only by the <hi>fancy;</hi> and
that the whole <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is but an
<hi>illusion</hi> of <hi>crasie imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this <hi>Objection</hi> I return, (1) in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
The more <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unaccountable</hi> these
actions <hi>seem,</hi> the greater <hi>confirmations</hi> are they
to me of the <hi>truth</hi> of those <hi>Relations,</hi> and the
<hi>reality</hi> of what the <hi>Objectors</hi> would destroy. For
these circumstances being exceeding <hi>unlikely,</hi>
judging by the measures of common belief,
'tis the greater probability they are not <hi>fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi>
For the <hi>contrivers</hi> of <hi>Fictions</hi> use to form
them as near as they can conformably to the
most <hi>unsuspected realities,</hi> endeavouring to make
them look as <hi>like truth</hi> as is possible in the main
<hi>supposals,</hi> though withal they make them
strange in the <hi>circumstance.</hi> None but a fool
or mad-man would relate with a purpose of
having it believed, that he saw in <hi>Ireland, Men</hi>
with <hi>hoofs</hi> on their <hi>heads,</hi> and <hi>eyes</hi> in their <hi>poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49942:7"/>
or, if any should be so ridiculously vain,
as to be serious in such an <hi>incredible Romance,</hi>
it cannot be supposed that all <hi>Travellers</hi> that
come into those parts after him should tell
the same story. There is large <hi>field</hi> in <hi>fiction;</hi>
and if all those <hi>Relations</hi> were <hi>arbitrary composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
doubtless the first <hi>Romancers</hi> would have
framed them more agreeable to the common
doctrine of <hi>Spirits;</hi> at least, after these <hi>supposed
absurdities</hi> had been a thousand times laugh'd
at, people by this time would have learn'd to
correct those <hi>obnoxious extravagancies;</hi> and
though they have not yet more <hi>veracity</hi> than
the Ages of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> yet one
would expect they should have got more <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
This suppos'd <hi>impossibility</hi> then of these
performances, seems to me a <hi>probable argument</hi>
that they are not wilful and designed forgeries.
And if they are <hi>Phancyes,</hi> 'tis somewhat strange
that <hi>Imagination</hi> which is the most <hi>various thing</hi>
in all the <hi>world,</hi> should infinitely repeat he
same <hi>conceit</hi> in all times and places.</p>
            <p>But again (2) the <hi>strange Actions</hi> related of
<hi>Witches,</hi> and presumed <hi>impossible,</hi> are not ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to their own powers; but to the Agency
of those <hi>wicked Confederates</hi> they imploy: And
to affirm that those <hi>evil spirits</hi> cannot do that
which we conceit <hi>impossible,</hi> is boldly to stint
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49942:8"/>
the powers of Creatures, whose natures
and faculties we know not, and to measure
the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>spirits</hi> by the <hi>narrow</hi> rules of our
own <hi>impotent beings.</hi> Wee see among our selves
the performances of <hi>some</hi> out-go the <hi>conceits</hi>
and <hi>possibilities</hi> of <hi>others;</hi> and we know many
things may be done by the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and
<hi>Mechanick Artifice,</hi> which common heads think
<hi>impossible</hi> to be effected by the <hi>honest</hi> ways of
<hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> And doubtless the <hi>subtilties</hi>
and <hi>powers</hi> of those <hi>mischievous Fiends</hi> are as
much beyond the <hi>reach</hi> and <hi>activities</hi> of the
most <hi>knowing Agents</hi> among us, as theirs are
beyond the wit and ability of the most <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi>
and <hi>illiterate;</hi> So that the utmost that any
man's reason in the world can amount to in
this particular, is onely this, that he cannot
<hi>conceive</hi> how such things can be performed;
which onely argues the <hi>weakness</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of our <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>apprehensions,</hi> not
the <hi>impossibility</hi> of those performances; and
we can no more from hence form an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against <hi>them,</hi> then against the most <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
effects</hi> in <hi>Nature.</hi> We cannot conceive
how the <hi>Faetus</hi> is <hi>form'd</hi> in the <hi>womb,</hi> nor as
much as how a <hi>Plant</hi> springs from the <hi>Earth</hi>
we tread on; we know not how our <hi>Souls</hi>
move the <hi>Body,</hi> nor how these <hi>distant</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49942:8"/>
               <hi>extreme natures</hi> and <hi>united;</hi> And if we are <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
of the most <hi>obvious</hi> things about us, and
the most <hi>considerable within</hi> our selves, 'tis then
no wonder that we know not the <hi>constitution</hi>
and <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> to whom we are
such strangers. Briefly then, <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi>
well proved ought not to be <hi>denied,</hi> because we
cannot <hi>conceive</hi> how they can be <hi>perform'd.</hi>
Nor is it a reasonable method of inference, first
to <hi>presume</hi> the thing <hi>impossible,</hi> and thence
to conclude that the <hi>fact</hi> cannot be <hi>proved.</hi>
On the contrary, we should judge of the
<hi>action</hi> hy the <hi>evidence,</hi> and not the <hi>evidence</hi>
by the <hi>measures</hi> of our <hi>fancies</hi> about the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
This is proudly to exalt our own <hi>opinions</hi>
above the <hi>clearest testimonies,</hi> and most <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demonstrations</hi> of <hi>fact:</hi> and so to give the
<hi>Lie</hi> to all <hi>Mankind,</hi> rather then distrust the
little <hi>conceits</hi> of our <hi>bold imaginations.</hi> But yet
further,</p>
            <p>(3.) I think there is nothing in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
mention'd, but what may as well be
accounted for the Rules of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
as the ordinary affairs of <hi>Nature.</hi> For
in resolving <hi>natural Phaenomena,</hi> we can only
assign the <hi>probable causes,</hi> shewing how things
<hi>may be,</hi> not presuming how they <hi>are.</hi> And in
the particulars under our <hi>Examen,</hi> we may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49942:9"/>
give an account how 'tis <hi>possible,</hi> and not
<hi>unlikely,</hi> that such things (though somewhat
varying from the common <hi>rode</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>)
may be acted. And if our narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
minds can furnish us with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the way and manner of such perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
though perhaps not the true ones, 'tis
an argument that such things may be effected
by creatures, whose powers and knowledge
are so vastly exceeding ours. I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
therefore briefly to suggest some things
that may render the <hi>possibility</hi> of these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
<hi>conceivable,</hi> in order to the removal
of this <hi>Objection,</hi> that they are <hi>contradictions</hi>
and <hi>impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>First</hi> then, That the <hi>confederate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
should <hi>transport</hi> the <hi>Witch</hi> through the Air
to the place of general <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> there is
no difficulty in conceiving; and if that be
true which great Philosophers affirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the real <hi>separability</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> from
the <hi>Body</hi> without <hi>death,</hi> there is yet <hi>less;</hi> for
then 'tis easie to apprehend, that the <hi>Soul,</hi>
having left its gross and <hi>sluggish Body</hi> behind it,
and being cloath'd only with its <hi>immediate
vehicle</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> or more <hi>subtile matter,</hi> may be
quickly conducted to any place it would be
at, by those <hi>officious Spirits</hi> that attend it.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49942:9"/>
And though I adventure to affirm nothing
concerning the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> of this <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
yet I must needs say, it doth not seem to
me <hi>unreasonable.</hi> And our experience of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies,
Epilepsies, Extasies,</hi> and the strange
things men report to have seen during those
<hi>deliquiums,</hi> look <hi>favourably</hi> upon this <hi>conjecture;</hi>
which seems to me to contradict no <hi>principle</hi>
of <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Philosophy,</hi> since <hi>Death</hi> consists
not so much in the <hi>actual separation</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body,</hi> as in the <hi>indisposition</hi> and <hi>unfitness</hi> of the
<hi>Body</hi> for <hi>vital union,</hi> as an excellent Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
hath made good. On which <hi>Hypothesis,</hi>
the <hi>Witches annointing</hi> her self before she takes
her flight, may perhaps serve to keep the Body
<hi>tenantable</hi> &amp; in fit <hi>disposition</hi> to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi>
at its return. These things, I say, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
though I affirm nothing about them;
and there is nothing in such <hi>conceptions</hi> but
what hath been affirm'd by men of worth
and name, and may seem <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>accountable</hi>
enough to those who judge nor altogether
by the measures of the <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>customary
opinion.</hi> And there's a saying of a great <hi>Apostle</hi>
that seems to countenance this <hi>Platonick opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
what is the meaning else of that expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
[<hi>Whether in the body or out of the body I cannot
tell</hi>] except the <hi>Soul</hi> may be <hi>separated</hi> from the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49942:10"/>
               <hi>Body</hi> without <hi>death;</hi> which if it be granted
<hi>possible,</hi> 'tis sufficient for my purpose. And</p>
            <p>(2) The <hi>Transformations</hi> of <hi>Witches</hi> into the
<hi>shapes</hi> of other <hi>Animals,</hi> upon the same <hi>supposal</hi>
is very <hi>conceivable,</hi> since then 'tis easie enough
to imagin, that the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>imagination</hi> may
form those <hi>passive</hi> and <hi>pliable vehicles</hi> into those
<hi>shapes,</hi> with more ease then the <hi>fancie</hi> of the
<hi>Mother</hi> can the stubborn <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi>
in the womb, as we see it frequently doth in
the instances that occur of <hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Singularities;</hi> And perhaps sometimes
the <hi>confederate Spirit</hi> puts <hi>tricks</hi> upon the <hi>senses</hi>
of the <hi>spectators,</hi> and those <hi>shapes</hi> are onely
<hi>illusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then (3) when they feel the <hi>hurts</hi> in
their <hi>gross</hi> bodies, that they receive in their <hi>aëry
vehicles,</hi> they must be supposed to have been
<hi>really</hi> present, at least in these latter; and 'tis
no more difficult to apprehend how the hurts
of <hi>those</hi> should be translated upon their <hi>other
bodies,</hi> then how <hi>diseases</hi> should be <hi>inflicted</hi> by
the <hi>imagination,</hi> or how the <hi>fancy</hi> of the <hi>Mother</hi>
should wound the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as several credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
do attest.</p>
            <p>And (4) for their <hi>raising storms</hi> and <hi>tempests,</hi>
they do it not, be sure, by their <hi>own,</hi> but by the
<hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> their <hi>friend</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49942:10"/>
               <hi>allie;</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that are injoin'd them,
are doubtless nothing else but <hi>entertainments</hi>
for their <hi>imaginations,</hi> and are likely design'd to
persuade them, that <hi>they do</hi> these strange things
<hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (lastly) for their being <hi>suck'd</hi> by the
<hi>Familiar,</hi> I say (1) we know so little of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Daemons</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> that 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we cannot certainly divine the reason of
so strange an action. And yet (2) we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
at some things that may render it less
<hi>imporbable.</hi> For some have thought that the
<hi>Genii</hi> (whom both the <hi>Platonical</hi> and <hi>Christian
Antiquity</hi> thought <hi>embodied</hi>) are recreated by the
<hi>reeks</hi> and <hi>vapours</hi> of <hi>humane bloud</hi> and the <hi>spirits</hi>
that derive from them. Which supposal (if
we grant them bodies) is not unlikely, every
thing being <hi>refresh'd</hi> and <hi>nourish'd</hi> by its like.
And that they are not perfectly <hi>abstract</hi> from
all <hi>body</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> besides the reverence we
owe to the wisest antiquity, there are several
considerable arguments I could alledge to
render it exceeding probable. Which things
supposed, the <hi>Devil's sucking</hi> the <hi>Sorceress</hi> is no
great wonder, nor difficult to be accounted
for. Or perhaps (3) this may be onely a <hi>diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Sacrament</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi> to confirm the
<hi>hellish covenant.</hi> To which I adde, (4) That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49942:11"/>
which to me seems most <hi>probable, viz.</hi> Tha
the <hi>Familiar</hi> doth not onely <hi>suck</hi> the <hi>Witch,</hi>
but in the action infuseth some <hi>poisonous
ferment</hi> into her, which gives her <hi>imagination</hi>
and <hi>spirits</hi> a <hi>magical tincture,</hi> whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>mischievously influential:</hi> and the word
<hi>venefica</hi> intimates some such matter. Now
that the <hi>imagination</hi> hath a mighty power in
<hi>operation,</hi> is seen in the just now mention'd
<hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi> that it causeth; and
that the <hi>fancy</hi> is <hi>modified</hi> by the <hi>qualities</hi> of th
<hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>spirits,</hi> is too evident to need proof:
which things supposed, 'tis plain to conceive
that the <hi>evil spirit</hi> having <hi>breath'd</hi> some <hi>vile
vapour</hi> into the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Witch,</hi> it may <hi>taint</hi>
her <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>spirits</hi> with a <hi>noxious quality,</hi> by
which her <hi>infected imagination,</hi> heightned by
<hi>melancholy,</hi> and this <hi>worse cause,</hi> may do much
hurt upon <hi>bodies</hi> that are <hi>impressive</hi> by such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</hi>
And 'tis very likely that this <hi>ferment</hi>
disposeth the <hi>imagination</hi> of the <hi>Sorceress</hi> to
cause the mentioned <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>separation</hi> of
the <hi>soul</hi> from the <hi>body,</hi> and may perhaps keep
the <hi>body</hi> in fit temper for <hi>its re-entry;</hi> as also it
may facilitate <hi>transformation,</hi> which, it may
be, could not be effected by <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assisted
imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see 'tis not so desperate to form an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49942:11"/>
apprehension of the manner of these odde
performances; and though they are not done
the way I have describ'd, yet what I have said
may help us to a conceit of the possibility,
which sufficeth for my purpose. And though
the Hypothesis I have gone upon will seem as
unlikely to some, as the things they attempt to
explain are to others, yet I must desire their
leave to suggest, that most things seem <hi>unlikely</hi>
(especially to the <hi>conceited</hi> and <hi>opinionative)</hi> at
first <hi>proposal;</hi> and many great <hi>truths</hi> are <hi>strange</hi>
and <hi>improbable,</hi> till <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>acquaintance</hi> have
reconciled them to our <hi>fancies.</hi> And I'le pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to adde on this occasion, (though I love
not to be <hi>confident</hi> in <hi>affirming</hi>) that there is
none of the <hi>Platonical supposals</hi> I have used, but
what I could make appear to be <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
to the capable and unprejudic'd.</p>
            <p>But I come (3) to another <hi>prejudice</hi> against
the being of <hi>Witches,</hi> which is, That 'tis very
improbable that the <hi>Devil</hi> who is a <hi>wise</hi> and
<hi>mighty spirit,</hi> should be at the beck of a poor
<hi>Hag,</hi> and have so little to do as to attend the
errands of the <hi>impotent lusts</hi> of a <hi>silly old woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I might answer, (1) That 'tis
much more <hi>improbable</hi> that all the <hi>world</hi> should
be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> and circumstances
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49942:12"/>
of the clearest evidence and conviction, than
that the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is <hi>wicked,</hi> should be also
<hi>unwise;</hi> and that he that persuades all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and accomplices out of their wits, should
himself act like his own temptations and
persuasions. In brief, there is nothing more
strange in this objection, than that <hi>wickedness</hi>
is <hi>baseness</hi> and <hi>servility,</hi> and that the <hi>Devil</hi> is at
leisure to serve those he is at leisure to tempt,
and industrious to ruin. And again, (2) I see
no <hi>necessity</hi> to believe that the <hi>Devil</hi> is always
the <hi>Witch's confederate;</hi> but perhaps it may fitly
be consider'd, whether the <hi>Familiar</hi> be not
some <hi>departed humane spirit,</hi> forsaken of God
and goodness, and swallowed up by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
desire of mischief and revenge, which
possibly by the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of its <hi>state</hi> it
cannot execute <hi>immediately.</hi> And why we
should presume that the <hi>Devil</hi> should have
the liberty of wandering up and down the
Earth and Air, when he is said to be <hi>held</hi> in
the <hi>chains</hi> of <hi>darkness;</hi> and yet that the <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
souls</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> of whom no such thing
is affirm'd in any <hi>Sacred Record,</hi> should be
thought so <hi>imprison'd,</hi> that they cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wag from the place of their <hi>confinement,</hi>
I know no shadow of conjecture. This <hi>conceit</hi>
I'm confident hath prejudic'd many against
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49942:12"/>
the belief of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> they not
being able to conceive that the <hi>Devil</hi> should
be so <hi>ludricous</hi> as <hi>appearing spirits</hi> are sometimes
reported to be in their <hi>frolicks;</hi> and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
that <hi>souls departed</hi> never <hi>re-visit</hi> the <hi>free</hi>
and <hi>open Regions;</hi> which confidence I know
nothing to justifie: For since <hi>good</hi> men in their
<hi>state</hi> of <hi>separation</hi> are said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, why the
<hi>wicked</hi> may not be supposed to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
the worst sense of the word, I know nothing
to help me to imagine. And if it be supposed
that the <hi>Imps</hi> of <hi>Witches</hi> are sometimes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>spirits</hi> of our <hi>own kind</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
the <hi>same</hi> that have been <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and
<hi>Witches</hi> in this life: This supposal may give
a fairer and more probable account of many
of the actions of <hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> than
the other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that they are always <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi>
And to this conjecture I'l adventure to
subjoyn another, which also hath its <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
viz.</hi> (3) That 'tis not impossible but that
the <hi>Familiars</hi> of <hi>Witches</hi> are a <hi>servile</hi> kind of
<hi>spirits,</hi> of a very <hi>inferiour</hi> constitution and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and none of those that were once of the
highest <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> now degenerated into the
spirits we call <hi>Devils.</hi> And for my part I must
confess, that I think the common <hi>division</hi> of
<hi>spirits</hi> much too <hi>general,</hi> conceiving it likely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49942:13"/>
there may be as great a <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Intellectual</hi>
creatures in the <hi>invisible</hi> world, as there is of
<hi>Animals</hi> in the <hi>visible:</hi> and that all the <hi>superiour,</hi>
yea, and <hi>inferiour</hi> Regions, have their several
kinds of <hi>spirits,</hi> differing in their <hi>natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
as well as in the <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of
their <hi>depravities;</hi> which being supposed, 'tis
very probable that those of the <hi>basest</hi> and <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Orders are they, who submit to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<hi>servilities.</hi> And thus the <hi>sagess</hi> and <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi>
of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> need not be
brought into question.</p>
            <p>But (4) the opinion of <hi>Witches</hi> seems to
some to accuse <hi>Providence,</hi> and to suggest that
it hath exposed <hi>Innocents</hi> to the <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>malice</hi>
of <hi>revengeful Fiends;</hi> yea, and supposeth <hi>those</hi>
most <hi>obnoxious,</hi> for whom we might most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect a more special <hi>tutelary</hi> care and
protection, most of the cruel practices of those
presum'd <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> being upon <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
who as they least deserve to be deserted
by that <hi>Providence</hi> that <hi>superintends</hi> all things, so
they most need its <hi>guardian influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this so specious an <hi>Objection</hi> I have these
things to answer. (1) <hi>Providence</hi> is a <hi>Deep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable;</hi>
and if we should not believe the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49942:13"/>
               <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of our <hi>senses,</hi> before we can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to our <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> we must
be groffer <hi>Scepticks</hi> than ever yet was extant.
The <hi>miseries</hi> of the <hi>present life,</hi> the <hi>unequal distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions</hi>
of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> the <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the greatest part of mankind, the <hi>fatal
disadvantages</hi> we are all under, and the <hi>hazard</hi>
we run of being eternally miserable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
these, I say, are things that can hardly
be made <hi>consistent</hi> with that <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
that we are sure hath <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> it
self with all things. And yet we believe there
is a <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>harmony,</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> in that
<hi>Providence,</hi> though we cannot <hi>unriddle</hi> it in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
instances;</hi> nor, by reason of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and imperfection, clear it from <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
appearances;</hi> and consequently, we ought
not to deny the being of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
because they will create us some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in our <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>Providence.</hi> But to come
more close, (2) Those that believe that <hi>Infants</hi>
are <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> &amp; <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> as soon
as they are <hi>disclosed</hi> to the world, cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
offer such an objection; for what is a
little <hi>trifling pain</hi> of a moment, to those <hi>eternal
tortures,</hi> to which, if they <hi>die as soon</hi> as they are
<hi>born,</hi> according to the tenour of this Doctrin,
they are <hi>everlastingly exposed?</hi> But however the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49942:14"/>
case stands as to <hi>that,</hi> 'tis certain, (3) That
<hi>Providence</hi> hath not secur'd them from other
<hi>violences</hi> they are obnoxious to from <hi>cruelty</hi>
and <hi>accident;</hi> and yet we accuse <hi>It</hi> not when a
whole Townful of <hi>Innocents</hi> fall a <hi>Victim</hi> to the
<hi>rage</hi> and <hi>ferity</hi> of <hi>barbarous executioners</hi> in wars
and <hi>Massacres.</hi> To which I adde, (4) That 'tis
likely the <hi>mischief</hi> is not so often done by the
<hi>evil spirit immediately,</hi> but by the <hi>malignant</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the <hi>Sorceress,</hi> whose <hi>power</hi> of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consists in the fore-mention'd <hi>ferment,</hi>
which is <hi>infused</hi> into her by the <hi>Familiar.</hi> So
that I am apt to think there may be a <hi>power</hi> of
<hi>real fascination</hi> in the <hi>Witch's eyes</hi> and <hi>imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
by which for the most part she acts upon
<hi>tender</hi> bodies. <hi>Nescio quis teneros oculus</hi>—For
the <hi>pestilential spirits</hi> being darted by a
<hi>sprightful</hi> and <hi>vigorous imagination</hi> from the <hi>eye,</hi>
and meeting with <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>passive</hi>
in the bodies which they enter, will not fail to
<hi>infect</hi> them with a <hi>noxious quality,</hi> that makes
<hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>strange alterations</hi> in the person
invaded by this <hi>poysonous influence:</hi> which way
of acting by <hi>subtil</hi> and <hi>invisible instruments</hi> is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
and <hi>familiar</hi> in all natural <hi>efficiencies.</hi>
And 'tis now past question, that <hi>nature</hi> for the
most part acts by <hi>subtil streams</hi> and <hi>aporhaea</hi>'s of
<hi>minute particles,</hi> which pass from one body to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49942:14"/>
another. Or however that be, this kind of <hi>agency</hi>
is as <hi>conceivable</hi> as any of those <hi>qualities igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
hath call'd <hi>sympathy</hi> and <hi>antipathy,</hi> the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of which we <hi>doubt</hi> not, though the <hi>manner</hi>
of <hi>action</hi> be <hi>unknown.</hi> Yea, the thing I speak of
is as easie to be apprehended, as how <hi>infection</hi>
should pass in certain <hi>tenuious streams</hi> through
the <hi>air</hi> from one house to another; or, as how
the <hi>biting</hi> of a <hi>mad Dog</hi> should fill all the <hi>bloud</hi>
and <hi>spirits</hi> with a <hi>venomous</hi> and <hi>malign ferment;</hi>
the application of the <hi>vertue</hi> doing the same
in our case, as <hi>that</hi> of <hi>contract</hi> doth in <hi>this.</hi> Yea,
some kinds of <hi>fascination</hi> are perform'd in this
grosser and more sensible way, as by <hi>striking,</hi>
giving <hi>Apples,</hi> and the like, by which the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
quality</hi> may be transmitted, as we see
<hi>diseases</hi> often are by the <hi>touch.</hi> Now in this way
of conjecture, a good account may be given
why <hi>Witches</hi> are most <hi>powerful</hi> upon <hi>Children</hi> &amp;
<hi>timorous</hi> persons, <hi>viz.</hi> because their <hi>spirits</hi> and
<hi>imaginations</hi> being <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>passive,</hi> are not able
to resist the <hi>fatal invasion;</hi> whereas men of <hi>bold</hi>
minds, who have plenty of <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vigorous
spirits</hi> are secure from the <hi>contagion,</hi> as in <hi>pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential
Airs clean</hi> bodies are not so liable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as are other tempers. Thus then we
see 'tis likely enough that very often the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceress</hi>
her self doth the <hi>mischief;</hi> and we know,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49942:15"/>
               <hi>de facto,</hi> that <hi>Providence</hi> doth not always secure
us from one another's <hi>injuries.</hi> And yet I must
confess, that many times also the evil <hi>spirit</hi> is
the <hi>mischievous Agent;</hi> though this confession
draw on me another objection, which I next
propose.</p>
            <p>(5) Then it may be said, that if <hi>wicked spirits</hi>
can hurt us by the <hi>direction,</hi> and at the desire of
a <hi>Witch,</hi> one would think they should have the
same power to do us injury without <hi>instigation</hi>
or <hi>compact;</hi> and if this be granted, 'tis a wonder
that we are not always annoi'd and infested by
them. To which</p>
            <p>I return, (1) That the <hi>laws, liberties</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints</hi>
of the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of the other <hi>world</hi> are
to us utterly <hi>unknown;</hi> and this way we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argue our selves into <hi>confessions</hi> of our <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
which every man must acknowledge that
is not as <hi>immodest</hi> as <hi>ignorant.</hi> It must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all that own the <hi>being, power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi>
of <hi>evil spirits,</hi> that the <hi>security</hi> we enjoy is <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,</hi>
whether they act by <hi>Witches</hi> or not; and
by what <hi>Laws</hi> they are kept from making us
a prey, to speak like <hi>Philosophers, we cannot tell:</hi>
yea, why they should be permitted to tempt
and ruine us in our <hi>Souls,</hi> and restrain'd from
touching or hurting us in our <hi>Bodies,</hi> is a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49942:15"/>
               <hi>mystery</hi> not easily <hi>accountable.</hi> But yet (2) though
we acknowledge their power to vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
us in our bodies also, yet a reason may
be given why they are less frequent in this
kind of mischief, <hi>viz.</hi> because their main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
are levell'd against the interest and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of our Souls, which they can best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
when their actions are most <hi>sly</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;</hi>
whereas did they ordinarily persecute
men in their bodies, their <hi>agency</hi> and <hi>wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
would be discover'd, and make a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
noise in the world, whereby men would
be awaken'd to a more suitable and vigorous
opposition, by the use of such means as would
engage <hi>Providence</hi> to rescue them from their
<hi>rage</hi> and <hi>cruelties,</hi> &amp; at last defeat them in their
great purposes of <hi>undoing</hi> us <hi>eternally.</hi> Thus we
may conceive that the <hi>security</hi> we enjoy may
well enough <hi>consist</hi> with the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>malice</hi>
of those <hi>evil spirits;</hi> and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
we may suppose that <hi>Laws</hi> of their
own may prohibit their <hi>unlicens'd injuries,</hi> not
from any <hi>goodness</hi> there is in their <hi>Constitutions,</hi>
but in order to the more <hi>successful</hi> carrying on
the <hi>projects</hi> of the <hi>dark Kingdom;</hi> as <hi>Generals</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<hi>plunder,</hi> not out of <hi>love</hi> to their Enemies,
but in order to their own <hi>success.</hi> And hence
(3) we may suppose a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>permission</hi> to hurt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49942:16"/>
us at the instance of the <hi>Sorceress,</hi> may well
stand with the <hi>polity</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> since by gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wicked person they encourage her in
<hi>malice</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> and promote thereby the
main ends of their <hi>black confederacy,</hi> which are
to propagate <hi>wickedness,</hi> and to ruine us in our
<hi>eternal interests.</hi> And yet (4) 'tis clear to those
that believe the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
spirits</hi> have vexed the bodies of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>instigation</hi> that we read of; and at this
day 'tis very likely that many of the <hi>strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi>
and <hi>diseases</hi> that befall us, may be the
<hi>infliction</hi> of <hi>evil spirits,</hi> prompted to hurt us
only by the delight they take in <hi>mischief.</hi> So
that we cannot argue the improbability of
their hurting <hi>Children</hi> and others by <hi>Witches,</hi>
from our own <hi>security</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> from the
<hi>effects</hi> of their <hi>malice,</hi> which perhaps we feel in
more instances than we are aware of.</p>
            <p>But (6) another <hi>prejudice</hi> against the <hi>belief</hi>
of <hi>Witches,</hi> is, a presumption upon the <hi>enormous
forces</hi> of <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt can do <hi>wonderful</hi> things, and beget
<hi>strange</hi> persuasions; and to these causes some
ascribe the presum'd effects of <hi>Sorcery</hi> and
<hi>Witchraft.</hi> To which I reply briefly, and yet
I hope sufficiently;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49942:16"/>
(1) That to resolve all the <hi>clear</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>fact,</hi> which we find in well attested
and confirm'd Relations of this kind, into the
power of <hi>deceivable imagination,</hi> is to make
<hi>fancy</hi> the greater <hi>prodigy,</hi> and to suppose, that
it can do <hi>stranger feats</hi> than are believed of any
other kind of <hi>fascination.</hi> And to think that
<hi>Pins</hi> and <hi>Nails,</hi> for instance, can, by the <hi>power</hi>
of <hi>imagination</hi> be convey'd within the skin, or
that <hi>imagination,</hi> should deceive so many as
have been witnesses in <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>sense,</hi> in all the
circumstances of <hi>discovery;</hi> this, I say, is to be
infinitely more <hi>credulous</hi> than the assertors of
<hi>Sorcery</hi> and <hi>Demoniack contracts.</hi> And by the
same reason it may be believ'd, that all the
<hi>Battels</hi> and <hi>strange events</hi> of the world, which
our selves have not seen, are but <hi>dreams</hi> and
fond <hi>imaginations,</hi> and like those that are
fought in the <hi>clouds,</hi> when the <hi>brains</hi> of the
<hi>deluded spectators</hi> are the onely <hi>Theatre</hi> of those
<hi>fancied transactions.</hi> And (2) to deny evidence
of <hi>fact,</hi> because <hi>their imagination may</hi> deceive the
<hi>Relators,</hi> when we have no reason to think <hi>so</hi>
but a bare presumption, that there is no such
thing as is related, is quite to destroy the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of all <hi>humane testimony,</hi> and to make <hi>all men
liars</hi> in a larger sense than the <hi>Prophet</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in his haste. For not onely the <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49942:17"/>
and the <hi>fanciful,</hi> but the <hi>grave</hi> and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whose judgments we have no reason to
suspect to be tainted by their <hi>imaginations,</hi> have
from their own knowledge and experience
made reports of this nature. But to this it will
possibly be rejoyn'd, the <hi>Reply</hi> will be another
<hi>prejudice</hi> against the belief I contend for, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(7) That 'tis a suspicious circumstance that
<hi>Witchcraft</hi> is but a <hi>fancy,</hi> since the persons that
are accused are commonly <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>miserable
old women,</hi> who are overgrown with <hi>discontent</hi>
and <hi>melancholy,</hi> which are very <hi>imaginative;</hi> and
the persons said to be <hi>bewitch'd</hi> are for the most
part <hi>Children,</hi> or people very weak, who are
easily imposed upon, and are apt to receive
<hi>strong impressions</hi> from nothing: whereas were
there any such thing really, 'tis not likely, but
that the more <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>subtil desperado's,</hi> who
might the more successfully carry on the
<hi>mischievous designs</hi> of the <hi>dark Kingdom,</hi> should
be oftner engaged in those <hi>black confederacies,</hi>
and also one would expect effects of the <hi>hellish
combination</hi> upon others than the <hi>innocent</hi> and
the <hi>ignorant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>Objection</hi> it might perhaps be
enough to return (as hath been above sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted)
that nothing can be concluded by this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49942:17"/>
and such like arguings, but that the <hi>policy</hi> and
<hi>menages</hi> of the <hi>instruments</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> are to us
altogether <hi>unknown,</hi> and as much in the <hi>dark</hi>
as their natures, mankind being no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the other world, than poor <hi>Cottagers</hi> and
<hi>Mechanicks</hi> are with the <hi>intriques</hi> of <hi>Government</hi>
and <hi>reasons</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Yea peradventure (2) 'tis
one of the great <hi>designs,</hi> as 'tis certainly the
<hi>interest,</hi> of those wicked <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Machinators,</hi>
industriously to hide from us their <hi>influences</hi>
and <hi>ways</hi> of acting, and to work, as near as is
<hi>possible, incognito;</hi> upon which supposal 'tis
easie to conceive a reason, why they most
commonly work by, and upon the weak and
the ignorant, who can make no <hi>cunning obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
or tell <hi>credible tales</hi> to <hi>detect</hi> their <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
Besides (3) 'tis likely a <hi>strong imagination,</hi>
that cannot be <hi>weaken'd</hi> or <hi>disturb'd</hi> by a <hi>busie</hi>
and <hi>subtil ratiocination,</hi> is a necessary requisite
to those wicked performances; and without
doubt an <hi>heightned</hi> and <hi>obstinate fancy</hi> hath a
great influence upon <hi>impressive spirits;</hi> yea,
and as I have conjectur'd before, on the more
<hi>passive</hi> and <hi>susceptible bodies.</hi> And I am very apt
to believe, that there are as <hi>real communications</hi>
and <hi>intercourses</hi> between our <hi>spirits,</hi> as there are
between <hi>material agents;</hi> which <hi>secret influences,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49942:18"/>
though they are <hi>unknown</hi> in their <hi>nature,</hi> and
<hi>ways of acting,</hi> yet they are sufficiently <hi>felt</hi> in
their <hi>effects:</hi> for <hi>experience</hi> attests, that <hi>some</hi> by
the very <hi>majesty</hi> and <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>spirits,</hi>
discover'd by nothing but a certain <hi>noble air</hi>
that accompanies them, will <hi>bear down</hi> others
<hi>less great</hi> and <hi>generous,</hi> and make them <hi>sneak</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; and some, by I know not what <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying
vertue,</hi> will tie up the <hi>tongue,</hi> and confine
the <hi>spirits</hi> of those who are otherwise <hi>brisk</hi>
and <hi>voluble.</hi> Which thing supposed, the <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
of a <hi>spirit</hi> possess'd of an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
imagination,</hi> may be <hi>malign</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> where
they cannot be resisted, especially when they
are accompanied by those <hi>poisonous reaks</hi> that
the <hi>evil spirit</hi> breaths into the <hi>Sorceress,</hi> which
likely are <hi>shot</hi> out, and <hi>applied</hi> by a <hi>fancy</hi> height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and prepared by <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>discontent.</hi>
And thus we may conceive why the <hi>melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
and <hi>envious</hi> are used upon such occasions,
and for the same reason the <hi>ignorant,</hi> since
<hi>knowledge</hi> checks and controls <hi>imagination;</hi> and
those that abound much in the <hi>imaginative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
do not usually exceed in the <hi>rational.</hi>
And perhaps (4) the <hi>Daemon</hi> himself useth the
<hi>imagination</hi> of the <hi>Witch</hi> so <hi>qualified</hi> for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
even in those actions of mischief which
are more properly <hi>his;</hi> for it is most probable,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49942:18"/>
that <hi>spirits</hi> act not upon <hi>bodies immediately,</hi> and
by their <hi>naked essence,</hi> but by <hi>means proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
and suitable in <hi>instruments</hi> that they use;
upon which account likely 'tis so strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that the <hi>Sorceress</hi> should believe, that
so her <hi>imagination</hi> might be more at the <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the <hi>mischievous Agent.</hi> And for the same
reason also <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are used in <hi>Inchantments,
viz.</hi> for the begetting this <hi>diabolical faith,</hi> and
heightning the <hi>fancy</hi> to a degree of <hi>strength</hi> and
<hi>vigour</hi> sufficient to make it a fit <hi>instrument</hi> for
the design'd performance. And these I think
are reasons of likelihood and probability, why
the <hi>hellish confederates</hi> are mostly the <hi>ignorant</hi>
and the <hi>melancholick.</hi> To pass then to another
prejudice.</p>
            <p>(8) The frequent <hi>impostures</hi> that are met
with in this kind, beget in some a belief, that
all such <hi>relations</hi> are <hi>forgeries</hi> and <hi>tales;</hi> and if
we urge the evidence of a <hi>story</hi> for the belief of
<hi>Witches</hi> or <hi>Apparitions,</hi> they will produce two
as <hi>seemingly strong</hi> and <hi>plausible,</hi> which shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in <hi>mistake</hi> or <hi>design;</hi> inferring thence, that
all others are of the same quality and credit.
But such arguers may please to consider,</p>
            <p>(1) That a <hi>single relation</hi> for an <hi>Affirmative,</hi>
sufficiently confirmed and attested, is worth a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49942:19"/>
thousand <hi>tales</hi> of <hi>forgery</hi> and <hi>imposture,</hi> from
whence cannot be concluded an <hi>universal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi>
So that, though all the <hi>Objectors stories</hi>
be <hi>true,</hi> and an hundred times as many more
such <hi>deceptions;</hi> yet one <hi>relation,</hi> wherein no <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
or <hi>fraud</hi> could be suspected for our <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
would spoil any <hi>Conclusion</hi> could be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them. And</p>
            <p>(2) It seems to me a belief sufficiently <hi>bold</hi>
and <hi>precarious,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> these <hi>relations</hi> of <hi>forgery</hi>
and <hi>mistake</hi> should be certain, and not <hi>one</hi> in
<hi>millions</hi> of those which attest the <hi>affirmative
reality,</hi> with circumstances as good as could
be expected, or wish'd, should be <hi>true,</hi> but all
<hi>fabulous</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> And <hi>they</hi> have no reason to
object <hi>credulity</hi> to the assertors of <hi>Sorcery</hi> and
<hi>Witchcraft,</hi> that can swallow so large a
morsel. And I desire such Objectors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p>(3) Whether it be fair to infer, that because
there are some <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there are no <hi>Realities.</hi> Indeed frequency
of <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>fallacy</hi> will warrant a greater care
and caution in <hi>examining,</hi> and <hi>scrupulosity</hi> and
<hi>shiness</hi> of <hi>assent</hi> to things wherein <hi>fraud</hi> hath
been <hi>practised,</hi> or may in the least degree be
<hi>suspected.</hi> But, to conclude, because that an old
woman's <hi>fancy</hi> abused her, or some <hi>knavish</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49942:19"/>
fellows put <hi>tricks</hi> upon the <hi>ignorant</hi> and the
<hi>timorous,</hi> that therefore whole <hi>Assises</hi> have been
a thousand times deceived in <hi>judgments</hi> upon
<hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> and numbers of sober persons
have been <hi>forsworn</hi> in things wherein <hi>perjury</hi>
could not advantage them; I say, such <hi>inferences</hi>
are as <hi>void</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi> as they are of <hi>charity</hi> and
<hi>good manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be suggested further, (9) That
it cannot be imagin'd what <hi>design</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi>
should have in making those <hi>solemn compacts,</hi>
since persons of such debauch'd and irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
dispositions as those with whom he is
supposed to <hi>confederate,</hi> are pretty securely <hi>his,</hi>
antecedently to the bargain, and cannot be
more <hi>so</hi> by it, since they cannot put their <hi>souls</hi>
out of <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> but by the
<hi>Sin</hi> that is <hi>unpardonable;</hi> or, if they could so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and give away themselves, it will to some
seem very unlikely, that a great and mighty
<hi>Spirit</hi> should oblige himself to such obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and keep such a-do to secure the soul of
a silly body, which 'twere odds but it would
be <hi>His</hi> though <hi>He</hi> put himself to no further
trouble than that of his <hi>ordinary temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>suggestions</hi> 'twere enough to say,
that 'tis sufficient if the <hi>thing</hi> be well <hi>prov'd,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49942:20"/>
though the <hi>design</hi> be not <hi>known.</hi> And to argue
<hi>negatively à fine,</hi> is very unconclusive in such
matters. The Laws and affairs of the other
world (as hath been intimated) are vastly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from those of our Regions, and therefore
'tis no wonder we cannot judge of their <hi>designs,</hi>
when we know <hi>nothing</hi> of their <hi>menages,</hi> and so
<hi>little</hi> of their <hi>natures.</hi> The ignorant <hi>looker-on</hi>
can't imagine what the <hi>Limner</hi> means by those
seemingly <hi>rude lines</hi> and <hi>scrawls</hi> which <hi>he</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for the <hi>rudiments</hi> of a <hi>Picture;</hi> and the
<hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Mathematick Operation</hi> are <hi>non-sense,</hi>
and <hi>dashes</hi> at <hi>a venture</hi> to one uninstructed in
<hi>Mechanicks.</hi> We are in the dark to <hi>one another's</hi>
purposes &amp; intendments; and there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
intrigues in our little matters, which will
not presently confess their design even to <hi>saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
inquisitors.</hi> And therefore 'tis folly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy
to argue any thing one way or other
from the <hi>designs</hi> of a sort of Beings, with whom
we so little communicate; and possibly we
can take no more aim or guess at their <hi>projects</hi>
and <hi>designments,</hi> than the <hi>gazing Beasts</hi> can do
at ours, when they see the <hi>Traps</hi> and <hi>Gins</hi> that
are laid for them, but understand nothing
what they mean. Thus in general.</p>
            <p>But I attempt something more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in order to which I must premise that the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49942:20"/>
               <hi>Devil</hi> is a name for a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> in which
there are very different <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of
<hi>Spirits,</hi> and perhaps in as much <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>place</hi>
and <hi>state,</hi> as among our selves; so that 'tis not
one and the same person that makes all the
compacts with those abused and seduced
Souls, but they are divers, and <hi>those</hi> 'tis like of
the meanest and basest quality in the <hi>Kingdom
of darkness;</hi> which being supposed, I offer this
account of the <hi>probable design</hi> of those <hi>wicked
Agents, viz.</hi> That having none to <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize</hi>
over within the <hi>Circle</hi> of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and government, they affect a <hi>proud Empire</hi>
over us (the desire of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>
being largely spread through the whole <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference</hi>
of <hi>degenerated nature,</hi> especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those, whose <hi>pride</hi> was their <hi>original
transgression</hi>) every one of these then desires to
get him Vassals to pay him homage, and to
be emploied like Slaves in the services of his
lusts and appetites; to gratifie which desire,
'tis like enough to be provided and allowed by
the <hi>constitution</hi> of their <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi>
that every <hi>wicked spirit</hi> shall have those Souls
as his <hi>property,</hi> and <hi>particular servants</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,</hi>
whom he can <hi>catch</hi> in such <hi>compacts,</hi>
as those <hi>wild Beasts</hi> that we can take in
<hi>hunting,</hi> are by the allowance of the Law
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49942:21"/>
our <hi>own;</hi> and those Slaves that a man hath
<hi>purchas'd,</hi> are his peculiar goods, and the vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of his will. Or rather those deluding
Fiends are like the seducing fellows we call
<hi>Spirits,</hi> who inveigle Children by their false
and flattering promises, and carry them away
to the <hi>Plantations</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> to be servilly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
there in the works of <hi>their</hi> own profit
and advantage. And as those base Agents will
humour and flatter the simple unwary Youth,
till they are on Ship-board, and without the
reach of those that might rescue them from
their hands: In like manner the more <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
Tempter</hi> studies to gratifie, please, and
accommodate to those he deals with in this
kind, till death hath lanch'd them into the
<hi>Deep,</hi> and they are past the danger of <hi>Prayers,
Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Endeavours;</hi> and then <hi>He</hi> useth
them as pleaseth <hi>Him.</hi> This account I think is
not unreasonable, and 'twill fully answer the
Objection. For though the matter be not as I
have conjectur'd, yet 'twill suggest a way how
it may be <hi>conceiv'd,</hi> which nulls the pretence,
That the <hi>Design</hi> is <hi>inconceiveable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we are still liable to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
(10) how it comes about, that those
<hi>proud</hi> and <hi>insolent Designers</hi> practise in this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49942:21"/>
kind upon so <hi>few,</hi> when one would expect,
that they should be still trading this way, and
everywhere be driving on the project, which
the vileness of men makes so feisable, and
would so much serve the interest of their
lusts.</p>
            <p>To which, among other things that might
be suggested, I return, (1) That we are never
liable to be so betraied and abused, till by
our <hi>vile dispositions</hi> and <hi>tendencies</hi> we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
the <hi>tutelary</hi> care and <hi>oversight</hi> of the
better Spirits; which, though generally they
are our <hi>guard</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> against the malice
and violence of <hi>evil Angels,</hi> yet it may well
enough be thought that sometimes they may
take their leave of such as are swallowed
up by <hi>malice, envy,</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>revenge,</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
most contrary to their <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi>
and leave them exposed to the <hi>invasion</hi> and
<hi>sollicitations</hi> of those <hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> to whom
such <hi>hateful Attributes</hi> make them very <hi>suitable.</hi>
And if there be particular <hi>guardian</hi> Angels, as
'tis not absurd to fancy, it may then well be
supposed, that no man is obnoxious to those
projects and attempts, but onely such whose
<hi>vile</hi> and <hi>mischievous natures</hi> have driven from
them their <hi>protecting Genius.</hi> And against this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49942:22"/>
               <hi>dereliction</hi> to the power of <hi>evil spirits,</hi> 'tis likely
enough what some affirm, that the <hi>Royal Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
directs that Prayer, <hi>Psal. 71. 9, 10. Cast me
not off in the time of old age, forsake me not when
my strength faileth.</hi> For—<hi>They that keep my
soul</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the <hi>LXX</hi> and the
<hi>Vulgar Latin, Qui custodiunt animam meam]
they take counsel together, saying, God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
him, persecute him and take him, for there
is none to deliver him.</hi> But I adde, (2) That
'tis very probable, that the state wherein they
are, will not easily permit <hi>palpable intercourses</hi>
between the <hi>bad Genii</hi> and <hi>our nature,</hi> since
'tis like enough that their own Laws and
Government do not allow their frequent
excursions into this world. Or, it may
with as great probability be supposed, that
'tis a very hard and painful thing for them,
to force their <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>tenuious</hi> bodies into
a <hi>visible consistence,</hi> and such shapes as are
necessary for their <hi>designs</hi> in their <hi>corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencies</hi>
with <hi>Witches.</hi> For in this action
their bodies must needs be exceedingly
<hi>compress'd,</hi> which cannot be well supposed
without a painful sense. And this is
perhaps a reason why there are so <hi>few Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,</hi>
and why <hi>appearing spirits</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in such haste to be gone, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49942:22"/>
they may be deliver'd from the <hi>unnatural pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of their <hi>tender Vehicles,</hi> which I confess
holds more in the <hi>apparitions</hi> of <hi>good</hi> than of
<hi>evil Spirits,</hi> most Relations of this kind, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
their discoveries of themselves, as very
<hi>transient,</hi> (though for those the Holy Scripture
records, there may be peculiar Reasons why
they are not <hi>so</hi>) whereas the <hi>wicked ones</hi> are not
altogether so <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>hasty</hi> in their <hi>Visits:</hi> The
reason of which probably is, the great <hi>subtilty</hi>
and <hi>tenuity</hi> of the bodies of the former, which
will require far greater degrees of <hi>compression,</hi>
and consequently of <hi>pain,</hi> to make them <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi>
whereas the latter, are more <hi>foeculent</hi> and
<hi>gross,</hi> and so nearer allyed to <hi>palpable consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and more easily reduceable to <hi>appearance</hi>
and <hi>visibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this turn, Sir, you may perceive that I
have again made use of the <hi>Platonick Hypothesis,
That Spirits are Embodyed,</hi> upon which indeed a
great part of my Discourse is grounded: And
therefore I hold my self obliged to a short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that supposal. It seems then to me
very <hi>probable</hi> from the Nature of <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie</hi>
of <hi>Nature</hi> For (1.) We perceive in
our selves, that all <hi>Sense</hi> is caus'd and excited
by <hi>motion</hi> made in <hi>matter;</hi> And when those
<hi>motions</hi> which convey <hi>sensible impressions</hi> to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49942:23"/>
               <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> are intercepted, Sense
is lost: So that, if we suppose <hi>Spirits</hi> perfectly
to be <hi>disjoyn'd</hi> from all <hi>matter,</hi> 'tis not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
how they can have the sense of any thing:
For how <hi>material Objects</hi> should any way be
perceiv'd, or felt without <hi>vital union</hi> with <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
'tis not possiblè to imagine. Nor doth it
(2.) seem suitable to the <hi>Analogie</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
which useth not to make <hi>precipitious leaps</hi> from
one thing to another, but usually proceeds by
<hi>orderly steps</hi> and <hi>gradations:</hi> whereas were there
no <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Beings</hi> between <hi>us,</hi> who are so
deeply plunged into the grossest matter, and
pure unbodied Spirits, 'twere a mighty <hi>jump</hi> in
Nature. Since then the greatest part of the
World consists of the <hi>finer</hi> portions of matter,
and our own Souls are <hi>immediately united</hi> unto
<hi>these,</hi> 'tis infinitely probable to conjecture, that
the nearer orders of Spirits are <hi>vitally joyn'd</hi> to
such <hi>Bodies.</hi> And so <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Degrees</hi> ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
still by the more <hi>refin'd</hi> and <hi>subtile</hi> matter,
gets at last to the pure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>immaterial minds,</hi>
which the <hi>Platonists</hi> made the <hi>highest Order</hi> of
<hi>created Beings.</hi> But of this I have discoursed
else-where, and have said thus much of it at
present, because it will enable me to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reason of the <hi>unfrequency</hi> of <hi>Apparitions</hi> and
<hi>Compacts, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49942:23"/>
(3.) Because 'tis very likely, that <hi>these Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are very <hi>unsuitable,</hi> and <hi>disproportion'd</hi> to the
<hi>frame</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of their <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Bodies;</hi> so
that perhaps, the <hi>Courser Spirits</hi> can no more
bear the <hi>Air</hi> of our World, then <hi>Batts</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi>
can the brightest beams of Day. Nor can the
<hi>Purer</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> any more endure the <hi>noysom
steams,</hi> and <hi>poysonous reeks</hi> of this <hi>Dunghil Earth,</hi>
then the <hi>Delicate</hi> can bear a confinement in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
Dungeons,</hi> and the foul <hi>squallid Caverns</hi> of
uncomfortable Darkness So that 'tis no more
wonder, that the better Spirits no oftner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
than that men are not more frequently in
the <hi>Dark Hollows</hi> under ground. Nor is't any
more strange that <hi>evil Spirits</hi> so rarely visit us,
then that <hi>Fishes</hi> do not ordinarily fly in the
Air, as 'tis said one sort of them doth; or that
we see not the Batt daily fluttering in the beams
of the Sun. And now by the help of what I
have spoken under this Head, I am provided
with some things wherewith to disable another
Objection, which I thus propose:</p>
            <p>(XI.) If there be such an intercourse between
<hi>Evil Spirits</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> how comes it about
that there is no correspondence between <hi>Good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
and the <hi>Vertuous?</hi> since without doubt, <hi>these</hi>
are as desirous to propagate the Spirit and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of the upper and better World, as <hi>those</hi> are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49942:24"/>
to promote the Interest of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which way of arguing is still from our <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
of the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the other
World, which <hi>must</hi> be <hi>confest,</hi> and <hi>may,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice to the <hi>Proposition</hi> I defend. But
particularly, I say, (1.) That we have ground
enough to believe, that <hi>Good Spirits</hi> do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in, yea, and <hi>govern</hi> our Affairs. For that
there is a <hi>Providence</hi> reaching from Heaven to
Earth, is generally acknowledg'd; but that
<hi>this</hi> supposeth all things to be order'd by the
<hi>immediate influence,</hi> and <hi>interposal</hi> of the <hi>Supreme
Deity,</hi> is not very <hi>Philosophical</hi> to suppose; since
if we judge by the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the <hi>Natural
World,</hi> all things we see are carried on by the
<hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Second Causes,</hi> and <hi>intermediate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</hi>
And it doth not seem so <hi>Magnificent</hi>
and <hi>Becoming</hi> an apprehension of the <hi>Supreme
Numen,</hi> to phancy His <hi>immediate Hand</hi> in every
<hi>trivial</hi> Management. But 'tis exceeding like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conjecture, that much of the <hi>Government</hi>
of us, and our Affairs, is committed to the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Spirits,</hi> with a due <hi>subordination</hi> and <hi>subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi>
to the Will of the chief <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</hi>
And 'tis not absurd to believe, that there
is a <hi>Government</hi> runs from <hi>Highest</hi> to <hi>Lowest,</hi> the
<hi>better</hi> and more <hi>perfect</hi> orders of Being, still ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49942:24"/>
the <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>less perfect.</hi> So that some
one would phancy that perhaps the <hi>Angels</hi> may
manage <hi>us,</hi> as we do the <hi>Creatures</hi> that God
and Nature have placed under our <hi>Empire</hi> and
<hi>Dominion.</hi> But however that is, That <hi>God</hi> rules
the lower World by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> is
very consonant to the <hi>sacred Oracles.</hi> Thus,
<hi>Deut.</hi> XXXII. viii, ix. <hi>When the Most High divided
the Nations their inheritance, when he separated
the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the number of the
Angels of God,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it; the
Authority of which Translation, is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
credited and asserted, by its being quoted in
the New Testament, without notice of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Text, even there where it differs from it, as
learned men have observ'd. We know also, that
<hi>Angels</hi> were very <hi>familiar</hi> with the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of
old; and <hi>Iacob's Ladder</hi> is a <hi>Mystery,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
their <hi>ministring</hi> in the affairs of the Lower
World. Thus <hi>Origen</hi> and others understand,
that to be spoken by the <hi>Presidential Angels,</hi>
Jer. LI. ix. <hi>We would have healed BABYLON,
but she is not healed, forsake her, and let us go.</hi>
Like the Voyce heard in the <hi>Temple</hi> before the
taking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And before <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was sent to learn
Wisdome and Religion among the Beasts, <hi>He</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49942:25"/>
sees a <hi>Watcher,</hi> according to the 70. an <hi>Angel,</hi>
and an <hi>holy One come down from heaven,</hi> Dan. IV.
xiii. who pronounceth the <hi>sad Decree</hi> against
<hi>Him,</hi> and calls it the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Watchers,</hi> who
very probably were the <hi>Guardian Genii</hi> of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
and his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And that there are <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Angels that have the special <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of particular <hi>Kingdomes, Provinces, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
yea and of <hi>Persons,</hi> I know nothing that
can make improbable: The instance is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
that hindred the other that was engaged for
the concerns of <hi>Iudaea;</hi> yea, our Saviour Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
tells us, that <hi>Children have their Angels,</hi> and
the Congregation of Disciples supposed that St.
<hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>his.</hi> Which things, if they be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the good Spirits have not so little to do
with us, and our matters, as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
And perhaps it would not be absurd,
if we referr'd many of the <hi>strange thwarts,</hi> and
<hi>unexpected events,</hi> the <hi>disappointments</hi> and <hi>lucky
coincidences</hi> that befal us, the <hi>unaccountable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi>
and <hi>successes</hi> that attend some <hi>lucky</hi> men,
and the <hi>unhappy fates</hi> that dog others that seem
born to be <hi>miserable;</hi> the <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> that
still waits on some without any conceivable <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
to allure it, and the <hi>general neglect</hi> of others
more <hi>deserving,</hi> whose <hi>worth</hi> is not <hi>acknowledg'd;</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49942:25"/>
I say, these, and such like <hi>odde</hi> things, may with
the greatest probability be resolv'd into the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>
and <hi>Menages</hi> of those <hi>invisible Supervisors,</hi>
that preside over, and govern our affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if they so far concern themselves in our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
how is it that they</hi> appear <hi>not to maintain a</hi>
visible <hi>and</hi> confest correspondence <hi>with some of
the</hi> better Mortals, <hi>who are most fitted for their
Communications and their influence?</hi> To which
I have said some <hi>things</hi> already, when I accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the <hi>unfrequency</hi> of <hi>Apparitions;</hi> and I
<hi>now add</hi> what I intend for another return to the
main Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) That the <hi>apparition</hi> of <hi>good</hi> Spirits is not
<hi>needful</hi> for the Designes of the better World,
whatever such may be for the interest of the
other. For we have had the <hi>Appearance</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation</hi>
of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we have <hi>Moses</hi> and
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the continued <hi>influence</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>greatest Arguments</hi> to strengthen <hi>Faith,</hi>
the most <hi>powerful Motives</hi> to excite our <hi>Love,</hi>
and the <hi>Noblest Encouragements</hi> to quicken and
raise our <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>hopes,</hi> any of which are
more than the <hi>apparition</hi> of an <hi>Angel;</hi> which
would indeed be a great <hi>gratification</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Life,</hi> but 'twould render our <hi>Faith</hi> less
noble and less generous, were it frequently so
assisted: <hi>Blessed are they that believe, and yet have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49942:26"/>
not seen.</hi> Besides which, the <hi>good Angels</hi> have
no such <hi>ends</hi> to prosecute, as the gaining any
Vassals to serve them, they being <hi>ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
for our <hi>good,</hi> and no <hi>self-designers</hi> for a <hi>proud</hi>
and <hi>insolent Dominion</hi> over us. And it may be
perhaps not impertinently added, That <hi>they</hi> are
not always <hi>evil Spirits</hi> that <hi>appear,</hi> as is, I know
not well upon what grounds, generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
but that the extraordinary <hi>detections</hi> of
<hi>Murders, latent Ireasures, falsified</hi> and <hi>unfulfill'd
Bequests,</hi> which are sometimes made by <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions,</hi>
may be the courteous Discoveries of the
better, and more benign <hi>Genii.</hi> Yea, 'tis not
unlikely, that those <hi>Warnings</hi> that the World
sometimes hath of approaching <hi>Iudgments</hi> and
<hi>Calamities</hi> by <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and sundry <hi>odd Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
are the <hi>kind Informations</hi> of some of the
Inhabitants of the upper World. Thus, was
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> forewarned before its sacking by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
by those <hi>Aiery Horsemen</hi> that were seen
through all the City, for almost forty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
2 <hi>Mac</hi> V. ii, iii. And the other <hi>Prodigious
Portents</hi> that fore-ran its Destruction by <hi>Titus:</hi>
which I mention, because they are <hi>notorious</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
And though, for mine own part, I
scorn the <hi>ordinary Tales</hi> of <hi>Prodigies,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from <hi>superstitious fears,</hi> and <hi>unacquaintance</hi>
with <hi>Nature,</hi> and have been used to bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49942:26"/>
by the <hi>Iealous</hi> and the <hi>Ignorant;</hi> Yet I
think that the Arguments that are brought by a
late very ingenious Author, to conclude against
such Warnings and Predictions in the whole
kind, are <hi>short</hi> and <hi>inconsequent,</hi> and built upon
too narrow <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For if it be supposed,
that there is a sort of Spirits over us, and about
us, who can give a probable guess at the more
<hi>remarkable futurities,</hi> I know not why it may
not be conjectured, that the kindness they have
for us, and the appetite of fore-telling strange
things, and the putting the World upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
which we find is very grateful to our
own Natures, may not incline them also to
give us some general notice of those uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Events which they foresee. And I yet
perceive no reason we have to phancy, that
whatever is done in this kind, must needs be
either <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
by <hi>extraordinary commission</hi> and <hi>appointment.</hi>
But it seems to me not unreasonable to believe,
that <hi>those officious Spirits,</hi> that oversee our affairs,
perceiving some <hi>mighty and sad alterations</hi> at
hand, in which their <hi>Charge</hi> is much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
cannot chuse, by reason of their <hi>affection</hi> to
us, but give us some <hi>seasonable hints</hi> of those <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Calamities;</hi> to which also their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
desire to <hi>fore-tell strange things</hi> to come, may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49942:27"/>
contribute to incline them. And by this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
the <hi>fairest probabilities,</hi> and <hi>strongest ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiotinations</hi>
against <hi>Prodigies,</hi> may be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable.
But this onely by the way. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the next Objection, which may be made
to speak thus:</p>
            <p>(XII.) The belief of <hi>Witches,</hi> and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things they are said to perform by the help of the
<hi>Confederate Daemon,</hi> weakens our <hi>Faith,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the World to <hi>lnfidelity</hi> in the great matters
of our Religion. For if <hi>They</hi> by Diabolical <hi>assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
can <hi>inflict</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> Diseases, and do things
so much beyond the <hi>comprehension</hi> of our <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi>
and <hi>activity</hi> of common Nature; What as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
can we have, that the <hi>Miracles</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
our Gospel were not the effects of a Compact of
like nature, and that <hi>Devils</hi> were not cast out by
<hi>Beelzebub?</hi> If <hi>evil Spirits</hi> can <hi>assume</hi> Bodies, and
render themselves <hi>visible</hi> in <hi>humane likeness;</hi>
What security can we have of the <hi>reality</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
of <hi>Christ?</hi> And if, by their help,
<hi>Witches</hi> can enter Chambers <hi>invisibly</hi> through
<hi>Key-holes,</hi> and little <hi>unperceived Cranneys,</hi> and
<hi>transform</hi> themselves at pleasure; What Arguments
of <hi>Divinity</hi> are there in our <hi>Saviour's</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself in the midst of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> when the
Doors were <hi>shut,</hi> and his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> in the
Mount? <hi>Miracles</hi> are the great inducements of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49942:27"/>
Belief, and How shall we distinguish a <hi>Miracle</hi>
from a <hi>Lying Wonder;</hi> a <hi>Testimony</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
from a <hi>Trick</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Hell;</hi> if they
can perform things that astonish and confound our
Reasons, and are beyond all the <hi>Possibilities</hi> of
Humane Nature? <hi>This</hi> Objection <hi>is spiteful
and mischievous, but I thus endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) The Wonders done by <hi>Confederacy</hi> with
<hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> cannot derive a suspition upon
the undoubted <hi>Miracles</hi> that were wrought by
the Author &amp; Promulgers of our Religion, as if
<hi>they</hi> were performed by <hi>Diabolical Compact,</hi> since
their <hi>Spirit, Endeavours</hi> and <hi>Designes</hi> were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
contrary to all the <hi>Tendencies, Aims</hi>
and <hi>Interests</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Darkness.</hi> For,
as to the Life and Temper of the Blessed and
Adorable <hi>IESUS,</hi> we know there was an
incomparable <hi>sweetness</hi> in his <hi>Nature, Humility</hi>
in his <hi>Manners, Calmness</hi> in his <hi>Temper, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
in his <hi>Miracles, Modesty</hi> in his <hi>Expressions,
Holiness</hi> in all his <hi>Actions, Hatred</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and
<hi>Baseness,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to all the World; all which
are <hi>essentially contrary</hi> to the Nature and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of <hi>Apostate Spirits,</hi> who abound in
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Rancour, Insolence</hi> and <hi>Rudeness, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi>
and <hi>Baseness,</hi> universal <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi>
of <hi>Men.</hi> And their <hi>Designes</hi> are as opposite, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49942:28"/>
their <hi>Spirit</hi> and their <hi>Genius.</hi> And now, Can
the <hi>Sun</hi> borrow its Light from the <hi>bottomless
Abyss?</hi> Can <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Warmth</hi> flow in upon
the World from the Regions of <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Ice?</hi>
Can <hi>Fire freeze,</hi> and <hi>Water burn?</hi> Can Natures,
so infinitely contrary, <hi>communicate,</hi> and jump in
<hi>projects,</hi> that are <hi>destructive</hi> to each others <hi>known
Interests?</hi> Is there any Balsome in the <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice's
Egge?</hi> or, Can the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> flow
from the <hi>Venome</hi> of the <hi>Asp?</hi> Will the <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Darkness</hi> strengthen the <hi>Arm</hi> that is <hi>stretcht</hi> out
to pluck his <hi>Usurp't Scepter,</hi> and his <hi>Spoyls</hi> from
him? And will he lend his <hi>Legions,</hi> to assist
the <hi>Armies</hi> of his <hi>Enemy</hi> against him? No, these
are impossible Supposals; No intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will industriously and knowingly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the <hi>Contradiction</hi> of its own <hi>Principles,</hi>
the <hi>Defeature</hi> of its <hi>Purposes,</hi> and the <hi>Ruine</hi> of
its own dearest <hi>Interests.</hi> There is no fear <hi>then,</hi>
that our Faith should receive prejudice from
the <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Witches,</hi> and
<hi>power</hi> of <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> since 'tis not the <hi>doing won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things</hi> that is the onely <hi>Evidence</hi> that the
<hi>Holy IESUS</hi> was from God, and his <hi>Doctrine
true;</hi> but the <hi>conjunction</hi> of other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the <hi>holiness</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of
his <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>excellency</hi> of his <hi>Designes,</hi>
added credit to his Works, and strengthned the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49942:28"/>
               <hi>great Conclusion, That he could be no other than
the Son of God, and Saviour of the World.</hi> But
besides, I say,</p>
            <p>(2.) That since <hi>infinite Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi>
rules the World, it cannot be conceiv'd, that
they should give up the greatest part of men to
<hi>unavoidable deception.</hi> And if <hi>evil Angels,</hi> by
their <hi>Confederates,</hi> are permitted to perform such
<hi>astonishing</hi> things, as seem so evidently to carry
<hi>God's Seal</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> with them, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Falshoods,</hi> and gaining credit to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,</hi>
without any <hi>counter-evidence</hi> to disabuse
the World; Mankind is exposed to <hi>sad</hi> and
<hi>fatal delusion.</hi> And to say that <hi>Providence</hi> will
suffer us to be deceived in things of the greatest
concernment, when we use the best of our care
and endeavours to prevent it, is to speak hard
things of <hi>God;</hi> and in effect to affirm, That He
hath nothing to do in the Government of the
World, or doth not concern Himself in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of poor forlorn Men. And if the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God be not a security unto
us against such <hi>Deceptions,</hi> we cannot be assured,
but that we are always abused by those <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Agents,</hi> in the <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>plain sense,</hi> and in
all the matters of our dayly Converses. If <hi>ONE</hi>
that pretends he is <hi>immediately</hi> sent from <hi>God,</hi> to
overthrow the ancient <hi>Fabrick</hi> of Established
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49942:29"/>
               <hi>Worship,</hi> and to erect a <hi>New Religion</hi> in <hi>His</hi>
Name; shall be <hi>born</hi> of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and honour'd
by a <hi>miraculous Star;</hi> proclaimed by a <hi>Song</hi> of
seeming <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Worshipped</hi> by the
<hi>wise Sages</hi> of the World; Revered by those of
the greatest <hi>austerity,</hi> and <hi>admired</hi> by all for a
<hi>miraculous Wisdome,</hi> beyond his <hi>Education</hi> and
his <hi>Years:</hi> If He shall <hi>feed Multitudes</hi> with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<hi>nothing,</hi> and <hi>fast himself</hi> beyond all the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities</hi>
of Nature: If He shall be <hi>transformed</hi>
into the <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>extraordinary Glory,</hi> and
converse with departed <hi>Prophets</hi> in their <hi>visible
Forms:</hi> If He shall Cure all Diseases without
<hi>Physick</hi> or <hi>Endeavour,</hi> and raise the <hi>Dead</hi> to
<hi>Life</hi> after they have <hi>stunk</hi> in their <hi>Graves:</hi> If
He shall be honoured by <hi>Voyces</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and attract the universal <hi>Wonder</hi> of Princes and
People: If he shall <hi>allay Tempests</hi> with a <hi>Beck,</hi>
and cast out <hi>Devils</hi> with a <hi>Word:</hi> If He shall
fore-tell his own Death particularly, with its
<hi>Tragical Circumstances,</hi> and his <hi>Resurrection</hi> after
it: If the <hi>Veil</hi> of the most Famous <hi>Temple</hi> in
the World shall be <hi>rent,</hi> and the <hi>Sun darkened</hi> at
his <hi>Funeral:</hi> If He shall, within the time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
break the bonds of Death, and lift up his
Head out of the Grave: If <hi>Multitudes</hi> of other
<hi>departed Souls</hi> shall <hi>arise</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> to attend at
the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of <hi>His Resurrection:</hi> If He shall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49942:29"/>
after Death, <hi>visibly converse</hi> with, <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi>
with, divers persons, who could not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a matter of <hi>clear sense,</hi> and <hi>ascend</hi> in Glory
in the presence of an astonisht and admiring
Multitude: I say, if such a One as this should
prove a <hi>Diabolical Impostor,</hi> and Providence
should permit him to be so credited and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged;
What possibility were there then
for us to be assured, that we are not always <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</hi>
yea, that our very Faculties were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us onely to delude and abuse us? And if
so, the next Conclusion is, <hi>That there is no God
that judgeth in the Earth;</hi> and the best, and most
likely <hi>Hypothesis</hi> will be, <hi>That the World is given
up to the Government of the Devils.</hi> But if there
be a <hi>Providence</hi> that superviseth us, (as nothing
is more certain) doubtless, it will never suffer
poor helpless Creatures to be <hi>inevitably deceived,</hi>
by the <hi>craft</hi> and <hi>subtilty</hi> of their <hi>mischievous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
to their undoing; but will without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
take such care, that the <hi>works</hi> wrought by
<hi>Divine Power</hi> for the Confirmation of <hi>Divine
Truth,</hi> shall have such <hi>visible Marks</hi> and <hi>Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
if not in their <hi>Nature,</hi> yet in their <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Ends</hi> and <hi>Designes,</hi> as shall discover
<hi>whence they are,</hi> and sufficiently <hi>distinguish</hi> them
from all <hi>Impostures</hi> and <hi>Delusions.</hi> And though
wicked Spirits may perform some strange
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49942:30"/>
things that may excite wonder for a while, yet
<hi>He hath,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> so provide, that they shall be
<hi>baffled and discredited;</hi> as we know it was in the
case of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian Magicians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, besides what I have directly said to the
<hi>Objection,</hi> I have this to adde to the <hi>Objectors,</hi>
That I could wish they would take care of such
<hi>Suggestions;</hi> which, if they overthrow not the
Opinion they oppose, will dangerously affront
the Religion they would seem to acknowledge.
For he that saith, <hi>That if there are</hi> WITCHES,
<hi>there is no way to prove that</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>was not
a Magician, and Diabolical Impostor;</hi> puts a <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Weapon into the <hi>hands</hi> of the <hi>Infidel,</hi> and is
himself next door to the <hi>SIN AGAINST THE
HOLY GHOST:</hi> of which, in <hi>order</hi> to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading</hi>
greater <hi>tenderness</hi> and <hi>caution</hi> in such
matters, I <hi>give</hi> this short account.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sin</hi> against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is said to be
<hi>Unpardonable;</hi> by which <hi>sad</hi> Attribute, and the
Discourse of our <hi>Saviour, Mat.</hi> XII. from the
xxii. to the xxxiii <hi>ver.</hi> we may <hi>understand</hi> its
Nature: In order to which we consider, That
since the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Merits</hi> of his
<hi>Son,</hi> are <hi>infinite,</hi> there is nothing can make a Sin
<hi>unpardonable,</hi> but what makes it <hi>incurable;</hi> and
there is no Sin but what is curable by a <hi>strong
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49942:30"/>
Faith,</hi> and a <hi>vigorus Endeavour: For all things
are possible to him that believeth.</hi> So that, <hi>that</hi>
which makes a Sin <hi>incurable,</hi> must be somewhat
that makes <hi>Faith impossible,</hi> and obstructs all
means of Conviction. In order to the finding
<hi>which,</hi> we must consider the ways and methods
the Divine Goodness hath taken for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> of <hi>Infidelity:</hi> which it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
first, by the Prophets, and holy men
of antient times; who, by the <hi>excellency</hi> of their
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>Miracles,</hi> and the
<hi>holiness</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> endeavoured the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and reformation of a stubborn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
World. But though <hi>Few believed their
report,</hi> and men would not be prevail'd on by
what they <hi>did,</hi> or what they <hi>said,</hi> yet their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity</hi>
was not hitherto <hi>incurable,</hi> because fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>means</hi> were provided in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of
<hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> whose Life was more <hi>severe,</hi>
whose Doctrines were more plain, pressing and
particular; and therefore 'twas possible that He
might have succeeded. Yea, and where He
failed, and could not open mens hearts and
their eyes, the Effect was still in <hi>possibility,</hi> and
<hi>it</hi> might be expected from <hi>Him</hi> that came after,
to whom the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were but the
<hi>Twilight</hi> and the <hi>Dawn.</hi> And though <hi>His mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Birth,</hi> the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Iourney</hi> of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49942:31"/>
the <hi>Wise Men</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi> and the <hi>correspondence</hi>
of <hi>Prophesies,</hi> with the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>first
appearance</hi> of the <hi>Wonderful Infant:</hi> I say, though
these had not been taken notice of, yet was
there a further provision made for the <hi>cure</hi> of
<hi>Infidelity,</hi> in his <hi>astonishing Wisdom,</hi> and most <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Doctrines;</hi> For, <hi>He spake as never Man
did.</hi> And when <hi>These</hi> were despised and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
yet there were other <hi>means</hi> towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi>
and <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> in those mighty
<hi>Works</hi> that bore <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> and ware
the evident marks of <hi>Divine Power</hi> in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.
But when after all, these <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Miracles</hi> which were wrought by
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and had eminently his <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
on them, shall be ascribed to the <hi>Agency</hi>
of <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Diabolical Compact,</hi> as they
were by the <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>spightful Pharisees</hi> in
the periods above-mentioned; when those <hi>great</hi>
and <hi>last Testimonies</hi> against <hi>Infidelity,</hi> shall be
said to be but the <hi>Tricks</hi> of <hi>Sorcery,</hi> and <hi>Complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
with <hi>Hellish Confederates, This</hi> is <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
in the highest, against the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> as <hi>cuts</hi> off all <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and puts the Unbeliever beyond all <hi>possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Cure.</hi> For <hi>Miracles</hi> are God's <hi>Seal,</hi> and the
great and last evidence of the truth of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And though, while <hi>these</hi> are onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49942:31"/>
as to the <hi>Fact,</hi> there remains a <hi>possibility</hi>
of <hi>perswasion;</hi> yet, when the <hi>Fact</hi> shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
but the Power <hi>blasphemed,</hi> and the
effects of the adorable <hi>Spirit maliciously</hi> imputed
to the <hi>Devils;</hi> such a <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> such an <hi>Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is <hi>incurable,</hi> and consequently <hi>unpardonable.</hi>
I say, in sum, the Sin against the Holy Ghost
seems to be a <hi>malicious imputation</hi> of the <hi>Miracles</hi>
wrought by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in our Saviour
to <hi>Satanical Confederacy,</hi> and the power of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Spirits;</hi> Than which, nothing is more
<hi>blasphemous,</hi> and nothing is more like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that is so abused to an
<hi>Eternal Dereliction</hi> of so <hi>Vile</hi> and so <hi>Incurable</hi> an
Unbeliever.</p>
            <p>This account, as 'tis clear and reasonable in
it self, so it is plainly lodg'd in the mention'd
Discourse of our Saviour. And those that speak
other things about it, seem to me to talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and perfectly without book. But to leave
them to the fondness of their own conceits, I
think it now time to draw up to a Conclusion
of the whole.</p>
            <p>Therefore briefly, Sir, I have endeavoured
in these Papers, which my respect and your
concernment in the subject have made <hi>yours,</hi> to
remove the main prejudices I could think of, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the existence of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions;</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49942:32"/>
and I'm sure I have suggested much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
what I defend, than ever I heard or saw
in any that opposed it; whose Discourses, for
the most part, have seemed to me inspired by a
<hi>lofty scorn</hi> of <hi>common</hi> belief, and some <hi>trivial
Notions</hi> of <hi>Vulgar Philosophy.</hi> And in despising
the <hi>Common Faith</hi> about matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and
fondly adhering to <hi>it</hi> in things of <hi>Speculation,</hi>
they very grosly and absurdly mistake: For in
things of <hi>Fact,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> are as much to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
as the most <hi>subtile Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators;</hi>
since here, <hi>Sense</hi> is the Judge. But
in matters of <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Iheory, They</hi> are not
at all to be heeded, because <hi>Reason</hi> is to be Judge
of <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> they know not how to use.
And yet thus it is with those <hi>wise</hi> Philosophers,
that will deny the <hi>plain</hi> evidence of the <hi>Senses</hi> of
Mankind, because they cannot reconcile <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi>
with the fond Crotchets of a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
which they lighted on in the <hi>High-way</hi> by
<hi>chance,</hi> and will adhere to at <hi>adventure.</hi> So that
I profess, for mine own part, I never yet heard
any of the confident Declaimers against <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi>
and <hi>Apparitions,</hi> speak any thing that
might move a mind, in any degree instructed
in the generous kinds of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>
of <hi>things.</hi> And for the <hi>Objections</hi> I have recited,
they are such as rise out of mine own thoughts,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49942:32"/>
which I obliged to consider what was possible
to be said upon this <hi>cccasion,</hi> For though I have
examined <hi>Scot's Discovery,</hi> phancying that there
I should find the <hi>strong reasons</hi> of <hi>mens</hi> dis-belief
in this matter; yet I profess I met not with the
least suggestion in all that <hi>Farrago,</hi> but what it
had been ridiculous for me to have gone about
to <hi>answer:</hi> For the Author doth little but tell
<hi>odd Tales,</hi> and <hi>silly Legends,</hi> which he confutes
and laughs at, and pretends <hi>this</hi> to be a <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the Being of <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Apparitions:</hi>
In all which, His <hi>Reasonings</hi> are <hi>trifling</hi> and
<hi>Childish;</hi> and when He ventures at <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
He is little better than <hi>absurd:</hi> So that 'twill
be a Wonder to me, if any but <hi>Boys</hi> and
<hi>Buffoons</hi> imbibe any <hi>Prejudices</hi> against a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
so infinitely Confirmed, from the <hi>Loose</hi>
and <hi>Impotent Suggestions</hi> of so weak a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, 'tis fit that I relieve your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
and I shall do so, when I have said,
that <hi>You</hi> can abundantly <hi>prove,</hi> what I have
but attempted to <hi>defend:</hi> And that among
the many Obligations your <hi>Country</hi> hath to
you, for the <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> of your
Endeavours in its service; your <hi>Ingenious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi>
for the <hi>Detecting</hi> of those <hi>Vile Practicers,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49942:33"/>
is not the least <hi>considerable.</hi> To which I will
add no more, but the <hi>Confession</hi> who it is that
hath given you all this trouble; which I know
you are ready to <hi>pardon,</hi> to the respect and good
<hi>Intentions</hi> of</p>
