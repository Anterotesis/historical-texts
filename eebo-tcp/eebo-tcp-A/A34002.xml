            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>By the ſaid Act every Head of great <hi>Scotch</hi> Cattle imported after the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and before the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> in any year, is to pay 20 <hi>s.</hi> one Moiety to the Informer, and the other to the Poor of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p>This Act is in force, and by vertue of it Stock Fiſh not being caught by our Veſſels, are barr'd out.</p>
            <p>And by the <hi>Act againſt Importing</hi> Iriſh <hi>Cattle,</hi> 18. <hi>Reg. Car.</hi> 2. no great Cattle, Sheep, or Swine, or any Beef, Pork, or Bacon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48596:4"/>
(except Sailing Proviſions) are to be Imported from beyond Sea after the Second of <hi>February,</hi> 1666. hence Weſtphalia Hams are barr'd out.</p>
            <p>By the ſaid Act no Ling, Herring, Cod, or Pilchard, freſh or ſalted, dried or bloated, or any Salmon, Eels, or Congers; taken by any Foreigners, are to be imported or ſold on penalty of loſing the ſame, the one half to the Informer, the other to the Poor of the Pariſh; and the ſame Penalty is on Fleſh before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Act is expired, and is now endeavoured to be rendred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Query</hi> may be, What Clauſes ought to be renewed? And with what Exceptions? And for what reaſon Fiſh or other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ought to be kept out?</p>
            <p>The Reaſon we take to be this:</p>
            <p>Thoſe Proviſions or Wares that <hi>England</hi> doth or may afford, enough, good, and to ſpare, ought not for our own Expence to be Imported or admitted from abroad.</p>
            <p>The Argument thus limitted is granted, with two Cautions: The Firſt is, Provided one part can ſupply another without great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. The other is, That there be ſome Grains of Allowance for delight or ornament, beſides neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Hence we having no Stock-Fiſh, which being never ſalted is of great uſe in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and long Voyages, that ought to come in: As to Cavair or Roes of Sturgeon, and Sturgeon it ſelf from the <hi>Sound</hi>; Potargoe's, or Roes of Mullets and Anchova's from <hi>Italy,</hi> they were never barr'd; and Weſtphalia Hams being chiefly for the City Treats, may be admitted under the Exception of Delight. To which I ſhall not add three Veſſels of Eels that uſually and yearly come laden from <hi>Holland,</hi> but leave it to the Parties concerned: And theſe being permitted, all other Fiſh caught by Strangers that were not by the former Acts admitted, may be kept out</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act ſeems to be built upon the Reaſon aboveſaid, yet I have heard of another Motive thereof; to wit, after His Majeſty's Reſtauration much Money was raiſed to disband the Army, to releive His Majeſty, and pay his Debts, and vaſt Sums brought out of the Country in <hi>Specie,</hi> to carry on the firſt <hi>Dutch</hi> War.</p>
            <p>The Country finding the want of Money, the returns whereof
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48596:4"/>
were much obſtructed by the Plague in 1665. whence alſo the expence and price of Proviſions much fell, began to complain we wanted People, and to conſider by what means it was poſſible to get the Money to return again into the Country. Some alledged there was no better way of doing it than by keeping out all Foreign Fleſh and Fiſh, to the end <hi>London</hi> paying dear for their Proviſions, the ſame would not only riſe in price, but haſten the return of the Money: Adding for Reaſon, that as long as Proviſions were cheap, People would be lazy and forbear work; and that the way to raiſe both Land and Proviſions was to reduce Intereſt of Money to a low rate. And theſe Reaſons, with the firſt about <hi>England's</hi> Plenty prevailing, an Act paſſed, prohibiting God's Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Others have undertaken to ſhew the ill Conſequences thereof, and therefore I ſhall not engage in it, farther than to add two or three <hi>Arguments</hi> (that perchance are not obvious to them) as a means to occaſion better meaſures to be taken, than to paſs this Act, at leaſt for any long time or perpetual.</p>

               <p>The Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Brereton</hi> lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, lent me a Paper to peruſe, that was a Copy of <hi>A Report of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Council of Trade,</hi> intended to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ireland,</hi> dated <hi>March</hi> 26, 1673. in Obedience to <hi>An Order of Council</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 20, 1672. concerning the Trade and State of that Kingdom; what were its Aggrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and the Remedies. Amongſt other Articles I find divers relating to <hi>England,</hi> which are inſerted at large into this Diſcourſe, to wit, in Article 15. it is alledged, That <hi>Ireland</hi> pays a yearly Debt to <hi>England</hi> of about 200000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Article 16. 'tis ſaid, That while the Cattel-Trade for live Oxen and Sheep was open, the value of all the Cattel exported to <hi>England</hi> never exceeded 140000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> whereof 60000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> was Commodity,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48596:5"/>
to wit, Hides, Tallow, Wool, and Freight, ſo we had but 80000 <hi>l.</hi> in Fleſh: In lieu whereof, they had Goods from <hi>England</hi> to about three or four times the value, that is, 280000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Article 17. the Cuſtoms between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in the freeſt Trade, are ſaid to come to 32000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as appears by their <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Books. And therefore after a Harangue of ſome hard Meaſures in Article 13. come to a reſult in theſe words Article 17. That about one third of all the imported Manufactures might be made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that about two Thirds of the Remainder might be more conveniently had from Foreign Parts than out of <hi>England</hi>: And Conſequently it is ſcarce neceſſary at all for <hi>Ireland</hi> to receive any Goods out of <hi>England,</hi> and not convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive above one Fourth from thence of the whole which it needeth to Import, the value whereof is under 100000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, 'tis highly our Intereſt to admit not only <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel, but all their Commodities, to keep them by Agreement, on equitable terms (hereafter propounded) from furniſhing Foreigners; their Hides were formerly wrought into Shoes, and exported to the Plantations; as alſo Tallow.</p>
               <p>And as to their Wool, if they are permitted to export it, either manufactured or unmanufactured, it will in time ruine all the Wool and Cloth Trade of <hi>England,</hi> for now they feed on their lean Cattel, export their fat, and increaſe their Flocks of Sheep.</p>
               <p>In ſum, <hi>Ireland</hi> can and doth ſell to Foreigners Wool, Hides, Tallow, Fleſh, and Fiſh, at about one Moiety of what <hi>England</hi> can afford them at; and ſeeing our Lead and Tin are alſo in a very declining condition, as is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48596:5"/>
hereafter ſhewed, it follows, that this muſt be redreſſed, or our Commodities lie on our hands: The Merchants in their humble Remonſtrance in 1659. to the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parliament, repreſented it as their judgment; That for as much as the Ground of <hi>Ireland</hi> was of far leſs value than that of <hi>England,</hi> an Acre there nor being worth 4 <hi>s.</hi> which is here worth 40 <hi>s.</hi> and Proviſions ſo much cheaper, and conſequently the Labours of Men; they might afford their Commodities one half cheaper than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can do: So that in time, if this were not redreſſed, <hi>Ireland</hi> would get all the Trade from <hi>England</hi>; but if not, 'tis better to Trade with them on an Over-Ballance than not at all; and better to leſſen their Markets abroad, than quite to obſtruct our furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame: Whence the <hi>Query</hi> reſulting is this:</p>
               <p>Have we, or is it fit we ſhould have, a Power over <hi>Ireland,</hi> to hinder them from ſelling their Commodities in Foreign Parts, when we will not have them our ſelves?</p>
               <p>If we have, it is not well obſerved, of which take the following Narrative.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Euclid Speidell</hi> a <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Officer, informs, that in the year 1678. there were 40 Ships lading of Wool Shipp'd off from <hi>Ireland,</hi> that according to Cockets ought to be unladen in <hi>England,</hi> but none of it arrived here; the Contents he certainly knew not: But according to a moderate ſuppoſition, Mr. <hi>Poyntz,</hi> His Majeſty's Tapeſtry-maker, hath given the following Calculation; to wit, 40 Ships or Veſſels at 40 Tuns each is 1600 Tuns, which will employ 29458 Men, Women, and Children, for a year, allowing 3 Perſons to a pound of Wool for a day; in ſome of the faculties of Carding, Spinning, Combing, Weaving, Dying, and Dreſſing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48596:6"/>
which at 6 <hi>d.</hi> each <hi>per diem</hi> comes to 268804 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> And according to Mr. <hi>Poyntz</hi> all theſe Faculties may be eſtimated to employ 96000 Perſons for a year, who may earn in that time at moderate rates 750000 <hi>l.</hi> which if wrought beyond Sea, is not only ſo much loſs to His Majeſty's Native Subjects, but as much gain to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, beſides the loſs of Navigation and Money, if the ſame ſhould come in upon us.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="argument">
               <head>The Second Argument.</head>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe that Act paſs, and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel are barr'd out; and this in favour to the Weſtern and Northern Parts, or breeding Grounds: I ſay, His Majeſty and the Eaſtern and Southern Parts are for the preſent the loſers; and in the event the Nation ſhall have no <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> nor by conſequence be able to conteſt the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sea. Of each ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Majeſty loſeth moſt of the Cuſtoms of 32000 <hi>l.</hi> a year before-mentioned; and alſo much by the over-dearneſs of Proviſions for His Navy, which are twice as dear at home, as our Neighbours over the Water are furniſhed with them from <hi>Ireland</hi> (as followeth), in ſo much that if another War at Sea ſhould happen, the Nation in this reſpect muſt ſoon groan under it as an unſupportable burthen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Kingdom loſeth the Navigation between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> and conſequently the Employment of three or four hundred Sail of Ships and Veſſels, and the breeding of Mariners to manage them, whereof (alas!) we have too few.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Eaſtern and Southern Parts have loſt their Victualling of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and of our own Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48596:6"/>
as may be plentifully proved from the Searchers Office at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> and 'tis already aſſerted in Print, that our Ships for the moſt part, Weſterly or Southerly bound, Victual here but for ſix Weeks, and take in the reſt of their Proviſions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proviſions in <hi>Spain,</hi> according to contract made for the ſame:</p>
               <p>Whereupon I put this <hi>Querie</hi>?</p>
               <p>Shall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships be permitted to Victual in <hi>Ireland</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>If yea, then our Proviſions are not ſpent at home, contrary to the Hypotheſis in keeping Cattel out; and our Money muſt be returned to purchaſe them there.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhall not be allowed to Victual there, I further Enquire, ſhall the <hi>Iriſh</hi> be permitted to carry their Proviſions abroad, or ſell them to ſtrangers at home, or both? Have we power to impoſe upon them.</p>
               <p>If they ſhall be permitted to carry them abroad, our Proviſions cannot obtain Foreign vend, as being much dearer than theirs: And when they Export their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they will alſo Export their Commodities, and furniſh their returns.</p>
               <p>Of this take the following inſtance; to wit, a Sea Commander Captain <hi>Swaine</hi> informes, that for 5 years paſt there were ſeldom leſs than 20 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ships frequently at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> Laden with Beef, Tallow, Hides and Leather, much Butter and ſome Wool; And that all the Capers or Privateers during that time were furniſhed with theſe Proviſions.</p>
               <p>That divers other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ships furniſht <hi>Ostend:</hi> and many of them he hath ſeen at <hi>Nants, Burneſ, Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48596:7"/>That at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſold their Proviſions at the following Rates.</p>
               <p>Tallow and Butter the Hundred Weight, from 20 to 22 <hi>Livers,</hi> That is, from 30 <hi>s.</hi> to 33 <hi>s.</hi> whereas 100 <hi>l.</hi> of Butter cannot but coſt dearer here, a <hi>Liver</hi> may be reckoned at 18 pence, and 10 <hi>Stivers</hi> to a Shilling, there is no great diſparity in Weight, 100 <hi>l.</hi> there makes 104 <hi>l.</hi> here.</p>
               <p>A Barrel of Beef Weighing about 2 Hundred and a half, from 12 to 23 <hi>Livers</hi>; That is, from ſeven and ſix pence, to thirteen and eight pence the Hundred Weight.</p>
               <p>Tann'd Leather from 14 to 18 <hi>Stivers</hi> a Pound Weight, that is, from 16 pence to 21 pence.</p>
               <p>That there was Imported but little Proviſions beſides Corn from <hi>England,</hi> to wit Butter; by which there was no great gain.</p>
               <p>Cod, Salmon, and Herrings, abound moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſts, inſomuch that ſome years there hath been ſeen at <hi>Wexford,</hi> no leſs than 200 ſail of Ships at a time, part <hi>Engliſh,</hi> part <hi>French,</hi> but moſt <hi>Dutch,</hi> taking in Herrings and other Proviſions, where a meſh of Herrings containing about 500 is commonly ſold for Four Shillings, often under, and ſometimes higher, and about two meſh fill a Barrel, moreover Cod at other places are ſold for 4 <hi>d.</hi> or 5 <hi>d.</hi> a peece.</p>
               <p>So that if this be permitted, and no redreſs found, it will be a folly to catch any Herrings in the Channel, in hopes of a profit by ſending them to <hi>Spain</hi> or into the <hi>Streights,</hi> when at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> the firſt coſt of a Barrel of Herrings is above double the value they coſt at <hi>Wexford,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Jared Hancock,</hi> and others will atteſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48596:7"/>
               <head>The Third Argument.</head>
               <p>Hence we muſt either allow <hi>Ireland</hi> a free Trade with others, to the ſubverſion of the Cloth Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and the incredible prejudice of the Fiſhery, and of Trade and Staple Commodities in general; or by agreement with them on equitable terms, (hereafter propounded) get ſo high a Duty of Cuſtoms laid on their Commodities as may, if exported by Foreigners or by themſelves, unleſs to <hi>England,</hi> render them of equal or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther higher value than the like Commodities in <hi>England,</hi> and then take off as many of them as we can, and furniſh them to others (after improvement here) at the ſecond hand, the latter (if we will avoid our own deſtruction) is the choice to be made.</p>
               <p>Hence their Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought not to be refuſed; and in what elſe can they pay <hi>England</hi> the debt before mentioned, and over ballance of Trade.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="argument">
               <head>The Fourth Argument.</head>
               <p>The prime reaſon for Barring Foreign Commodities holds not in this caſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel in queſtion, with their Hides, Tallow and Wool, are not ſo much Imported for our expence, as to Ship off, to furniſh Foreign Markets withal, and are received in payment of an annual debt, which cannot be well otherwiſe returned from <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we ought not for our own expence to be furniſhed with Commodities from abroad, that we can ſupply our ſelves with at home, then ought we to have no Foreign <hi>Salt, Iron, Braſs, Paper, Tapeſtry-hangings,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48596:8"/>
Canvas, Linnen, Earthen-wares, Madders, Safflore, Smalt,</hi> hard <hi>Soap,</hi> tinned Plates, and divers other Commodities of leſſer moment Imported, and no <hi>Salt Petre</hi> from the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> nor Sugar from <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſeeing our own Plantations will afford it.</p>
               <p>And if we admit theſe great concerns from Strangers, 'tis more fit his Majeſties Subjects ſhould have a free Trade with one another, for matters of far leſs moment:</p>
               <p>As to that ſtraw, that unleſs Proviſions be dear the people will be lazy, and will not work.</p>
               <p>Anſwer, 'tis granted neceſſity begets induſtry, yet notwithſtanding if ſome will be idle, it follows not that all or the Major part will be ſo: Poor people muſt either work, beg, or ſteal; If the latter, beſides ſaving the Almes of the Pariſh, there are Houſes of Correction and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
               <p>Moreover goodneſs and cheapneſs are the main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to put off any Commodity: And it canot be well apprehended how Labour ſhall be cheap and Work plenty where Proviſions are dear, where the one riſeth the other doth ſo likewiſe: As at <hi>London</hi> and in other places where Proviſions are deareſt Labor is deareſt: And this aſſertion is contrary to experience in memory, to wit, before the year 1640. Proviſions were much cheaper than they are now, and Labour likwiſe, and work more plentifull, for then we had a great Trade; And about 60 Ships of about 400 or 500 Tuns burthen employed in the <hi>Streights,</hi> which afterwards in 1659. came to be reduced to 6 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, as the City repreſented to <hi>Olivers</hi> Council: Whereas on the contrary at preſent we have ſo little work that many thouſands of Families of Salt-workers, Rope-makers, Weavers, Dryers, Potters, Tanners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no Employment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48596:8"/>And to make Proviſions dear as a means to make the poor work, is the ready way to drive them into Foreign Plantations, where they may either have greater Wages for their pains, or Ground for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given them by the Law of the Country. Thoſe that are for grinding and made the <hi>Objection,</hi> I ſuppoſe would not willingly undergo a mean comfortleſs drudgery themſelves.</p>
               <p>As to that Allegation about a low rate of intereſt, to the intent Lands and Proviſions may riſe in value:</p>
               <p>'Tis granted and affirmed, that according to the Laws of Arithmetick for yearly Purchaſes, if Money be at 4 in the hundred, Land ſhould be at 25 years Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; and at 5 in the hundred at 20 years Purchaſe: though the Effect doth not always follow the ſuppoſed Cauſe: As in the year 1640. when Money was at 8 <hi>per Centum,</hi> and Land ſhould have been worth but 12 and a half years Purchaſe, yet it was commonly ſold for 20 years Purchaſe; Whence take this <hi>Sorites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Land riſes, the Commodities the Land yields muſt alſo riſe, otherwiſe the Tenant cannot pay his Rent.</p>
               <p>This riſing-price muſt be paid either at home or abroad, if neither, conſequently a low Rate of intereſt cannot advance the price of Lands.</p>
               <p>Cloth, Lead, and Tin, are our chief Staple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: And whether theſe will bear a conſiderable Riſing price abroad or at home, is the <hi>Querie:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As for Cloth, I hear the Merchants hazard is great and gain little; and it was more formerly: This ſaith Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> an eminent Merchant in a Book of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> Trade, Printed in 1659. page 13. <hi>Intituled the Merchants Petition and Remonſtrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clothiers and others complain againſt the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48596:9"/>
in general, that they take not off and buy their Cloathes, and other their Manufactures: nor give them ſuch prices for them whereby they may make a Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants complaints are very great, becauſe they are rather loſers than gainers by the ſales of their Cloth, (on which Commodity I lately loſt 10 <hi>per</hi> Cent out of my principal on an hundred Cloaths, well bought and ſorted, that I ſent to <hi>Smyrna:</hi>) And to put off our Cloth we are now forced to remit quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Monies to Purchaſe the Commodities of thoſe Countries; which tendeth very much to the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stock.</p>
               <p>At that time the <hi>Turks</hi> beſieging <hi>Candy,</hi> in reaſon Cloth ſhould have ſold dearer than now, when they are far in the Inland Country, and when <hi>Turky</hi> is ſupplyed with the Cloth of <hi>Germany</hi> by the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to Lead, Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> page 8. ſaith, that during the late (Uſurper's) War with <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wanting Lead Employed thoſe that had skill in Mines, who preſently found moſt excellent Mines by <hi>Xaen,</hi> and ſince they have needed little of ours from 1634 to 1646. ſaith Capt. <hi>Thomas Buſhell,</hi> that great Miner, in his Caſe printed in 1649. <hi>pag.</hi> 13.3 or 4 Thouſand Tuns yearly raiſed, was and now is the Trade and Cuſtoms, both by Tranſportation and Importation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning <hi>Tin,</hi> I have heard divers Merchants of late years affirm, they could not get the Intereſt of their Principal by it; and when the Debate about Tin Farthings happened, the <hi>Pewterers</hi> affirmed, That there was 22000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Tin at <hi>Smyrna</hi> remaining, that had been ſome years in the hands of one Mr. <hi>Pythorne,</hi> a Factor there, that he could not ſell to any advantage;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48596:9"/>
and it's well known that Tin was never ſo cheap at home, nor more of it lying on our hands than now, albeit His Majeſty ever ſince 1666. hath received no benefit by his Prerogative of praeemption, nor is like to have any for the future; whereas in former times it was farmed at 12000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Rent.</p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, give me leave to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion about the improvement of our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>Endeavours have been on foot to reſtore this fallen branch of the Revenue by Farming it of His Majeſty, and coming to a Compoſition with the Miners of <hi>Cornwal</hi> to take off all the Tin the Mines yeild, or at leaſt 1200 Tuns <hi>per annum,</hi> but there were two Rubs in the way; the one was, the Convocation could not well come to ſuch an Agreement, till an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was obtained to bind all particular Miners to ſtand to ſuch contract as the ſaid Convocation ſhould make: The other was, the Farmers would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch Bargain without Covenanting with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to ſupply <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the Plantations, with Tin Farthings, a Pound weight of them to be cut into 16 Pence, that by the profit of theſe Farthings the Farmers might be enabled to pay their Rent.</p>
               <p>This Deſign was oppoſed by the Mint as a groſs cheat and an abuſe to be put upon the Nation. Amongſt many things alledged againſt Tin Farthings: I ſhall enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſome of the moſt material, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a Metal might be made whiter and harder than Tin of poyſonous Ingredients, <hi>viz. Spelter, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſuch Metal, when worn, would not yeild above Two Pence a Pound, or little more, and no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48596:10"/>
                  <hi>Pewterer</hi> durſt uſe it, as being contrary to Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Tin Farthings might be coyned with a Hammer, caſt in a Mold, ſqueezed in a Vice, and be counterfeited by any Tinker, Plummer, Smith, Glaſier, Tinman, Watchmaker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence a <hi>Query</hi> was put to the Farmers, whether they would change all that were brought them or not, good or bad, either made by themſelves or others? And if ſo, who ſhould allow the Country and City Brewers their Charges, in ſending them up to <hi>London</hi> in Drays and Wagons, with Tellers?</p>
               <p n="5">5. They refuſing, it was inferred, that if Tin Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things were Eſtabliſhed, His Majeſty muſt receive His Revenue of Exciſe (and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Poſtage) in Tin Farthings, in regard a Brewer cannot avoid the taking of much Money in Tin Farthings at home of Tub-Women and Firkin-Men, and abroad of the Ale-houſe-keepers that are his Cuſtomers.</p>
               <p>Theſe Arguments ruined that wretched Deſign, and I pray let it ſleep in its Rubbiſh.</p>
               <p>Afterwards one Mr. <hi>Vane</hi> deceaſed, propoſed a Deſign to make Tin the <hi>fundus</hi> of a Bank; to be managed for His Majeſty's advantage by Commiſſioners that were able Merchants, that could pay the Miners by Contract for the Tin quarterly, and be reimburſed by Sales, when it ſhould bear a price, or by others that would have credit in the ſaid Bank: And His Majeſty to promote the ſame, bought up 60000 <hi>l.</hi> of Tin when it was cheap, to wit, at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 6. <hi>d.</hi> the Hundred weight, of which this was the event:</p>
               <p>The Plot breaking out, and the Parliament not ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſuch Contract could not be made with the Miners; and the ſaid Tin, after it had with Warehouſe room,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48596:10"/>
and Intereſt of Stock, coſt about 3 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred weight, was ſold at the <hi>African-Houſe</hi> for about 3 <hi>l.</hi> the Hundred weight, or little more; and thoſe that bought it ſo, Shipp'd off moſt of it to <hi>Holland,</hi> and are ruined by the bargain. And the cauſe is this:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> abounds with Tin, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> buy there at about 5 <hi>d.</hi> a Pound, and bring it home for Ballaſt Freight free; and they have brought home ſo much in former years, as to bring down the price of ours. See a Book of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade printed in 1667. where in <hi>pag.</hi> 9. you have this paſſage:</p>
               <p>As for Tin, there is vaſt quantities in ſome parts of <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> during the time of the late proeemption of Tin having brought home in two years 4 or 500 Tuns: And it might be more advantagious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, not only to tranſport Tin from one part of <hi>India</hi> to another, rather than to ſend it from <hi>England</hi>; but alſo to bring Tin from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> for Ballaſt of their Ships that come with Pepper from <hi>Bantam,</hi> did they not prefer the Kingdoms Intereſt before their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Profit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. brought home, as a Letter from <hi>Holland</hi> mentions, above 150 Tuns, which is ſaid to be 5 <hi>s.</hi> a Hundred weight better than ours; and at firſt ſold it at 3 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred weight, then fell to 3 <hi>l.</hi> then to 2 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> and ours would not ſell for above 2 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, to apply a Remedy I muſt humbly Addreſs my ſelf to the Honourable the <hi>Members of Parliament</hi> that ſerve for the Counties of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi>; and Propound,</p>
               <p>That whereas we now in <hi>England</hi> make Salt the beſt yet known in the World, and are notwithſtanding much
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48596:11"/>
oppreſſed by Foreign Salt; to Redreſs which, the Salt-workers have for many years endeavoured to bring on a ſmall Exciſe on our own, to recompence His Majeſty for the loſs of the Cuſtoms of Foreign, to be kept out by a high Duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you be pleaſed no longer to oppoſe ſuch Exciſe, upon pretence that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Salt will not cure your Pilchards.</p>
               <p>I have a Treatiſe of Salt ready for the Preſs, ſhewing the ſeveral ways of making of Salt in <hi>England</hi> and other Countries, and ſetting forth the Excellency and manner of uſing our own in curing both Fleſh and Fiſh, for the longeſt of Voyages through the hotteſt of Climates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That you vouchſafe to make uſe of ſuch opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to remove all burthens upon Tin, as well Sealing Duty of 4 <hi>s.</hi> a Hundred weight, which may come to 5000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> (except a competent Recompence to the Officers for ſealing ſuch as is free from Iron and Droſs, according to Conſtitution;) as alſo exporting Duty of 7 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> a Hundred, which may come to 7000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, or more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That then a Farm of all the Tin the Mines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, be let to the <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>Pewterer</hi>'s Company; the one will ſo regulate the Price abroad, and the other at home, that we ſhall not be undermined by the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, the ſaid Companies may erect a ſafe Bank, and not be damaged, albeit they have Tin on their hands to a vaſt quantity and value. The advantages of Banks are great, whereof I ſhall mention but one; It enables the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to Trade with a dead ſtock: to wit, when a Laden Ship arrives, the goods are appraiſed, depoſited in the Bankers Ware-houſes and Credit given at home or in Foreign parts, for about three quarters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48596:11"/>
of their value; which is an incredible advantage in Trade.</p>
               <p>I further humbly repreſent to you, that in the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's time an Exciſe of a half peny a Gallon brought in 26000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> when Fiſhery-Salt was excepted, and paid nothing, the which was obſerved to be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble back door and a Cloak to many fallacious pretences, whereas laying the duty univerſal, the revenue raiſed by Fiſhery Salt, being employed for the advantage of a Fiſhery Trade, ſhall much more advance the deſign, than the payment of ſuch duty can hinder it, eſpecially ſeeing our Neighbours cannot be furniſht with Salt for that purpoſe ſo good and cheap, as we by 12 or 15 <hi>per</hi> Cent; And in caſe the ſame be employed in the Royal Fiſhery Company at <hi>London,</hi> out-parts may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Fiſheries are diſcouraged; to which may be replied that at <hi>London</hi> a duty is paid upon Ballaſt, but not the like in the out-ports or moſt of them, where a revenue may be levied on Ballaſt to promote their reſpective Fiſheries; And if ſuch duty be laid univerſal and well managed it may produce 38000 or 40000 <hi>l.</hi> a year. And ſuch a ſtock as that Employed to encourage our Manufactures, ſhall enrich the Nation much above a Million a year; I offer how and moſt humbly move you to promote:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſetting up a Fiſhery Company, to have 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a year given them, to Build Ships and Veſſels to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Adventurers to undertake the Fiſhery Trade, and the making of Twine Nets, Canvas, and Cordage, at <hi>Clerkenwell</hi> work-houſe, not only for their own uſe, but alſo for his Majeſties ſtores; as is hereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And if they be rendred a Council of Trade, (for which reaſons are afterwards given, why they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48596:12"/>
are or may be a moſt proper conſtitution,) they will go far in earning ſuch benevolence, and doubtleſs give ſuch advice as followed ſhall redreſs the aggreivances of the Nation about Trade and Manufactures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a new Art of preparing, whitening, and dreſſing both of Hemp and Flax, that ſhall render it of a ſilver Colour, ſo fine that of one pound of it a thread may be made 20 Miles long, and in value to 50 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>l.</hi> Hence we want no Foreign Linnen nor Canvas, which may be barr'd out by a high duty.</p>
               <p>Of the refuſe or Tow thereof, of Raggs, Old Fiſhery Netts and Sails, may be made Paper; whereof we ſpend in <hi>England</hi> in Writing and Printing, about 1000 Reams a day, or to the value of 120000 l. <hi>per Annum.</hi> Good Paper is made in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>; and the Art thereof is attained in <hi>England</hi>; but to encourage the ſame here, there wants a higher duty on Foreign Paper; and a Company with a good ſtock to undertake the ſame; the which might be the Stationers Company, with other Adventurers; to whom for encouragement might be allowed the uſe of 5000 l. <hi>per Annum Gratis</hi>; to be taken out in Stationary Wares for the ſupply of all his Majeſties Offices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the like encouragement, the Upholſterers with others might be induced to undertake the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Tapiſtry hangings, the benefit of gaining ſuch Manufacture is great, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It will ſave an expence of Foreign Wool, and beget an expence of our own, to the value of One hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> now imported in Tapeſtry-hangings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will cauſe our Cloaths to go off in <hi>Turkey</hi> in Barter, to procure raw Silk to work up with the ſaid Hangings.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48596:12"/>3. It will in the ballance of Trade ſave the value of ſuch Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings yearly to the Nation, and in time become a Staple Commodity to Ship off, in regard we can have Wool, Silk, and Proviſions, much cheaper here than in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> the ſole Provinces where this Manufacture was formerly made, the skill whereof is now well attained in <hi>England</hi>; but Encouragement in its Infancy by keeping out Foreign, and a Stock to carry it on, is wanting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will employ many thouſands of poor People in Carding, Combing, and Spinning, beſides Dyers, Weavers, Worſted-workers, Drawers, and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſigners. See the excellent Propoſal in Print of Mr. <hi>Francis Poyntz,</hi> His Majeſty's Tapiſtry-maker.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Parliament having lately built 30 Men of War, 'tis hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous to truſt them and many more in the River of <hi>Medway</hi>; and beſides, their Moorage and Attendance is very chargeable: A wet Dock would add much to their ſafety, and prevent much of the conſtant charge</p>
               <p>A Propoſal may be drawn where to make ſuch a Dock, with a Pool behind it wherein to keep Maſts ſunk, and at what Charge; which might be defrayed out of the Exciſe upon Salt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if there be yet a Surplus, the Revenue of the Mint craves it; the ſaid Revenue was much too ſhort for Coyning any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of our Moneys into ſmaller pieces than Shillings, even before the Prohibition of <hi>French</hi> Wines, (which paid 10 <hi>s.</hi> a Tun Coynage-duty) and became a notable Abridgment of ſuch Revenue, namely, 6000 <hi>l</hi> a year. Moreover to Coyn more Moneys ſmall, is the beſt way to accommodate the People, and prevent its Exportation.</p>
               <p>Now, after a long Digreſſion, having ſhewed that our Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will not yeild the intended riſing Price abroad, it ſeems ridiculous to ſuppoſe they ſhould riſe, lying on our hands at home.</p>
               <p>I proceed to ſhew the languiſhing Condition of our Foreign Trade, and that in oppoſition to thoſe groſs ignorant Flatterers, that ſay, <hi>England</hi> was never more thriving, our Trade never greater, nor ſafer, and ſo endeavour to beget an Enmity in the Gentry, or Country Party, againſt the City, the Merchants, and Trading part of the Nation.</p>
               <p>As to our ready Money, if we have about 7000000 of People in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Graunt,</hi> Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> and others, on rational grounds ſuppoſe, and but 1000000 of ready Money,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48596:13"/>
as Mr. <hi>Mun,</hi> and others, gueſs; theſe, if equally diſtributed, would not be 3 <hi>s.</hi> a piece.</p>
               <p>As to our Foreign Trade, I begin with that of the <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not leſs than 50 or 60 Men of War, and ſuch vaſt numbers of Trading Ships, that it's ordinary to ſee 140 Sail at a time in <hi>Batavia</hi> Road, from 300 Tuns burthen to 1400 Tuns, not to mention 37 Magazines, and 20 conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Forts, as we read, aſſerted in the printed Tranſlations of two <hi>French</hi> Treatiſes of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade. How ſmall our number of Trading Ships thither is, (to wit, 15 or 16) and how great our danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need not to mention.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, they have in a former War got <hi>Surinam</hi> from us, which (as the late Lord <hi>Brereion</hi> affirmed) hath ſometimes yeilded about 3000 Tuns of Sugar in a year, and will yeild as much of that Commodity, Tobacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they can get hands to Plant and manage, and being on the Main, is more free from Hurricanes, and more temperate, than the <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands; amongſt the Weſtwardmoſt of which, they have one called <hi>Curaſao,</hi> the Mart for their <hi>Negro's</hi>; amongſt the Eaſtwardmoſt they have <hi>Tabago,</hi> and claim two little Iſlands from us, to wit, <hi>Sabia,</hi> and <hi>Stacia</hi> aliàs <hi>Eustachia,</hi> near St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s, which the <hi>French</hi> took from us in 1666. and by the Treaty of <hi>Breda</hi> were to reſtore, but baffled us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelling them to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> from whom our Governour Collonel <hi>Stapleton</hi> took them in 1673. and the <hi>Dutch</hi> under <hi>Everſon</hi> retook them in 1674. he being gone, valiant <hi>Stapleton</hi> retook them the ſame year; and on the Concluſion of the laſt Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it not being known (as is preſumed) that they were in our hands, we agreed to reſtore what was taken from them, and they what was took from us; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they reſtored to us <hi>New York,</hi> and expect to have <hi>Sabia</hi> and <hi>Stacia</hi> from us, which, if we keep, will do us no good; but if we reſtore much hurt, for whilſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> had them, they framed the Timbers of Sloops in <hi>Holland,</hi> carried them thither in the holds of their Ships, and there compleatly built them, a Sloop being a Veſſel of about 25 or 30 Tuns burthen, and with theſe they went a Trading by ſtealth to repleniſh our almoſt-ruin'd Iſlands with <hi>Negro's</hi> in barter for Commodities, to wit, Cottons, Sugar, Tobacco, Indigo, Ginger, Fuſtick, and other dying Stuffs; and by vertue of ſuch Trade with the <hi>French</hi> which they allow, and with us by ſtealth or conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, they have ſome years laden home many Ships, as 12 or more, of Goods of the growth of thoſe Iſlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to His Majeſty's great loſs in the Cuſtoms, and carrying them home into <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence Exporting moſt of them to Foreign Markets almoſt Cuſtom free, were capacitated to under-ſell us 12 or 15 <hi>per cent.</hi> and 'tis their chiefeſt aim in getting Iſlands there not ſo much to Plant, as to drive on this kind of Trade. How great our loſs of <hi>Negro's</hi> and Inhabitants was in 1666. off the Iſlands of St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat,</hi> and <hi>Antego,</hi> is not ſo proper to mention as bewail, in regard the <hi>French</hi> have more Iſlands full Mann'd, and a conſiderable Fleet commonly abroad in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the danger of our <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, except that of <hi>Newfound-Land,</hi> for poor <hi>Jack</hi> in which we are undermined by the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>New
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48596:13"/>
Englanders</hi> by aid of 1000 of our own Seamen that ſtay'd there on ſhoar in 1665. to avoid the Service againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> where in a following years expedition our damage was ſo much, that the Town of <hi>Dartmouth</hi> alone loſt 8000 <hi>l.</hi> but of this more largely in my Salt Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Before I come to our <hi>Streights</hi> Trade, let us conſider the <hi>Dutch</hi> advantages over us at home, did they Trade meerly not to export again, which are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Ships lying for the moſt part at or near their own Doors or Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, they ſave Lighterage and Cartage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſave Intereſt of Money, not paying Duties there 'till a Sale, whereas here we pay Cuſtoms upon entry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their 7 Provinces, <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ſpend more imported Goods than <hi>England</hi> can ſpend; theſe Countreys are furniſhed by Boats and Veſſels, ſome of 40 Tuns, that go above 500 miles up the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as far as <hi>Franckfort,</hi> which is not now hard to do by aid of towing Engins in Boats. The late Lord <hi>Brereton</hi> affirmed, the <hi>French</hi> make way up the River <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> one of the moſt rapid hitherto known, by a new Invention, after the rate of 4 or 5 miles an hour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Down theſe Rivers they are furniſhed with Rheniſh Wines, and other <hi>German</hi> Commodities, in large flat-bottom'd Veſſels built of great Timber, never intended to return, out of which they build their Doggers, Buſſes, and Fiſhery Veſſels, at about half the Rate we can do the like in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Their Bank enables them to borrow Money, and to Trade with a dead Stock, that is, Goods there depoſited: By aid of ſuch Bank, they in former years furniſhed about 80 Sail of Trading Merchants Ships in the <hi>Streights</hi> of about 600 Tun, and 30 Guns each, with a Stock of ready Money to be let out at <hi>Bottomree</hi>; that is to ſay, the Money is lent to <hi>Jews,</hi> upon taking in a Cargo of Goods at one Port, at the rate of 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> for Intereſt and freight, leſs or more, according to agreement, the Owners to run all hazards whatſoever of Shipwrack, Pirates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the Ship arrives at the Port whereto ſhe is bound, the Money is received on board before the Goods are delivered on ſhoar: In the mean while the Owners enſure at a moderate rate at home, by this means ſending out their Ships with <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Commodities of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the <hi>Sound, &amp;c.</hi> they keep them in long Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abroad. I have ſeen 40 of theſe kind of Ships at once employed as Men of War in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not had above two or three; neither have we the like way of employing our Ships abroad, or little practice it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, as Carriers, to ſupply all Foreign Markets with all ſorts of Commodities, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade chiefly to export their own Goods, and furniſh Returns for their own Expence: And this comes to paſs by reaſon we pay Cuſtoms, or a Duty, when we import Goods, and they Exciſe, that is a Duty not paid 'till the Goods are ſold for Expence. The Diſparity is ſo great, that it hath been the prime cauſe of the greatneſs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade, Wealth, and Power at Sea.</p>
               <p>In 1641. Mr. <hi>Lewes Roberts</hi> repreſented to the Long Parliament, in his Book called <hi>The Treaſure of Traffick,</hi> two Examples thereof, to wit, ſuppoſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48596:14"/>
two Ships of equal burthen of 300 Tuns each, to come out of the River of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> laden with Wine, the one arrives at <hi>London,</hi> and pays Duties inward, the other at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and then both Export; the Charges at <hi>London</hi> come to about 1200 <hi>l.</hi> and at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 60 <hi>l.</hi> and in two Ships of Tobacco of 200 Tuns each, the charges ſhall be here 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> 120 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by reaſon hereof the <hi>Hollanders</hi> uſe to employ about 300 Sail of Ships every Winter to bring in <hi>French</hi> Wine and Brandy to Ship off again, to the quantity of 40000 Tuns, by which they could not get leſs than 2 or 300000 <hi>l.</hi> and 200 Sail more for Salt. I have twice ſeen Fleets of theirs of about 500 Sail at a time in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only trade for 11 or 12000 Tuns of Wine yearly to ſpend.</p>
               <p>The Caſe being thus, and our building and ſailing with more hands more chargeable, it is no wonder we do not much thrive, albeit we drive on rather a great Navigation, than a profitable Trade.</p>
               <p>This inconvenience was long ſince repreſented to King <hi>James</hi> by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> as we find in his little Book of <hi>Obſervations upon Trade,</hi> printed in 1653. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. in theſe words:</p>
               <p>Of this their ſmalneſs of Cuſtom (meaning in <hi>Holland, Hamburgh,</hi> &amp;c.) inward and outward, we have daily Experience; for if two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, or two of any other Nation, be at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> both laden with Wine of 300 Tuns a piece, the one bound for <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other petit States, the other for <hi>England,</hi> the Merchant ſhall pay above 900 <hi>l.</hi> here in Duties, when the other in <hi>Holland</hi> ſhall be cleared for 50 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo in all other Wares and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes accordingly.</p>
               <p>It ought to be an Inſtruction to a <hi>Council of Trade,</hi> to State an Accompt thereof on every Commodity.</p>
               <p>He proceeds, and ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That this draws all Nations to Traffick with them, and although it ſeems but ſmall Duties which they receive, yet the multitudes of all kind of Commodities and Coyn that is brought there, and carried out by themſelves and others, is ſo great, that they receive more Cuſtoms and Duties to the State (beſides Exciſe) by the greatneſs of their Commerce in one year, than <hi>England</hi> doth in two years, for the hundredth part of the Commodities are not ſpent in <hi>Holland,</hi> but vended into other Countreys, which makes all the Country Merchants to buy and ſell, and increaſe Ships and Mariners to tranſport them. My Travels and meaning is, neither hath been to diminiſh your Majeſty's Revenues, but exceedingly to encreaſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This might be remedied, by changing that part of the Duty of Cuſtoms that concerns Foreign Goods, into an Exciſe, to be managed in the ſame places, and by the ſame Offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, and that without detriment to the Revenue, laying the Exciſe upon the Expence, eſpecially of Goods we may want, or beſt ſpare, high, and yet hardly raiſe the price of them, for where Goods are plenty they will be cheap, and People will be rather content with a ſmall profit at home, than run the hazard of a greater abroad.</p>
               <p>If the advice of our renowned <hi>Hero</hi> had been followed, the Dominion of the Sea had never been diſputed, which if once gained by our Adverſaries,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48596:14"/>
(as an eminent Peer in his Speech, well obſerved) is never to be loſt, or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and if ſo; we might poſſibly be at their mercy: whether the River of <hi>Thames</hi> ſhould be ſtopt from Coals and Trade or not.</p>
               <p>That we have loſt the <hi>Greenland, Muſcovia</hi> and Fiſhery Trades, is notorious. And all this digreſſion, is but to render Gentlemen that may poſſibly meet with this diſcourſe, more kind in their meaſures towards the trading part of the Nation: eſpecially at ſuch a time, when our ſtaple Commodities, and Forreign Trades are under ſuch circumſtances: and we not out of danger of our Neighbours entring into a Conjunction againſt us.</p>
               <p>The Remedy we Propounded in the Third Argument, will deſtroy the greateſt part of the profit, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could or might have had, by Trading with any but our ſelves. We muſt therefore propound <hi>equitable Terms of amends,</hi> Namely: that whereas we are now Furniſhed with <hi>Linnen,</hi> and <hi>Canvas,</hi> from Forreign parts, to the value of much above a Milion a Year: We ought to encourage the planting of <hi>Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> and the Manufactures thereof, by keeping out Forreign, both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and at home: And by taking off all that <hi>Ireland</hi> can furniſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> allbeit, it be to the value of 400 Thouſand Pounds a Year: in that Commodity, and in building and fitting out (if the Fiſhery Trade be well encouraged) Ships and Fiſhery Veſſels, Cordage, Twine, and Nets, Sails, and Barrels: which may be done there at Cheap rates, ſo by that means encourage their induſtry; and receive payment for the Debt, payable to <hi>England</hi> aforeſaid; and for that great value of goods that uſed to be exported hence into <hi>Ireland.</hi> And withall allow them a Trade to our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> plantations.</p>
               <p>This was the Advice of Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> and many eminent Merchants, given to <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Council; in 1658. as we find it, in Page 14 of his Book, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Merchants Petition and Remonſtrance:</hi> conſented to by the Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>How great Prudence, and Right State Policy were it, That all encouragements, and immunities, ſhould be given to thoſe of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that ſhould Sow,</hi> Flax, <hi>and</hi> Hemp, <hi>and that the ſame might be made into</hi> Linnen; <hi>whereby</hi> England <hi>might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dependant on</hi> Ireland <hi>for the ſame. Which would make that Country to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very Rich, and Flouriſh; And ſo the wealth of theſe Nations would be kept within themſelves. And for a mutual Correſpondency; all the wools of</hi> Ireland, <hi>ſhall be brought into</hi> England: <hi>and converted into Manufactures. And theſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures Exported into</hi> Ireland, <hi>to pay neither Cuſtome nor Exciſe. Whereby you will ſtill keep</hi> Ireland <hi>dependant on</hi> England; <hi>according to the practice of the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>in the</hi> Weſt-Indies: <hi>Where Vines for Wines, Olave Trees, for Oyles will grow better than in</hi> Spain. <hi>Yet none are ſuffered to be planted, upon pain of Death; becauſe they may keep them dependant on</hi> Spain, <hi>for the Commodities of their own growth, and by which comes unto them moſt benefit. For if they ſhould have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the planting of theſe in the</hi> Weſt-Indies: <hi>they would not have needed that Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from</hi> Spain. <hi>The</hi> Weſt-Indies <hi>being large Territories: and the Ground of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value; And the Ground of</hi> Ireland, <hi>being of: far leſs value, than that of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>an Acre there, not being worth</hi> 4 s. <hi>which is here worth</hi> 40 s. <hi>And Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being ſo much cheaper, and conſequently the Labours of men, they may afford their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48596:15"/>
Wool cheap; which being wrought into Manufactures, and that Countrey better ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than</hi> England, <hi>for Forreign Exportations, they might afford them the one half cheaper than the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould be able to do. So that</hi> Ireland <hi>in time, would get all the Trade from</hi> England; <hi>And it will be no prejudice to them, to bring their Wools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the price of Wool, will not therefore be the Cheaper in</hi> England: <hi>rather they will have thereby a greater value, becauſe the Commodities that are made of the ſame, will be exported again into</hi> Ireland; <hi>and, Forreign parts, where the prices of theſe Manufactures would otherwiſe be leſſen'd. And conſequently the Wools, by how much they ſhould make, and Export from</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This occaſions me to ſay, that <hi>Carolina</hi> is a Plantation that yields Wines, Oyles, Silks: As Sir <hi>Peter Colliton,</hi> and others proved before his Majeſties late Council of Plantations.</p>

               <head>Concerning the New Art of Preparing <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Hemp,</hi> before mentioned; it hath formerly been imparted to divers Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the Words following.</head>
               <p>(The Propoſers name, being <hi>Franciſcus Strick,</hi> a Flemming)</p>
               <p n="1">1. HE hath an Art, to Diſſolve it, and make it extraordinary Fine, Soft, and of a Silver Colour; ſo that both the <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Tow,</hi> may be Spun to an extraordinary fineneſs, and even Thread.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Flax</hi> dreſſers, that dreſſes <hi>Flax</hi> the ordinary way in all places, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce more than One Pound, and a Quarter, out of a ſtone of Flemiſh <hi>Flax,</hi> which ſtone ways Six Pounds. And the Propoſer can produce Four Pounds and a half fine, out of the ſaid Six Pounds; that ſhall Spin as fine a Thread as theirs, and ſhall bear a price currant with the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the diſſolving, he takes nothing from the <hi>Flax,</hi> but the Earthy pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and unprofitable ſubſtance: which they muſt of neceſſity take out at laſt, after the great charges, in the Hackling and Spinning of the ſaid <hi>Flax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt Boyl, or Scoure their Thread, or Twine, after it is Spun, to take out that filthineſs, which the Propoſer takes out before: And in ſo doing, they loſe out of every Pound of Twine, one quarter of a Pound; which is more worth, than the whole ſtone of <hi>Flax,</hi> before it was prepared.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Propoſers Twine or Yarn, needs not to be Boyled after it is Spun, or any other thing done to it. Onely given to the <hi>Weaver,</hi> or <hi>Throwſter:</hi> to be <hi>Woven,</hi> or <hi>Twined,</hi> into fine Thread.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It will be an evener Thread, and the <hi>Weaver</hi> needs not to ſtiffen it,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48596:16"/>
(with ſize,) as they do their own Thread, by which means it will be much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſpeedily Twined, and will be much ſtronger: thereby the ſtock will have more ſpeedy returnes. The Propoſer's charge being but ſmall, in the preparing of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Tow</hi> may be ſpun as well as the <hi>Flax</hi>; and the reaſon is, becauſe of its extraordinary fineneſs, before it is hackled. For in the Hackling, it is onely drawn together, and in the ſpinning, is eaſily drawn out again; And it is appraiſed, or rated, according to the fineneſs thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Of Three Pounds, or leſs, of this Yarne: there may be pieces of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Woven,</hi> cantaining 50 Ells flemiſh, or 30 Ells <hi>Engliſh</hi> meaſure: Or fine Sewing Thread, from Ten Shillings a Pound weight, to Three or Four Pounds Sterling the Pound weight.</p>
               <p n="9">9. What is affirmed concerning <hi>Flax,</hi> is common to <hi>Hemp.</hi> It being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame way; And there may be made of it, all ſorts of died Thread; fine Tykes for Beds, all ſorts of Fringes, may be, and commonly are Woven of the <hi>Hempen Yarn:</hi> And thereof better Linnen Cloth may be made, than is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made of <hi>Flax</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> as hitherto practiſed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Alſo a way will be found, to draw the Negotiation of the <hi>French</hi> Sail Cloth, and all kind of Tackle, concerning Ships, in as ſmall or big Cordage, as all other Nations afford, a Third part lighter, ſtronger, and leſſer ſtowage; to more profit to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and Companies of Merchants, as well as particular Trades.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Propoſer. Others add, that the Hurds, offall refuſe, or <hi>Tow,</hi> of <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Hemp,</hi> will ſerve to make a weaker, or a worſer ſort of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, or a good Printing and Writing Paper, here in <hi>England</hi>; ſome Tryals of all ſorts whereof have been lately, (and never before) made, by Mr. <hi>Henry Million,</hi> Stationer in the <hi>Old Bayley</hi>; who deſerves well of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for his indefatigable pains, in promoting the <hi>Paper, Woollen,</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> Manufactures; and well underſtands the Art of preparing of <hi>Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Flax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it is objected, that <hi>Engliſh Hemp,</hi> even that which is dew wet, and not River wet, is not ſo long; nor will not take Tarr, to make Cables of, as <hi>Swediſh Hemp</hi> doth, and conſequently, hath not that ſtrength, or durability.</p>
               <p>To this 'tis anſwered. That it hath been affirmed at the <hi>Royal-Society</hi>; That the late Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> ſent over an Agent, to <hi>Riga,</hi> to obſerve on what Ground, <hi>Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi> Royal, as they call it, grew there: And to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome of the ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being planted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> grew very well. And that the <hi>Hemp</hi> being fine dreſt, took Tarr; why may not the like be done in <hi>England?</hi> and ſome ſay it is in <hi>York-ſhire:</hi> the reaſon our <hi>Hemp</hi> will not take Tarr, is conceived to be, either becauſe it is not fine enough dreſt, or over hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have heard of a Rope maker, that having wetted our <hi>Hemp</hi> in <hi>May</hi> dew, ſteeved the ſame for ſome time; that it might ſomewhat ſwelter, moiſten, or impair it ſelf; and then it took Tarr but although our <hi>Hemp</hi> ſhould not be fit to make great Cordage; as Cables, and Halſers. Yet it is much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, and uſed by Forreigners, and our ſelves, for ſmall rigging: And is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be much lighter, and ſtronger, than any Forreign Cordage of the ſame ſize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48596:16"/>I believe, there only wants ſome good Experiments to be made, to determine the matter, whether our <hi>Engliſh Hemp,</hi> will take Tarr: and hope ſome of the Lords of the Committee, of his Majeſties Privy Council for Trade, will give order, to ſome of his Majeſties Rope-makers, to try the Experiments, before the <hi>Royal-Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Enquiry being made at the <hi>Royal-Society,</hi> what was known, concerning the aforeſaid Art of, preparing <hi>Flax</hi> and <hi>Hemp,</hi> Anſwer was given,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Art of preparing, and dreſſing of <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Hemp,</hi> was long known, and practiſed, by Mr. <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk:</hi> who many Years ſince, had ſhewed divers Examples of <hi>Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> ſo prepared; as alſo to one Mr. <hi>Stephens.</hi> And that Engines, or Tools might be contrived, ſo far to facilitate the work, that one man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with furniſhed, ſhould diſpatch as much, as divers could do without.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are divers Marſh, Sandy Clay, and other Grounds, on the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> belonging to the Crown, that ly waſt, or turn to little, or no benefit, that might properly be made uſe of, for planting of <hi>Hemp,</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> which admirably prepares for Corne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Mr. <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> lately imparted this new art of preparing, and Whitening of <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Hemp,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Fermin,</hi> who before he knew it, is ſaid to have Spun Thread ſo fine, out of <hi>Flax,</hi> that one Pound hath yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 20 Thouſand Ells, but now can produce much more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How much the working of Rough <hi>Hemp,</hi> into Cables, and wrought Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, hath been diſcouraged; may be taken from an inſtance at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> put in Print, by one Mr. <hi>Bowers,</hi> a Merchant of that place; who preſented his Papers, to divers Members of the Houſe, ſetting forth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in Anno 1653. Four Rope-makers of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> wrought up 208 Tuns of <hi>Hemp,</hi> for the then Parliament, beſides what they, and Six Maſter Rope-makers, wrought up for private uſes, a good part whereof, was <hi>Engliſh Hemp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the whole Town at preſent, doth not make 7 Tuns of Cordage in a Year. Whereas in thoſe times, there was 4 or 500 ſtone, at 14 <hi>lib.</hi> the ſtone, of <hi>Engliſh Hemp,</hi> (beſides Forreign) wrought up weekly into Cordage, and now it falls ſhort of 30 Stone.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> in a diſcourſe of the <hi>Norway</hi> Trade, ſaith, that we have loſt the making of 2800 Tuns of Cables, and Cordage, Yearly, in the County of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> The cauſe thereof is:</p>
               <p>The Cuſtomes of Cordage, and Cable Yarn, being Forreign wrought, and commonly bad, are but 8 Pence the Hundred weight, the ſame with the Cuſtomes of rough, or unwrought <hi>Hemp.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Conſequences hereof are.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The Importation of <hi>Hemp</hi> unwrought, is obſtructed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Marſh Grounds on the Coaſts, and within <hi>Lincoln-ſhire, Norfolk, Eſſex, Kent, &amp;c.</hi> Formerly Sown with <hi>Hemp,</hi> either ly waſte, or are now for want of a proportionable Conſumption Sown with Corn, to an incredible detriment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48596:17"/>3. The Employment and skill, many poor People might attain unto, in Sowing, Planting and Manufacturing ſuch <hi>Hemp,</hi> either for Netts, Twine, Canvas, Cordage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is loſt, and for want thereof, Rents, and Lands, are fallen, and the Pariſhes are burthened with ſuch poor.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Nation, if a Warr breaks out, when his Majeſties ſtores are not thoroughly repleniſhed, may ly under a ſurprize, and either be barr'd the <hi>Sound,</hi> or be driven to great inconveniences.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Remedy.</head>
               <p>Is, to continue the preſent duty of 8 <hi>d. per.</hi> Hundred weight on unwrought, or rough <hi>Hemp,</hi> and to enlarge the duty of Cuſtomes on Cordage, and Cable Yarn, imported, 5 or 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred weight.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Conſequences will be.</head>
               <p n="1">1. If <hi>Hemp</hi> be either imported or ſown here, it will give Imployment to the People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Cordage, and Cable Yarn, be ſtill imported (as it is like, it will be for ſome Years) the duty is multiplied to his Majeſties advantage; As for inſtance, the Town of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> Yearly ſpends, 2 Thouſand Tuns of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or thereabouts, which at 8 <hi>d.</hi> the Hundred weight Cuſtome comes to 1333.6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> Whereas, at 6 <hi>s.</hi> the Hundred weight, the Cuſtomes would come to 12000. <hi>l.</hi> The like is the caſe of other places.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the expence of the Nation in Linnen, Cordage, and Canvas, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſs than a Million a Year. With which, it is fit we ſhould ſupply our ſelves, as far as we can, by diſcouraging Forreign, by an impoſition, of a Penny an Ell, and poſſibly a higher duty on <hi>Flax,</hi> and unwrought <hi>Hemp,</hi> to encourage the Planting of it here, in which caſe we muſt be wary, that it be not oppreſſed, with Taxes, and Tyths. Now to encourage the Manufacturing we offer,</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>A Propoſal for the Advancement of the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> and employment of the Poor.</head>
               <p>FOraſmuch, as the Fiſhery probably connot proſper, without good encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements; and in time of peace, cannot well employ their Boys in Summer time, and furthermore, a Warr may happen, and prevent Fiſhing; And conſequently, cauſe the adventurers to give over: To prevent ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, it is propoſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Royal-Fiſhery</hi> Company, undertake the making of Canvas, at <hi>Clerken-well</hi> workehouſe, to ſupply his Majeſties ſtores with, it being well known, that our own Canvas is as good, and as ſtrong, yea, better than any Forreign.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his Majeſty be graciouſly pleaſed, to take off to the value of 10

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Company pay his Majeſty 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> for the advance of the Money, out of ſuch bounty or benevolence, the Parliament ſhall be pleaſed to give, which if but narrow: may be in this manner enlarged, by letting the Company gain that in his Majeſties affaires, which otherwiſe muſt be got by others.</p>

                  <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> Thou mayeſt perceive the Advantage I have taken from a report, agreed and drawn up by a Council of Trade in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and if we had enjoyed a good one continually in <hi>England,</hi> with proper inſtructions, I believe the Nation might have been twice as rich and much ſtronger at Sea, than now it is. I my ſelf about three years ſince, drew up a Draught of inſtructions: ſuch as do not interfere with the work of the preſent Committee, of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt honourable privy Council, for Trade, with a Narrative of the loſſes of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſheries, in all making about 7 Sheets of Paper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to publiſh the ſame: after it hath obtained Licenſe, from one of his Majeſties Principal Secretaries of State, for there are ſome things in it, of a private Nature, and others that much concern the advancement of his Majeſties revenue, and prevention of frauds.</p>
               <p>The preamble is this. That as ſoon as ſuch Council ſhall be conſtituted, and their Houſe agreed upon, that it be declared to all the Nation, in the <hi>Gazets,</hi> and upon the <hi>Exchange:</hi> That his Majeſties Gracious intentions, in erecting the ſame is to encourage the Manufactures, and employ the poor of the Nation. And that hereupon, all Merchants, Trades-men, Corporations, Counties, and places, be invited and deſired, to ſend up their Complaints, and aggreivances about Trade, and Manufactures, or any Act relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to the Secretary, who is to Collect, and draw up out of all Papers ſent in, or otherwiſe procurable, all that can be pertinently ſaid, on any argument of Trade, by way of Debitor and Creditor: all that can be ſaid, <hi>pro</hi> on one ſide or the left hand Page; and all <hi>Contra</hi> on the right hand Page, obſerving the like Method, in Replies, and Duplies.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the <hi>Inland</hi> inſtructions was about the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act, to conſider ſome Laws in being, whether they hinder, or encourage Trade, particularly the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act about Cattel. And to be the better ſatisfied about the ſame, to ſend to all Counties, and Corporations, for their ſentiments therein, how much they conceive they are benefited, or damaged thereby, and to give an account of how much feeding, and breeding grounds they have, and thence according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſtate an Accompt, and Report in readineſs, when called for, the like for the Act of Navigation; and whether our Trade to the <hi>Sound</hi> be not obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, and the building of Ships, and Veſſels, for the <hi>Norway</hi> and Fiſhing Trades hindred, and what the Annual damage may be.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Inſtruction about Forreign affairs was. That whereas, ſuits of Law, in <hi>Chancery,</hi> about Merchants Accompts, depend long there, to the great trouble of the Court, the vexation of the Maſters, to whom the ſame are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and in the event, to the ruine of the Parties concerned; to prevent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48596:18"/>
which, the Inſtruction is to obtain the Conſtitution of the Court of Merchants in <hi>Holland,</hi> for ending Suits of that nature, and to conſider whether the like may not without inconveniency be put in practice here, and what additional Laws, Conſtitutions, and Inſtructions, will be neceſſary for the ſetling thereof.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of ſuch Inſtruction Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> thus renders:</p>
               <p>That tedious Law Suits create great Expence, (which otherwiſe would go in Trade to the benefit of the whole Nation) the makers of the Law not underſtanding Accompts, could not provide for the ſame; and the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors having their Study by the Law, and they and the Judges having no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Merchants affairs, or skilled in Accompts, they cannot be ſo compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Deciders and Judges thereof, and great inconveniencies come unto all Traders for want of ſuch a Court (where rhe Parties alone and their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhould be heard) ſpending both their Monies and their time in Law, and after many years of Conteſt, for the moſt part their buſineſs is referred out of <hi>Chancery</hi> to Merchants, or ended at Law, as it were, at hit or miſs, when very often both Parties have ſpent more than double the value of the thing they conteſted for, being neceſſitated for every motion or tryal to have many Lawyers on both ſides: Whereas in <hi>Spain,</hi> and other parts, there can be admitted for each Party but one Lawyer, nor can there be more preſent in any of the Courts where the Cauſes are tryed, than one Lawyer for the Plaintiff, and another for the Defendant; and to the eminenteſt of them 20 <hi>s.</hi> is an extraordinary pay, when he ſhall attend purpoſely for the hearing of that one Cauſe ſeveral days. To which may be added, that it diſcourages Merchant-Strangers to live and trade with us.</p>
               <p>Being loth to omit mentioning ſuch an Aggreivance, I come now to give the Reader a Copy of a Paper formerly drawn up to aſſert, that the <hi>Royal-Fiſhery</hi> Company when well filled and conſtituted, are proper to be rendred <hi>A Council of Trade,</hi> but with this limitation:</p>
               <p>That it be not hence concluded that none but the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> Company, nor all of them ought to be concerned in ſuch a Council, nor that others ſhall be excluded; the Regulation and Choice as to Number and Perſons, is moſt humbly ſubmitted to His Majeſty's grave Prudence, who by adding ſome eminent Perſons to ſuch a Company, may have the more frequent Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how ſuch Affairs move on.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The REASONS are,</head>
               <p n="1">1. Such Company did of late, and 'tis hoped will again conſiſt of Members enough, to wit, Nobles, Gentlemen, and Merchants, where out at all times to have a ſufficient Choice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such Company connot thrive (at leaſt in its Infancy) without good Encouragements from the Crown or the Nation, (by its Repreſentative in Parliament) and therefore in lieu of ſuch Encouragements, may be put on Duty to earn the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48596:18"/>3. In regard of the Capacity the Members thereof are propoſed to be in, to wit, of obtaining the Honour of being of the number of ſuch Council, it will excite many who aim at His Majeſty's and the Nation's welfare, to become Adventurers in ſuch Company, which in probability may in ſome time become as ſplendid as either the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> or <hi>African</hi> Company, who thrive already without any ſuch Encouragements.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If ſuch Company (at leaſt for ſome years) be allowed Houſe-Rent by His Majeſty, and Salaries to their Officers for doing the work of the Fiſhery, and withall, that of the Council, it is as good as ſo much given to the ſaid <hi>Fiſhery</hi> Company; whereas to ſettle it on any other Conſtitution, were to put His Majeſty to a needleſs Charge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea, and it may be ſuſpected to almoſt a fruitleſs Charge, for it is not reaſonable to expect that eminent Perſons named to be Members of ſuch Council ſhall be ſo diligent in attending an Affair, whereby they have no profit, nor no particular concernment of their own, as wherein they have, eſpecially if their Houſe have an inconvenient Situation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If a War break forth and hinder Fiſhery Affairs, the Company muſt then loſe Houſe-Rent and Officers Salaries, which would be a diſcouragement to them, and may by this means be prevented.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The main work of ſuch Council, will be firſt to call for and receive the Complaints, Senſe, and Informations of the trading People of the Nation about Aggreivances concerning Trade, and the improvements of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and the amendments of Acts relating thereto, and thence to draw up all that can reaſonably be ſaid <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Former Councils have not preſcribed this, which ought to be the main work of the Officers, and ſuch Councils have been ſo ſlow or ill paid, that little of this kind could be expected; whereas it is ſuppoſed the <hi>Royal Fiſhery</hi> will be ſo well paid by Effects in their hands, that there will be no failure of the like kind hereafter: And doubtleſs it is very material to encourage the writing on Arguments of Trade as here propounded.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>Royal Fiſhery</hi> Company well conſtituted with a good Stock, may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Sound</hi> with Herrings before the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by uſing the Iſlands of <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Shetland</hi>; yea alſo <hi>Portugal, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> by fiſhing in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, where Herrings and Cod arrive ſix weeks ſooner than in the <hi>Channel</hi>; yea alſo with Cod and Ling caught about <hi>Angleſey:</hi> To which (beſides the advantage of time) may be added, the propinquity of Situation; yea, ſuch Company may alſo have a Trade to <hi>New England,</hi> for building of Veſſels, and returning with Cod, Salmon, and Sturgeon, (if it prove good and well-cured) and with poor Jack from <hi>Newfound-Land</hi>; whence it may be reaſonably preſumed, ſuch Company, by reaſon of its Foreign vent and returns, may have a greater inſight in Foreign Trade, than any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The planting of Hemp and Flax, and the Manufactures thereof, as alſo the furniſhing of materials for Paper (if not undertaking that Manufacture) and conſequently employing the Poor, and many Trades will much depend upon the example and directions of this Company, whence they may be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48596:19"/>
judged a better conſtitution for Inland Affairs than any other, and are like to afford more Parliament-men, to ſpeak to matters of this nature.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of this Treatiſe, there came to my hands a printed Paper of the learned and moſt renowned Sir <hi>William Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> about <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel: A Copy of it followeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some of the OBSERVATIONS made by <hi>W.P.</hi> upon the <hi>Trade of</hi> IRISH CATTEL.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat the value of the Oxen and Sheep (their Hides, Tallow, and Skins deducted) which were ever imported in one year out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> were never worth above 80000 <hi>l.</hi> nor above the hundredth part of the Rents of Land in <hi>England,</hi> nor above the hundredth part of the Butchers meat yearly ſpent in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Ireland</hi> never yet did, nor could ſpare, as many Sheep and Oxen alive or dead, as would maintain a fifth part more People than now it hath, that is to ſay, than would maintain about 1300000 People, of which number there are about 1100000 now in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas <hi>Ireland</hi> contains three quarters as much Land as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and there be above 6000000 of People in <hi>England</hi> it follows, that if <hi>Ireland</hi> can furniſh Fleſh meat but unto 1300000, that <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gland</hi> cannot with equal plenty furniſh meat unto ſaid 6000000.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Owners of breeding Lands have ſince the Prohibition not gotten above 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Head more for their Cattel than before it which the Owners of the feeding Lands have paid them and loſt. Moreover the Mariners of <hi>England</hi> have loſt the getting of 9 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Head for Freight and Primage, and the People of <hi>England</hi> have loſt 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Head more for driving and grazing; the King hath loſt 3 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Head for Cuſtom on both ſides, beſides Officers Fees; and the Traders in Hides and Tallow have loſt what they might have gained out of 15 <hi>s. per</hi> Head; and the Merchants and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans of <hi>England</hi> have loſt yearly what they might have gained by 140000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures; the Wool-growers of <hi>England</hi> have loſt as much as their Wool is fallen; by reaſon of the extraordinary Sheep-walks now in <hi>Ireland</hi>; the Landlords of <hi>Ireland</hi> reſident in England, have loſt 5 <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> extraordinary for exchange of Money. Laſtly, the Bulk of the People of <hi>England</hi> have loſtſ one Half-peny for every pound of Fleſh meat they have ſpent, amounting for all <hi>England</hi> unto about 2000000 <hi>per annum,</hi> of which great ſum, the Owners even of breeding Lands have paid three times more in the enhanſement of Wages and Manufactures, than they got by the raiſed price of their Cattel above-mentioned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since this Prohibition, the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> (who are 800000 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) have gotten a Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> to eat Fleſh five days in the week, whereas formerly they did but four, in which extraordinary day of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, there is as much meat ſpent by the Papiſts in a year, as ever was brought into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48596:19"/>6. Although a Beaſt worth 40 <hi>s.</hi> might be brought out of <hi>Ireland</hi> even to <hi>London</hi> for about 20 <hi>s.</hi> yet the Land of <hi>England</hi> generally taken is worth five times as much, Acre for Acre, as the Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> generally taken; neither can the Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> riſe up to a level of value with thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> without the Miſſion of ſome millions of People more into <hi>Ireland</hi> than now are there, nor without the expence of more Millions in buildings and improvements, than all <hi>Ireland</hi> now is worth; nor can the Lands of <hi>England</hi> fall down to a level with thoſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without vaſt Depopulations and Devaſtations preceding.</p>
               <p>Every of the before-mentioned particulars can be readily proved from grounds of Senſe, known, granted, or Authentique.</p>
               <p>Here it is not improper to acquaint the Reader, that <hi>Ireland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rebellion was planted with Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the Lands were in their poſſeſſion; but now after ſo great a Deſolation, and Deſtruction as the Wars made, moſt of the Lands were planted and peopled by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> who adventured their Lives and Fortunes in reducing it, who carried over with them the beſt Cattel, Horſes, and Sheep, <hi>England</hi> could afford, where they have raiſed ſuch a Breed, as will compare with the beſt in <hi>England</hi> for largeneſs and fatneſs, and the Wool, Butter, and Cheeſe there raiſed, is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to what is made in <hi>England</hi> for goodneſs, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have many lean Cattel to ſpare, but their Sheep need no fattening.</p>
               <p>The Laws there are made by a Parliament, conſiſting of moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> with aim eſpecially to encourage the making of Cloth and Woollen Manufactures, to the end, they may ſupply Foreign Markets, which they doubt not to effect ere long at half the price <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth goes at: And they do by their Laws diſcourage the bringing of their Wool into <hi>England,</hi> and have laid a great Cuſtom upon all Cloth, Stuffs, Stockings, and Hats, that ſhall be imported out of <hi>England.</hi> This they do acknowledge in Print, and that they have furniſhed <hi>Holland, Flanders, France, Portugal, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Streights</hi>: plentifully with Proviſions, namely, Beef at 9 or 10 <hi>s.</hi> the hundred weight; confeſſing, that not only <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but other Nations have their Factors reſiding in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to buy up Beef, Fiſh, Tallow, and Hides, and that all their Ports are well ſtored with Shipping, whereby they ſupply all thoſe Parts with Proviſion, and make their returns with thoſe Commodities the Kingdom can vend, which they can have much cheaper than from <hi>England,</hi> and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48596:20"/>
plus they return in Money: This I take out of a Sheet, printed with Allowance by <hi>J.B.</hi> in 1677.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Particulars following are taken out of a Letter from Ireland, <hi>printed in</hi> 1677. viz.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. We find more advantage by Victualling Foreigners, than we had formerly by a whole Sale in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. You were provided by a ſufficient Act of Parliament to be the only Mart for Wool, it being made Felony to tranſport it into Foreign Parts, and Confiſcation to import it to you otherwiſe than crude and unmanufactured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. This is not to be exported neither without Licenſe, paying both the King's Duty, and that to the Lord Lieutenant,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. Which is at leaſt 2 <hi>s.</hi> a Stone, beſides Freight, Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Market Charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. All exported, muſt be firſt entred for <hi>England</hi> and pay theſe Duties, though afterwards it loſeth its way at Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. An Account is given of their Progreſs in ſetting up the Woollen Manufacture.</p>
               <p>Much Proviſions alſo and Goods they Ship off to our Plantations, from whence 'tis probable in time we muſt export Money for our own ſupply.</p>
               <p>Againſt this whole Diſcourſe may be raiſed the following grand <hi>Objection,</hi> to wit, an Opponent may inſiſt, that the admiſſion of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel cauſeth Rents of breeding Grounds exceedingly to fall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Intereſt of the Owners and Farmers thereof; and this is the reaſon why Cattel, in themſelves a Bleſſing, are called a Nuſance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Objection is granted, and comes to paſs, becauſe we cannot Victual our Neighbours and their Shipping, nor moſt of our own, nor is the ſale of Fleſh much hindred by Fiſh or <hi>Izeland</hi> Cod, for of late years little or none hath been ſpent in His Majeſty's <hi>Navy-Royal:</hi> But a remedy is propounded. On the other ſide, the Owners of feeding Grounds, the Merchandizing and Trading part of the Nation, or Corporations, who bear above two Third parts of the Charge of the Government, ſuſtain the greater wrong,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48596:20"/>
which in the event will be very prejudicial, if not ruinous to the whole.</p>
               <p>I my ſelf have my life in Lands in <hi>Marſhland</hi> in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which tell from 32 <hi>l.</hi> to 17 <hi>l.</hi> a year, but is of late riſen to 21 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Gentlemen Owners of feeding Grounds in our <hi>Midland</hi> Counties, whoſe Rents are fallen above one quarter of what they uſually made before the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act had a being, they know not to what other cauſe to impute it, and I have not liberty to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion particulars.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a <hi>London</hi> Miniſter, who hath Lands in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> which fell from 60 <hi>l.</hi> to 30 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and both he and ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Gentlemen aforeſaid, are forced to ſtock their Grounds, and keep them in their own hands, committing the management to Bayliffs.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Letter, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. ſaith, That if the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were now to tell Counties, he hath been lately aſſured from ſome in <hi>England,</hi> that thoſe Counties that find not themſelves bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted, and thoſe that are really aggreived by this Act, do by this time upon Experiment, and ſecond thoughts, make up the greateſt Party.</p>
               <p>And <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he ſaith, That when it paſſed, it was not without ſome repugnance at firſt in His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is obvious, His Majeſty could not but foreſee ſome of the ill conſequences thereof, as namely, that it would cauſe his Duty of Cuſtoms to fall, leſſen our Navigation, much increaſe the charge of Victualling his Navy, and diſoblige all his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which might be of dangerous Conſequence.</p>
               <p>But to reſtore an Union with them and at home, ſuppoſe they conſent to the terms Propounded in <hi>pag.</hi> 9, 23.</p>
               <p>Then there will be a conſiderable Acceſſion made to His Majeſty's Revenue in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to wit, near the value of all the Commodities exported out of that Kingdom that come not to us, and this will help to maintain a Navy, there or in the Channel; and ſuch help is but highly neceſſary, for one of the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty was pleaſed to inform me, that 300000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame conſtantly allotted and paid to that uſe, would but defray the ordinary annual Harbour Charges of Repairs, Yards,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48596:21"/>
Moorage, the Wages of Workmen and Labourers, the Salaries of Officers, and 14 Men of War at Sea.</p>
               <p>Whereas to furniſh Stores, build a neceſſary ſupply of Ships from time to time, and maintain a competent Fleet abroad, will require a far greater Sum, as hath been repreſented to the late Long Parliament.</p>
               <p>So that I hope if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Act paſs, it ſhall not be perpetual, and that in the interim, our Grandees will propoſe, and receive terms of Accommodation with <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>If the former Meaſures take, theſe muſt be the Conſequences.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Poor will obtain Employment; in other Nations they have been their Renown, Wealth, and Strength, but here on the contrary, our Shame, Improveriſhment, and Burthen; hence to employ the Poor, and to render idle beggarly Perſons profitable Members to the Kingdom, to reclaim Vice, and encourage Induſtry by proper Expedients, cannot but be Subjects that may always deſerve and expect due encouragement from Authority, but more eſpecially now, when too too long empoveriſhments make us groan for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, which if obtained, will be a bitter potion to our too powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours abroad,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Navigation and ſtrength will encreaſe; and if we can be either happy or ſafe without Navigation, and maintain it without a Fiſhery, and mannage it without Pilots, 'tis well; but if not, the Fiſhery is of an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſity to the welfare, both of King and People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Merchants, and Trading part of the Nation, will be encouraged, and are they not as Writers denominate them. The great Revenue of the King, the honour of the Kingdom, a noble Profeſſion, a School of Skill, the ſupply of our Wants, the ſource of Employments, the improvement of our Manufactures, and cauſe of our Exportation, the Nurſery of our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Walls of the Kingdom, the means of our Treaſure, the ſinew of our Wars, and the terrour of our Enemies.</p>
