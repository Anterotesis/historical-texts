            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now (Noble Sir) you ſheltered my perſon under your roof, and favour in the late Times of Tyranny and Confuſion; and when I entered into the Miniſtery by the Dore, with an Epiſcopal Ordination on my head, in a time, and place that would for that cauſe only render me ſlighted and rejected of the moſt, you therefore contracted the beams of your Countenance more auſpiciouſly upon me; nor ſhunned to impart to me your pious and loyal thoughts of heart for our then perſecuted Church, and diſtreſſed Soveraign. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence you were pleaſed to put in me, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably obliged my ſoul to you in the greateſt ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dearneſs of honour and affection; ſo that if I may be ſo free with you, I can ſincerely profeſs, no Gentleman in the world poſſeſſes a greater love and eſteem in my heart than your ſelf.</p>

            <p>And ſince I have had thoughts of making my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on theſe things publick, thinking to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething to the return of our proſperity, by turning if it may be, ſome from their iniquity, I have been glad hereby to catch the opportunity, to teſtifie to the world my due reſentments of your manifold undeſerved kindneſſes; a grateful acknowledgment being the only requital I am able to make for all your accumulated favours, a poor requital indeed, when thus by paying my old ſcore I run but farther into your debt, begging your acceptance from him, who remains</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE diſmal Diſpenſations of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us, in that ſeries of ſad Judgments lately inflicted on us, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſtroying War, devouring Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and deſolating Fire in <hi>London,</hi> having ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up my Soul in a deep ſenſe of our hainous ſins as the true cauſe of our heavy ſufferings, I remained ſome time in a confuſed plunge of ſpirit hereby, all other buſineſs and employs ſuperſeded, till at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting my diſordered thoughts, I brought them to a certain compoſure, and to render them more profitable to my ſelf, and to allay the ſharpneſs of ſorrow with the pleaſure of ſome phancy, I framed them in metre.</p>
            <p>I began with the War, therein conſidering not the Hiſtory as to the management of men, but the calamity as to the judgment of God: I went on with the Peſtilence guided in my Contemplation by the courſe of that, conſidering the riſe, increaſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
<pb facs="tcp:98038:4"/>
and deplorable effects thereof, as they happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but having no thoughts all this time of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I wrote, concluding with my ſelf in regard theſe Reflections would not be ſin ſhed but with the Sickneſs, they would be then leſs ſeaſonable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and profitable to the Publick, the ſenſe of Judgments too frequently wearing off with the ſuffering, and ſcarce any thing concerning them than making impreſſion on moſt hearts.</p>
            <p>But then the ſtartling and aſtoniſhing news of the Cities Conflagration, hurried my Muſe to a new wrack of tormenting griefs, rending me as many others for a time capable of nothing but to ſtand in the way for News, wherein for ſome days together we ſtill met with <hi>Job</hi>'s meſſengers, with ſad tidings of increaſing miſery: till at length occurring the joyful report of the miraculous extinguiſhing of the Flames, and unexpected Preſervation of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed part of the City and Suburbs, my mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſedate and quiet, and my Muſe ſet her ſelf to reflect on this woe as the former, not without ſome thoughts of Publication, imagining this had revived mens ſenſe of Gods juſt diſpleaſure, and might render them capable of remorſe for their ſins, procuring theſe dire effects of it in ſuch a dreadful ſucceſſion of woes: then purpoſing to diſcover all our ſins as cauſe of our ſufferings, and knowing that by the Law is the knowledge of ſin, I run over the
<pb facs="tcp:98038:5"/>
Law of God in my thoughts, and obſerved how ſins of all ſorts againſt every Commandment, and others more directly againſt the Goſpel abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, ſo that our ſins being found ſo great, and numerous, we may not wonder our ſufferings have been ſo many and calamitous: And what ever God in his merciful Providence may ſeem to be doing for the removal of his Judgments, and reſtoring of Health, and Peace, and Proſperity to us, and we may flatter our ſelves with hopes of ſeeing good days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; yet otherwiſe than on the foundation of our Repentance and better Obedience, can we build no aſſurance of ſetled Proſperity for the future; for ſhould it now clear up, yet another cloud may ſoon riſe, if we ſtill provoke the God of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And therefore I proceed to add an Hortatory part, perſwading to Repentance and Obedience to Gods Laws, as the moſt certain cure of our Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and ſure way to have better times, which, (if (as we hope) our woes are in a manner paſt, yet) may be of good uſe to us all for the ſecuring us in a flouriſhing condition for time to come, the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any People uſually ebbing and flowing with their Piety and Virtue.</p>
            <p>And ſo at laſt, I add a Conſolatory Part as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial for to chear the penitent and humble, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing there, the Hiſtorical Relation of our War o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Firſt Part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98038:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>The three firſt Parts I have compoſed in a familiar kind of compleat Verſe, as being for the moſt part Reprehenſive, and Hortatory, therein condeſcending to the meaneſt capacities, as meant for the uſe and benefit of all: In the laſt, where the Subject is more Heroick, ſuitably I uſe quattrains cloſing the ſenſe with a compleat, and riſe to a little higher, though not aiming (if I could attain it) at a lofty ſtrain: I ſeek where to make my Verſe ſerve my Subject, and not ſubject my nobler matter to my Metre.</p>
            <p>Now candid Reader, I hope the ſincerity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of my Deſign in this Work may obtain an Apology for any defects in the management<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Divinity excuſe the want of Phanſie: I do more than ſuſpect I ſhall fall under the cenſure of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Sectaries, though piouſly affected, becauſe I tax their Errors; of Vitious perſons, though loyal and conformable, becauſe I tax their vices; of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, eſpecially ſuch as mask traiterous and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns with pious pretences to ſeduce the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe I lay them open to the world, <hi>furtivis nudatos coloribus,</hi> and tax their villanies, however palliated, as contributing to our Calamities: But my Prayer to God is, that he would open all their eyes and turn their hearts, the firſt to follow after Truth, the ſecond Holineſs, and the third ſort the Truth of Holineſs, then I am ſure we ſhould be a flouriſhing Church and Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98038:6"/>If thou blame me (Reader) for any where rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up old ſores, I will aſſure thee I do not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than for fear that falſe Prophets have healed the hurt of the Daughter of our People ſlightly, to let out the corruption the right way by Repentance, leſt they feſter and break inwardly and kill their ſouls. If thou complain of rough handling, know it is done with a Chirurgeons heart, to heal and not wound: and if my Patient cry out of me in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſore as an Enemy, I am well aſſured if he would ſuffer the cure, he would acknowledge me in the end to be his friend: and when in ſearching thy ſore I touch thee to the quick, lay thine hand on thine own heart confeſſing thy corruption and ſin, rather than ſtretch out that, or move thy tongue to ſmite me who only mean thy health, and welfare.</p>
            <p>Read on, and the ſweetneſs of Conſolation at laſt will allay the tartneſs of Reprehenſion before: nauſeate therefore nothing herein, ſince all will do thee good, if thou with candor receive and digeſt it. Accept then kindly what is intended ſincerely for Gods, thy Souls, and this Nations glory from him who is</p>

            <l>Fire ſtrove to drink up Sea, Sea to quench out</l>

            <l>Entring to take away our darling child,</l>
            <l>Oh what a plight ſhould we be in? how wild,</l>
            <l>And quite beſide themſelves, would ſurely be</l>
            <l>The tender Mothers of the Infantry?</l>
            <l>Who, that their ſenſes have, would not deſire</l>

            <l>His brains daſht on the wall before his eyes,</l>
            <l>And how the ſprawling Corpſe convulſing dies,</l>
            <l>Rather than ſuch ſhould us of them bereave,</l>

            <l>Deplores not the ſad ſtate of <hi>Grecian</hi> Land?</l>
            <l>Now then it were a noble enterpriſe,</l>

            <l>You'le never find the ſinful City clean.</l>
            <l>But now lets think on thoſe who ſtay behind,</l>
            <l>Diſtreſt in Body, and Eſtate, and Mind:</l>
            <l>Who know not where to ſly, and fear to ſtay;</l>
            <l>But yet muſt bear the burthen of the day;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98038:14"/>A wrathful day, a diſmal time, wherein</l>

            <l>But it increaſes, ſpreads, deſtroyes, doth make</l>
            <l>Such as remain, for fear of death to quake.</l>
            <l>Now might you ſee red Croſſes there great ſtore,</l>

            <l>The Wardſman ſtanding, as if he were ſent</l>
            <l>Deaths Bayliffe to arreſt the houſe for Rent,</l>
            <l>And turn the dwellers out; and ſure I am,</l>
            <l>But few could live long there after he came:</l>
            <l>Now Knells of death continually do ring,</l>
            <l>And that ſame doleful ſound of Buryers, bring</l>
            <l>Your dead out, mortal Ears with terror pierce;</l>
            <l>And now a Cart becomes the only Hearſe</l>
            <l>To bear a heap of bodies to their Grave,</l>
            <l>Which neither Obſequies, nor Rites can have</l>

            <l>Now might you ſee all faces blackneſs gather,</l>

            <l>Shed death among them, but from this a Fire,</l>
            <l>A waſting fire: ſcarce had that Vial done</l>

            <l>This foſter'd in their flight, brought home again</l>
            <l>In their return, bred their enſuing bane:</l>

            <l>Whom <hi>judgments</hi> do not mend, they oft make <hi>worſe</hi>:</l>
            <l>The Beaſts God ſav'd in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark came out</l>
            <l>Beaſts as they went in, and ſome Men, no doubt,</l>
