            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
FROM THE
CHANCELLOUR
OF
MARY-LAND,
TO
Col. Henry Meeſe,
Merchant in <hi>LONDON:</hi>
Concerning the late Troubles in <hi>MARY-LAND.</hi>

               <salute>Colonel <hi>Meeſe,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOAKELY being now ready to Sail, I thought it fit to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the receipt of your Letters this year; I have only that before
me which you writ by Mr. <hi>Ambroſe Sanderſon,</hi> and ſhall for your
ſake, his Functions, and his own, ſerve him in any thing I may;
The reſt of your Letters I have left at home, ſo muſt defer my anſwer till
the next Ship.</p>
            <p>I find by the Maſters of the Ships, that the Impriſonment of Capt. <hi>Joſias
Fendal,</hi> and Capt. <hi>John Coode,</hi> hath made ſo great a noiſe at <hi>London;</hi> and
therefore I thought it neceſſary to give you an account of it, as having
been formerly an Inhabitant of <hi>Mary-land,</hi> and an Eye-witneſs of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Capt. <hi>Fendal,</hi> in the years 1659, and 1660. when he Perfidiouſly
broke his Oath and Truſt, being Governour of this Province; cancell'd
his Commiſſion from the then Lord Proprietor, and took a new one from
the Aſſembly. For that offence he was only Fin'd, and declar'd uncapable
of ever bearing any Office in this Province, as you may remember, and that
hath gaul'd him ever ſince; and to get into Office, he now ſets all his Wits
to work, inciting the People in <hi>Charles</hi>'s County to <hi>Mutiny</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi>
and Tampering with ſome of the Juſtices of Peace in St. <hi>Maries</hi> County:
Firſt, telling the People they were Fools to pay any Taxes, (though laid
by Act of Aſſembly;) that there was Wars in <hi>England</hi> between the King
and the Parliament; and that now nothing was Treaſon, a man might ſay
any thing: And then to the Juſtices, hinting how eaſie a matter it was to
overturn the Government here, by ſeizing the Lord Proprietor, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
Secretary, and Colonel <hi>Darnal,</hi> all the reſt (as he ſaid) ſignifying
nothing. The Juſtice of Peace told him, he had no Commiſſion, and that
it would be down-right Rebellion; He went from him, and revealed this
diſcourſe to another Juſtice, who diſcovered this whole matter to my Lord.
<pb facs="tcp:54211:2"/>
Shortly after this, Capt. <hi>John Coode</hi> falls upon a time, at a Feaſt, into diſcourſe
with a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who was Suing a Friend of his for a piece of Land; and
ſaid, That he need not trouble himſelf for a piece of Land, for that no <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> in <hi>Mary-land</hi> ſhould be Owner of any Land at all in this Province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three Months; for that he had ten thouſand Men at his Command; and
he could make it High-Water, or Low-Water, when he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Coode</hi> was obſerved to make Viſits to <hi>Fendal,</hi> which he never
uſed to do before, and they both went over into <hi>Virginia;</hi> and within few
days after their return from thence, a Bo<gap reason="illegible: torn page" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> deſigned for <hi>Carolina</hi> from <hi>Mary-land,</hi>
was forced in by bad weather to a Houſe in <hi>Virginia,</hi> where the Owner
of the Boat heard that <hi>Fendal</hi> and <hi>Coode</hi> had been thereabouts; and that
the whole diſcourſe there was, that <hi>Fendal</hi> intended to raiſe <hi>Mutiny</hi> in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-land,</hi>
and that he and <hi>Coode</hi> would carry their Families into <hi>Virginia.</hi>
This being Sworn to, and at that very inſtant Information being given,
that one of Capt. <hi>Coode's</hi> Servants reported, that his Maſter intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his Family on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following into <hi>Virginia;</hi> made my Lord
think it high time to look to the Security and Peace of the Province, and
therefore ſent Colonel <hi>Darnal</hi> with about ten Men, to bring <hi>Coode</hi> and
<hi>Fendal</hi> before him and the Council; Colonel <hi>Darnal</hi> came to <hi>Coodes</hi> when
it was light, and the Servants uſing to go to work opened the door, at
which Colonel <hi>Darnal</hi> entered alone, leaving his Men without, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Mr. <hi>Coode's</hi> Chamber, told him he was his Priſoner; <hi>Coode</hi> at firſt
laid his hand upon his Sword, but at laſt yielded; after which Col. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
went over the River, and took Capt. <hi>Fendal</hi> alſo, and brought them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Lord and Council. And the next day after, Mrs. <hi>Coode</hi> did Hector
my Lord at a rate I never heard from a VVoman before; by which you may
conclude ſhe was not run mad with the fright of her Husbands being pull'd
out of his Bed, as we are told her Son <hi>Slye</hi> falſly reports at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three or four days after I ſaw her at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and then I did ſuſpect ſhe
would not continue long in her Wits, knowing ſhe had been Mad a while
upon the death of her eldeſt Son, about the year 1659 and had heard ſhe
ſometimes fell into the like Fits ſince.</p>
            <p>After this, my Lord took Bail for <hi>Coode</hi> within five days, but <hi>Fendal</hi> was
kept till my Lord had ſecured Lieutenant <hi>George Godfrey,</hi> who laid a <hi>Plot</hi>
to unhorſe his Captain, and carry the Troop to the reſcue of <hi>Fendal,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſearching for the <hi>Indians,</hi> that had Murther'd ſome of our Planters,
and were daily expected to fall into <hi>Charles</hi> County, in great numbers; as
they afterwards did in leſs than three VVeeks.</p>
            <p>My Lord intends to ſend over their Tryals, that the VVorld may ſee
with how much Favour the Court proceeded, and to ſtop the Mouth of
Calumny; So that I ſhall not trouble you now any further, but ere I make
an end, muſt preſent my own and my VVifes ſervice to your Second-ſelf,
as you ſtile her; and ſo ſubſcribe my ſelf, Sir,</p>
