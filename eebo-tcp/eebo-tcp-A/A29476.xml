            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Relation of the Persecutions and Cruelties that have been acted upon the People called Quakers, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN our last Intelligence we concluded with the Relation of proceedings of what happened the last day of the sixt month, at the meeting at the <hi>Bull,</hi> and how cruel and merciless the Train-bands were towards our friends that day; and how that many were wounded, and bruised, and knocked down in a barbarous manner; the woful effects of which persecution hath more then sufficiently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to the amazement of many in this City, who have admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the sufferance of such dealing, so illegal and cruel in this famous City. And we shal not need at this time to aggravate the cruelty of that day by many circumstances, for the woful effects shal prove the matter; for since that day diverse are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life, that were beat, and wounded, and abused in that meeting; and particularly one man who lay under the grievous pangs of death for ten days after he had received such cruel bruises and blows, then departed this world; and upon some considerations by his friends that were present with him on his death-bed, and especially they knowing (as by all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it was manifest) that, he was killed and murdered, and that his wounds and bruises received at the Meeting were the absolute occasion of his death: It was found convenient, that the Coroner of the City should be sent for, and that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest should pass upon his dead body, that the murder might be manifest, and not be hid in secret; accordingly it was done; the dead Corps were carried to the <hi>Bull</hi> into the Meeting-room where he received his death-blows, and his body was exposed to publick view; to which place multitudes of people of the City did resort to see the woful sight of the dead Corps, which was such a sad sight, that it made many beholders astonished;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50216:3"/>
his dead body was so black with bruises, and even rotten, and like a Jelly, that none can scarce express the grievous symptoms of cruel blows that had fallen on that body, which had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned his death; and for diverse hours together many came to behold the same, and went away afflicted in their hearts by the sight that their eyes had seen; and the Coroner came and impanelled a Jury of the Neighbors, and gave them a charge (according to his Office) to make true inquiry upon their oaths, and to present what they found the cause of his death to be; accordingly they viewed the Corps throughly, and had a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon or two with them to advise concerning the cause of the death of that person; and after some time spent in consulting among themselves, and in viewing the Corps; then passed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in private (desiring the Friends to bury the body, which that evening was done) and that time they suspended to give in their Verdict for diverse reasons known to themselvs; though without doubt it was the judgment of the Surgeon then present, and of themselves also according to their evidence, and of all that beheld the dead Carkase, that he was absolutely murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the blows received at that Meeting aforesaid were the real cause of his death; and diverse times since the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Jury have met together upon the occasion, to hear witnesses, and to determine concerning the matter; and many substantial evidences have been brought in, testifying of that grievous cruelty acted that day by the Train-bands aforesaid, which have sufficiently proved the manner of the said murder, with its several aggravating circumstances, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed method of this following Letter sent by a Friend to the Mayor of the City, the next day after the death of the said person.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Am moved of the Lord to write unto thee concerning a person lately dead, who being met with many others of the people of God at the Bull and Month, the <hi>31.</hi> day of the last Month, (the usual time and place of their Meeting for the worship of the living God) was so beat and bruised by that party of the Trained Bands of the City which were sent to that place to disturb the Meeting, who did so beat and wound many of our Friends, and use that violence towards the innocent people, that 'tis scarce
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50216:3"/>
to be believed that men should be so inhumane, cruel and merciless to their honest neighbours, as they were at that time and place: But that there is now a sufficient witness of their cruelty, by the death of this person, who was absolutely murdered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea purposely and wilfully, as may be justly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected: I may suppose thou hast heard of this thing; for it was done not in the night, but at <hi>the mid-time of the day;</hi> not suddenly, unawares, by mishap, <hi>but intendedly, and in a long space of time a doing;</hi> and not in a corner, but <hi>in the streets of the City of London;</hi> All which circumstances doth highly <hi>aggravate this Murder,</hi> to the very shame and infamy of this famous City and its Government. And now seeing it is thus come to pass, consider in the fear of God, and take his counsel what thou oughtest now to do as chief Magistrate of this City, wherein such Murder is so hainously committed) for the end that innocent blood may not be hid, nor this cruel deed be covered with hypocrisie; but that this matter may be enquired into (as of right it ought) and sought out by thee, and Iustice and true Iudgement brought forth; that thou mayest for ever stand clear both before God and men (when called to an account) and that the City may be cleared also of innocent blood, which now lies upon it, by this man's death.</p>
                  <p>Friend, I say again in dear and tender love to thee, Consider what thou hast to do in this case; it's not to be over-looked and connived at by thee, as a thing of nought; for really and in truth, the City is defiled by the innocent blood of a servant of God, who is slain for his Worships sake; and these things will be brought to account before God the Iudge of all, who is provoked to anger because of these things, and may also ('tis not impossible) be brought to an account in this world, when the sufferings of Gods people are finished, which will once be as sure as the Lord lives, whose purpose is to deliver his people from all their Oppressions, and they shall be free, though the Rulers of the earth do what they can to the contrary, whom God will deal with as he dealt with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> if the [now] Israel of God may not be permitted to meet to worship the true and living God, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration shall not pass till it be accomplished; And the innocent blood of his servants is now touched, and this City hath defiled it self therewith, which will hasten vengeance and destruction: And as for this thing, if thou now art silent, and it be hid, how shall the Lord look upon thee clear, who art the chief Magistrate, and hast the Power, and ought by the Law of God to search out, and judge this cause of innocent blood. I am moved to warn thee, that thou mayest exercise that Power and Understanding which God hath given thee, for the end to prevent the shedding of the blood of God's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50216:4"/>
servants for the time to come: I seek no revenge, nor the lives of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, but rather, that the Murderers, and all ungodly men may be converted, and their souls and bodies may live for ever; though by the Law of God, and the Law of this Land, Eye for eye, and life for life; and this is just and equal. And certain it is, not onely one man us guilty of this cruel deed, but many who were then present, assenting, consenting, and acting their parts in this bloody Tragedy; and all such are liable to answer the Law, if Iustice be done; yea, and if they had a command to kill men, as some of them said, such a one is liable to the Iustice and Iudgement of the Eternal God for the same, and God will render to every man according to his wayes: Though we desire the repentance of all, and that they may have mercy from God and man; yet in conscience, according to my duty, have I laid this thing before thee, that thy heart may be stirred up to remove the weight and guilt of innocent blood, that now cryes in the ears of the City.</p>

            <p>But though they have had diverse meetings about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and many consultations, and had much evidence for proof of the murder; yet for some reasons not well known to us, they have not till this time given in their Verdict, whether they find upon their oaths, that person diseased as aforesaid to have been murdered or no? The reasons rendered by some for such suspence of Verdict is, That because they cannot by any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence yet given to them charge any one particular man with the said murder, as that such a person did give the deceased person his deaths blows, though it is testified that the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son now dead was seen beaten and knocked down; but it being in such a confused croud as was at that time on that occasion, that no particular man can be fixed upon, as that any can say, this man did the deed; this is not yet found out, though the Jury have sought for it; and 'tis supposed, that if a particular person could be charged with the murder, he would be turned over to the Law, and tried accordingly; but if no particular person can be charged herewith, then the City is liable to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50216:4"/>
a merced some great summe at the pleasure of the King, for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering such murder in the City on the day-time, and in such publick manner, and the murderer suffered to escape, and not apprehended; which thing it is supposed the City fears; so this is the reason given by some why Verdict: is suspended till the particular person can be found out on whom the said mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be charged: But however the matter is plain to many thousands in this City, that the said person was murdered, and it is well known to the whole City that for three months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, scarce one First-day, but the souldiers came violently and cruelly into our Meetings; beating, abusing, and knocking down many for dead; and thus much for present shal suffice concerning the death of the aforesaid person, till we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion to publish the whole matter about the business, which in due time may be done, as good occasion shall justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
            <p>The first day of the seventh month a Friend suffered some persecution in and near <hi>Smithfield</hi> in the Fair-time, who was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go through the Fair naked, with a pan on his head full of fire and brimstone, flaming up in the sight of the people, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repentance among them, and bad them remember <hi>Sodom,</hi> &amp;c. for which some rude people did abuse him much, and took him to an Officer, but he was not committed to Prison, but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</p>
            <p>About the 7<hi>th</hi> day of the month two Women were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Old <hi>Bridewel,</hi> for going into <hi>Pauls</hi> in the time of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; the one of them being moved to go at that very time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place vvith her face made black, and her hair dovvn vvith blood poured in it, vvhich run dovvn upon her sackcloth vvhich she had on, and she poured also some blood dovvn upon the Altar, and spoke some vvords, and another Woman being moved to go along vvith her, they vvere both taken avvay to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> vvhere they remain to this day, and vvere not yet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any fact, nor any evil yet justly laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>The same day a person vvas committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> for giving abroad a printed paper (to diverse persons he gave diverse of them) it was <hi>Concerning the cruelty acted in the meeting that day the man was killed,</hi> as aforesaid; and though one of the same was delivered to the King, by a person that was moved to acquaint
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50216:5"/>
him with the murder of the person aforesaid, at which the King seemed displeased, that one of our Friends should be killed at a Meeting, in these words expressing himself; <hi>I assure you it was not by my advice that any of your friends should be slain, and you must tell the Magistrates of the City of it, and prosecute the Law against them,</hi> these were the Kings words; but the person aforesaid was taken up by some Officer, &amp; charged with giving Papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, being had before <hi>Rich. Brown,</hi> who committed him to Prison for dispersing scandalous papers, as he said, though the Authors name was at the Paper; and yet he was Committed to Newgate, where he now remains.</p>
            <p>Our Friends meetings for these six Weeks last past, in and about this City, have been for the most part quiet and free from disturbance by Souldiers, the Meetings at the Bull and divers other places have been kept in the fear and name of the Lord, peaceable and quiet, and not violated by souldiers, as of late heretofore; onely for these three last first days, in <hi>Wheeler-street,</hi> at the Meeting-place, souldiers have appeared in a very rude manner, and shut up the doors, and kept a Guard against our Friends, and would not permit them entrance into their own house, but did beat, knock and abuse friends in a wicked man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the streets; and one Lievtenant uttered these words, He matter'd not if he killed a Quaker, he should not be hanged for it: And seeing they would not suffer friends to pass into their Meeting-room, they stood in the street before the door, and could not depart, though the rude souldiers continued to abuse them with their Kanes and Swords, beating them in a pittiful manner; though some of the soberest of them desired that some of our friends would go to the King, and acquaint him with these proceedings, that they might be spared from that duty, for they were wholly weary of it.</p>
            <p>And one first day there were four of the friends taken out of the Streets, and committed to New-Prison, where they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Sessions, and were then discharged. And this hath been most of the disturbance our friends have had in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the time aforesaid.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the 7th. Month one <hi>Henry Bowerman</hi> was taken out of his Ship, and brought before <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> and committed to Newgate for selling of our Friends Books, which

they say are unlicensed by the Bishop, and therefore not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be sold, though to this day neither the Bishop, nor any other person hath ever detected any point of doctrine or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in any of our Books, or proved any unsoundness in them, or contrary Doctrine to the Scriptures of truth; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the said <hi>Henry</hi> was committed close Prisoner upon that pretence, and for three Weeks laid among the Felons, and suffered many great abuses, because of which, distemper of body grew upon him, and he grew very weak till death, and the 17. day of the 8. month dyed in <hi>Newgate</hi>; thus this honest just man finished his Testimony in Bonds for the Name of Jesus in faithfulness, whose reward is with him for ever; and he is accounted among the suffering Martyrs for the truth of Jesus: And without all doubt his close imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the abuses he suffered, was the cause and ground of his sickness, and so of his death; and this was the opinion of divers of the Jury-men that passed upon his dead Corps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot omit in this place, to mention the state of our dear Friends in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and how it hath fared with them in this stormy season.</p>
            <p>In the 4<hi>th.</hi> Month last, the Meeting of our Friends at <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-down</hi> (the usual place of their peaceable meeting to worship God for these divers years) was disturbed and violated by Souldiers in Arms, in the same rude, illegal manner as the Meetings in the City, of whom ye have heard heretofore; and at divers times on three first dayes, were taken out of the said meeting to the number of about 50. persons, and from time to time committed to prison at the <hi>White-Lyon,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till the Assise, which was held at <hi>Guilford,</hi> to which place the Prisoners were had in order to tryal, the Gaoler ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their words to travel to the place, being 25. miles distance from the Goal, without any Keeper; which they did faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and appeared at the time and place appointed; but few of them were called before the Bench, for there was no witnesse against them, nor preparation of Indictments; for which cause (it is supposed) <hi>Orlando Bridgeman,</hi> then Judge of the Assize, did discharge all the Prisoners saving four, who had the Oath then tendered them, and for refusing, were re-committed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50216:6"/>
back to prison, and the rest were all released, and they onely detained. And this was the proceeding towards our friends at that time.</p>
            <p>But the rage and malice of some men were not yet an end; for though the Judge of Assize had ordered the release of our friends in the face of the Countrey, yet in a little time after their return home, they were fallen upon again in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the place aforesaid, and by rude Souldiers violently halled, pulled and dragged out of their peaceable Meeting, and led by force before some Justices of the peace, who took some examination of them, and committed them to the Gaol for the County, according to the following Relation received from the Prisoners themselves.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>ON the <hi>3 d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> day of the <hi>6th.</hi> Month (called <hi>August)</hi> being the first day of the week, we being met together as our manner is, in the fear of the Lord to feel and enjoy his presence, and to be refreshed in his pretious life, and one in another; for indeed in the Unity to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in the Unity to bow or worship before the Lord, and together in the unity to live, is very precious unto us, and we cannot but exercise our selves therein, notwithstanding the Decrees and Laws of men are to the contrary: And being met together (even out of the fear of man) after some time came a Constable with some Souldiers, and found us very peaceable and quiet; yet notwithstanding they soon began to thrust, hale, and carry forth of the Meeting all Women-Friends, some with much violence; and when they had wrought their design upon them (we all this while siteing still, eying the dear loving-kindness of the Lord to us, and little regarding the cruelties of men, feeling in our hearts that Love which casteth out fear, <hi>which Love envieth not,</hi> but teacheth us to pity, and to pray for them <hi>that despitefully use us;</hi> knowing that their eyes are blinded, and their hearts hardened, and that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not what they do.) Then they began with us, and after much thrusting, halling and pulling, we were brought six or eight sometimes in a company, and sometimes more, every Souldier his prisoner, as though we had been great Malefactors; We were strongly guarded, and brought to the Court at <hi>Margarets Hill,</hi> where they kept their Main-Guard, especially on the first dayes of the Week, having little other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at present for their Souldiers, than to range up and down <hi>like Wolves greedy of prey,</hi> to find where the Lambs and Sheep of Christ
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50216:6"/>
meet together; drudging about this day many miles for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. So when we were all brought into their Guard, they set a strong watch at the door, scarce suffering or admitting any Friends Wives to come in: After some time we were called to go up into an upper room, which was over the Court of Guard, where there were two Magistrates called <hi>Justice Moor,</hi> and <hi>Justice Lee,</hi> and several other persons, most as spectators; so by parcels as aforesaid, we were brought before them; and the Constable and two Souldiers were sworn to witness against us, the Magistrates having the late Act made against us, lying upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before them: And being called one by one to the last, the Constables evidence was, That we were taken met together. So they set down our Names, and asked us for sureties to be bound for our appearance next Sessions or Assizes to be holden in this County: They were answered, That we had transgressed <hi>no just Law;</hi> and having broken no good Law of the Nation, we ought not to be asked for sureties; requiring and challenging them or any other Magistrates or People in the Nation, to charge us justly with the breach of any one good Law of the Nation, since we were a people in scorn called <hi>Quakers:</hi> But as for such <hi>Laws; Decrees,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances of men,</hi> which were not according to the Law of God and right Reason, but contrary to both; their own Law saith, That such <hi>Laws, Decrees, Customs</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, and not to be obeyed. And further, they were told, That we were subject readily and willingly to all good Laws, and wholsome Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of the Nation, which tend to the preservation of Mankind, not for fear, but for Conscience-sake; and that it did not concern them, nor any other Civil Magistrates, to trouble us for the exercise of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences towards God in spiritual things; and that the King had also said and promised, That <hi>none should be molested or troubled about matters of Conscience, provided they did not disturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace;</hi> which we have not at any time done, but have endeavoured and do endeavour to the utmost, to follow peace with all men. This and much more they heard somewhat moderately; but they said we must obey the Kings Laws; and there must be <hi>an Uniform of Worship;</hi> and that we would ruine our selves, and they were (they said) sorry for us, and such like. So still it was urged upon them, to convince us of the breach of any good Law, and if they could, we would put in security to answer that Law: And further also told them, That if we did err in our minds, and were wrongly perswaded in our hearts, in and about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Worship and Religion, yet had not they any Precept nor President
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50216:7"/>
from the Primitive Christians nor Christ, to imprison our bodies, and ruine our Estates for that cause onely, <hi>it being wholly contrary to Christianity, or the Spirit of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we answering not their request as to sureties, the whole Guard most of which in the mean while being in the lower room behaving themselves very rudely &amp; cruelly towards some; one woman being by a Soldier punch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the belly, being big with child, &amp; thrust with much violence back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon the Pavement, appearing for some time as dead; but little notice would be taken by the Magistrates of the fault without an Oath.) So the wholeGuard, consisting of near one hundred, were ordered &amp; commanded to guard us to the County-Gaol, many hundreds of people attending to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us with much pity. So we were delivered into prison, thirty four in number, for the Testimony of a good Conscience; for if we would make shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, we need not suffer by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. So in the true patience, long-suffering and love, which thinks no ill, we rest in the hope which maketh not ashamed, knowing our God whom we serve, is able to deliver us; but if he will not, be it known to all, he will, and doth enable us chearfully to suffer whatsoever the sons of men are permitted to inflict upon us; believing in the end, That Love, Patience and Innocency shall overcome all that is contrary; and in the end, the Lamb and the Saints shall have the victory.</p>

            <p>In like manner the said Meeting of the people of God was assaulted for diverse days; till such time as they had taken from time to time out of the Meeting, and committed about Eighty of our Friends to the <hi>White Lion,</hi> where they lay grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously thronged up together in noisome stinking places, till the Sessions held at <hi>Kingstone</hi> for that County, which was the beginning of this Month, to which place the Prisoners were conducted in order to hearing and trial; and accordingly here they were arreigned and indicted upon the Statute of the 35 of <hi>Elisabeth</hi> (though it is the judgment of diverse Lawyers that that Statute is repealed) for unlawful Conventicles, and unlawful Assemblies, &amp;c. And demanded to plead <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>not Guilty</hi>? to which most of the Prisoners pleaded, <hi>Not guilty</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50216:7"/>
and they were demanded to give Bayl to answer the next Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Though some of the Prisoners spoke home to the Court, and told them their Indictment was <hi>made up of lies and falsities</hi>; upon which occasion some disturbance grew in the Court, so that some party of the Train-bands were commanded into the Court to keep all quiet; who did make a bussle and stir, and some received some blows; one man in particular being no <hi>Quaker</hi> (so called) who was struck, made some defence to keep the blows off him, upon which a lying report was raised in the Town and Country, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> fought and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the souldiers, which was <hi>not true at all, but a very lye</hi>; for none of our Friends made the least resistance, no not in the defence to save their heads from blows; and this may be taken notice of to prevent false reports. But none of the Prisoners were tried, but all recommitted to prison, and the Court ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till the 28 day of this instant to sit on <hi>Margarets</hi> Hill in <hi>Southwark</hi>; in the mean time all our friends are kept prisoners for refusing to put in Bayl for their appearance; though their denial to give bayl is not as though their crime was so great as they could not answer it, but 'tis usual if at any time any friends give bayl, they are more ensnared thereby, and made more liable to greater sufferings; for which cause, with some others, our friends cannot give such bayl demanded of them; so at this present there are remaining in prison, in <hi>White-Lion,</hi> near Eighty of our Friends as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>The Sessions for the general Gaol delivery was held at the Old <hi>Baily</hi> the 9, 10, 11, and 12 days of this Month; where se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Murderers, Fellons, and some Coyners were arraigned and tried, and only six persons condemned, three whereof were executed, and the rest Reprieved. And there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve of our Friends in prison in <hi>Newgate,</hi> which were detained from the Sessions before, for refusing to give Bayl for appearance, and for their behaviour, &amp;c. though they were discharged by the Kings late Letter sent to the Magistrates of the City for to release all our Friends out of the Gaols for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> of which ye have heard heretofore; and being yet continued prisoners, it was expected they should have been called to the Court at the Sessions; but was not brought before them, onely their names called over, and they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50216:8"/>
returned in the Gaolers Kalendar, to continue prisoners, or <hi>to give Bayl for appearance the next Sessions, in the mean time to be of good behaviour, &amp;c.</hi> upon which they are detained still in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> though very unjustly, as may be made appear, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in due season; and how men who unjustly do these things, will be able to answer before God when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account, is to be considered; For though this people have none among men to plead their cause, yet will the Lord God arise in his season, to hear the cry, and plead the cause of his innocent people who suffer for his Name sake, in patience bearing all things, till God from Heaven work deliverance for the oppressed.</p>
            <p>About the 18th. day of this Month was an Order sent from the King to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> for to release <hi>Iohn Boulton, Iohn Crook,</hi> and <hi>Isaac Gray,</hi> the three persons formerly convict of Praemunire, who were committed during the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and had their Estates seized upon, according as ye have formerly heard, which Order contained thus much: That <hi>whereas the said three persons stood convicted of Praemunire, and was committed during the pleasure of the King, his Will and Pleasure was thereby signifyed, That the said three persons should forthwith be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and set at liberty, &amp;c.</hi> According to the intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the said Letter, the said three persons are delivered out of prison after their five months imprisonment, and the hard sentence passed upon them.</p>
            <p>The same day <hi>Rebecca Travers</hi> was committed to the New-Prison by the Lievtenant of the Tower, who being moved to go to him on the behalf of some Prisoners that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for being at Meetings; in some discourse with him, pressing upon him for pity and compassion to poor men, he was much discontented; and she being passing away from him one of the Keepers used some violent speeches towards her at her departure; to whom she replied and exhorted him <hi>to be good in his place while it was the Lords Will he had it, &amp;c.</hi> At which he was so vexed, that he went back speedily to the Lievtenant, and swore she had spoken Treason; for which her Mittimus was made, and she immediately committed, where she now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Thus instead of hearing her sober requests in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the poor prisoners, he committed her also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50216:8"/>So this is the sum of proceedings in and about this City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There remains at this present of our friends Prisoners, in <hi>Negate</hi> twelve, in <hi>New-Prison</hi> four, and in <hi>Southwark</hi> near eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And for these late Weeks Meetings are generally quiet, and much pity in the hearts of sober people raised up towards friends, who have observed the patient and long-suffering spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord amongst us, through this hard time of trial and persecution, and to continue in the same we are resolved through the strength of Christ Jesus, even till our deliverance come; and we shall never seek vengeance against our Enemies, nor rise up against them to redeem our selves by our own strength; and we desire like-mindedness among all that love us; for the Lord will accomplish his own Work in his season.</p>
            <p>At a Meeting at <hi>Ham,</hi> five miles out of the City, divers Friends have been taken of late, through the instigation of a wicked Priest, who hath stirred up the Officers of the Town to disturb the Meeting; and they have sent divers friends, some to <hi>Colchester</hi>-Gaol, and some to the House of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And one Friend in particular, was dragged at a Horses tail for some part of the way. Thus the cruelty of the Priests is daily made manifest, to their shame and reproach through the Land; even these men, who were themselves in a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition some of them; and yet without regard either of God or man, stir up the hearts of men to be cruel towards the Innocent.</p>
            <p>By late Letters from <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> we have lately understood, That for the most part our Friends Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are quiet and peaceable in all them East-Counties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in some places where the Officers are violent and rude men, and are willing to do our friends mischief, and there our friends are most molested: But there are not many of our Friends Prisoners in them parts at this present.</p>
            <p>By Letters lately received from <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> and out of the West, we understand, That there are very few of our Friends in prison in them parts: At <hi>Bristol</hi> three remains taken from meetings some Weeks since, two of whom are convict by the late Act against meetings, and the other detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for refusing the Oath. In <hi>Exceter</hi> some lately released out
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50216:9"/>
of the prison, who were committed for meetings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at this present are generally quiet in the West: For our Friends are so well known to be of peaceable deportment, and of inoffensive conversation, and their meetings so clearly for the Worship of God, that sober men have no great mind nor desire to use violence to their honest neighbors, in halling them out of meetings, and carrying them to prison; for all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men must needs confess, That such kind of dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Friends, as of late practised in this City, by perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and cruelty acted upon them, can never make (in the effect of it) for the happiness of the King and Government; but 'tis liberty and freedom in the exercise of Conscience in spiritual matters, that must make for the prosperity of the King and his subjects.</p>
            <p>By Letters lately received from the North, we understand, that in <hi>York</hi> Castle there are about an hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our friends prisoners, committed for meeting together in the Worship of God, some of whom have lately been tried at the sessions, and some are fined 40. s, some more, some less, and some senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into Premunire, and all returned back to prison again, saving some about <hi>Wakefield</hi>-side, who were released. And thus they go on to persecute the innocent through their enmity, till the Lord arise, and work the deliverance for his people.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Leicestershire</hi> and <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> divers were released out of prison this last Sessions, though some are committed again since for meeting together to worship God: Also we have been given to understand of late, that very much goods have been distrained from our friends in the Countreys, for meeting together, and for not going to Parish-Houses to hear Common-Prayer, and for Tythes and Priests hire; so that great are the sufferings of the innocent every way; the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plow furrows upon their backs, and are like pricking briars and thorns unto upright men, and this is a very trying day unto all that fear the Lord, whether they will suffer for the truth they profess, or whether they will deny their God and Religion: But blessed and happy are the faithful this day, who follow Christ through suffering; for they that suffer with him, shall reign with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50216:9"/>At <hi>Hartford</hi> last Sessions, four honest Friends were tryed for refusing the Oath of Allegiance, and sentenced into a <hi>Pramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> and are kept close Prisoners ever since: Take the account of it in the Letter following.</p>

                  <p>IN the bowels of endeared love and perfect unity, in that measure of Light and Life which we are made partakers of in the Father, do we salute you, with the rest of our dear Friends and suffering brethren in bonds for the testimony of a good Conscience in the Prison of <hi>Newgate.</hi> We thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to acquaint you from our own hands, with the cause of our suffering in these bonds, and to give you some brief account of the Sessions-proceedings against us: On the 6<hi>th.</hi> and 7<hi>th.</hi> days of this Month was the Quarter-Sessions for the County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> where we with divers other of our friends were arrested with Sessions Processes for not going to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Church, (as they called it) where is to be observed, that we are Inhabitants of the Corporation, and so by the Law not accountable at the County-Sessions: But the morning before the Sessions, the Mayor, Steward and Company gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and went to the County Justices, and told them we were a people too mighty for them to deal with, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired them to take us into their cognizance. So we four persons whose Names are under subscribed, were called, &amp; after a few words spoken to us on the account of our Indictment for not going to hear Common-Prayer, some said, Tender them the Oath of Allegiance: So we pleaded to our former business, and asked if we were discharged from that? They said we were, onely paying our Fees, which we denyed; but they made haste to the Oath, having intended what to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and read the Oath to us, and asked us to swear: We asked time of consideration, which he, called the Lord <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw,</hi> acknowledged to be a reasonable question; so they would grant us till the morning; but withall, we must say whether we would take it or not, then; so they recorded the refusal. On the next day we were called again; for they were so eager on it, as if they were in great haste, and took so much pains,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50216:10"/>
as if that were the onely business they had to do, (and some in the Court said, three or four of these would do the Work, or to that purpose.) They had prepared an Indictment, and read it to us, and besides, alledged many Scriptures to prove the lawfulness of swearing; but when we spake to those Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as they asked us to do, then <hi>Fanshaw</hi> would cry out Grand Imposters; and yet would often in his words pity us, and say, he would help us, but the Law would not permit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we would take the Oath. When the Jury were going forth with the Indictment, we would have spake to them, but they would not permit us, and said we must not speak to the Jury until they came in (which is contrary to the Law.) Some few words we did speak to the Jury, and some of them said they were more sorry than we were, but they could not help it; and some (or one of them) said, that they would not have found it, but that they durst do no other; and though they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted but Enemies to us, most of them, yet they said, That scarce one was willing to find it. After some more time, about three quarters of an hour, they brought in the Indictment, and found us guilty: So without sentence we were sent away to Prison. And after about three hours we were called again, the Lord <hi>Fanshaw</hi> being gone, and but few Justices left, the Judge of the Sessions, one <hi>Hen. Chansie,</hi> and about four more present, after some impertinent quotations of Scripture to prove the honorable esteem the servants of the Lord had of swearing, he said, That he was sorry that it was his hard mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to pronounce so sad a sentence as this was against us, and bid the Clark of the Sessions to read our sentence, which was, <hi>That we should be put out of the Kings protection, &amp; have no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Law, and to forfeit our Lands, Goods and Estates to the King, and to answer it before the King and his Council, or else Processes of Premunire to be issued forth against us, and we to be kept close Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> the which we are continued. And it was said by the Gaoler, That we should be kept without pen, ink or paper; and he to be fined 20. <hi>l.</hi> if he let any come at us beside such as brought us provision; but this latter is not so executed on us. They have not yet seized our Estates, but they say, they expect it hourly; and many are their threats against us; that the loss
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50216:10"/>
of our Estates, and thus imprisoning of our persons, is not all, but to send us beyond sea, and that one hath begged us for that end already; but we are kept above the terror of these things, knowing that our God can, if he see it good for us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us out of all these things.</p>
                  <p>This we thought meet to lay before you; and if you think it for truths advantage that any thing further should be done, let us hear from you: And so we remain your Friends in the pure truth.</p>

            <p>THe Beloved of God our Saviour, and the Lord Iesus Christ; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as it hath pleased God through the riches of his Grace to make us partakers with you in this suffering fellowship of the Gospel; as also of the love, joy, peace and presence which attends all who in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart suffer in the like sort, though indeed ours is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to what we have heard hath been in the City, by a certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which hath its date (as I remember) from the first <hi>6th</hi> mo. to the first <hi>7th.</hi> And gives us a full and ample account during that time; and we do credibly believe it to be according to truth; and it much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies us here to see their rudeness and cruelty so rightly Stated: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall give you a short hint of what was done in these our Sessions concerning the said people commonly and scornfully called <hi>Quakers;</hi> use it as you shall see fit. Upon the <hi>8th</hi> of this instant <hi>8.</hi> month, —<hi>62,</hi> the prisoners being called, all but those three whom we hinted to you in our last were so unlawfully <hi>Praemunir'd</hi> the last assizes, being prosecuted against and cast into prison upon the late Act against unlawful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Meetings, until the time of the Iudges sitting here, and then at that self same time run into this relapse, and here left with several others who were cast in here, and lies upon the account of Tythes, who were not as this time called forth. Upon the first day of their Sessions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50216:11"/>
was called one <hi>William Foster,</hi> a man of sober and good repute in his Country, who hath laid here since the Assizes for not consenting to find Bond for the good behaviour, he not being convinced of any evil that he had done, but contrariwise suffered that peaceable people to meet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his house to wait upon God, was called forth, and asked, if hee could yet find Sureties for the good behaviour, which he for conscience sake denying, is cast into prison again as formerly, there to continue. That self same day in the evening some more of the said people were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Bishop being then upon the Bench; after the reading of the Act made against that people, and some debate betwixt him and the Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about their proceedings at the other Sessions, which he thought (the said Bishop) not to be cruel enough towards them, yet said, he loved mercy in his heart; But the very first that was called before him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been fined <hi>50 s.</hi> before, and then coming upon the second account, the Bishop sitting as Iudg of the Court (and will not let to be accuser al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o) being a furious man, had it seems forgotten all his mercy, so that there was not one Groats-worth of mercy for the prisoner; for <hi>James White</hi> being called, he was sentenced <hi>10</hi> pounds, according to the Act, and the Bishop cried out, <hi>Abate him not one Groat:</hi> Thus they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against nine in the like condition, fined them ninety pounds. The rest, it being the first time, less; there being twenty, or above, men and women, which all of them bare it with a great deal of boldness, courage, and patience, blessing God that they were found worthy to suffer for his sake. Also one <hi>William Fallowfield</hi> a <hi>Westmoreland</hi> man, coming into this County to visit some friends, and so to pass towards <hi>York</hi> to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit a brother he had living there, being taken at a Meeting before he got out of this County, was cast into Prison, and there continued nine weeks, was fined <hi>50</hi> shillings, returned to prison there to remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that here remains onely nine prisoners at this present; four for Tythes, three Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munir'd; one for having Meetings in his house, the other for his Fine. As to the body of friends in these parts all are valiant for the truth upon earth, and not at the least dismaid at the manner of these proceedings; finding daily by experience the peace and presence of God with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having faith that God will assuredly finish the good work which he hath begun amongst us, to his own praise and glory for ever; for which we with you, and all the Elected and Chosen of God remain waiting until the accomplishing thereof:</p>

            <p>BEtween 30. &amp; 40. Horsemen, who said they were the Kings souldiers, quartering in <hi>Southwark,</hi> went to a Friend's House near <hi>London,</hi> &amp; broke open the doors, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there was one there that would have open'd any door to them, &amp; under pretence of searching for Arms, robbed a poor serving-man who was left to look to the house, and took away two pair of Stockins from him, and a pair of Shoes, and a Bible and Knife, and drank four or five Bottles of Wine up, and swore God damn him, and called him son of a Whore, and so went away.</p>

               <head>A Relation of what fell out the 26. of this Month.</head>
               <p>THE conclusion of our present News is not the least material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This same day a great stir was in the City, and both many Horse and Foot marching in the Streets all the day; and in the forenoon (the Friends being met for the Worship of God at ths <hi>Bull)</hi> there came Horse and Foot great number, and took away all the men, and dispersed the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and guarded the men all away to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and took up divers in the Streets as they passed along. In like manner they did at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Johns street,</hi> and at the Meeting in <hi>Aldersgate-street,</hi> and in <hi>Wheeler-street,</hi> and at the Meeting in <hi>Jameses,</hi> and in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and Friends were hardly used at every Meeting; and to Newgate that day were committed of our Friends about one hundred and twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and put in the Common Gaol above one hundred in one room among the Felons; and in Old-Bridewell were committed above thirty, and to New-Prison about twelve, and are all continued Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Likewise there were taken very many of the Baptized People and others. Not one Meeting that we hear of about the City, but was dealt with in like manner; and <hi>Rich, Brown</hi> himself was in the head of the Souldiers about the Streets on that day. So there were divers hundreds committed that day to divers Prisons.</p>
