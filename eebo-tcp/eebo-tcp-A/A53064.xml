            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may be said to me, as one said to a Lady, <hi>VVork Lady, VVork, let wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books alone, For surely VViser Women ne'r writ one</hi>; But your Lordship never bid me to Work, nor leave Writing, except when you would perswade me to spare so much time from my Study as to take the Air for my Health; the truth is, My Lord, I cannot Work, I mean such Works as Ladies use to pass their Time withall, and if I could, the Materials of such Works would cost more than the Work would be worth, besides all the Time and Pains bestow'd upon it. You may ask me, what Works I mean; I answer, Needle-works, Spinning-works, Preserving-works, as also Baking, and Cooking-works, as making Cakes, Pyes, Puddings, and the like, all which I am Ignorant of; and as I am Ignorant in these Imployments, so I am Ignorant in Gaming, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and Revelling; But yet, I must ask you leave
<pb facs="tcp:100053:4"/>
to say, that I am not a Dunce in all Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for I Understand the Keeping of Sheep, and Ordering of a Grange, indifferently well, although I do not Busie my self much with it, by reason my Scribling takes away the most part of my Time. Perchance some may say, that if my Understanding be most of Sheep, and a Grange, it is a Beastly Understanding; My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, I wish Men were as Harmless as most Beasts are, then surely the World would be more Quiet and Happy than it is, for then there would not be such Pride, Vanity, Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, Faction, Treachery, and Treason, as is now; Indeed one might very well say in his Prayers to God, O Lord God, I beseech thee of thy Infinite Mercy, make Man so, and order his Mind, Thoughts, Passions, and Appetites, like Beasts, that they may be Temperate, Sociable, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, Patient, Prudent, Provident, Brotherly-loving, and Neighbourly-kind, all which Beasts are, but most Men not. But leaving most Men to Beasts, I return to your Lordship, who is one of the Best of men, whom God hath fill'd with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Fortitude, Noble Generosity, Poetical Wit, Moral Honesty, Natural Love, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly-kindness, Great Patience, Loyal Duty, and Celestial Piety, and I pray God as Zealously and Earnestly to Bless you with Perfect Health and Long Life, as becomes</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Noble Readers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Hope you will not make the Mistake of a Word a Crime in my Wit, as some former Readers have done, for in my <hi>Poems</hi> they found Fault that the Number was not Just, nor every Line Matched with a Perfect Rime; But I can answer for that Book, that there be but some such Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in it, and those as it were by Chance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, in some Languages, as <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which are accounted the Chief, they regard not Rimes in their Poems, but only an Exact number of Feet and Measures; however Rimes and Numbers are only as the Garments, and not as the Body of VVit; but I have been more Exact in my other Book call'd <hi>Natural Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,</hi> wherein most Verses are Just both for Number and Rimes. As for my VVork, <hi>The VVorld's Olio,</hi> they may say some VVords are not Exactly Placed, which I confess to be very likely, and not only in that, but in all the rest of my VVorks there may be such Errors, for I was not Bred in an University, or a Free-School, to Learn the Art of VVords; neither do I take it for a Disparagement of my VVorks, to have
<pb facs="tcp:100053:6"/>
the Forms, Terms, VVords, Numbers, or Rymes found Fault with, so they do not find Fault with the Variety of the Subjects, or the Sense and Reason, VVit, and Fancy, for I leave the Formal, or VVorditive part to Fools, and the Material or Sensitive part to VVise men. Concerning my <hi>Philosophical Opinions,</hi> some did say, they were too Obscure, and not Plain Enough for their Understanding; I must confess, I writ that Book at first at the same time when I wrote my Poems, but to my Reason it was as Plain as I could write it, and if some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could not Understand it, I am not Nature to give them VVit and Understanding; yet have I since not only Over-viewed, and Reformed that Book, but made a great Addition to it, so that I believe, I have now so clearly Declared my Sense and Meaning therein, that those which Understand it not must not only be Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, but Insensible Creatures. As for my Book of <hi>Playes,</hi> some find Fault they are not made up Exactly, nor the Scenes placed Justly, as also I have not in some Playes caused all the Actors to be of an Acquaintance, but this same Fault they find, I have Express'd in one of the Epistles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Book, which they fling back upon my Work. As for my <hi>Orations,</hi> I have heard, that some do Censure me for speaking too Freely, and Patronizing Vice too much, but I would have them not to be too Rash in Judging, but to Consider, first, whether there be a sufficient Reason that may move them to give such a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for truly I am as much an Enemy to Vice,
<pb facs="tcp:100053:6"/>
as I am a Friend to Virtue, &amp; do Persecute Vice with as perfect an Hatred, as I do Pursue Virtue, with an Intire, and Pure Love, which is Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Known to those that Know me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is not out of Love to Vice that I Plead for it, but only to Exercise my Fancy, for surely the Wisest, and Eloquentest Orators, have not been Ashamed to Defend Vices upon such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and why may not I do the like? for my Orations for the most part are Declamations, wherein I speak <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and Determine nothing; and as for that Part which contains se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pleadings, it is Fit and Lawful that both Parties should bring in their Arguments as well as they can, to make their Cases Good; but I matter not their Censure, for it would be an Endless Trouble to me, to Answer every ones Foolish Exception; an Horse of a Noble Spirit Slights the Bawling of a Petty Cur, and so do I. As for the Present Book of Letters, I know not as yet what Aspersion they will lay upon it, but I fear they'l say, they are not written in a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>style, that is, in a Complementing, and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical way, with High Words, and Mystical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as most of our Modern Letter-writers use to do; But, <hi>Noble Readers,</hi> I do not intend to Present you here with Long Complements in Short Letters, but with Short Descriptions in Long Letters; the truth is, they are rather Scenes than Letters, for I have Endeavoured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cover of Letters to Express the Humors of Mankind, and the Actions of Man's Life by the Correspondence of two Ladies, living at
<pb facs="tcp:100053:7"/>
some Short Distance from each other, which make it not only their Chief Delight and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, but their Tye in Friendship, to Discourse by Letters, as they would do if they were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally together, so that these Letters are an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of a Personal Visitation and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I think is Better (I am sure more Profitable) than those Conversations that are an Imitation of Romancical Letters, which are but Empty Words, and Vain Complements. But the Reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is, first, that I have put forth Twenty Playes already, which number I thought to be Sufficient, next, I saw that Variety of Forms did Please the Readers best, and that lastly they would be more taken with the Brevity of Letters, than the Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Scenes, and whole Playes, whose Parts and Plots cannot be Understood till the whole Play be Read over, whereas a Short Letter will give a Full Satisfaction of what they Read. And thus I thought this to be the Best Way or Form to put this Work into, which if you Approve of, I have my Reward.</p>

               <p>THe Lady <hi>C.

The truth is, a young beautiful face is a Friend, when as an old withered face is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the one causes Love, the other Aversion: yet I am not of Mrs. <hi>U.

rather dye before her Beauty, than that her Beauty should die before her: for I had rather live with wrinkles, than die with youth; and had rather my face cloth'd with Time's sad mourning, than with Death's white hue; and surely it were better to follow the shadow of Beauty, than that Beauty should go with the Corps to the Grave; and I believe that Mrs. <hi>V.

               <p>I Do not wonder, there are great factions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the three families <hi>C. Y.

and Ambition the disturbers of Peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Idleness should be banish'd out of every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which will also be a means to be rid of Poverty, for Industry is the way to thrive: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, when men have something to do, they will have the less time to talk; for many words from discontented persons increase hate, and make dissentions: the truth is, words for the most part make more discord than union, and more enemies than friends; wherefore Silence is more commendable than much Speaking, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the tongue doth rather express men's follies, than make known their wit; neither do many words argue much Judgement; but as the old Saying is, The greatest talkers are the least actors, they being more apt to speak spitefully, than to act mischievously; another Saying is, That musing men rather study to do evil, than contemplate on good; But I am not of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for if men would think more, and speak less, the world of mankind would be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and wiser than they are, for Thoughts beget Consideration, Consideration begets Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Judgement begets Discretion, Discretion begets Temperance, and Temperance begets Peace in the Mind, and Health in the Body, for when men want Temperance, they are subject to Insatiable Appetites, unruly Passions, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Desires, which causes Covetousness and Ambition, and these cause Envy and Hate, which makes Faction and Strife, which

These three Ladies are resolv'd never to marry, which makes many sad Lovers; but whilst they were here, in comes the Lord <hi>S.

But, Ladies, said he, Consider, Time wears out Youth, and fades Beauty, and then you will not be the three young fair Graces; You say true, my Lord, answer'd one of them, but when we leave to be the young fair Graces, we shall then be the old wise Sibyls. By this answer you may perceive, that when our Sex cannot pretend to be Fair, they will pretend to be Wise; but it matters not what we pretend to, if we be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virtuous, which I wish all our Sex may be, and rest,</p>

               <p>IN my opinion the marriage between Sir <hi>A. G.</hi> and Mrs. <hi>I. S.</hi> is no wayes agreeable, wherefore not probable to be bless'd with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py union, though she is likelyer to be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of the two; for 'tis better to have an old doting fool, than a wanton young filly; but he will be very unhappy through Jealousie, what with his Dotage, and her Freedom, which will be like fire and oyl, to set his mind on a flame, and burn out the lamp of his life: Truly, I did wonder, when I heard they were married, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her nature and his humour, for she loves young masculine Company, and he loves onely
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100053:12"/>
young female Companion; so that he cannot enjoy her to himself, unless she barr her self from all other men for his sake, which I believe she will not do, for she will not bury her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor put her Wit to silence for the sake of her Husband; for, if I be not mistaken, she will love a young Servant better than an old Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; nay, if her Husband were young, she would prefer variety of Servants, before a single Husband, insomuch, that if she had been made, when there was but One man, as <hi>Adam,</hi> she would have done like her Grand mother <hi>Eve,</hi> as to have been courted by the Devil, and would betray her Husband for the Devil's sake, rather than want a Lover.

               <p>IN your last Letter you sent me word, that Sir <hi>F.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100053:13"/>
an Evil life vvithout VVit, vvill be but a dull and tedious Story, indeed so tedious and dull, as I believe none will take the pains to read it, unless he himself read of himself: but it is to be hoped, that he will be tir'd of himself, and so desist from his self Story. And if he do write his own Life, it will be as a masking Dolphin, or such like thing, where the outside is painted past-board or canvas, and the inside stuff'd with shreds of paper, or dirty raggs, scrap'd from dunghils: and if he set his Picture before, as a Frontispiece to his Book, it will be like an ill-favour'd masking Vizzard.

There's a saying, That men are born to live, and live to dye; but I think some are onely born to dye, and not to live; for they make small use of life, and life makes small use of them; so that in effect they were ready for the Grave, as soon as they came forth from the Womb.

               <p>I Am sorry to hear, Wit is so little known and understood, that Sir <hi>W.

               <p>IN your last Letter I perceive that the Lady <hi>N. P.</hi> is an actor in some State-design, or at least would be thought so, for our Sex in this age, is ambitious to be State-Ladies, that they may be thought to be Wise Women; but let us do what we can, we shall prove our selves Fools, for Wisdom is an enemy to our Sex, or rather our Sex is an enemy to Wisdom. 'Tis true, we are full of Designs and Plots, and ready to side into Factions; but Plotting, Designing, Factions, belong nothing to Wisdom, for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom never intermeddles therein or therewith, but renounces them; it is onely cheating Craft and Subtilty that are the managers thereof: and for deceiving Craft, Women are well practised therein, and most of them may be accounted Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians; for no question but Women may, can, and oftentimes do make wars, especially Civil wars; witness our late Civil war, wherein Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were great, although not good actors; for though Women cannot fight with warring arms themselves, yet they can easily inflame men's minds against the Governours and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unto which Men are too apt even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the perswasion of Women, as to make inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through envy and emulation, in hopes of advancement in Title, Fortune and Power, of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100053:15"/>
which Women are as ambitious as Men; but I wish for the honour of our Sex, that Women could as easily make peace as war, though it is easier to do evil than good, for every fool can make an uproar, and a tumultuous disorder, such as the wisest can hardly settle into order again. But Women in State-affairs can do as they do with themselves, they can, and do often make themselves sick, but when they are sick, not well again: So they can disorder a State, as they do their Bodies, but neither can give Peace to th' one, nor Health to th' other; but their rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Minds, and unsatiable Appetites, do many times bring Ruin to the one, and Death to the other; for Temperance and Quietness are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our Sex. But leaving the Lady <hi>N. P.</hi> to her petty Designs, and weak Plots, I rest,</p>

               <p>IN your last Letter you were pleased to tell me for news, that <hi>C. V.</hi> was newly made a Lord; truly he deserves it, and if his Title were to be measur'd, it would be far short of his Merit, but it is a greater honour to have more Merit than Title, than to have more Title than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100053:16"/>
Merit. Indeed Title ought to be but as a Sign; as the King's Arms or Picture to a Shop of a rich Merchandise; so Title should be but to have it known there is a worthy Person, who is full of Noble Qualities, Moral Virtues, Sweet Graces, Divine Influences, Learned Sciences, Wise Counsels, and the like, which ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced and traffick'd within the world, for their own and others good, benefit and pleasure; for the riches of the Mind must do as other riches, which is to disperse about, not to lie unprofitably hid, and horded up from all use; but they ought to be as Staple Commodities, and not as Trifles of Vanity, which wear out, or are laid by, as mens humours change, and are more for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than benefit. But some men seem to be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than they are, and some to be poorer than they are; they that seem richer than they are, lay all in their outward Shops, and those that seem poorer than they are, lay all in their inward Ware-houses: Those that lay all in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shops are vain-glorious Persons, those that lay all in their inward Ware-houses are magnanimous Persons; But womens Minds or Souls are like Shops of small-wares, wherein some have pretty toyes, but nothing of any great value. I imagine you will chide me for this opinion, and I should deserve to be chidden, if all Women were like to you; but you are but one, and I speak of Women, not of One woman; and thus I am neither injurious to You, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to our Sex; but I wish with all my heart, our

               <p>I Hear the Lady <hi>B. A.</hi> and the lady <hi>C.

Thus you may see many of our Sex are made Saints, though they be Sinners, but they are Sainted for theit Beauty, not for their Piety, for their outward Form, not for their inward Grace: Indeed they are worldly Saints, and the Court
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100053:17"/>
is their Heaven, and Nature their Goddess, which indues them with attractive Graces; to which I leave them, and rest,</p>

               <p>I Hear the Lady <hi>D. C.</hi> makes Politick feasts and entertainments, feasting the Courtiers, and entertaining them with dancing and carding, to whom she doth Politickly lose her mony, and causes her husband to lend them mony out of a Policy, and 'tis likely she will Politickly ruin her husband; for I believe she is more Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick with her husband than with the Courtiers, and they more Politick with her than her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. But many wives will perswade their husbands to invite company, pretending some Designs, whenas their chief Design is, to have Company; and they will be very free and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with their guests, making their husbands believe they are so onely to compass, or bring their Designs to pass; so as they make their husbands Pimps to Cuckold themselves, who think their wives wise women, both in their Counsels and Actions: Such, and the like inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and excuses wives have to be in company; and it is to be observed, that those wives that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100053:17"/>
love freedom and company, will be so very kind to their husbands when they bring home company, or are with such company as they like, that not onely strangers, but their husbands think them for that time the best wives in the world; whenas being all alone, to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, the Furies are no more turbulent, nor worse natur'd than they; But in much compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all is as their husbands please, whether to dance or play; upon which kind words and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour, their husbands are so ravish'd with joy, as then it is what their wives please; nay, they intreat their vvives to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and approve of all they say or do. Other vvives, to get, or be in company, vvill insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly flatter, and persvvade their husbands, that they are the wisest, or wittiest men in the world, and that there is none that knows how to entertain company but they; that for their own parts they hate much company, as nothing so tedious and troublesome, and onely take delight to see their husbands entertain guests, and love to hear them discourse with strangers, their wit and behaviour being so far above others; and to encourage their husbands, or to flatter them the more, they will repeat their Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses when they are alone together, as how well such or such a question was resolv'd, or how wittily such or such a one was answer'd, and the like; whereupon the husband often invites company, onely for his wife to hear his supreme Wit, wise Sentences, and to see his grave En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100053:18"/>
whenas his wife laughs in her mind to hear what a Fool, and to see what a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Coxcomb, and how self-conceited he is. Thus most husbands are either deluded with Politick wives, or forced to obey, or humour their Turbulent and Peevish wives, or deceived by their Insinuating and Flattering wives, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray themselves.

               <p>MOst of Mrs. <hi>L. A</hi>'s. discourse is of her self, indeed every one is apt to speak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as being full of self-love, which makes most tongues discourse of a self-theme; but her theme is, to tell how good a VVife she will make when she is married, although the proof will be after she is married, if she can get a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for I believe she wants one, and desires one, because she talks so much of a Husband, and promises so well for a Husband. Truly, it is to be observed, that all Maids love to talk of Husbands, all VVidows of Suters, and all VVives of Lovers: for men may marry, nay do often marry, yet not for Love, but for Interest,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100053:18"/>
as for Posterity, or the like; and Suters may woo, yet not for Love, but Interest, as for VVealth, or the like; But when Amorous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers plead, it is for no other design, but to lie with the VVoman they make their address to; and married VVives are more apt to yield than Maids or VVidows, having a cloak to cover their shame or reproach, and a husband to father their children; and they are more fond of amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Courtships than Maids or VVidows, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are more barr'd, as being bound in Wedlock's-bonds: besides, it requires more secrecy and difficulty, both which Women love. But when Maids, Widows, and Wives, talk of Husbands, Suters and Lovers, they are so delighted with the Discourse, as you may perceive, not only by their Speech, being then quicker, and their VVit sharper, and VVords fluenter, but also by their Looks, their Eyes being livelier, their Countenances pleasanter, and their Behaviour gayer or wantoner, than in any other Discourse, especially if it be upon particular Persons, such as they fancy, or think they fancy them. But as for Mrs. <hi>L. A.</hi> who discourses so much of a Husband, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, she will make a very good VVife, not that she sayes so, but that she hath been bred strictly and retiredly, and is of a sober, and stay'd Nature, not apt to run into Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, nor to desire variety of Company, but is Huswifly and Thrifty, and of an humble and obedient Behaviour, and not onely Attentive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100053:19"/>
to good Advices, but Tractable and practive to them; all which makes her deserve a good Husband, and I wish her one with all my heart; but she must take her fortune, whether none or any, bad or good; but many a good Batchelour makes an ill Husband, and many a wild deboyst Batchelour makes a good Husband; and as for VVidowers, many men that were good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to their first VVives, are ill Husbands to their second, or third, or fourth, or to some good, and to some bad; and some that have been ill and unkind Husbands to their first Wives, are very good, &amp; fond Husbands to their second: the like for Maids, Wives and Widows; so as none can make a wise choice in hap-hazard; for hap-hazard, as chance, barrs out VVisdom's pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it blindfolds VVisdom, having no insight into Chance; so as a Fool blinded with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, may choose in the Lottery of Husbands and VVives, as well as the VVisest, being blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the inconstancy of Mankind. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mrs. <hi>L. A.</hi> to the Lottery, and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Contemplations and Discourses, I rest,</p>

               <p>I Am of your opinion, that Philosophers &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets certainly should be the wisest men, for they having so deep an insight, as to peirce even into the Secrets of Nature, it should be easie for them to have an insight into the Designs, Counsels, and Actions of Men, &amp; to foresee the Effects of Things; for they that can Judge of Hidden and Invisible Causes, and find out their Effects, may easily Judge of Visible Actions or Businesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Mankind; and there is no man that can be Wise, that hath not a deep peircing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and a clear fore-sight to conceive and fore-see, what is, and what may probably be; for 'tis not History that makes men Wise, nor Law, nor Logick, nor to be Learn'd in all the Sciences, but to have a Natural Ingenuity, as to conceive Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, to judge Solidly, to understand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, to perceive Readily, to distinguish Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to compare Rightly, to search Narrowly, to examine Strictly, to observe Generally, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Seriously, of all that hath been, is, or is not, or what may be, or cannot be; In all which, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophers and Poets are the most Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious men; But of this sort of men the world hath not many, indeed so sew, as the rest of mankind doth not understand them, for they think them rather Fools than Wise men; for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100053:20"/>
though Wise men know Fools, yet Fools know not Wise men, nay Fools do not know Fools, but Wise men know VVise men; for how should a Fool know a Fool, when he knows not Himself? But if any fault be in Natural Poets and Philosophers, 'tis that they are so delighted with Transcendency, as they will not Descend to consider, or regard the Actions and Designs of Men, no, not the outward and ordinary works of Nature; they are of Nature's privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, wherefore they scorn to be in Temporal or Human Counsels of Men; they are Natural States-men, and will not be Temporal States-men, neither they will attend Temporal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being Nature's Chief Courtiers; and when they chance to observe the Actions and Courses of other men, they view them with a despising smile, to see their gross Errours, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Follies, painful Pleasures, foolish Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and unprofitable Labours: also Natural Philosophers and Poets are not only the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, but the Happiest men; not only in pleasing themselves with their vast Knowledge, supreme Wits, subtil Conceptions, delightful Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and curious Fancies, having all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Mind, and Pleasures of Thoughts, but in that they can Conquer their Unruly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Unsatiable Appetites, and order their Minds according to their Fortunes; they are Happy in any Condition, having their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness always with them, and in them, &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, when other men's Happiness lies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100053:20"/>
without, and their Unhappiness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, their Minds are alwayes like trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Waters, and every cross Accident is apt to make a Storm, when Poets and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Minds are like the fixt Stars, having onely a twinkling motion; or rather like the Sun, which keeps a constant Course, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alters, but yet moves swiftly about the world, and views every corner, and peirces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very bowels of the Earth, and their Sun-like Mind is the Light of their Thoughts; like as the rest of the Planets receive light from the Sun, so the Thoughts from the Mind; and as the Sun hath Heat and Light, so hath the Mind Reason and Knowledge; and as the Sun inlivens several Creatures, so their Mind conceives several Causes and Effects, and creates several Fancies; and as the Sun shews the World, and the World of Creatures, so the Mind finds and shews the Truth of Things.

mentioned, but he seem'd to be rapt up into the third Heaven, and from thence to descend to declare her Praises; and to repeat his Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they were so extraordinary, as they will not easily go out of my Memory, so as you shall have them word for word. First, he said, She was a Lady fit to be the Empress of the whole world, for though Fortune had not given her a Temporal Imperial Crown, Dignity and Title, as neither by Inheritance, Victory, nor Choice, nor had not advanced her to a Temporal Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power, nor placed her on a Temporal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Throne, nor held she a Temporal Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Scepter, yet she was Crown'd at her Birth the Empress of her Sex; for though Fortune had not Crown'd her Body, yet Nature had Crown'd her Soul with a Celestial Crown, made of Poetical Flame, instead of Earthly Gold that Crown's the Body; and instead of Diamonds, Pearls, and other pretious Stones set in Golden Crowns, her Celestial Crown was set with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Judgement and Wit, also with clear Distinguishings, oriental Similizings, and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Fancies, a Crown more glorious than <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adne</hi>'s Crown of Stars; and though she was not advanced on a Temporal Imperial Throne, yet she was set higher, as on a Throne of Applause; and though she possess'd not a Temporal Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Power, nor held a Temporal Imperial Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet she had a powerful Perswasion and the tongue of Eloquence; and though she was not adorn'd with Imperial Robes, yet she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100053:21"/>
with Natural Beauty; and though she had not a Temporal and Imperial Guard, yet she was guarded with Virtue; and though she was not attended, waited and served with and by Temporal and Imperial Courtiers, yet she was attended, waited on, and served by and with the sweet Graces, and her Maids of Honour were the Muses, and Fame's house was her Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Palace. Thus was she Royally Born, and Divinely Anointed or Indued, and Celestially Crown'd, and may Reign in the memory of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Age and Nation to the world's end; and not onely Reign, but Reign Happily, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and Famously. But when he had said what I have related, I could not chuse but smile, to hear such Poetical commendations of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, doubting none of our Sex was worthy of such high, and far-fetch'd Praises; he ask'd me why I smil'd? I told him, I smil'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how the Passion of Love had bribed his Tongue; he said, he was not guilty of partial Bribes, but Justice had commanded his Tongue to speak the Truth: I told him, I was glad to find, at least to hear, that there was Justice in Men, and Merit in Women, as the one to Praise, the other to be Praise-worthy; but I pray'd him to give me leave, or to pardon me, if I told him, that his Speech shew'd, or express'd him not a Temporal and Imperial Courtier, as to praise one Lady to another, and to give so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Praises to an absent Lady, as to leave no Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the present Lady: He pray'd me to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100053:22"/>
him that Errour, and that hereafter he would alwayes Praise that Lady he was present with. But, Madam, those Praises given the Lady <hi>T. M.</hi> had I been apt to Envy, it had turn'd me all into Vinegar, or dissolv'd me into Vitriol; but being unspotted, and free from that speckled Vice, I am heighten'd with joy to hear any of our Sex so Celestial, as to deserve a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Praise: And leaving you to the same Joy, I rest,</p>

Loyalty, as also, for Courtesie, Civility, and Obligements; for wise Forecasts, prudent Managements, industrious Ingenuities, noble Commands, and honest and conformable Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; likewise for graceful Behaviours, and handsom Demeanours; also, for Fencing, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Vaulting, Wrestling, and the like; for proper and fit Sciences for Noble Persons to be learn'd and known, as Fortification, Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Astronomy, Cosmography, Architecture, Musick, and History; and for Wit, as Scenes, Songs, Poems, and the like: and this Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes them Admire, Love, Respect, and Praise each other, and watch all opportunities to Oblige each other, thinking and esteeming it a Happiness so to do; for the effects of Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are quite different from the effects of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, for Envy is full of Dispraise and Detraction, either covertly or openly, and watches all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do Mischief, and to obscure the Beauty of Virtue, and the grace and becoming demeanours of Virtuosoes; whereas Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rejoyces when Virtue is visibly Seen, and justly Praised, and Virtuosoes highly Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: indeed, Emulation dwells with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest Persons, Envy with the Basest.

               <p>I Remember you told me, that formerly you thought Time troublesome, and every Place wearisome; as in the Spring, you would wish for Summer, when Summer came, you would wish for Autumn, and in the Autumn you would wish for Winter, a cold wish; nay every Day, every Hour, every Minute, you thought Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Long. Indeed Time runs so fast upon Youth, as it doth oppress Youth, which makes Youth desire to cast it by; and though the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time is swift, yet the Desire of Youth is swifter, and the Motions of Thoughts are as far
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100053:26"/>
beyond the Motions of Time, as the Motion of Time is beyond the Motion of Nature's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture; so as Youth through it's Sharp, Greedy, Hungry Appetite, devours Time, like as a Cormorant doth Fish; for as he never stayes to chew, but swallows down whole Fishes, so Youth swallows, as it were, whole Dayes, Weeks, Months, Years, untill they surfeit with Practice, or are fully satisfied with Experience: The same reason makes Youth weary of every Place or Company, for they are not satisfied, because they have not had enough variety of Knowledge, they know not the right use of Time, the unprofitable use of Vanity, the restless motions of Variety, nor know they the Deceits, Abuses, and Treacheries of their own Kind, as Mankind, neither do they know their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Dispositions, they know not what to Choose, nor what to Leave, what to Seek, nor what to Shun; neither have they felt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burdens of Cares, nor oppressions of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for Losses and Crosses; they have not been pinched with Necessity, nor pained with long Sicknesses, nor stung with Remorse; they have not been terrified with bloody Wars, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of Natural Friends, nor betrayed by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friendships; they have not been robbed of all their Maintenance, nor been banished their Countrey. Thus being tenderly Young, they are Opprest with the quick repetitions of Time, and their Senses being Sharp, and their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites Hungry, they greedily Devour Time,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100053:27"/>
though in the end Time devours them, the Meat, the Eater; also the desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge makes every Place and Company wearisom, for Youth takes delight in that which is New, they being New themselves, for Youth is like Garments new made, and being new themselves, they Sympathetically delight and love new things, as new Clothes, new Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, new Vanities, new Sports, new Countries, new Companies, new Lovers, new Friends, and any thing that is new to them, insomuch as they would rather have a new Enemy, than an old Friend; and thus will Youth do, until Time turns its back, whereupon are written all the Follies of Youth, which Follies they could not see to read whilst Time was before them, for while Times face is towards them, they onely see their childish desires, which are all written upon Times breast. But, Madam, I believe, that Time, as troublesom as it hath seem'd to you, you would be glad now of its stay; but Time doth as all Courting Amorosoes do, they run to imbrace Youth, though they tire Youth with their troublesom kindness, but when the gloss of Youth is past, they leave off their Amours, nay, they hate those they made love to, and strive to get away from them as fast as they can, and as far off: Just so doth Time, it makes love to all, and then forsakes all it hath made love to. But, Madam, it hath but newly turn'd its head from you, but it will turn its whole body; at first it will seem to pace slowly from you, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100053:27"/>
it will mend its pace, and at last run from you, yet let it not run without your repining, or grieving for its neglects, for no perswasion will make it stay. But, Madam, you will be happier in Times neglects, than in its imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and will make more advantage from Times heels than from its head, for Times head is fill'd with Vanity, and on Times heels is Experience; yet although Time runs from you, Wisdom will stay with you, for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Son of Time, and became Wise by his Fathers Follies, which are written upon his Fathers back; for Wisdom waits alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Father, and neither Wisdom the Son, nor Time the Father, do meet face to face; and you will find more happiness in Wisdom's Company than in Times Courtships, for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Conversation is Comfortable and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, it speaks with the Tongue of an Oratour, the Wit of a Poet, and the Advice of a Friend; then who would be troubled with the fantastical Humours, apish Actions, flattering Speeches, and subtil Deceits of Time?

               <p>I Am sorry that Mrs. <hi>P.

But I observe that cards is one of the chief pastimes of our Sex, and their greatest delight, for few or none of our Sex loves or delights in Poetry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Copy of Verses made in their praise, wherein for the most part is more Flattery than Wit; neither doth our Sex delight or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Philosophy, for as for Natural Philosophy they study no more of Nature's works than their Faces, and their greatest ingenuity is, to make them Fairer than Nature did; and for Moral Philosophy, they think that too tedious to learn, and too rigid to practise; yet I make no question but they have heard of Temperance, though few are acquainted with it, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they scorn to accompany, they despise
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100053:28"/>
her as a mean, plain Huswife, and Fortitude can get no entrance, for strong Fears keep her out; as for Justice, I think our Sex doth onely resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Emblem or Moral, as Justice is blinded with a band to keep out Partiality, so our Sex is blinded with Ignorance, which keeps out Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and though our Sex holds no Sword in their hands to cut off Offences, yet they hold as sharp a Weapon in their mouths, to cut off good Fame, and will make more Offences, than the Sword of Justice is able to cut off; and as for the Balance of Justice, which is Judgement, they never use it, for they seldom Weigh any thing; and for Faith, Hope, and Charity, they seem to have no more Faith than to believe their own Praises, and their onely Hope is for pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Beauty or Title, for Place or Wealth, and for Vanities; and as for Charity, they spend so much upon themselves, as they have nothing left for the Poor; and they are so far from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning their Passions and Appetites, as their Passions and Appetites govern and rule the whole course of their Lives; neither doth our Sex take much delight in true History, for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally our Sex is too lazy to look back into past Times, neither have they the peircing foresight to see into Future times, they only regard the Present; neither doth our Sex take much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in harmonious Musick, only in Violins to tread a measure; the truth is, the chief study of our Sex is Romances, wherein reading, they fall in love with the feign'd Heroes and Carpet-Knights,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100053:29"/>
with whom their Thoughts secretly commit Adultery, and in their Conversation and manner, or forms or phrases of Speech, they imitate the Romancy-Ladies: And our Sexes chief Pastime is Gaming of all kinds or sorts, but most Cards, whereby they lose more money than get reputation; indeed Carding is their Work, for they make it rather a Labour with long and tiresome Sitting, careful Playing, and painful Vexing and Fretting, than a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Recreation; and our Sexes chief Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is Dancing, not alone, amongst themselves, for that they hate, but in masculine Company, and this they love so well, as to dance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a firie heat, if not a Fever; and their onely delight is in Love and Courtships, and their only pleasure Luxury, insomuch as they are for the most part Eating, whether Sitting, Walking, or Dancing.

I am sorry to hear gallant men should brag of their own Actions, for their bragging takes off the gloss of their Courage; for as Time takes off Youth or fresh Colour off Beauty, so Self-praise takes off the Esteem and Honour of Merit: But as some will boast of their own Worth, so others will boast of their own Baseness, as what subtil Cheats they have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, or whom they have Betrayed, or how ingenious they were in telling Lies, or how many Robberies they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as also of their Disobedience, Disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like; others will boast of their Debaucheries, as how often they have had the <hi>French</hi> Disease, how many Women they have Debauch'd, how much they can Drink before they are Drunk, and how long they can sit a Drinking, what Monies they have Won or Lost at Play, how Vain and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive they are, or have been, and many the like, which I wonder at, that men should Glory and take a Pride in that which is Base or Foolish: But this argues some men to have mean Souls and foolish Brains, full of idle Discourses, wanting Judgement and Wit; also unprofitable Lives, and when they Die there is a good riddance, for they were but as Rubbish in the World, which Death, like as an honest painful Labourer, takes up like as Dunghils, and throws them into the Grave, and buries them in Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not being worthy of a monument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100053:30"/>
Home-lovers, that is, the He-friend makes love to the Wife, or the She-friend is Courted by the Husband; and if they be both married, 'tis likely they Cuckold each other; and thus, for Example, these Ladies are become Enemies through Jealousie, for though the Lady <hi>L. T.</hi> profess'd to love her Friend the Lady <hi>A. M.</hi> dearly well, yet it seems, she will not have her to Share with her of her Husbands Love or Courtship, although Sir <hi>T. O.</hi> the Lady <hi>L. T</hi>s. Husband, could be no less than a Servant to his Wives dear Friend; Besides, it is a temptation to an Husband, to see two She-friends Imbrace, and Kiss, and Sport, and Play, which makes the Husband to desire to do the like, not with his VVife, but his VVives Friend, for temptation is from that which men are not accustomed to, or to do as they see others do; but 'tis likely, when the jealous Humour of the Lady <hi>L.

               <p>IN your last Letter I perceive the Gallants of the Time, I mean Gallants for Youth and Bravery, for Vice and Vanity, for Expence and Prodigality, for foolish Quarrels, and rash Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, these Gallants, it seems, condemn Age as unfit for State-affairs, as neither to Govern, Command, Direct, nor Advise; but certainly those States or Kingdoms that have young Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Counsellers, shall have more Combustions and Disorders committed by their Ignorance and Follies, than the most experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Age can Rectifie: indeed such Kingdomes and States are rather govern'd by Chance than Wisdom. 'Tis true, Fools have Good Fortune sometimes, but not so often as Bad, which shews they neither have a Politick <hi>Vlysses,</hi> nor a Counselling <hi>Nestor,</hi> for though Young men may Fight as <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet they can neither Counsel as <hi>Nestor,</hi> nor Speak as <hi>Ulysses</hi>; not but that some Old men may be Fools, but it is against Nature for Young men to be Wise, wherefore they are fitter to Obey than to Command, and to be Advised, than to give Counsel, for it is a wonder whenas young Counsellers keep Peace, or young Generals be Conquerours; and it makes them more Famous, because not Usual, especially when Fortune favours them, as she
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100053:31"/>
doth many times their Rash Adventures, or haughty and Ambitious Enterprises; for good Fortune makes Youth appear more Glorious than Age; but Fortune many times favours Youth, as she favours Fools, for a time, and in the end leaves them to their own Ruin; but where Fortune hath little or nothing to do, as in wise Counsels, there their Ignorance and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Passions and Partialities, Factions and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations appear, especially in the success of their Counsels; wherefore Young men may better and more safely be trusted with an Army than a City, for 'tis more safe to leave them to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than to trust them with Prudence; for Young men can tell better how to make Wars, than to keep Peace, being easier to Lead an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than to Rule a Kingdom, to Fight a Battel, than to Order a Commonwealth, to Distribute Spoils, than to Do Justice, for Fortune hath more power in Victory than Right. 'Tis true, sometimes there's such a Concurrence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in Affairs of State, as also in Armies, as the Wisest or Valiantest men cannot make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor Fools nor Cowards worse, which is the cause that many times Wise or Valiant men, or both, may be thought Fools and Cowards, and Fools and Cowards Wise or Valiant men; and many times Fools are too hard for Wise men, by reason there be numbers of Fools for few Wise men, nay, numbers of Fools for One Wise man, which Wise man may be buried in the Rubbish of Fools; but if a Wise man be not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100053:32"/>
overpower'd, he treads down their Follies and Triumphs in Peace and Prosperity: But Aged men most commonly are assisted and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> and Young men by <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> The truth is, 'tis against Sense and Reason, that Young men can be so VVise, or proper for Affairs of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, either to Command, Govern, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, as Aged men, who have had long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and great Observations, by Seeing, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Knowing much, so as there is nothing New, or Unacquainted to them, neither in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, Changes, nor Chances; for Nature, Fortune, and Time, is their long Acquaintance, by which they know the Appetites, Passions, Humours, Dispositions, Manners, and Actions of Men, with their Defects, Errours and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; also the Revolutions of Time, the Casualties of Chance, the Change of Fortune, and the Natural Course, Causes, and Effects of several Things in the VVorld, all which makes Aged men VVise, and want of such Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Observation, makes Young men Fools in comparison of Aged men; for Young men can have but a Relative, and not an Experienced Knowledge, nor can they have very much by Relation or Reading, having not time enough for Instruction &amp; Learning; whereas Aged men have Read, Heard, Seen, Convers'd and Acted in and of several Ages, Societies, Nations, Men, and Business; also in several Places of several Subjects, and several Matters, to several Men,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100053:32"/>
at several Times: But Young men are so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and Opinionative of themselves, as they think, they neither want Wit, Judgement, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, nor Knowledge, and that Antient men rather Dote than Know; but though Young men cannot be Wise in Nature, unless by Inspiration, yet those are nearest to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that have been Bred up, Instructed, and Educated by Wise Age, and so much Better and more Knowing they are than others which have been Bred, Instructed, and Educated by Young Pedants or Governours, as the first shall be as Old men, although but Young, and the others shall be as Boyes when they are Young Men, and Young Men when they are Old, or rather Boyes all their life time, although they should live long; so that one may say, Happy is Youth that lives with Age: But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as well Aged as Young men, to Knowledg and Ignorance, Wisdom and Folly, Prudence and Fortune, I rest,</p>

Thus, Madam, we may perceive how Discourse in Conversation is Judged of, and for the most part Condemned by the Hearers, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the Ladies imagine that they are Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and Commended for their Wit and Confident Behaviour; for Self-love thinks all is well Said or Done, that it self Speaks or Acts, so that Self-love doth alwayes Approve it self, and Dispraise others.

               <p>VVE have no News here, unless to hear that the Lady <hi>C. R.</hi> did beat her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and because she would have Witness e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100053:33"/>
she beat him in a Publick Assembly, nay, being a woman of none of the least Sizes, but one of the largest, and having Anger added to her Strength, she did beat him Soundly, and it is said, that he did not resist her, but endured Patiently; whether he did it out of fear to shew his own VVeakness, being not able to Encounter her, or out of a Noble Nature, not to Strike a VVoman, I know not; yet I believe the best: and surely, if he doth not, or cannot tame her Spirits, or bind her Hands, or for Love will not leave her, if she beat him Often, he will have but a Sore life. Indeed I was sorry when I heard of it, not onely for the sake of our Sex, but because she and he are persons of Dignity, it belonging rather to mean-born and bred VVomen to do such unnatural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for certainly, for a VVife to strike her Husband, is as much, if not more, as for a Child to strike his Father; besides, it is a breach of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial Government, not to Obey all their Husbands Commands; but those Women that Strike or Cuckold their Husbands, are Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Traitors, for which they ought to be highly punished; as for Blows, they ought to be banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Husbands Bed, House, Family, and for Adultery, they ought to suffer Death, and their Executioner ought to be their Husband. 'Tis true, Passion will cause great Indiscretion, &amp; VVomen are subject to Violent Passions, which makes or causes them so often to err in VVords and Actions, which, when their Passion is over,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100053:34"/>
they are sorry for; but unruly Passions are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a cause of uncivil Words and rude Actions, whereas Adultery is caused by unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; wherefore Women should be Instructed and Taught more Industriously, Carefully, and Prudently, to Temper their Passions, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Appetites, than Men, because there comes more Dishonour from their unruly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Appetites, than from Mens; but for the most part VVomen are not Educated as they should be, I mean those of Quality, for their Education is onely to Dance, Sing, and Fiddle, to write Complemental Letters, to read Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, to speak some Language that is not their Native, which Education, is an Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Body, and not of the Mind, and shews that their Parents take more care of their Feet than their Head, more of their VVords than their Reason, more of their Musick than their Virtue, more of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than their Honesty, which methinks is strange, as that their Friends and Parents should take more Care, and be at greater Charge to Adorn their Bodies, than to Indue their Minds, to teach their Bodies Arts, and not to Instruct their Minds with Understanding; for this Education is more for outward Shew, than inward Worth, it makes the Body a Courtier, and the Mind a Clown, and oftentimes it makes their Body a Baud, and their Mind a Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san, for though the Body procures Lovers, yet it is the Mind that is the Adulteress, for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100053:34"/>
if the Mind were Honest and Pure, they would never be guilty of that Crime; wherefore those Women are best bred, whose Minds are civilest, as being well Taught and Govern'd, for the Mind will be Wild and Barbarous, unless it be Inclosed with Study, Instructed by Learning, and Governed by Knowledg and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for then the Inhabitants of the Mind will live Peaceably, Happily, Honestly and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, by which they will Rule and Govern their associate Appetites with Ease and Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their Words, as their Houshold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will be imployed Profitably.

               <p>YEsterday I employed my time in reading History, and I find in my self an Envy, or rather an Emulation towards Men, for their Courage, Prudence, VVit, and Eloquence, as not to Fear Death, to Rule Commonwealths, and to Speak in a Friend's behalf, or to Pacifie a Friend's Grief, to Plead for his own Right, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100053:35"/>
to Defend his own Cause by the Eloquence of Speech; yet this is not in all Men, for some men have Courage and no VVit, and some have VVit and no Conduct, and some have neither VVit, Courage, nor Conduct; but mistake me not, for I do not Envy or Emulate a Stubborn Obstinacy, nor a Desperate Rashness, nor an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving Policy, nor Fine VVords and Choice Phrases; but to Fight Valiantly, to Suffer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, to Govern Justly, and to Speak Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Movingly, Timely and Properly, as to the purpose, all which I fear Women are not Capable of, and the Despair thereof makes me Envy or Emulate Men. But though I love Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice Best, and trust to Valour Most, yet I Admire Eloquence, and would choose VVit for my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime. Indeed Natural Orators that can speak on a Sudden and Extempore upon any Subject, are Nature's Musicians, moving the Passions to Harmony, making Concords out of Discords, Playing on the Soul with Delight. And of all the Men I read of, I Emulate <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> most, because he was a man that had all these Excellencies, as Courage, Prudence, Wit and Eloquence, in great Perfection, insomuch as when I read of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> I cannot but wish that Nature and Fate had made me such a one as he was; and sometimes I have that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as to think I should not be afraid of his Destiny, so I might have as great a Fame.

And, Madam, if you do Consider well, you cannot chuse but Admire, and Wonder at the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100053:36"/>
Power of Eloquence, for there is a strange hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mystery in Eloquence, it hath a Magical Power over mankind, for it Charms the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Inchants the Mind, and is of such a Commanding Power, as it Forces the Will to Command the Actions of the Body and Soul, to Do, or to Suffer, beyond their Natural Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and makes the Souls of men the Tongue's Slaves; for such is the power of an Eloquent Speech, as it Binds the Judgement, Blindfolds the Understanding, and Deludes the Reason; also it Softens the Obdurate Hearts, and causes Dry Eyes to Weep, and Dryes Wet Eyes from Tears; also it Refines the Drossy Humours, Polishes the Rough Passions, Bridles the Unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appetites, Reforms the Rude Manners, and Calms the Troubled Minds; it can Civilize the Life by Virtue, and Inspire the Soul with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. On the other side, it can Enrage the Thoughts to Madness, and Cause the Soul to Despair. The truth is, it can make Men like Gods or Devils, as having a Power beyond Nature, Custom and Force, for many times the Tongue hath been too Strong for the Sword, and often carried away the Victory; also it hath been too Subtil for the Laws, as to Banish Right, and to Condemn Truth; and too hard for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Men, making their Passions its Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and since Eloquence hath such Power over Arms, and Laws, and Men, as to make Peace or War, to Compose or Dissolve Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, to Dispose of Souls and Bodies of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100053:36"/>
wherefore those men that are indued with such Eloquence, and overflowing Wit, are both to be Fear'd and Lov'd, to be highly Advanced or utterly Banished; for those whose Eloquent Wit out-runs their Honesty, are to be Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but those that employ their Eloquent Wit, and Elegant Graces, to the service of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, are to be Esteemed, Respected, and Relied upon, as Pillars of the Commonwealth. But to conclude, Wit makes a Ladder of Words, to climb to Fame's high Tower, and the Tongue carries men further than their Feet, and builds them a Statelier, and more Lasting Palace than their Hands, and their Wit, more than their Wealth, doth Adorn it. But now, leaving Words and Wit, I rely upon Love and Friendship, and rest,</p>

               <p>I Heard by your last, that the Lady <hi>S.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100053:37"/>
or otherwise I was Constraind, in not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Liberty, that usually other VVives have, to go Abroad, and receive what Visitors they please: But if she did but know the sweet Pleasures, and harmless Delights I have by this Retirement, she would not have said what she did; and to answer to what she said, This course of Life is by my own voluntary Choice, for I have liberty to do any Thing, or to go any VVhere, or to keep any Company that Discretion doth Allow, and Honour Approve of; and though I may err in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, yet not in cases of Honour, for had I not onely Liberty, but were Perswaded or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by all the World's Allurements, or were Threatned with Death, to Do, or Act any thing against Honour, or to do any Thing or Act, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did not Approve of, I would not Do it, nay, I would Die first: But in that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Honour, are many Ingrediencies, as Justice, Chastity, Truth, Trust, Gratitude, Constancy, and many the like. Next I answer, That it is not out of a Fantastick Humour, that I live so much Retired, which is to keep my House more than go Abroad, but out of Self-love, and not out of Self-opinion, and it is Just and Natural for any one to Love himself: Wherefore, for my Pleasure and Delight, my Ease and Peace, I live a Retired Life, a Home Life, free from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements, confused Clamours, and rumbling Noise of the World, for I by this Retirement live in a calm Silence, wherein I have my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100053:37"/>
free from Disturbance, and my Mind lives in Peace, and my Thoughts in Pleasure, they Sport and Play, they are not Vext with Cares nor worldly Desires, they are not Covetous of worldly VVealth, nor Ambitious of empty Titles; they are not to be catch'd with the Baits of Sensual Pleasures, or rather I may say, Sensual Follies, for they Draw my Senses to them, and run not out to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; they have no quarrelling Disputes amongst them; they live Friendly and Sociably together; their onely Delight is in their own Pastimes and harmless Recreations; and though I do not go Personally to Masks, Balls, and Playes, yet my Thoughts entertain my Mind with such Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, for some of my Thoughts make Playes, and others Act those Playes on the Stage of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, where my Mind sits as a Spectator, Thus my Mind is entertain'd both with Poets and Players, and takes as much Delight as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar</hi> did to have his <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> the Patron of Poets, sit and hear <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> read their Works unto them; so my Mind takes Delight in its dear <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> which is Contemplation, and to have its Poetical Thoughts, although not like <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Horace,</hi> yet such as they are, it is pleased to have them Repeat their Poems, and other VVorks which they make; and those my Mind likes best, it sends them forth to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to write them down, and then to send them out to the publick view of the VVorld; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Senses send in Objects to the Mind,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100053:38"/>
who straight commands his Poetical Thoughts to take them for Plots of Playes, or causes the Grave Philosophical Thoughts to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of them, or his Oratorical Thoughts to practice their Eloquence on them, or his Critical Thoughts to Dispute and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with them, which done, all their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Discourses, Disputes, Arguments, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, Playes, and the like, made on those Objects, are sent back to the Senses to write them down, so that the Mind and the Thoughts imploy the Senses, and the Senses imploy the Mind and Thoughts, and thus I take as much Pleasure within my self, if not more, as the Lady <hi>S. P.</hi> doth without her self; indeed none enjoyes truly himself, but those that live to themselves, as I do, and it is better to be a Self-lover in a Retired Life, than a Self-seeker in a Wandring Humour, like a Vagabond, for they go from Place to Place, from one Company to another, and never are at rest in their Minds nor Bodies; and how should it be otherwise? for they lose themselves in Company, and keeping much Company, they know not where to find themselves, for as for their Dwelling-place, they are sure to miss of themselves there; but indeed they have no constant Dwelling, for going much Abroad, they dwell Every where, and yet to speak Metaphorically, No where. But every ones Delights are different, for the Lady <hi>S. P.</hi> delights her self with Others, and I delight my self with my Self; Some delight in Troubles,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100053:38"/>
I delight in Ease, and certainly much Company and Conversation cannot chuse but be Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; for in much Company are many Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, much Envy, much Suspicion, much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, much Faction, much Noise, and much Non-sense, and it is impossible, at least impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for any particular Person to please all the several Companies they come into, or are visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, if the Resort be many, by reason every one hath as different Humours as Faces, wherein some will be Displeased, if others should be Pleased, and most commonly they are so far from pleasing All, as None is Pleased; for if any particular Person should Praise Every one, it would be thought Flattery, if he should Praise None, it would be conceived to be Envy, if he should Praise but Some, it would be judged to be Partiality; the like for Discourse; if one should Address his Discourse to any One, or to Some more than to Others, it would be taken as a Disrespect, if Generally, to the whole Company, it would be accounted Pride, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ones self to be the onely Singular Person that must have a General Audience; neither can any one Person fit his Discourse to every one's Humour, Fancy, Capacity, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Knowledge or Delight, nay, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, whatsoever is Spoken, is Interpreted to the worst Sense, at least, Contradicted, and when they are parted, their Words or Discourse is Repeated to their Disadvantage, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented on, and Interpreted to an evil Sense;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100053:39"/>
and if they say Nothing, or but Little, they are accounted Ill-natured, or thought Fools, and yet they love not to hear any one speak but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, every one desires to be heard, yet takes it ill not to be spoken to; also if particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons make an Entertainment, if they invite not those they have no acquaintance with, as well as those of their Acquaintance, if they are within the distance of coming to the Entertainment, they take it for an Affront, but if they should leave out any Acquaintance, it is a Breach for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and they become their Enemies: also if particular Persons be accoustred Bravely, they are Envied, if they be attired in plain, mean Garments, they are Despised; and if any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be more Beautiful than commonly the rest are, if she appears to the World, she shall be sure to have more Female Detractors and Slanderers, to ruin her Reputation, than any Monarch hath Souldiers to fight an Enemy, &amp; if any Woman be Ill-favoured, it is mentioned as a Reproach, although it be Nature's fault, and not hers, and if she be indifferently Handsom, they speak of her as Regardless; if she be in Years, they will say, she is fitter for the Grave than Company, if Young, fitter for a School than Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if of middle Years, their Tongues are the Fore-runners of her Decay; if she have Wealth, and no Titles, she is like Meat, all Fat and no Blood, and if great Title with small Wealth, they say, she is like a Pudding without Fat, and if she hath both Wealth and Title, they Shun

her as the Plague, they Hate to see her, as Owls hate the Light, and if she hath neither Wealth nor Title, they Scorn her Company, and will not cast an eye towards her; and thus the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is to every Particular: wherefore it is impossible for any Particular either to Please the Humours, or Avoid the Slanders or Reproaches of the Generality, for every One is against Another; indeed, every One is against All, and All against every One, and yet through the itch of Talk, Luxury, Wantonness and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they will Associate into Companies, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may say, Gather into Companies, and Frequent each others Houses, whereas those that endeavour to be truly Happy, will not be Troubled with such Follies, nor Disturbed with such Toyes: But I am not so Retir'd, as to bar my self from the Company of my good Friends, or such as are free from Exception, as not to Translate harmless and simple Words, to an evil Sense or Meaning, or such as are so Noble, as not to Dispraise, or Detract from such Persons as they are pleas'd to take the pains to Visit, or from such as will not take it for a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, if I do not punctually return their Visit, or perhaps not Visit them at any time, but will Excuse or Pardon my Lazy Humour, and not account it a Disrespect, as truly it is none, for I do Honour and Admire all Civil, Worthy, and Honourable Persons, and would be ready at all times Honestly to Serve them. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Life is so Pleasing to me, as I would not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100053:40"/>
change it for all the Pleasures of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick World, nay, not to be Mistress of the World, for I should not desire to be Mistress of that which is too Big to be Commanded, too Self-willed to be Ruled, too Factious to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, too Turbulent to live in Peace, and Wars would Fright, at least Grieve me, that mankind should be so Ill-natur'd and Cruel to Destroy each other.

or a mixture of both, I read part of the day in that Book, and it was my chance to read the Life of <hi>Pericles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> in which Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he is Commended for his Gravity, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Wisdom; this <hi>Pericles</hi> I did much Admire all the time I read of him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I did read where it was mentioned of his marrying <hi>Aspasia,</hi> a famous Courtesan, and then I did not think him so Wise a man as I did before, in that he could not rule his Passion better, but to marry a Whore; neither doth Gravity and Wantonness suit well together, for to my imagination a Grave Cuckold doth appear most Ridiculous: And although she was Constant to him, yet the Lewdness of her former Life could not but be a great Blemish to him, as to marry the Dregs and Leavings of other men; But it seem'd that she had an Attractive Power, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on such as they call Wise men, as States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Philosophers, and Governours, and all this Power lay in her Tongue, which was a Bawd for the other end; nay, so well (it is said) she could Speak, that not only such men as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned did come to hear her, and to learn to speak Eloquently by her, but many also brought their Wives to hear her, which in my opinion was Dangerous, lest they might learn her Vice with her Rhetorick; but it seems the <hi>Graecians</hi> were not like the <hi>Italians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Wives, although they were like them concerning their Courtesans; but honest

               <p>SIr, <hi>D. D.</hi> and his Lady had invited a great many of their Friends to a Feasting Dinner, and being Set, they fell to Eating, and soon after to Talking, for Talking accompanies Eating and Drinking, especially at a Feast; but amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Discourses, they were speaking of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100053:42"/>
Husbands and Wives, where Sir <hi>D. D.</hi> said somewhat that his Wife had great reason to take Unkindly, knowing her Virtue had deserv'd more loving Expressions from him, especially in an open Assembly, which Unkindness forced Tears through her Eyes, but they were becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tears, for they did not cause the Feature in her Face to be Distorted, for she appear'd in her Countenance Sweet and Amiable, as if there had been no Discontent in her Mind, neither did she shew any Discontent in her Words or Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for she neither Complain'd, nor Rail'd at her Husband, nor Quarrel'd with him, nor rose from the Table in a Passion, to the Disturbance of the Company, as most Women would have done, and often do, when they are Displeased or Anger'd, but she wip'd the Tears from her Eyes, and Addrest her self, as she did before, to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Friends Civilly and Courteously, and when they had all Dined, and the Cloth taken away, she ask'd pardon of her Friends for her Tears, saying her Tears had made their meeting appear rather as a funeral Condoling, than a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feasting: But truly, said she, I could not help it, for they would not be restrain'd do what I could, for some words my Husband spoke cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Storm of Grief in my mind, which rais'd up Billows of Tears that overflow'd my Eyes, yet, said she, the Dearest and Loving'st Friends will both Take and Give Cause of Exception sometimes, for not any Man or Woman is so Perfect as not to Err; and thus her Discretion
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100053:42"/>
did not suffer her Passion to Disturb her Guests, and her good Nature did Excuse her Husband's Folly, and her Love did Forgive his Disrespect to her; But the Lady <hi>C. C.</hi> did not behave her self so, for her Husband Sir <hi>G. C.</hi> and she had invited many of their Friends to a Feasting Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and she, as the Mistress, to order all affairs belonging to a Wife, took upon her to order the Feast, and being a Mode-Lady, would have a Mode-Feast; but the Cook knowing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster loved rost Beef, sent in a Chine of rost Beef to the Table, and when her Guests were all Set, and beginning to Eat, she spied the Chine of Beef, whereat she was very angry, to have, as she thought, her Feast disgraced with an old English fashion, and not only an Old, but a Countrey fashion, to have Beef serv'd to their Table; wherefore she, to shew her self a Courtier, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Country-Lady, commanded one of the waiters to take the Beef from the Table, Sir <hi>G. C.</hi> her Husband desired not to have it taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for said he, I love Beef better than any other Meat, but she to express she had a Ladies Nice Stomack, or rather a Nice Ladie's Stomack, said, the Beef was fulsom to her Eyes, and made her Stomack sick to see it, her Husband bad her to look upon some of the other meat, and to give him leave to eat of what he lik'd; but she would not agree to that, for, said she, the very Smell was Offensive to her, and therefore she would have it taken away, he said it should not be taken away, untill he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100053:43"/>
had eaten as much as he would; but in fine, their words Multiplied, and gathered together in an outragious Tumult, raised their voices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Uproar, and then from Words they went to Blows, flinging whatsoever came next to hand at one anothers head; their Guests being in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be Hurt, rose from the Table, and Sir <hi>G. C.</hi> and his Lady rose also, and went to Cuffs, but their Friends did soon part them, and the Lady went Crying into her Chamber, and was Sick, because she had not her Will, at least Feign'd her self Sick; As for their Guests, they were rather invited to Fast than to Feast, as it fell out, for all the fine Quelquechose was spoil'd, and overthrown in the hurly burly, but the Beef was so Substantial and Solid, as it strongly kept its place, on which the Guests might have Fed; but Fright, Noise and Disorder, had taken away their Appetite to Eating. Thus, Madam, I have related these Feasts and Entertainings, to let you know the different Humours and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of these two Ladies, the one having cause to be Angry, did Patiently and Discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pass over her Injury, appearing Celestial, the other out of a vain Humour, fell into a raging Passion, the truth is, she shew'd her self a Fool, and behav'd her self as Mad.

Melancholy since she was married, which is a sign she is not pleas'd with the Condition of her Life; I believe one of the causes of her Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is; that she is in the Country, wherein is little Resort, especially of courting Gallants, for most Women love Variety of Company, and much Company, even married Wives as well as Maids, neither do all Widows shun Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; As for Maids, they have an excuse to get them Husbands, and Widows are at liberty to make a second, third, or fourth Choice, when their Husbands are dead, but Wives have no excuse for the Company of Courting Servants, and merry Meetings, but onely the Splene, which nothing can cure but Company and Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to divert Melancholy, and to remove the Splenetick Obstructions and Crude Vapours, for which Dancing, Feasting, Gaming, and the like, is the best Cure, <hi>Probatum est</hi>; Whereas the lone Company of a Husband is so far from working any Cure, as it is many times the Cause of the Disease; But if her Melancholy proceed from want of Variety of Company, I pitty both her Husband and Attendants, for most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Peevish Frowardness doth attend that Melancholy, they will Quarrel with every Thing, and not be Pleased with Any, take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions at every Word, complain of being Sick, but know not where their Pains are, even as Weary of Themselves, which makes their Husbands many times Weary of Them, and to Divert the Grief of their Wives Troubles, they

Solace with their Wives Maids, who are more Pleasant Company, being not troubled with the Splene, as not having a Husband, nay, when they do Marry, their minds are so employ'd about getting a Livelihood, as they have not time to think of their Splenes, besides, they are forced to Labour and VVork for their Living, which keeps them from such Obstructions or Disease, and the Splene is a Disease which is onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Noble and Rich, whose VVealth makes them Idle, and their Idleness begets an appetite to Variety of Diets, Clothes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereas Poor, Laborious People know not such Disease.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100053:45"/>
chose a Fool for his Mistress? he said, he did not Court her for her Wit, but for her Beauty; for, said he, now I have a Mistress for Delight, and a Wife for Conversation, I have a Mistress to Look on, and Admire, and a Wife to Listen to and Discourse with, and both to Embrace at my Pleasure; but, said his Friend, if your Wife should come to know you have a Mistress, you will not take much Pleasure in her Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unless you account mourning Complaints of, or to you, Exclamations and Curses against you, cross Speeches, opposite Actions, and hideous Noise, to be Conversable and Delightful; for the truth is, said he, your Wife's words will be so Salt, Sharp, and Bitter, as they will Corrode your Mind, Leaven your Thoughts, and make your Life Unpleasant. My Wife, said Sir <hi>W. C.</hi> shall not know I have a Mistress; his Friend replied, your often Absence will Betray you, or else some other will tell her, for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is like Murder, it seldom escapes finding out; and since that time Sir <hi>W. C</hi>s. Lady hath heard of her Husbands Mistress, but she seems not to be Angry at it, but talks of it with great Patience, saying, that if her Husband takes Pleasure in Variety, he will be more delighted with her Wit, than with his Mistress's Beauty, and will sooner be tired with gazing on One Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than in hearing Divers Discourses and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of Wit, Sense, Reason, Judgement, Fancy, and Speech; Besides, said she, VVit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Mind more to Love, than Beauty to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100053:46"/>
Admiration, and if my Husband Loves me Best, said she, I am well content he should Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire her Beauty Most, as also to Imbrace her as much as he pleases, for I am so Delighted, and VVedded to my own VVit, that I regard not my Husbands Amours nor Imbracings, for VVit is Spiritual and not Corporeal, it lives with the Mind, and not with the Body, being not subject to the gross Senses, for though Wit, said she, may be made known by VVords and Actions, yet those are but the Pictures of Wit's VVorks, not VVit it self, for that cannot be Drawn, it is beyond all Draughts; and so much Difference, said she, is between my Husband's Mistress and his VVife, as a Picture and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Spirit, which Spirit can both Help and Hurt, Delight and Terrifie, Damn and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; But howsoever, said she, my VVit shall not be my Husbands Evil Spirit, neither to Reproach him, nor to Disgrace, Reprove, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, or Anger him, but it shall be alwayes ready to Defend, Commend, Inform, Delight, and if it could, to Reform him; but I believe, said she, that is past the power of my Wit, for it is a hard matter to Restrain Nature from Liberty, especially of the Appetites, for the Passions of the Mind are more easily Govern'd, than the Appetites of the Body, for they are Sensual and Brutal, wherefore Time is a better Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Appetites than Reason.

liable to be Tempted, yet men have not been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently tempted, perswaded, or allured to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courtesans, unless in this Age, wherein Courtesans are so Prevalent and Fortunate, as they do not onely get themselves Husbands, when Beauty and Lovers begin to leave them, but marry more Richly and Honourably for Dignities, than Honest, Chaste Widows, or Pure and Innocent Virgins, which is apt to make Honest and Chast Women to doubt, their Honesty and Chastity is not blest with such good Fortune as Dishonesty is, insomuch as those that are not Honest, merely, and for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, than for Honestie's sake, may be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted through hopes of good Fortune; but where Virtue takes a thorow Possession, it never leaves the Habitation; yet many that have been Base, Wicked, and of Beastly Lives, may be Reformed, so as to become very Honest, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and Pure, and such Reclamed Persons ought to be Esteem'd and Respected, for I am not of Mrs. <hi>F. R</hi>s. Humour, who Hates a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formado. But some Men are of that Humour, as they Hate Honest, Chast Women, not onely out of a Despair of their Enjoyments, but that they love the Company and Conversation of Wanton and Free VVomen, insomuch that a Courtesan shall have a greater and stronger Power to Cause and Perswade Men to do Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not onely to the Ruin of their Estates and Families, but to the Ruin of their Honours and Reputation, nay, to make them Unnatural, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant

               <p>YOu were pleas'd to tell me in your last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there was a great and earnest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between <hi>O. G.</hi> and <hi>C. O.</hi> in Divinity, as to prove many things which are easier to be Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than Proved; for though Proof makes Knowledg, yet Belief doth not make Proof;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100053:48"/>
for though many thousands of men Believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like one Thing or Things a thousand years, yet neither the number of Men, nor of Years, doth prove it to be true, it only proves that so many Men did believe it for so many Years; for though there be many things in Nature that may be Conceiv'd, and Demonstrated to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, at least, to have a Probability in Reason, but cannot be Demonstrated to the Senses, yet the Conceptions do oftener deceive, not onely the Reason, but the Senses, than the Senses do the Reason or Conception, for though the Senses may, and are oftentimes Mistaken and Deluded, yet they are the most certain and surest Guides and Informers we have; But Divinity is above all Sense and Reason, as also all Demonstrations, wherefore Faith is required in all Religions, for what cannot be Conceived or Apprehended, must be Believed, and if the chief Pillar of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is Faith, Men should Believe more, and Dispute less, for Disputations do argue Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith, nay, they make a Strong Faith Faint, for all Disputes in Divinity are Enemies to Faith, and are apt through Contradictions and Different Opinions, to Destroy Religion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Thoughts and Mind Atheistical, and the VVords Sophistical, Men spending more time in Disputing than Praying, rather striving to Express their VVit than to Increase their Knowledge, for Divine Mysteries are beyond all Natural Capacity, and the School-men have rather taught Men Contradictions than Truth,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100053:48"/>
and Church-men rather Division than Union. But all Disputes and Arguments in Divinity are onely fit for Church-men, whose Profession is to be Teachers and Instructors in the Divine Laws, and not for Lay-men, unless they intend to be Church-men: for as all National Laws have Judges, Serjeants, Barresters, Attornies, and the like, to Perform and Execute the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Civil Laws, that have been Prudently Enacted for the Good and Benefit of the Bodily Life and Commonwealth; so there are Bishops, Deans, Deacons, Parish-Priests and Curats, to Perform and Execute the Divine Laws, which have been Spiritually Enacted for the Salvation of mens Souls; and as Lawyers are Informers of the National Laws, and Pleaders of Causes, so Ministers are Informers of the Divine Laws, and Teachers of good Life, and all Spiritual Causes should be Decided by the Bishops, as all National or Human Causes by the Judges, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there would be a Confusion both in Church and State; wherefore those that are not of that Profession, ought not to meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or Dispute thereof, but to Submit to that which our Fore-fathers thought fit to Enact, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Dispose, for the good of their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and Succedent Times; And so leaving <hi>O.

               <p>YOu were pleased to desire, that one of my Servants should inquire for Sir <hi>N. G.</hi> and give him a Letter, or to leave the Letter at his Lodgings. Madam, I must tell you what I hear, which is, that he may be Enquired for, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be Found, or his Lodgings Known, he will be gone out of the Town; not that he obscures his Lodging, but that he Stayes not any where, for he is like a Shadow, or a Ghost, when you think it is so near as to speak to it, it straight appears afar off, or Vanishes away; and he is not onely in this City, but in every Town, for he rides from Town to Town, as Birds flie from Tree to Tree, and his onely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is for Divertisement for Health, so that his Life is as if it rid Post; but let him ride from Death as far as he can, and do what he can to Shun it, yet Death will Meet him at his Journeys end, and there Arrest him, and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his Body in a Grave, for Time hath laid an Action of Battery against him, and hath now threescore and fifteen years Summoned him to Appear, but as yet he keeps out of Sight, and will as long as he can, as we may perceive by his riding, and short stay in every place he comes to. Indeed Nature hath been his Friend, and seems
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100053:49"/>
to be so still, and as long as she Protects him, Death cannot get him; nay, she hath Favour'd him more than many of his Neighbours, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, for he never stayes so long in one place, as to make a Neighbourhood, but hath Acquaintance in every place; neither doth he tronble any Acquaintance with long Visits, but onely as to ask how they do, and so farewel; he doth not stay to examin the long Welfare of his old Acquaintance, nor to make tedious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements with new Acquaintance, nor stayes to inquire for those Acquaintance he sees not, but he will make new Acquaintance at first sight; and this Advantage he hath by riding to several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if it be any, that he hears more News than any other man, for he meets News in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Town, which his Memory like a Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua carries with him, and as in every Town he takes up some News, so in every Town he leaves some; But such a Posting Life, were I a Man, would be Wearisom to me, for it would soon Tire my Life, or Rid me out of the World, at least to my thinking, although to him it is a Sport and Pleasure, or else he would not do so, since he is not Constrain'd thereto. Wherefore, as for your Letter, it must either be sent back to you again, or else it must lie here as a Watch to Take him, for it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should Overtake him, nor can any one tell where to find him, except those that are in the same place he is, which soon changes to Is not, so as one may say, he Is,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100053:50"/>
and Is not, he is like a Juglers Ball, 'tis here, 'tis gone; but he is no Jugler himself, for I hear he is a very Worthy Person, and his Honest and Harmless Endeavour to Prolong his Life, shews him a Wise man; and so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him and your Letter to meet, though I know not when, I rest,</p>

               <p>I May give the Lady <hi>F.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100053:50"/>
a Wife; no, said the former Man, it was not the Wisdom of the Man, but the Folly of the Woman, that caus'd that Match; so she was even with her first Husband in Folly, for he play'd the Fool to Marry her, and she play'd the Fool to Marry her second Husband. Thus most of the World of mankind is mistaken, for what they Attribute to some men's Wit, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men's Folly, but for Marriages, the truth is, that Folly makes more Marriages than Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as for Example, Mr. <hi>A.

               <p>I Have observed, that in time of Peace most men study the School-men and Fathers, and in times of War they study Martial-men and Poets, or rather Practise what former Martial-men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100053:51"/>
have Taught, and Repeat what former Poets have VVritten, for when they are in Garrisons, or have any spare time from Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Assaulting, or Defending, they will chuse to read <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Lucian,</hi> rather than St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or the like, or rather than they will read Books of Controversies, as <hi>Scotus, Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and others, they will read <hi>Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries</hi>; the truth is, though School-men and Books of Controversies do not Fight Combats, yet they make Quarrels and Disputations, so that there are More, Oftener, and Continual Wars in Schools than in the Field, onely that their Weapons they use in Schools, are not so deadly as those that are used in the Field, for there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tongues and Swords, Words and Blows; The truth is, Scholars and Women quarrel much alike, as after the same manner, wherein is more Noise than Danger, and more Spite than Mischief; but yet different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion and Laws in a Commonwealth, cause Cruel Civil Wars, making Factions and Parties, with Disputations and Arguments, and nothing will decide the Quarrel but Blood and Death, nor end the War, but Destruction of the Whole, or Conquering Victory of the one Party over the other, whereof the late Wars in this Country are a woful Example, all being brought to Confusion with Preaching and Pleading, on the one side Preachers and Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

               <p>'TIs now become a fashion for men to brag of their Fortunes or Estates, to get Credit, as to Borrow, or run on the Score, for they think if Trades-men believe they are able to Pay, they will be willing to Trust, and if they can get Trust, they'l spend as long as their Credit will last, and when they ow Most, they bear up Highest, for Tradesmen for fear of Losing what they have Trusted or Lent, will Trust or Lend more in hope to be paid All at last, so as they fling the Handle after the Hatchet; and whereas at first the Borrowers are Humble to get Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, at last the Creditors become Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for their Own, and VVait for an Answer

with their Caps in their hands, and the Borrower, like a proud Favorite, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Seen or Spoken to, nay, when he vouchsafes them his Presence and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, he gives them VVords for Pay, and Promises more than he is able to Perform, and sometimes they have Frowns and Checks, for being so Presumptuous to Come before they were Sent for, or so Bold to Ask for what was justly Owing them; But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Creditors deserve good VVords for their good Deeds, though they can get no Mony for their VVares. But in these needy times Tradesmen must venture to Trust, or else they will hardly put off their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for where one payes ready Mony, five, nay twenty, run on the Score; the reason is, there is not so much Mony <hi>in Specie,</hi> not in all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay, in the VVorld, as to pay readily for all that is Bought, for there are more Commodities than Mony, I may say, more Paper than Mony, for Paper and Parchment payes more than Mony; a little Mony sprinkled amongst many Bills and Bonds, keeps up Commerce and Trading throughout the VVorld, more than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Commodities doth.

And as there are several Degrees of Wit for Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Sorts of Wit for Quality, so there are Several Weights of Wit, for Salt Wit is Heavy and Searching, it Presses to the Centre, and Peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Quick, and opens the Obstructions of the World of Mankind, like as Mineral VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do the Splene, or the like parts of the Body, whereas Fresh Spring Wit is Light and Airy, Running with a Smooth and Quick Motion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing the VVorld of Mankind, Bathing the Soul, Cleansing the Thoughts, and Quenching the Drought of Time, which is Overheated with Running; but least my Pen should become Dry with Writing, having not VVit enough to Moisten it, I'le take my leave, and rest,</p>

               <p>SInce I writ to you that Letter of the first of the last Month, I have several times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with Mrs. <hi>R. E.</hi> and I find her Wit runs in Parts, like as Musick, where there must be several Parties to Play or Sing several Parts; she is not a whole Consort her self, neither can she Play the grounds of Wit, but yet she can make a shift to fill up a Note; and it is to be observed, that Wit in several Persons runs on several Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but few have general Wits, as to Play Musically upon every Subject, especially with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a Fault, for I have known some, on some particular Subjects, will be wonderful Witty, and on others mere Dunces and Idiots. And for parts of Wit, some have Gossiping Wit, as Midwife and Nurse Wit, also Wafer and Hippocras Wit, Ale and Cake Wit, as in Christning, Churching, Lying in, and other Gossipings; Others have Bridal Wit, Game-some Wit, also Gaming Wit, Tavern-Wit, Brothel-VVit, and some have Court-VVit, which is a Jeering, Scoffing Wit, but all these are but Scums or Dregs of VVit, onely Scum-VVit swims on the top, which soon boyls over, and Dreg-VVit lies at the bottom, and is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stirr'd without much motion to raise it up.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100053:55"/>
Thus several sorts of Wit run about amongst Mankind, and Mrs. <hi>E. R</hi>s. Wit is a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Wit, as loving Friendships, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of Souls, but take her from the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks,</hi> and she is gone, both from Wit and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, or those are gone from her; and so leaving her to her single-Self, and her Wit to her <hi>Platonick</hi>-Lover, I rest,</p>

               <p>TH' other day the Lady <hi>S. M.</hi> was to Visit me, and I gave her Joy, she said she should have Joy indeed if it were a Son, I said, I bid her Joy of her Marriage, for I had not seen her since she was a Wife, and had been Married, which was some four VVeeks ago, wherefore I did not know she was with Child; but she rasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind out of her Stomack, as Childing-VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men usually do, making Sickly Faces to express a Sickly Stomack, and fetching her Breath short, and bearing out her Body, drawing her Neck downward, and standing in a weak and faint Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as great bellied VVives do, bearing a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Burden in them, told me she had been with Child a fortnight, though by her behaviour one would not have thought she had above a VVeek to go, or to reckon; But she is so pleased with the Belief she is with Child (for I think
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100053:56"/>
she cannot perfectly Know her self, at most it is but breeding Child) as she Makes or Believes her self Bigger than she Appears, and says, she Longs for every Meat that is Difficult to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and Eats and Drinks from Morning till Night, with very little intermission, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Night; whereupon I told her, if she did so, I believ'd she would be bigger Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and greater Bodied, whether she were with Child or not; besides Eating so much would make her Sick, if she were not with Child; she answer'd, that Women with Child might Eat Any thing, and as Much as they would or could, and it would do them no Harm. But I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, that generally VVomen take more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure when they are with Child, than when they are not with Child, not onely in Eating more, and Feeding more Luxuriously, but taking a Pride in their great Bellies, although it be a Natural Effect of a Natural Cause; for like as VVomen take a greater Pride in their Beauty, than Pleasure or Content in their Virtue, so they take more Pride in Being with Child, than in Having a Child, for when they are brought to Bed, and up from their Lying in, they seem nothing so well Pleased, nor so Proud, as when they were great with Child; and to prove they are Prouder, and take more Pleasure in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, and in Lying in, than in Having a Child, is their Care, Pains, and Cost, in Get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Making, and Buying Fine and Costly Childbed-Linnen, Swadling-Cloths, Mantles,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100053:57"/>
and the like; as also fine Beds, Cradles, Baskets, and other Furniture for their Chambers, as Hangings, Cabinets, Plates, Artificial Flowers, Looking-glasses, Skreens, and many such like things of great Cost and Charge, besides their Banquets of Sweet-meats and other Junkets, as Cakes, Wafers, Biskets, Jellies, and the like, as also such strong Drinks, as methinks the very Smell should put a Childbed-Wife into a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as Hippocras and Burnt-Wine, with Hot Spices, Mulled Sack, Strong and High-colour'd Ale, well Spiced, and Stuffd with Tosts of Cake, and the like, all which is more chargeable than to bring up a Child when it is Born; nay, they will rather want Portions for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are grown to be Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or want sufficiency of Means to pay for their Learning and Education, than want these Extravagancies of Luxury and Vanity at their Birth; and their Children being Christ'ned, are like some Brides and Bridegrooms, that are so Fine on their Wedding-day, as they are forc'd to go in Raggs all their lives after, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is very strange, that for the Vanity and Shew of one day, they will spend so much as to be Beggars all their lives after; But as I said, this Proves that Women take a greater Pride and Pleasure in Being with Child, than in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children well Bred, and well-Bestow'd or Maintain'd, when grown to Years; and that which makes me wonder more, is, that Wise Men will suffer their Foolish Wives to be so
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100053:57"/>
Foolishly and Imprudently Expensive, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such men are worthy to be Impoverished, that will suffer their wives to be so Vain, for it shews them to be better Husbands than Fathers, Kinder to their VVives than Careful of their Children, also it shews them Fonder Husbands than Loving Children, because they Ruin their Fore-fathers Posterity, by Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing their own Succession, and that onely to Please their Wives Humours, and to Expend for their Wives Vanities. But leaving the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>S.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100053:59"/>
Markets, which are also Publick Meetings, (for all Markets are Publick) are so well stor'd of all sorts and degrees of Titles, Professions, Ages, and the like, as they are as Cheap as stinking Makrel, and all Coins are current there, but Virtue, wherefore that is never offer'd; 'tis true, the Markets of <hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are in one and the same City or Place, yet <hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> Sell apart, like as several Grasiers bring their Beasts to one Market or Fair; I call them several Markets, to make a Distinction of which belongs to <hi>Hymen,</hi> and which to <hi>Venus</hi>; but for better Distinction's sake, I will put them into Shops apart, or into as many Pews in one Church, or Compare them to several Scenes in one Mask, several Acts in one Play, for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stalls or Shops there are in one Market, and several Magistrates in one City, so many Shops hath <hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in one Market; but the Cheapest that are to be sold out of <hi>Hymen's</hi> Shops, are young Novices; and although there is much scarcity in <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Shops, yet the Price of Gold or such Riches, if they be offer'd, buyes any man that is there to be sold, which are Batchelours and Widdowers, for there's no Married man in <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Shops, unless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known that they were bought before, and once Discover'd, they are Punish'd, for Married men can neither be Bought nor Sold by <hi>Hymen</hi> or his Customers, until they be Widowers; but in <hi>Venus</hi> Shops there be as many, if not more, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men than Batchelours or Widowers; but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100053:60"/>
both in <hi>Hymen</hi>'s and <hi>Venus</hi>'s Shops there are of all sorts, Better and Worse, as Mean Persons and others of Quality, Handsom and not Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, Old and Young, and of middle Years; And as for Women, few are Sold in Shops, for they are the Buyers, and Married Women are the best Customers <hi>Venus</hi> hath; &amp; though Married Women go to the Publick Market, which are Publick Meetings, as Fine as they can be Drest, and to the Publick View, out of pretence to meet there, and speak with such of their Friends that are <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Customers, as also to help those Friends to Choose and Bargain for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or to keep them Company, yet when they go to <hi>Venus</hi>'s Shops they go Covered with their Veils, or rather Follies, for fear they should be known of their Husbands that lye there to be sold, for though they go Uncovered to <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Shops, as with their Friends, to Assist them, yet to <hi>Venus</hi>'s Shops they go alone. Thus Married and Unmarried take some occasion to be at the Market, and thus there is more Trade, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick and Commerce, in this Market than in any other; But such Persons as will live Single and Chast, never come there, unless some few; and this sort of Persons for the most part live in <hi>Diana</hi>'s Court, which are Cloisters or Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; also some few Married Wives that live Retired, do not Frequent this Market, but if they do, they never come into any of the Shops, but stand in the midst of the Market-place, that it may be known they Buy nothing

I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100053:61"/>
said, I thought no Posture was more becoming, nor did fit Devotion better, than Kneeling, for that Posture did in a manner Acknowledg from Whence we came, and to What we shall return, for the Scripture says, from Earth we came, and to Earth we shall return; then she spoke of Prayers, for she is all for Extemporary Prayers, I told her, that the more Words we used in Prayer, the Worse they were Accepted, for I thought a Silent Adoration was better Accepted of God, than a Self-conceited Babling; Then she ask'd me, if I thought one might not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, by Tempering their Passions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, or by Banishing the Worst of them from the Soul and Body, to that Degree, as to be a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or so Divine, as to be above the Nature of Man; I said no, for put the case Men could turn Brass or Iron, or such gross Metals, into Gold, and Refine that Gold into its height of Purity, yet it would be but a Metal still; so likewise the most Refined Man would be but Human still, he would be still a Man, and not a God; nay, take the Best of Godly Men, such as have been Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Grace, Prayer and Fasting, to a degree of Saints, yet they were but Human and Men still, so long as the Body and Soul were joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but when they were Separated, what the Soul would be, whether a God, a Devil, a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or Nothing, I could not tell; with that she Lifted up her Eyes, and Departed from me, Believing I was one of the Wicked and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, not capable of a Saving Grace, so as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100053:61"/>
she will not come near me again, lest her Purity should be Defiled in my Company, I believe the next news we shall hear of her, will be, that she is become a Preaching Sister; I know not what Oratory the Spirit will Inspire her with, otherwise I believe she will make no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Sermons, but I think those of her Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling do defie Eloquence, for the more Non-sense they Deliver, the more they are Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their Godly Fraternity.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100053:62"/>

               <p>TH' other day the Lady <hi>D. C.</hi> and the Lady <hi>G. B.</hi> came to Visit me, and being both met together, as Visitants, they fell into a Discourse of History, and so of former Times, and Persons of both Sexes, at last they fell into a Discourse of Married Wives, giving their Opinions of Good and Bad Wives that had lived in former Ages, and the Lady <hi>D. C.</hi> said, that <hi>Lucretia</hi> was the Best Wife that ever History mentioned, in that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100053:63"/>
she Kill'd her self to save her Husbands Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, being a Dishonour for a Husband to have an Abused, as a Ravished Wife, for though her Husband was not a Cuckold through her free Consent, yet was he a Cuckold through her Inforcement, which was a Dishonour in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree; The Lady <hi>G. B.</hi> said, that though she did believe <hi>Lucretia</hi> was a very Chast Woman, and a Virtuous and Loving Wife, yet whether she Kill'd her self to save her Husbands Honour of her Own, she could not Judge, unless she had the Effect of a God, to know the Minds and Thoughts of human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for perchance <hi>Lucretia</hi> might know, or verily believe, that when her Husband should come to know the dishonourable Abuse that was done unto her, he would have Kill'd her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, not so much through a Jealous mistrust of her, but for the Dishonour or Disgrace of the Abuse, and if so, then the Cause of <hi>Lucretia's</hi> Killing her self, was as much through Prudence &amp; Wisdom as through Virtue, for in Killing her self she gain'd an Immortal Fame, for Dying by her Own hand she seem'd Innocent, whereas, had she Dyed by her Husband's hand or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the World being Censorious, would have thought her a Criminal; wherefore, since <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> must Dye, she chose the best way, to Dye by her own voluntary Act, but had <hi>Lucretia</hi> been Unmarried, said she, and had been so Abused, she had been a Fool to have Kill'd her self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she had endeavoured to have Kill'd her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buser,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100053:64"/>
for it would be more Justice to have Kill'd the Murderer of her Honour, than to have Murdered her Innocent Self, onely the Revenge ought in Honour to have been Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in some Publick Place and Assembly, and then the Private Abuse Declared, if it had not been Known already: But these two Ladies arguing whether <hi>Lucretia</hi> Kill'd her self for her Husband's Honour of for her Own, at last grew so Earnest in their Discourse, as they fell to Quarrel with each other, &amp; in such a Fury they were, as they were ready to Beat one another, nay, I was afraid they would have Kill'd each other, and for fear of that Mischief, I was forced to be a Defender of both, standing between them, and making Orations to the one and then to the other; at last I intreated them to Temper their Passions, and to Allay their Anger; and give me leave Ladies, said I, to ask you what <hi>Lucretia</hi> was to either of you? was she of your Acquaintance or Kindred, or Friend, or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or Nation? and if she was none of these, as it was very probable she was not, Living and Dying in an Age so long afore this, nay, so long, as the Truth might Rationally be questioned, if not of the Person, yet of the Manner of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for perchance the clear Truth was never Recorded, Falshood having been written in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of much later Times than that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi>; therefore Allay your Passions, for why should you two Ladies fall out, and become Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s sake, whom you never knew

or heard of, but as in an old Wife's Tale, which is an old History.

Thus talking to them, at last I calmed their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and made them Friends again, but making Peace between them, I spent more Breath and Spirits, than the Peace of two Foolish, at least, Cholerick Ladies was worth, for although there is an old Saying, Happy is the Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, yet I am happy I am quit at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of their Company, and that I can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe my self,</p>

               <p>YOu were pleased in your last Letter to tell me, that you had been in the Country, and that you did almost Envy the Peasants for living so Merrily; it is a sign, Madam, they live Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, for Mirth seldom dwells with Troubles and Discontents, neither doth Riches nor Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur live so Easily, as that Unconcerned Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100053:65"/>
that is in Low and Mean Fortunes and Persons, for the Ceremony of Grandeur is Constrain'd and bound with Forms and Rules, and a great Estate and high Fortune is not so easily manag'd as a Less, a Little is easily order'd, where Much doth require Time, Care, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Study as Considerations; but Poor, Mean Peasants that live by their Labour, are for the most part Happier and Pleasanter than great Rich Persons, that live in Luxury and Idleness, for Idle Time is Tedious, and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Unwholsom, whereas Labour is Healthful and Recreative, and surely Country Huswives take more Pleasure in Milking their Cows, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Butter and Cheese, and feeding their Poultry, than great Ladies do in Painting, Curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Adorning themselves, also they have more Quiet &amp; Peaceable Minds and Thoughts, for they never, or seldom, look in a Glass to view their Faces, they regard not their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, nor observe their Decayes, they Defie Time's Ruins of their Beauties, they are not Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish and Froward if they look not as Well one day as another, a Pimple or Spot in their Skin Tortures not their Minds, they fear not the Sun's Heat, but Out-face the Sun's Power, they break not their Sleeps to think of Fashions, but Work Hard to Sleep Soundly, they lie not in Sweats to clear their Complexions, but rise to Sweat to get them Food, their Appetites are not Queazie with Surfeits, but Sharp'ned with Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they relish with more Savour their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100053:65"/>
Course Fare, than those who are Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd do their Delicious Rarities; and for their Mirth and Pastimes, they take more Delight and true Pleasure, and are more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Pleased and Outwardly Merry at their Wakes, than the great Ladies at their Balls, and though they Dance not with such Art and Measure, yet they Dance with more Pleasure and Delight, they cast not Envious, Spiteful Eyes at each other, but meet Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Lovingly. But great Ladies at Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings take not such true Pleasures, for their Envy at each others Beauty and Bravery Disturbs their Pastimes, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs their Mirth, they rather grow Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish and Froward through Envy, than Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Kind through Society, so that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Countrey Peasants meet with such Kind Hearts and Unconcerned Freedom as they Unite in Friendly Jollity, and Depart with Neighbourly Love, the Greater sort of Persons meet with Constrain'd Ceremony, Converse with Formality, and for the most part Depart with Enmity; and this is not onely amongst Women, but amongst Men, for there is amongst the Better sort a greater Strife for Bravery than for Courtesie, for Place than Friendship, and in their Societies there is more Vain-glory than Pleasure, more Pride than Mirth, and more Vanity than true Content; yet in one thing the Better Sort of Men, as the Nobles and Gentry, are to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100053:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is, that though they are oftener Drunken and more Debauch'd than Peasants, having more Means to maintain their Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, yet at such times as at great Assemblies, they keep themselves more Sober and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate than Peasants do, which are for the most part Drunk at their Departing; But to Judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Peasantry and Nobles for Happiness, I believe where there's One Noble that is truly Happy, there are a Hundred Peasants; not that there be More Peasants than Nobles, but that they are More Happy, number for number, as having not the Envy, Ambition, Pride, Vain-glory, to Cross, Trouble, Vex them, as Nobles have; when I say Nobles, I mean those that have been Ennobled by Time as well as Title, as the Gentry. But, Madam, I am not a fit Judg for the several Sorts or Degrees, or Courses of Lives, or Actions of Mankind, as to Judg which is Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest, for Happiness lives not in Outward Shew or Concourse, but Inwardly in the Mind, and the Minds of Men are too Obscure to be Known, and too Various and Inconstant to Fix a Belief in them, and since we cannot Know our Selves, how should we know Others?

               <p>HEre is no News, onely I read a Gazet that speaks of a Courtesan, which hath been the Ruin of many Gentlemen's and Noble Men's Estates, by presenting her with Rich Gifts, and maintaining her in Bravery, and 'tis likely she hath Ruined their Bodies, if not their Souls, as she hath done their Estates; yet it is to be hoped, that all is not Truth that is Printed in a Gazet, for it is to be observed, that Gazets are fuller of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100053:67"/>
Lies than Truths, which makes some Histories that are lately Printed and Published, to have so many Falshoods in them, being for the most part Compiled and Form'd out of Gazets; But if this part of the Gazet be true, as concerning the Courtesan, it shews that she hath a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Art of Allurements, not onely to insnare one or two, but many, which Art hath a Magick Power to Transform Rational Men to Beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adulterers, Simple Asses, and Prodigal Fools; for certainly it cannot be merely Beauty alone that can have such Power, for mere Beauty takes oftener the Eye than the Heart, it hath more Admirers than Doting Lovers, and the greatest Gift Beauty hath given, are Praises, which Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses last not Long, by reason Beauty soon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes; But when Beauty is attended with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating Arts, as Behaviour of Person, Pleasant Speech, and Harmonious Voice, as also the Arts of Musick, Dancing, Dressing, and the like, it becomes Victorious, and makes its Triumphs in many Hearts, like as in many Nations; But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times those Arts are Victorious without Beauty, whereas Beauty is seldom or never Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious without them; Indeed Women Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in these Arts are like Juglers, which Deceive Sense and Reason, making an Appearance of that which is not Really so; and thus most of our Sex Juggle with Men, they Delude them with Artificial Shews and Insinuating Flattery, and 'tis their chief Study and Endeavour so to do; But few Arrive to that Artificial Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100053:68"/>
as the Courtesan mentioned in the Gazet; wherefore it would be well if Wives had more of that Art to keep their Husband's Affections, or at least to keep them from seeking after Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; and for Courtesans to have less, that they might not Draw and Intice Husbands from their Honest Wives, nor Batchelors and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers from lawful Marriage: But for the most part Courtesans with their Arts Usurp the Wives Rights and Maids hopes; and so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the famous Courtesan to her Lovers, and her Lovers to their Ruins, I rest,</p>

               <p>IN your last Letter you sent me word, you were not of my Opinion, that all men ought to wear their Swords at all Times, and in all Places and Companies, for you say it is not fit that Drunkards, or Mad-men, or Lovers, should wear Swords; for Drunkards will use their Swords to the hurt of Others, by reason they are Quarrelsome and Abusive; and Mad-men will use their Swords to the hurt of Themselves, either through a Frantick Despair or Conceit; and Lovers will Affright their Mistresses with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100053:68"/>
them. Madam, you have forgotten two or three Words added thereto, for I said, that all Gallant Gentlemen ought to wear Swords, at all Times, and in all Places and Companies; but Drunkards and Mad-men, though they may be Gentlemen, yet they cannot be said Gallant men whilst they are Mad or Drunken, because they want their Reason to Distinguish, for the Gallantry of the Mind or Soul is Valour, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity, Humanity, Justice, Fidelity, and the like, all which cannot be, at least, not in force in Irrational Creatures, which Mad-men and Drunkards are for that time. And for Lovers, it is very Requisite they should wear Swords to guard their Mistresses, for she is but a Foolish Mistress that will be afraid of her Safety; But a Gallant man wears his Sword for his Honour, King, and Country; as for his Country, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Piety, Friendship, and Natural Affection; for his King, it includes Fidelity and Loyalty; for his Honour, it includes Truth, Right, Love, Generosity and Humanity. In truth, Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Humanity is like the Sun and the Air, for Humanity doth like the Air spread equally to all, it enters every where, and fills up all Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and Generosity like the Sun, shines every where, and on every Creature, although not at one Time, yet in such a Compass of Time as it hath strength and motion to extend it self; also his Benefits are General, he Disputes not Who or What deserves his Light or Heat, but knows his Light and Heat is Beneficial to all Creatures,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100053:69"/>
which if they Abuse to Evil Uses, it is none of his Fault. Thus Generosity shines in the Air of Humanity, and Fortitude is like Heaven, which no Enemy can Enter, it Defends and Guards the Distressed; and Valour is the Sword of Justice, to Cut off Offenders, and the Sword of Valour is a sharp metal'd Blade, that Gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should alwayes wear about them, and have Skill to Manage it, and Judgment and Discretion to know When, and on Whom to Use it.

Christ did not teach us Long Prayers, but a Short One, nay if it were lawful for Men to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milize God to his Creatures, (which I think it is not) God might be Tired with Long and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100053:69"/>
Petitions or often Repetitions; but, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Good Deeds are Better than Good Words, in so much, as One Good Deed is better than a Thousand Good Words, As for Example, One Act of Upright Justice, or Pure Charity, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Book full of Prayers, a Temperate Life is better many times than a Praying Life; for we may be Intemperate even in our Prayers, as to be Superstitious or Idolatrous; Indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Good Deed is a Prayer, for we do Good for Gods sake, as being pleasing to him, for a Chast, Honest, Just, Charitable, Temperate Life is a Devout Life, and Worldly labour is Devout, as to be Honestly Industrious to Get, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Thrive, that one may have where with all to Give; for there is no Poor Begger, but had rather a Penny than a Blessing, for they will tell you, that they shall Starve with <hi>Dieu vous assiste,</hi> but be Relieved with a <hi>Denar.</hi> Wherefore the Lady <hi>P. Y.</hi> with her much Fasting and long Praying will Starve her Self, and Waste her Life out before the Natural Time, which will be a Kind of Self-murder, and we hold Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Greatest Sinn, although it should be done in a Pious Form or Manner; but to Help a Friend in Distress is Better and more Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than to Pray for a Friend in Distress, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Beggar in Want, is better than to Pray for him, to Attend the Sick is better than to Pray for the Sick; But you will say, both do Well, I say it is Well Said, and Well when it is Done, but the One must not Hinder the Other,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100053:70"/>
wherefore we ought not to Leave the World to Pray, but to Live in the World to Act, as to Act to Good Uses, and 'tis not enough to Give for the Poor, but to see that the Poor be not Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd of their Gifts, wherefore they ought to Distribute their Gifts Themselves, and to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious to Know and to Find out those that do Truly and not Feignedly Want, neither must their Gifts make the Poor Idle, but set the Idle Poor awork, and as for those that cannot VVork or Help themselves, as the Old, Sick, Decrepit, and Children, they must be Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by those that have Means and Strength and Health to Attend them; But perchance if the Lady <hi>P. Y.</hi> heard me, she would say, I were one of those that did Speak more Good VVords, than Act Good Deeds, or that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spent my Time in Praying nor Pious Acting; Indeed I cannot, as the Proud Pharisee, Brag and Boast of my Good Deeds, but with the Poor Publican, I must say, Lord have Mercy on me, a miserable Sinner, yet I must say thus much Truth of my Self, that I never had Much to Give; for before the VVarrs of this Country I was too Young to be Rich, or to have Means in my Own Power of Disposing, and since the VVarrs all my Friends being so Ruined, and my Husband Banished from his Native Countrey, and Dispossest of his Inherited Estate, I have been in a Condition rather to Receive, than to Give: Yet I have not done much of either, for truly I am as Glad not to Receive, as Sorry not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100053:70"/>
to Give, for Obligation is as great a Burden to me, as not be Able to Oblige is an Unhappiness, not that I account it so great an Unhappiness to be in such a Condition, as to be fit to Receive, but to Receive in such a Condition, as not to be Able to return the Obligation, for the Truth is, I had rather Suffer for Want, than Take to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; But I thank God, I have not had many of those Burdens of Obligations, some few I have had, but those were from my near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Friends, not from Strangers, which is a Double, nay, a Treble Blessing; but my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is fitter for Prayer, as having not sufficient Means to do Good Works, my Husband being Rob'd of all his Estate, than the Lady <hi>P.

               <p>I Am sorry to hear there is such a Difference betwixt the Lady <hi>F. O.</hi> and her Husband, as they are upon Parting, I wish their Humours and Dispositions were more Agreeable, and their

Froward Passions less Violent; I cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Either, nor Excuse Both, for if they An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger each Other, they have Both cause to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and are Both to be Blamed for so Doing, and so Both together they ought to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but Each apart to be Excused: But Marriage is a very Unhappy Life when Sympathy Joyns not the Married Couple, for otherwise it were better to be Barr'd up within the Gates of a Monastery, than to be Bound in the Bonds of Matrimony; but whenas Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy Joyns Souls and Bodies in Marriage, then those Bonds are like Diamond-Chains to Adorn, not to Inslave them, and Heroick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Chastity are the two Thrones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Married Couple is Placed, Heroick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is the Throne of the Husband, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity the Throne of the Wife, on which Love Crowns their Lives with Peace, and Inrobes or Inclothes them with Happiness, which Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness you Enjoy, which is also the Joy,</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100053:71"/>
Thrifty, and Quiet, Harmlesly Merry and Free, yet full of Respect and Duty, which Few Servants are in this Age, for most are Idle, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening, Wastful, Crafty, Bold, Rude, Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Factious and Trecherous, and what not that is Evil? But truly, Madam, the Fault ought to be laid on the Masters and Mistresses, who either give their Servants ill Examples by their Evil or Idle Life, or through a Creduluos Trust, which is a Temptation to a Poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and it is a part of our Prayer, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation</hi>; or through a Neglect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, for there is an old true Saying, The Masters Eye makes the Horse Fat; or through a Timorous Fear of Commanding, for many Masters are Afraid to Command a Peremptory Servant, being more in Aw of the Servant than the Servant of the Master; or through much Clemency, giving their Servants their Wills so much as they neglect their Duties; or through their Prodigality, when to Inrich their Servants they make themselves Poor, so as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant becomes Greater than the Master, which makes them so Proud, that they Slight their Commands and Neglect their Services, Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting who Advanced them, and are apt to Rebel against them, just like the Devils, when they were Angels, who perceiving they were so Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Creatures, Rebell'd against their Creator, and would be as God himself; Just so are Poor Servants when their Master gives them fine Cloaths to Adorn them, or Money to Inrich
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100053:72"/>
them, or Offices to Advance them, they streight would be their Masters, nay, they will Envy their Master if they see him have any thing Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they. This I have Known by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but They will not Know it, untill they become to be like Devils, that is, in a miserable Condition, which they deserve for their Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but a Good Servant is a Treasure, sayes <hi>Solomon</hi>; and so I think is a Good Master to a Servant, if the Servant have Wit to perceive it, But a Good Master is to know How to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, When to Command, and What to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; also When to Bestow, What to Bestow, &amp; How much to Bestow on a Good Servant; also to fit Servants to Imployments, and Imployments to Servants; also to know How and When to Restrain them, and when to give them Liberty; also to observe, which of his Servants be fit to be Ruled with Austerity or Severity, and which with Clemency, and to Reward and Punish them Properly, Timely and Justly; Likewise when to make them Work, and when to let them Play or Sport; as also when to Keep them at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and when to Associate Himself with them; And truly, I should sooner chuse to Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate my Self with the Company of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, had they good Breeding, or were Capable to Learn and Imitate what did belong to good Behaviour, than with Strangers, for Good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are Friends as well as Servants, nay, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are a Guard to their Masters, for Good &amp; Faithfull Servants will Dye for the Safeguard of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100053:72"/>
their Masters Life, and they will indure any Torments rather than Betray their Masters; and it is the Duty of Servants so to Do, for Servants ow almost as much Duty to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as Children to their Parents, or Subjects to their Natural Prince, for Servants are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Govern'd, but Instructed, Fed, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; and what greater Crime is there, than to be a Traitor to their Governour, Tutor, and Nourisher of their Life? And every Master, the Meanest that is, is a Father and a King in his own Family, Wherefore to my Reason they are very unwise that will go out of their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and leaving their own Obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are their Servants, Travel into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms, which are other Families, wherein they have neither Power nor Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, leaving their own Servants without Rule or Guide, for when a Master is from Home, his Family is like a Body without a Head, like as a King should Travel into Forein Countries, and leave his Subjects and Kingdom and State-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at Random, or to a Deputy, 'tis likely his Subjects would Rebell against him through Dislike to the Deputy, as Scorning to be Ruled or Govern'd by a Fellow-Subject, or else the Deputy will get away their Love from their Prince, and then will strive to thrust the Right Owner out; The same is with a Master and his Servants; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Wise, Loving Master will keep Home, and go no oftener Abroad than Occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100053:73"/>
but will Entertain himself with his own Family, and his Family will Entertain him with Sports and Pastimes, like as Subjects do their Princes, and whenas a Servant doth Rebell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Master hath not Power to Banish him the Country or Kingdom, as Princes have, yet hath he Power to turn him out of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Banish him from his House, if his Fault do deserve it; but some may think it strange, that there are as few Masters that know how to Govern their Families Wisely, as there are Kings that know how to Rule their Kingdoms Wisely; but that is no wonder, for first, where there is One King of a Kingdom, there are Thousands Masters of Families, and a King is the Master of all those Families, insomuch as a King hath more Masters to Govern and Rule, than the Richest Master of his Kingdom hath Servants; but if Servants were as they should be, Masters would not onely Thrive by the Trusty Labours of their Servants, and Servants by the Wealth of their Master, but Masters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants would live Easily, by the Diligence of the One, and the Prudence of the Other; also they would live Delightfully, by their Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, where the Master would sit as a Kingly Spectator, whilst his Servants were Pleasant Actors, in all which both Masters and Servants would be very Happy, so as this World would seem an Earthly Paradise.

               <p>I Have observed, there are amongst Mankind as often Mode Phrases in Speech, as Mode Fashions in Cloaths and Behaviour, and so Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they are, as their Discourse is as much Deckt with those Phrases as their Cloaths with several Coloured Ribbands, or Hats with Feathers, or Bodyes with Affected motions, and whosoever doth Discourse out of the Mode, is as much Despised, as if their Cloaths or Behaviours were out of Fashion, they are accounted Fools or Ill-bred Persons; indeed most Men and VVomen in this Age, in most Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> are nothing but Mode, as mode-Minds, mode-Bodyes, mode-Appetites, mode-Behaviours, mode-Cloaths, mode-Pastimes or Vices, mode-Speeches and Conversations, which is strange to have Minds according to the Mode, as to have a mode-Judgment, for all will give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Opinions according to the Mode, and they Love and Hate according to the Mode, they are Couragious or Cowardly according to the Mode, Approve or Dislike according to the Mode, nay, their VVits are according to the Mode, as to Rallery, Clinch, Buffonly Jest, and the like, for Better VVit is not usually the Mode, as being alwayes out of Fashion amongst mode-Gallants, but True and Good VVit lives
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100053:75"/>
with the Seniors of the Time, such as Regard not the Mode, but Chuse or Prefer what is Best, and not what is Most in Fashion, unless that which is Best be in Fashion, which is very seldom if ever Known, for that which is Best or Good, is not General, especially Wit, for the Right True and Best VVit keeps to Particulars, as being Understood by Particulars; Some Moders have oftner VVit in their Mouths than in their Brains, that is, they Speak the VVit of Others, but have none of their Own. But Grave, Experienced and VVise men give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Opinion, not according to the Mode or Fashion, but according to Probability, Sense and Reason; neither do they say, such or such a Thing VVill or Shall be, or Is so, VVhy? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the General Opinion, but they say, such or such a Thing May be, or 'tis Likely Will be, or Is so, VVhy? because there is a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Reason for it: Neither do the Just and Wise Hate or Love, Approve or Dislike, because it is the Mode, as to Hate what is not Generally Loved, or Love what is not Generally Hated, or to Despise what is Generally Disliked, or Admire what is Generally Commended, but they Hate what is Really Bad, Wicked or Base, and not what is Thought so; and Love what is really Good, Vertuous and Worthy, not for the general Opinion, but for the Truth, and they Admire and Commend, Despise or Scorn, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or Disapprove that which is Despisable or Discomnendable or Scornable, and so the like;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100053:75"/>
neither are they Couragious or Cowardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mode, but they are Valiant or Cautious according to the Cause or Quarrel; they do not Fight out of or in a Bravado, but for Honour, or in Honour's Quarrel; nor do they Pass by Injury, or Cover an Anger or Affront with a Rallery or Jest, but because the Person that did the Injury, or gave the Affront, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Drunk, Mad, or a Base, Inferiour Person, fitter for his Man's Quarrel, than for his Own; and for Wise men, they Speak not with Mode-Phrases, but such Words as are most Plain to be Understood, and the Best to Deliver or Declare Sense and Reason, and their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours are those which are Most Manly and Least Apish, Fantastical or Constrain'd; and their Clothes are such as are most Useful, Easie and Becoming; neither do their Appetites Relish Mode-Meats or Sauces, because they have the Mode Haut Goust, but they Relish Best what is most Pleasing or Savoury to their Taste; and so for Drinks Compounded, as Chocolata, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monada, and the like, they will not Drink them because of the Mode; neither do they Affect Mode-Songs or Sounds, because they are in Fashion to be Sung or Play'd, but because they are Well-Set Tunes, or Well-Compos'd Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, or Witty Songs, and Well Sung by Good Voices, or Well Plaid on Instruments; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they follow Mode-Vices or Vanities for Fashion, but for Pleasure, or their own Humour or Fancy; nor do they use those Exercises that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100053:76"/>
are in Mode, but those they like Best. Thus a Wise Man Follows not the Mode, but his own Humour, for if it be the Mode to Play at Tennis, or Paille-maille, or the like, if he like better to Ride or Fence, he will let alone the mode-Exercises and Use his Own; if it be the mode-Pastime to Play at Cards or Dice, if he like better to Write or Read, he will leave the mode-Pastime and Follow his Own; and if it be the mode-Custom to Dine and Sup, and Meet at Ordinaries or Taverns, if he like better to Sup and Dine at Home alone, he will not go to Ordinaries or Taverns; if it be the Mode to make General Courtships; if he Like, or is better pleased with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mistress, he will not follow the Mode; neither will he Ride Post because it is the Mode, but because his Affairs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; neither will he Journey from Place to Place to no Purpose, because it is the Mode, but will VVisely Sit still or Rest at his own Home, because it is Easie, Peaceable, Quiet, and Prudent, as not so Chargeable. But leaving the Modists to their mode-Clothes, Oaths, Phrases, Courtships, Behaviours, Garbs and Motions, to their mode-Meats, Drinks, Pastimes, Exercises, Pleasures, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Vices; to their mode-Songs, Tunes, Dances, Fiddles and Voices; to their mode-Judgements, Opinions and Wits; to their mode-Quarrels and Friendships,

               <p>YOu were pleased in your last Letter to Ask my Opinion, Judgement, and Advice of that which you Spoke of when I last Saw you; truly, when any one asks my Opinion of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or Effects, or my Judgment of Affairs, or of any thing concerning the Actions of the World, as their Successes to Good or Bad, or Desires my Advice of any Concernment to Particulars, let me tell you, as first, for Causes and Effects, my Reason Studies, and Observation Watches, to find out the Cause by the Effects, or to Foresee the Effects by the Causes; and as for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of several Affairs and Actions in the World, I put all the Probabilities in one Scale, and all the Impossibilities, or at least Unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, in another, and Weigh them both, and which soever Scale Weighs Downward, I give my Judgement; and as for Advice to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I Examin their Means, Abilities, Strength,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100053:79"/>
Power, Right, Truth, and Justice, according to all which I give my Advice, for I Search the Bottom, Stirring up the very Dregs, or Fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Depth; like as Sailers cast their Line and Plummet to Fathom the Sea, for fear of Quick-sands, Shelves, or the like, and then Draw up their Line to see the Depth, or at least take Notice how much the Line sinks down; so do I concerning my Opinion, Judgement, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but you must Pardon me if I give not my Judgment or Opinion in a Publick Letter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Publick Affairs, in which I ought not to meddle, being a Woman; neither ought those of the Masculine Sex to give their Opinions, or Judgments, or Advices Publickly, unless they were Desired and Required so to do, as also not Impertinently, Busily, or Intrudingly, to Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or Censure, or Speak of that which they have nothing to do, or at least, where they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Help or Mend. But pray believe, I am not so Vain as to think I can Reason, Judg, or Advise Wisely, no, I onely Endeavour, or at least, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire so to do; and since you have not mentioned under your hand-writing, that which you would have me give my Opinion, Judgment, or Advice of, I will not give it under my hand, but leave it till such time as we Meet, for Friends may Talk as freely as Think, fearing no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thery, and so I rest,</p>

               <p>I Am Sorry that Sir <hi>C. A.</hi> is Kill'd, and as Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that <hi>V. A.</hi> hath Kill'd him, for by Report they were both Worthy and Right Honourable Persons, which causes me to wonder how such two Persons could Fall out, for surely they were such men as would be as Unwilling to Give an Offence as to Take an Affront, and if the Offence was Unwillingly given, as by Chance, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of Honour and Merit, would not be Grieved, at least, not Angry at or for it: but many times a Third man will make a Quarrel betwixt Two others, and leave them to Fight it out. You may say, that sometimes Quarrels cannot be Avoided, although they be betwixt two Noble Persons, as for Example, two Dukes, about the Preheminence of Place, none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which of them had the First Place, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Yielding, must needs Fight to Decide it; but such Cases are not often put to the Trial, or ought not to be, for Heraulds are for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Judges. But these two Noble Persons which you mentioned in your last Letter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their Quarrel was, the one is Kill'd, the other Banished; and now to speak of such Quarrels as generally cause Duels between Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons, they are either about Words, or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100053:80"/>
Women, or Hawks, or Dogs, or Whores, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Cards or Dice, or such Frivolous, Idle, or Base Causes; I do not say All Quarrels, but Most, for some are more Honourable, but of all Sorts or Causes of Quarrels, Drunken Quarrels are the most Sensless; As for the Manner or Fashion of Fighting, Duels in my opinion are not Proper, for in this Age in most Nations they Fight Private Duels, somewhat after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Publick Battel, as three against three, or at least two against two, also they Fight with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols and Swords, with their Doublets on, which serves instead of an Armour, and for the most part a Horse-back; first, they shoot off their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols at each other, and then they come to the Sword, if they be not shot Dead before their time comes to Fight, for Shooting is not a direct Fighting, because they must stand at some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to take Aim, which in my opinion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears Cowardly, to Pelt at each other, as if they were Afraid to come near each other; besides, a Child may have so much Skill &amp; Courage as to shoot off a Pistol, and may chance to Kill a Man, but a Child cannot tell how to use a Sword, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Horse; also a Peasant or such mean bred Persons, can shoot off Pistols, or Carbines, or Muskets, but they have no skill to use a Sword, nor know not how to manage an Horse, unless a Cart-Horse, &amp; that better in a Cart than when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stride: 'Tis true, Peasants or Common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will fight with Force and Fury like as Beasts, and Kill their Enemy with mere Strength, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100053:81"/>
not with pure Valour, for they fight as in an Uproar, and will knock one another down with their Staves, or But-ends of their Muskets, which is more a Club or Clown-fighting; and if they have Swords, they fight with the Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, not with the Point, for they know not how to use it, neither is it fit they should, wherefore the Gentlemen are too Strong for them, for the Gentleman's point of his Sword hath the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Clown's Club; and the onely Grief to Gallant, Valiant Gentlemen in the day of Battel or Duel, is, the fear they should be Kill'd with a Bullet, against which they can shew no Active Valour or Well-bred Skill. The last Observation concerning fighting Duels in this Age, is, in choosing of Seconds, and the right Use of Seconds in all Ages that I have heard of, unless these Later, is, to be Overseers, Witnesses and Judges, wherefore they ought to be Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, Honest, Judicious, and Skilful men, and Worthy, and Honourable Persons, for they are to Judge whether their Quarrel requires Blood, and may not be pass'd over without Dishonour; also they are to see that each man may be Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Armed, and that there be no Untimely Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages taken of each other; also they are to Help or Assist them when they are Wounded, as to Bind up their Wounds, and they are to witness to the World how they Fought; But in this Age, the Seconds are so far from being Judges, Overseers, Witnesses, or Helpful Friends, as they become Duellers themselves,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100053:81"/>
Fighting for Company, not for Injury or Wrong done to each other, and for Fashions sake, which is an Unjust, Irrational, Inhuman, and Wicked Fashion or Practice; neither is it Manly or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but Base and Beastly, as to Fight without Reason or Injury; wherefore Pistols and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seconds ought not to be. But, Madam, if any should read this Letter besides your self, I should be found fault with, it being not Fit, nor Proper for a VVoman to Discourse or VVrite of Duels or VVars, nor of Horses or Swords, or the like, but pray, if you hear any say so, tell him, that I have a greater Privilege than other VVomen in this Discourse, for my Husband hath been a General of an Army of 30000 men, and hath fought Battels; also he is Master of those two Arts, the Use of the Sword, and the Manage of the Horse, as there is not any man, nor hath never been, so well Known, Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Practised, as he, so that he is the best Horseman and Swordman in the World; also two of my three Brothers were Souldiers, or Commanders in War, and well Experienced in that Profession, and my Father was a Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was Banished for a time, for Killing a Gentleman in a Duel of Honour. Thus have I been Born, Bred, Lived, and Married, all with Sword-men, and to my greater Honour, all Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men; and so leaving this Discourse, I rest,</p>

               <p>THe five Ladyes which you Desire to have a Relation of, I cannot of my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge give you an Account of, for I have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Acquaintance with them, but I can tell you what Report sayes; As for the Eldest, 'tis said, she wants not Experience, though her Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes more through Misfortune than Time, for she is not Old; also that she hath a good Judgment, but makes no Good Use of it, for she is oftner Ruled by others Perswasion than her own Judgement; neither doth she want Wit, but can Speak VVell, and Promise Fair, though her Deeds and VVords be not Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nor her Performance to her Promises, for she will Speak better than Do, and Promise more than Perform; she is very Civil and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Persons, to gain their Applause, but she makes no Difference between the Noblest and Meanest, the VVorthy and Unworthy, the Honest and False, but rather of the Two she Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100053:83"/>
Affects those that are Meanest, either for Birth, Breeding, or Merit, but to some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars she is very Partial, even so Partial as to do Unjust Actions for their Sakes or by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions. Her Confidents are such as have been False, but she believes they are so Honest now, as only fit for Trust, although in all her Affairs she hath had Ill Success, for all her most Secret Intentions are made Known before they have been put into Action; but Time may make her VViser. As for the Second Lady, she seems at the first Acquaintance to be of a very Good and Generous Nature, but some time Discovers her to be rather of an Easie, Facil, than a Pure, Good or Generous Nature, a Foolish Kindness, and a Childish Liberality, that with Flattery is Ruled, Governed and Perswaded, she Loves and Gives but knows not Why, nor Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; also she is Amorous, and at this time so in Love, as it is Reported she will Marry a Person, that is so Mean, and far below her in Birth, as the Marriage will not onely Disgrace the Family from whence she Sprung, but her Posterity that may live after her; neither hath her Beloved Person nor Parts, Wealth nor Fame. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Third Lady, she is Proud and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and seems rather Obstinate than Facil, and if her Fortune were but Answerable to her Birth, she in my Opinion would Deceive the Belief of many in Doing those things that might be Worthy a Person of her Quality and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Fourth Lady is Simple, God know's,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100053:84"/>
most of her Time is Imployed in Dancing and Eating, and in Foolish, Childish Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes; She is as Inconstant as her Sex can be; she is also Amorous, and would have Love-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, if she were not afraid of those that have some Power and Authority over her, which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain her, but 'tis believed she will break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all Restraints. As for her Estate, she only thinks of the Present, but never Considers the Future, which makes her Necessitated, as she will in time be a Begger. The Fifth Ladyes Time is only spent in Giving and Receiving Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, in Balling, Dancing, and the like, but I hear nothing else of her. Thus, Madam, have I written what is Reported by those that are well Acquainted, as also by their Domesticks and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, not that I inquire into the Humours, Natures or Affairs of those Persons I have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to, but I cannot but hear of many Actions and Persons and Passages in the World, unless I should stop my Hearing; but in this Letter I have done only my Duty, in telling you what I Hear of what you Desire to Know, and as long as I live, I shall be Obedient to all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and Industrious to Satisfie all your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and Rest,</p>

               <p>YEsterday a Consort of Learning and Wit came to Visit me, but they became at last to be a Discord; This Consort was Natural Philosophers, Theological Scholars, and Poets, and their Discourse was their Musick, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers were the Bass, the Theologers the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the Poets the Treble, all which made an Harmony wherein was Variety and Delight, but the Poets that love Change of Place, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and Pastime, went away, and left the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Theologers, who began a Serious Discourse, which was Dull and somewhat Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, for it was concerning the Soul, as also the Immortality of the Soul; some of the Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers said, the Souls of Men were part of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100053:86"/>
Spirit of God, others, the Souls of men were the Breath of God, others, they were a Light proceeding from God, and all these Concluded that the Souls were an Immaterial or Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Form, but the Natural Philosophers said, that Mens Souls or any such Soul was an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which was the Purest Matter, or Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence In and Of Nature, but the Theologers would not allow that Opinion, and said, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philosophers were Atheists, whereupon the Natural Philosophers said, that the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers were Ignorant, and full of Fallacy and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry, for said they, How can No Matter have a Form or a Being? and if Souls are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, they cannot possibly be Evil, and if they be the Breath of God, they cannot be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, if so, then the Souls of Men cannot be subject to Sin, and if not subject to Sin, in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice they were not subject to Punishment, and if the Souls of all Men were produced from God, as the Beams of Light from the Sun, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Beams might be Obscured with Dark Clouds or Gross Vapours, yet they did not Lose any of their Purity or Propriety, nay, though the Sun Beams were Capable to Lose their Purity or Propriety, yet the Beams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God could not, for whatsoever Proceeds Immediately from God, can neither be Alterable nor Impure; at last the Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Philosophers became so Violent and Loud, as I did fear they would have Fought, if they had had any other Wounding Weapons
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100053:86"/>
than their Tongues, but Heaven be praised, they had no Killing Swords, and so they did no harm to each other, but after the Violence of their Dispute was past, I ventur'd to speak, saying, Noble Gentlemen, you have Discoursed more Learnedly than Knowingly, and more Vainly than Wisely, for <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, that not any thing is throughly Known, and that all is Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Sun, as well that which hath been, as what is, and shall be, and yet his Wisdom proceeded from Gods particular Gift; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave the Foolish Custom of Disputing, and bring in a Devout Custom of Praying, leaving your Souls to Gods disposing, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them with Idle Arguments; and hearing me talk Simply, they laught at my Innocency, and in their Mirth became Good Friends and Sociable Companions, and after some time they took their leave, and left me to relate their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in a Letter to your Ladiship.

               <p>IT is seldom known that a Perfect and Famous Poet or Philosopher was ever very Cruel, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were the most Bloody, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100053:87"/>
they were Kings, and it seems Reason of State was too forcible for Good Nature, and there is no Rule but hath some Exception.

               <p>SInce I last writ to you, I have been to hear Mrs. <hi>P. N.</hi> Preach, for now she is, as I did believe she would be, <hi>viz.</hi> a Preaching Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, There were a great many Holy Sisters and Holy Brethren met together, where many took their turns to Preach, for as they are for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience, so they are for Liberty of Preaching, but there were more Sermons than Learning, and more Words than Reason, Mrs. <hi>P. N.</hi> began, but her Sermon I do not well remember, and after she had Sighed and VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out her Devotion, a Holy Brother stood up and Preached thus, as I shall briefly relate to you.</p>
               <p>DEarly beloved Brethren and Sisters, We are gathered together in the Lord with Purity of Spirit to Preach his Word amongst us, We are the Chosen and Elect Children of the Lord who have Glorified Spirits and Sanctified Souls, we have the Spirit of God in us, which Inspires us to Pray and to Preach, as also to Call upon his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100053:88"/>
Name and to Remember him of his Promise to Vnite and Gather us together into his New Ierusalem, separating us from Reprobates, that we may not be Defiled with their Presence, for you Dear Brethren Know by the Spirit, that they are not the Children of the Lord but Sathans Children, they are the Children of Darkness, we the Children of Light, we are Glorified and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Supernatural Grace, we are a Peculiar People, and the Holy Prophets of the Lord, to Fore-see, Fore-tell and Declare his Will and Pleasure, also we are to Incourage and Comfort the Saints in Afflictions and Times of Tribulation and Consolation, and to Help them to Present their Sanctified Sighs, Tears and Groans unto the Lord; but the Spirit moveth me to Pray and to leave off Preaching, wherefore let us Pray unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>So after the Holy Brother had done his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Mr. <hi>N. N.</hi> who was there, pull'd off his Peruick, and put on a Night-Cap, wherein he appeared so like a Holy Brother as they took him for one of their Sect, and he Preached this following Sermon.</p>
               <p>DEarly beloved Brethren, We are here met in a Congregation together, some to Teach, others to Learn; but neither the Teaching nor Learning can be any other way but Natural and according to Human Capacitie, for we cannot be Coelestial whilst we are Terrestrial, neither can
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100053:88"/>
we be Glorified whilst we are Mortal and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Death, nor yet can we arrive to the Purity of Saints or Angels, whilst we are subject to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Imperfections both in Body and Mind, but there are some Men that Believe they are, or at least may be so Pure in Spirit by Saving Grace, as to be Sanctified, and to be so much fill'd with the Holy Ghost as to have Spiritual Visions, and ordinarily to have Conversation with God, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to be a Common Companion to their Idle Imaginations. But this Opinion proceeds from an Extraordinary Self-Love, Self-Pride, and Self-Ambition, as to believe they are the only fit Companions for God himself, and that not any of God's Creatures are or were Worthy to be Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but They, much less to be made of Gods Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Counsel, as they believe they are, as to Know his Will and Pleasure, his Decrees and Destinies, which indeed are not to be Known, for the Creator is too Mighty for a Creature to Comprehend him, Wherefore let us Humbly Pray to What we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Conceive.</p>
               <p>But before he had quite Ended his Sermon, the Holy flock began to Bustle, and at last VVent quite out of the Room, so that he might have Pray'd by Himself, had not I and two or three Ladies more that were of my Company, Stayed, and when he had done his short Prayer, He told me and the other Ladyes, that he had Done that which the Great Counsel of State could not Do, for he had by one short Discourse Disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100053:89"/>
a Company of Sectaries without Noise or Disturbance, but at last we dispersed our selves to our own Houses, although Mr. <hi>N. N.</hi> would have given us a Ball after a Sermon, but I was so tyred with the One, as I was not fit for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for we were from Morning till Evening to hear them Preach; yet as Tyred and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as I am I could not choose but Repeat these two of their shortest Sermons which I heard, and so I subscribe my self,</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100053:89"/>
of Amorous Love, which Love is between Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or Desire and Fruition of Different Sexes of Men and Women; but I perceive that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance-Writers endeavour to make all their Romance-Readers believe that the Gods, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Fates, Destinies and Fortune do imploy or busie themselves only in the affairs of Amorous Lovers, which is a very low Imployment or Concern. Also I perceive that Romance-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are very Rheumatick, for if all the Tears Romances express Lovers to shed, were Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or United, it would cause a second Deluge of the World; it seems Amorous Love is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed more of Water than Fire, and more of Desire than Fruition.

               <p>I Was yesterday presented with a Book Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> wherein I find the Author of the Book Condemns those that set their Images before their Books, or that suffer their Friends to give their Opinions of their Books in Epistles, or that do write many, or some, or few Epistles before their Books, whereas him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self writes so Long an Epistle, in finding Fault with Others, and civilly Applauding Himself, in not having his Picture or his Friends Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as that Epistle or Preface is as Long, if not More, than many Short Epistles, and as Vain-glorious as Many Friends Praises. But I am so far from that Noble Persons Opinion or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, that I wish, whereas I have One Friend to Praise my Works, although Partially, I had a Thousand, or rather Ten thousand Millions, nay, that their number were Infinite, that the Issue of my Brain, Fame, and Name, might live to Eternity if it were possible; neither do I think or believe it a Sin to Wish it, by reason it proceeds from Pure Self-love, which is the Root or Foundation of the Love of God and all Moral Virtues, I do not mean Corrupted Self-love, but as I said, Pure Self-love, by which God and Nature did Make, and doth Order the

Customs, as also in Diets, Accoustrements, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, Discourse, and the like; all which I have seriously Consider'd, what should be the Cause that men being of One and the same Kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Mankind, should Differ so much in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages in the Course of their Life; But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any more Reason for it, than for several Diseases in several Ages, as for Example, a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, namely, the Sweating Disease, that was Predominant in <hi>England,</hi> and after in <hi>Germany,</hi> and many other Diseases which are Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in One Age and not in Another, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is produced from an Influence from the Planets.

               <p>I Have Read <hi>R</hi>s.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100053:95"/>
to Church-men, to Study, Interpret, Expound, Teach and Preach the Scripture, and its an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation for Lay-men to meddle in Church-mens Profession, unless it be granted that a Lay-man have more VVit, Reason, Learning and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than all the Church-men have. But truly, Madam, the Book is an Excellent Book in that Kind, Only give me leave to tell you, that to Defend Scripture is partly to express Faults in Scripture; and to Dispute upon the Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in Scripture is to Puzzle the Truth in Scripture.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100053:95"/>
to Interprete the Scripture, or to Conceive the Spiritual Inspections and Elevations of the Purity of Christian Religion, and all the several Opinions therein.

But Officers, Governours and Commanders are for the most part chosen by the means of Bribes, Faction or Favour, and not for Fitness, VVorth and Merit, which Causes so many Disorders, Complaints and Rebellions, for few Nations live long in Peace, and most part of the World, at

               <p>I Am sorry the Plague is much in the City you are in, as I hear, and fear your Stay will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger your Life, for the Plague is so Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Penetrating a Disease, as it is a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Contagion, and Dilates it self throughout a City, nay, many times, from City to City, all over a Kingdom, and enters into every Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar House, and doth Arrest almost every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Person with Death, at least, layes grievous Sores upon them; Indeed Great Plagues are Death's Harvest, where he Reaps down Lives like Ears of Corn; wherefore, Madam, let me perswade you to Remove, for certainly Life is so Pretious, as it ought not to be Ventured, where there is no Honour to be Gain'd in the Hazard, for Death seems Terrible, I am sure it doth to Me, there is nothing I Dread more than Death, I do not mean the Strokes of Death, nor the Pains, but the Oblivion in Death, I fear not Death's Dart so much as Death's Dungeon, for I could willingly part with my Present Life, to have it Redoubled in after Memory, and would willingly Die in my Self, so I might Live in my Friends; Such a Life have I with you, and you with me, our Persons being at a Distance, we live to each other no otherwise than if we were Dead, for Absence is a Present

Death, as Memory is a Future Life; and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends as Remember me, so many Lives I have, indeed so many Brains as Remember me, so many Lives I have, whether they be Friends or Foes, onely in my Friends Brains I am Better Entertained; And this is the Reason I Retire so much from the Sight of the World, for the Love of Life and Fear of Death: for since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made our Bodily Lives so short, that if we should Live the full Period, it were but like a Flash of Lightning, that Continues not, and for the most part leaves black Oblivion behind it; and since Nature Rules the Bodily Life, and we cannot live Alwayes, nor the Bounds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be Inlarged, I am industrious to Gain so much of Nature's Favour, as to enable me to do some Work, wherein I may leave my <hi>Idea,</hi> or Live in an <hi>Idea,</hi> or my <hi>Idea</hi> may Live in Many Brains, for then I shall Live as Nature Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst her Creatures, which onely Lives in her Works, and is not otherwise Known but by her Works, we cannot say, she lives Personally amongst her Works, but Spiritually within her Works; and naturally I am so Ambitious, as I am restless to Live, as Nature doth, in all Ages, and in every Brain, but though I cannot hope to do so, yet it shall be no Neglect in me; And as I desire to Live in every Age, and in every Brain, so I desire to Live in every Heart, especially in your Ladiships, wherein I believe I do alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wish I may live Long.

               <p>IN your last Letter you say, that the Lady <hi>G. P.</hi> carried a Letter she received from Mrs. <hi>O.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100053:99"/>
Friendly and Kind Expressions are to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before Courtly Complements, the First sounds like Real Truth, the Other may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to be Feigning, for all Complements Exceed the Truth; 'Tis true, the Style of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alters and changes as the Fashion of Clothes doth, but Fashions are not alwayes changed for more Commodious or Becoming, but for the sake of Variety, for an Old Fashion may be more Useful and Graceful than a Modern Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But I believe the Lady <hi>G. P.</hi> carried Mrs. <hi>O. B</hi> s. Letter about with her for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to visit Company, like as Gossips do Cakes and other Junkets to their Neighbours, the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets increasing the Company, and the Company the Junkets, so the Lady <hi>G. P.</hi> out of a Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Talk and Company, like as other Gossips out of a Luxury to Talking and Eating, carried the Letter, to shew her several Acquaintance Sport, to get other Acquaintance, and if she had not had that Letter, 'tis likely she would have found some other Pretence rather than have stayed at Home. Indeed, one may say, that in this Age there is a malignant Contagion of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siping, for not onely one Woman Infects an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but the Women Infect the Men, and then one Man Infects another, nay, it Spreads so much, as it takes hold even on Young Children, so strong and Infectious is this Malignity; but if any will Avoid it, they must every Morning A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Soles of their Feet with the Oyl of Slackness, and Bath every Limb in a Bath of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100053:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Rest, then they must put into their Ears some Drops of Quiet, to Strengthen the Brain against Vaporous Noise, and Stop their Ears with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wool of Deafness, to keep out the Wind of Idle Discourse, also they must Wash their Eyes with the Water of Obscurity, lest the glaring light of Vanity should Weaken them, and they must take some Electuary of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which is very Soverain to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Spirits, and they must drink Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Julips of Discretion, which are good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Fever of Company, and if they take some Jelly of Restraint, they will find it to be an Excellent Remedy against this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, onely they must take great care lest they be too Relax to Perswasion, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so Restringent as to be Obstinate from entring into a Concourse; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Dangerous in all Malignant Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, than Throngs or Crowds of People; and this is the best Preparative against the Plague of Gossiping.

               <p>YOu were pleased in your last Letter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to me the Reason of the Lady <hi>D. S</hi> s. and the Lady <hi>E. K</hi>s. Melancholy, which was for Want of Children; I can not Blame the Lady <hi>D. S.</hi> by reason her Husband is the Last of his Family unless he have Children, but the Lady <hi>E. K</hi>s. Husband being a Widdower when he Married her, and having Sons to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his Estate, and to Keep up his Family, I Know no Reason why she should be troubled for having no Children, for though it be the part of every Good Wife to desire Children to Keep alive the Memory of their Husbands Name and Family by Posterity, yet a Woman hath no such Reason to desire Children for her Own Sake, for first her Name is Lost as to her Particular, in her Marrying, for she quits her Own, and is Named as her Husband; also her Family, for neither Name nor Estate goes to her
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100053:101"/>
Family according to the Laws and Customes of this Countrey; Also she Hazards her Life by Bringing them into the World, and hath the greatest share of Trouble in Bringing them up; neither can VVomen assure themselves of Comfort or Happiness by them, when they are grown to be Men, for their Name only lives in Sons, who Continue the Line of Succession, whereas Daughters are but Branches which by Marriage are Broken off from the Root from whence they Sprang, &amp; Ingrafted into the Stock of an other Family, so that Daughters are to be accounted but as Moveable Goods or Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that wear out; and though sometimes they carry the Lands with them, for want of Heir-males, yet the Name is not Kept nor the Line Continued with them, for these are buried in the Grave of the Males, for the Line, Name and Life of a Family ends with the Male issue; But many times Married Women desire Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as Maids do Husbands, more for Honour than for Comfort or Happiness, thinking it a Disgrace to live Old Maids, and so likewise to be Barren, for in the Jews time it was some Disgrace to be Barren, so that for the most part Maids and Wives desire Husbands and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon any Condition, rather than to live Maids or Barren: But I am not of their minds, for I think a Bad Husband is far worse than No Husband, and to have Unnatural Children is more Unhappy than to have No Children, and where One Husband proves Good, as Loving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100053:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Prudent, a Thousand prove Bad, as Cross and Spendthrifts, and where One Child proves Good, as Dutifull and Wise, a Thousand prove Disobedient and Fools, as to do Actions both to the Dishonour and Ruine of their Familyes. Besides, I have observed, that Breeding VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, especially those that have been married some time, and have had No Children, are in their Behaviour like New-married VVives, whose Actions of Behaviour and Speech are so Formal and Constrain'd, and so Different from their Natural way, as it is Ridiculous; for New Married Wives will so Bridle their Behaviour with Constraint, or Hang down their Heads so Simply, not so much out of True modesty, as a Forced Shamefulness; and to their Husbands they are so Coyly Amorous, or so Amorously Fond and so Troublesome Kind, as it would make the Spectators Sick, like Fulsome Meat to the Stomach; and if New-married Men were Wise men, it might make them Ill Husbands, at least to Dislike a Married Life, because they cannot Leave their Fond or Amorous VVives so Readily or Easily as a Mistress; but in Truth that Humour doth not last Long, for after a month or two they are like Surfeited Bodyes, that like any Meat Better than what they were so Fond of, so that in time they think their Husbands Worse Company than any other men.

oftentimes the Sickness is only in their Faces, not but that some are Really Sick, but not every Breeding Women; Likewise they have such Feigned Coughs, and fetch their Breath Short, with such Feigning Laziness, and so many Unnecessary Complaints, as it would VVeary the most Patient Husband to hear or see them: besides, they are so Expensive in their Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Perpetual Eating of several Costly Meats, as it would Undo a man that hath but an Indifferent Estate; but to add to their Charge, if they have not what they Please for Child-bed Linnen, Mantels, and a Lying-in Bed, with Suitable Furniture for their Lying-Chamber, they will be so Fretfull and Discontented, as it will indanger their Miscarrying; Again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double the Charge, there must be Gossiping, not only with Costly Banquets at the Christening and Churching, but they have Gossiping all the time of their Lying-in, for then there is a more set or formal Gossiping than at other ordinary times.

               <p>IN your last Letter you were pleased to let me know, how Bravely the Lady <hi>F. O.</hi> lives, both for Rich Clothing, Costly Houshold-furniture, and Great Equipage; truly, for those that have a sufficient Estate to Maintain it, and a Noble Title to Countenance it, 'tis very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and Honourable to live in Grandeur, otherwise it is Prodigal, Vain, Base, and Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish: Prodigal, to live Beyond their Means or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100053:103"/>
Wealth; Vain, to make a Fluttering shew with the Wast of their Estate; Base, to Usurp the Grandeur of Noble and Princely Titles; and Foolish, to make Enemies through Envy to their Vanity, to Triumph on them in their Poverty, which Poverty must of Necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Unnecessary Wast, if they have not a Staple-stock, so that they of Necessity must Break and become Bankrupts, in which Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they will be Despised, and so much the more as they were Envyed for their Vain Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and Hated for their Base Usurped Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, the more they are Scorned in their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Laugh'd at in their Misery. Indeed, it is a Ridiculous Sight to see any live Above their Wealth or Dignity; 'tis like mercenary Stage-players, that Act the parts of Princes, but none of the Spectators give them the Respect and Honour due to Great Princes, knowing they are but Poor Players and Mean Persons; but true Noble Persons indeed, as they will not Quit any thing that belongs to their Dignities, so they will not Usurp any thing that belongs not to their Titles, and when such Persons chance to fall into Misery, yet they fall not into Scorn, but Pity and Compassion will wait upon them, or meet them with Respect; but in all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Degrees, and Dignities, it is better to Live Wisely than Bravely, and to Live Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, to Spend Moderately, to Live Plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Easily, Peaceably, Pleasantly, and so Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily; to Spend Moderately, is, to keep within
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100053:104"/>
the Bounds of their Estate, not to go beyond the Limits of their Comings in; to Live Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, is, to spend nothing Vainly, nor to spare nothing Useful, or Proper for their Quality; to Live Peaceably, is, to live Privately, free from troublesome Company, as Idle Visitors, and Trencher-Guests, who Censure every Word or Act to the VVorst Intent and Sense, and Slander every one that is Better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; to Live Easily, is, to have their Family in Order and Obedience, and all their Affairs to be done Methodically; to Live Pleasantly, is, to have such Delights as the Estate will Afford them, and such Pastimes as are Agreeable to their Humours, and the Company of Sociable and Conversable Friends; also to Banish all Perturbed Passions, and Extravagant Appetites, all which is to Live Wisely, as your Ladiship doth; But whether the Lady <hi>F.

               <p>I Wonder that Sir <hi>F. E.</hi> should turn his Back to his Enemy, as you say you heard he did, when heretofore he Out-faced his Enemies; wherefore, surely he either thought those Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he Turn'd from, their Cause to be Juster, or he had some Burden upon his Conscience that was Unrepented of, and knowing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he was not fit to Die at that present, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Preserve his Life by a Flight; or else he thought he might do some Greater Service if he Preserv'd his Life, whereas in that Fight he should Die Unprofitably; or else it was a Panick Fear, that may seize sometimes on Men of Great Courage, although True, Sober, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Men are Seldom, if Ever, Seized with that Fear, by reason they never Venture their Lives but for Honour, and Honour forbids a Masker'd Flight, though not a Noble Retreat, for it is as Commendable to make a Wise and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Retreat, as to Fight a Just Quarrel. But I have observed, that as some are Wise, Honest, and Valiant, or rather Couragious by Fits, so some are Couragious and Cowardly in several Causes or Cases; as for Example, Some have Courage to venture Hanging for Robbing or Stealing, yet are afraid of a Cudgel, to Fight
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100053:105"/>
although but at Cuffs; others have Courage to Betray a Friend, but dare not Assist or Conceal a Persecuted Friend, others have Courage to Commit Treason, yet dare not Fight an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and many the like; also some are very Couragious in a Passion, and mere Cowards when their Passion is over; also Fear makes some Stout and Couragious, and others Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and so doth Drink, and the like; also Covetousness of Wealth makes more Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious than any Thing or Cause else, for an Army of Souldiers, if they know they shall be Inriched by the Victory, will Fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Fear, nay, so as to Die Every man; but Propose to them Honour, or their Countries Safety, or their Kings Right, and they for the most part will Run away, unless they be sure to be Hang'd for it, and then perchance they may Fight for Life, rather than Run away to be sure to Die, for by Staying there is some Hopes, whereas by Running away there is none; but if they fear not to be Catch'd, they Fly. But the Commanders that Fight more for Honour than Spoil, most commonly Stick to the Fight, fearing a Disgrace more than Death, and loving Fame more than Life. But the truth is, that generally there are more Cowards than Valiant Men, and more that have Courage to be Knaves, than to be Honest Men, for it requires both VVisdom and Valour to be Truly Honest, and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Just, but few have that Noble and Prudent
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100053:105"/>
Breeding, as to Know what is Truly Just, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and Valiant, insomuch as many Commit Errours and Crimes, and so are Disgraced, merely through Ignorance, whereas did they Know and rightly Understand the Grounds or Principles of Honesty and Honour, they would not hazard Infamy; But there are more that have not Breeding according to their Natures, than Natures according to their Breeding, for alas, the World wants Good Instructors, which is the cause of the Follies, Errours, Faults, and Crimes in Men and their Actions. But leaving the Generality, I am sorry for the Disgrace of Sir <hi>F. E.</hi> although it may be hoped, he may Recover himself out of this Reproach, by some Eminent, Honourable, and Valiant Action, which will be a Grave to Bury this Disgrace, for there are wayes and means for men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a Lost Honour, but none for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for if once they Lose their Honour, it is Lost for Ever without Redemption, wherefore every one is to regard their own Actions.

               <p>THe Lady <hi>G. R.</hi> and the Lady <hi>A. N.</hi> in a Visiting meeting, fell into a Discourse of Great Princes and Noble Persons, where the Lady <hi>G.

R.</hi> said, that True Grandeur did ride in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph upon Misfortunes back, for though Ill Fortune might Degrade Noble Persons of Wealth, and Poverty Degrade them of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, yet the Right Grandeur of True No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons would appear through Raggs, and their Low Condition like as the Sun, which though it could not shine Cleer and Bright through Thick, Black Clouds, yet it made Day in that Hemisphere it moved in, for a Dark Day is not Night; so, although Ill Fortune may Darken the Grandeur of Noble Persons, yet it cannot Benight it; and as for Age, said she, it is so far from Lessening Grandeur as it gives it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100053:106"/>
Addition, for true Noble and Heroick Persons, their very Shadows do appear with a Majestical Grandeur, and their Fame sounds with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Renown, both to beget Respect, Reverence and Honour in the Eyes, Ears and Minds of all persons, in despite of Fortune or Time, for Grandeur, said she, lives both in the Ashes and Fame of Noble, Worthy, and Gallant Persons.

               <p>I Hear there are many Noble Lords with their Ladies gone into <hi>F.</hi> which shews that in this Age there are many Kind Husbands, for usually when Husbands Travel, they leave their Wives behind, at least, think them to be a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on their Journies, and counting their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be more, than the Pleasure of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyes, they are left at Home. But I believe, this Mode-Travelling is only in this, and not in other Nations, for our Countrey-men make Kinder Husbands than men of other Nations. But since our Wars some are Necessitated and Forc'd to Travel into Forein Countreys, being Banish'd out of their Native Countrey, and the Wives of Banished men are forced to Travel to and from their Husbands, to seek for Means and Subsistence, to Maintain or Relieve their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated lives, wanting Meat to feed on, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100053:107"/>
Cloaths to cover them; Yet be there not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this Banished Condition for Number as for Worth, for they are most persons of great Qualities or Dignities, and had great Estates, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly in great Splendor and Plenty, and now in low Despised Poverty and cold Charity, which makes their Conditions or Fortunes so much the more Sad and Lamentable, onely their Souls and Spirits are not according to their Fortunes, for their noble Souls and Heroick Spirits yield not to Fortunes Slavery, but they as Conquerors ride Triumphing on proud For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun's back, spurring her sides with Scorn, for though Fortune may Starve or Inslave their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, yet she cannot Conquer their Minds. But in this Age there are more Women that Travel for Fashions sake, than out of VVant, more that Travel for Breeding than for Bread, for Company than for Necessity, they spend more in Unnecessary Travels to see strange Nations and Men, than others can get, that Travel to their own Native Countrey and neer Relations, for these Travel not for Observation but Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, they make not their Journies Frolicks of Mirth, but Weeping Departures, their Minds Swim in Troubled Tears, and are Blown with Sighs in their Bodily Barks, whilst they are Swimming on the dangerous Sea in Barks or Ships of Wood blown by blustring Winds; they venture not life for Sport and Fashion, but for Love and Charity; Indeed whereas other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, either for Observation or Fashion, may

with their Fathers, Husbands or Sons Travel all the World over, those Women must for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity Travel as they can, having no Choice; And so leaving our Sex either at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in their own Native or Forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I rest,</p>

K.</hi> was never a True Friend to him, but only a Seeming, as a Professing not an Acting Friend, for though Love lives in the Heart, yet the part of True Friendship Dwells or is onely made Known by the Action; But I have observed, that there's more that are Unkind to their Friends, even their Natural Friends, than Revengefull to their Enemies, and though both are Bad, yet the not doing Good or Timely Service to a Friend, is Worse than to do Hurt to an Enemy; for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation may Constrain them to the One, at least it is but <hi>quid for quo,</hi> as to Revenge an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100053:108"/>
but nothing but a Treacherous Nature can make or Hinder them from doing a Service for a Friend, if they be able thereto; for it is Inhuman not to do a Timely Courtesie to a Stranger, nay, to an Enemy in Distress, for a Noble Person will not take Advantage of his Enemy, but rather Help him in Distress, although he takes Revenge when he is in an able Condition to Help himself. But not to Help a Friend in Distress, is a Nature worse than Devils, for sure one Devil will Assist ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be but for Acquaintance: But there are many sorts of Friends, if I may call them so, for some Friendships are Made in Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are for the most part Broken in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, either through Envy or Pride; and some Friendships are Made in Prosperity, and are Lost in Adversity, either by Scorn or Fear; some Friendships are Made by Mirth, which are for the most part Lost in Mourning, either for the Shunning of Melancholy or Sad Objects, or for the Love to Mirth, or for the Desire of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness; some Friendships are Made by Luxury, which are Broken in Sickness; some Friendships are Made in Dangers, as to help each other, which are Lost in Security, and some are Made in Security, which are Lost in Danger, for to avoid the Dangers of each other; some Friendships are Made in Amours, and are Lost by Satiety; some Friendships are Made by Faction and Combination, and are Broken by Separation, and many the like Friendships, which are Made and Broken; but True, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolving

Friendships are made by Faith, Love, Trust, Gratitude, Fortitude, and Honour, for they are alwayes Valiant for their Friends Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Industrious in their Friends Necessity, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for their Friends Security, Secret in their Friends Trust, Faithful in their Friends Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Dispatchful in their Friends Affairs, Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Friends Sutes, Speaking in their Friends Behalf, Fighting in their Friends Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, Dying in their Friends Causes, nay, ready to indure Torments for their Friends Ease, or Troubles for their Friends Peace, and there can be no Bar between True Friends, from Doing or Endeavouring Good for and to each others Good; Such a Friendship, Madam, is betwixt You and Me, and True Friends have an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Belief of each others Love and Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherefore it is but civil Ceremony to tell you, I am,</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100053:109"/>
no more at those Games, but at Chess; (though Fox and Geese were a better Game for him in my Opinion) for although he may Lose as great Sums at Chess, yet not so Quickly as at Dice, Cards, or Tennis, for the Game at Chess takes time to Consider before he parts from his mony, besides, it requires a Good Judgment, which Sir <hi>S. P.</hi> did not prove to have by his former Adventures, wherein he had such Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; Indeed, Wise men will Venture as little on Fortune as they can, by reason she never gives Assurance, and is too Inconstant to be Trusted without Bonds or Engagements of Friends or Lands, but I know none she hath, for she never keeps Friendship with any One, nor Dwells Constantly in any Place, so as she can neither be Sued, Arrested, nor Imprisoned; wherefore Prudent men will not Trust her, unless upon Necessity; But, certainly it is through a Covetous Humour, that causes men to Venture so much at Play; like as greedy Merchants, that will Venture their Whole Stock upon the Uncertain Winds, and Raging, Rough Seas, in hope of a Rich Return; and I fear Sir <hi>S. P.</hi> hath Lost his Stock in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, as many Merchants do, and so will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Bankrupt.

Sweating, and Weaken their Nerves by Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining them; neither can Tennis be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, for it is too Laborious for Pastime, which is onely a Recreation, and there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in Sweaty Labour, for it is laid as a Curse upon men, that they shall Live by the Sweat of their Brows, but those that Lose, shall Want, and become Poor by the Sweat of their Brows; wherefore Recreation which is Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Delight, Lives in Ease and Plenty; And thus it is through a Covetous Humour, that men Play at Cards and Dice, and not for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime nor Exercise, for as Tennis hath too Much Motion for Exercise, so Playing at Cards and Dice hath too Little, insomuch that when Gamesters rise from Play, their Limbs are Stiff, Numb, and Insensible, for want of Use, the truth is, they fall asleep through Laziness, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Imployment; Neither can I perceive it to be a Recreation, by reason Cards and Chess require more Study than Arithmetick, or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, or any other Science that sets the Brain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and there is as little Recreation in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Mind, as in the Labour of the Body, in the Labour of the Thoughts, as in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Limbs; besides, their Stakes are Attended and Watch'd with as many Fears as Hopes, and both are Troubles of the Mind, for Hopes are built on Doubts; and for the Increase of their Wealth, Gamesters are like Chimists, that Seek the Philosophers Stone, in which Search they all become Bankrupts, Losing more
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100053:110"/>
Gold than they Get, in so much that when they Dye, they leave no Wealth behind them, only their Folly, which they leave at their Death, for Death will not be troubled therewith; But of Worldly Riches they are as Poor as <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> yet whether they shall Lye in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, I Know not. And as Gamesters are like <hi>Lazarus</hi> for the matter of Poverty, so Drunkards are like <hi>Dives</hi> for the matter of Drought, they are alwayes Dry, for much Strong Liquor causes Heat, and Heat causes Drought, so as they Drink themselves Dry, and many times in a Fevorish Distemper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Drop of Water to Cool their Parched Tongues, having Scalding Heat within them, so that their Wine, or Feavour which Wine causes, proves to their Bodies as Hell-fire, and a furious Madness in their Minds; only there is this Difference, that in Hell-fire, its said, the Body never Decayes or Dies, but in the Fire of Wine the Body doth Wast by degrees, or is suddenly Burnt up in Feavours, and so Dies; Also Drunkards have the Fate of Gamesters and Chymists, which is to be Poor, for as Chymists are Impoverish'd by a VVasting Fire, so Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards are Impoverish'd by Inflaming Wine; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Drunkards are Guilty of Covetousness, not so much of Wealth as of Drink, but they are as Insatiable for Drink as the others for Gold; and Whoremasters may come amongst them for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness and Poverty, for should they neither Covet Gold nor Drink, yet they Covet other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100053:111"/>
Men's Wives, Daughters, Sisters, Aunts, Neeces and Maid-Servants, and Impoverish their Estates, either by presenting the Coy with Gifts, as Bribes to Tempt them, or Maintain them for their Use; also they are as Short-lived as Drunkards, or as Diseased, &amp; as full of Aches, Pains and Weakness. Thus some Toss away their Estates &amp; Lives with a Ball, others Throw away their Estates and Lives with a Dice, some Shuffle away their Estates and Lives with a pack of Cards, others Spue out their Estates and Lives with Wine, others Kiss away their Estates and Lives with Mistresses, and so with the Pot and the Rot, the Ball, the Card and the Dice, men Busie the whole Time of their Life, or rather Waste the whole Time of their Life, together with their Life; And not in any one of these Actions is Honour, nor, as I can perceive, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; for their can be no Pleasure in Fear of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, nor in Sick-spuing, nor in Painfull Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor is there any Honour in these Actions, for it is not Honourable to beat a Ball, but to beat an Enemy, nor to deal out Cards, but to lead out Souldiers, neither is it Honourable to be Dead-drunk in a Tavern, but to be Wounded in the Field of War, for a Drunken Quarrel is not an Honourable Fight, the Fury in a Tavern is not the Valour in a Field; to be Inclosed in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses soft Armes is not to lye on the hard Ground open to all the Injuries of the Elements; neither shall men get an Eternal Fame, for Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gaming and Whoring, but they sooner

and Bringing them up; another said, that her Husband had so many Faults, as it was an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less work to Relate them, for his Faults did Surpass all Account; at last, when they had Railed a Long time, I, to Express the Nature of our Sex, (which is, that we cannot Refrain our Tongues from Speaking, although it be on such Themes as we Understand not, or of such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or Causes as we have nothing to do with, and which do not Concern us) did most Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly Speak to the Ladies, saying, I wonder'd to hear them Rail at their Husbands, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Dispraise them, for if they had Faults, it was the Wives Duty to Wink at them, at least not to Divulge them, and if their Husbands would Speak of them, and Tell their Faults, it was likely they would Equal their Husbands Faults, if not Surpass them; but the Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Heated with VVine, and then at my VVords, with Anger fell into such a Fury with me, as they fell upon me, not with Blows, but with VVords, and their Tongues as their Swords, did endeavour to VVound me; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I perceiving my own Folly of Unnecessary Speaking, and being Sorry for the Indiscretion, became as Silent as if I had been Dead, onely I did Move to shew I was Alive, for I took a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Leave, as with a Curtsie, and came away; and it hath so Frighted me, as I shall not hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to a Gossiping-meeting again, like as those that become Cowards at the Roaring Noise of Cannons, so I, at the Scolding Voices of VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;

This were to make his Crimes her Tormentors, which would neither let the Mind, Thoughts, or Body, live in Rest or Peace; and why should a VVife Grieve for her Husbands Inconstancy, since she receives no Dishonour from it? nay, if it be for the Loss of her Husbands Affection, she is but a Simple VVoman that will Trouble her self for him that Loves her not, or for him that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers another VVoman in his Affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>IN your last Letter you were pleased to tell me, that you shew'd the Admirable VVorks
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100053:118"/>
of <hi>A. B.</hi> to <hi>L. C.</hi> and he did not Admire them, which was a sign he did not Understand them; Certainly, so little Understanding is in the World, that if the World of Mankind were Divided into Four Parts, Three Parts and a Half of the Four are Ignorant Dolts, which is the Reason that Rare Qualities, Learned Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Curious Arts, and Divine Fancies are no more Esteemed or Admired; for if Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were General, Men would Run, Seek, and Sue, to see any One Person that had the Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to Invent Arts, or Find out New Sciences, or that had the Gift of Poetry, or the Deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Philosophy; but for the most, these enter not into their Capacity, and being not to their Capacity, it cannot be to their Pleasure or Delight, and so not to their Esteem; as for Proof, let the most Rare Poems, or some Deep Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy be Read to Several men, and tell them of some New Science, or shew them some Curious or Profitable Arts, and you shall find they will Express they are VVeary of them, by their Yawning, Humming, Hauking, and Spitting, or sit as if they were Statues, without Life or Sense, as not being Sensible of them; but read to them something that they Understand, by their Brutish Nature, as Ribbaldry, a VVan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Song or Scene, or the like, although there be neither Wit nor Sense in it, and you shall hear them Loud with Laughter or Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Swear all the Oaths they never heard Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Cry up the Author for a mighty VVit;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100053:118"/>
or shew them any Vain or Useless Art, and they will Admire it, if it be but a Glass-ring, and will Wonder how it came to be Invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Admire the Inventor for a Person of an Ingenious Brain; but if it be an Art that is Rare or Profitable, they will Slight it, and cast their heads Aside, not out of Envy, but Ignorance; wherefore, Madam, those that are well Qualified and VVitty, are Admired but by by a Few, which is by the VVise and Knowing, and those Few are Worth all the rest; for the VVise and Knowing, indeed, are all the VVorld of Mankind, the rest are but Mongrels, as Sensual Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> half Men, and half Beasts, or Dull, Ignorant Persons, as half Men, and half Stones or Blocks, nay, for the most part they are Three parts Beasts or Stones, and One part Men. Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all Nature's Works True Men are the Scarcest, being the Rarest, as the most Excellent Works in Nature. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the most Excellent Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not Admired by the General Bulk, so as it is no wonder that <hi>L. C.</hi> did not Esteem and Praise the VVorks of <hi>A.

Becoming, Easie and Commodious, than follow a New, Vain and Mis-becoming Fashion, so 'tis more Seemly, Gracefull and Becoming, for a Wife to have her Husband alwayes with her, to be a Witness of her Honest Actions, than to give a Suspicion both to her Husband and the World, as if she desired to be Absent from him and out of his Sight, that she might take more Liberty to be Wanton; for none can Imagine, a Wife will Abuse her Husband before his Face, as in his Sight, unless her Husband were Mad, or Drunk, or an Idiot, as a Natural Fool, and she not only a Whore, but an Impudent Whore; and for his Wealth being Greater than his Birth, it shews, her Parents and Friends were Wise to Marry her to Plenty, for with Poverty lives for the most part Discontent, and it shews, she was Dutifull and Obedient to Accept of her Parents Choice rather than her Own; and shews her self to be Wise, preferring Honesty before Vanity, a Plain-Behaviored man before a Fantastical Fl<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>TH' other Day the Lord <hi>N. N.</hi> arguing with others that were in Company, said, he was of an Opinion that all the Stars were Suns, and that Every one of those Suns had such Planets above and below them, like as the Sun hath that gives this Earth light; others said, that then those Planets would be Seen, he Answered, they could not be Seen, for those Suns we call Fixt Stars were at such a Distance as they appear but like Stars, and their Planets having but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Lights from those Suns could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by reason Reflected Lights are Faint and Dim in Comparison of Inherent Lights; also he was of an Opinion, that there were Many Worlds, and that those Worlds were Unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Unchangeable, and therefore Eternal; Also he said, the several Kinds and Sorts of Creatures in those Worlds, as Animals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, Minerals, and Elements were Eternal; but the Particulars of every Kind or Sort were Transmigrable or Transformable; whereupon others in the Company said, it could not be that those VVorlds were Eternal, for if they were, then they had no Beginning, and that could not be, by reason the VVorld seem'd to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, Made and Ordered by some Infinite Wisdome, causing such Method and Measures,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100053:121"/>
Proportions, Distinctions, Order, Exactness, Rule, Degrees and Decrees, all which could not be without Design, and by Chance; <hi>N. N.</hi> said, that if the World was Eternal, it was not made by Chance, for Chance proceeded from some Alteration, or Change of some Motions, and not from Eternity, for Eternity was not Subject to Chance, although Chance might be Subject to Eternity, and to prove the World and Worlds were Eternal, he said, the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Frame, Parts, Motions, and Form, were not Subject to Change, for they Continue One and the Same without any Alteration. Thus, Madam, the Sages Discoursed, but they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I was very Attentive to their Discourse, they ask'd my Opinion, I answered, they had left no Room for another Opinion, for the World was Eternal or not Eternal, and they had given their Opinions of either side; then they desired me to be a Judg between their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I said, such an Ignorant Woman as I will be a very unfit Judge, and though you be both Learned, and VVitty Men, yet you cannot Resolve the Question, it being impossible for a Small Part to Understand or Conceive the VVhole, and since neither you, nor all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, were they joyn'd into one Soul, Body, or Brain, can possibly know whether the World had a Beginning or No Beginning, or if it had, VVhen it was Made, nor of What it was Made, nor for VVhat it was Made, nor what Power Made it, nor what the Power is that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100053:121"/>
Made it, nor whether it shall Last or Dissolve; wherefore said I, the best is to leave this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and Discourse of some other Subject that is more Sociable, as being more Conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Then they Laugh'd, and said they would Discourse of VVomen, I said, I did believe they would find that VVomen were as Difficult to be Known and Understood as the Universe, but yet I thought they would find them more Sociable, at which Expression they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves very merry; but being my near Relative Friends, I took their Mirth in good part, as I hope you will do this Long Letter, Knowing the Length of my Letter is to Express my Obedience to your Commands, in which I shall prove my self,</p>

and Solitary Contemplations, which produce Poems, Songs, Playes, Masks, Elegies, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, Anagrams, and the like, they will be more lasting than Castles of Wood, Brick, or Stone, and their Architecture, if well Designed and Built, will be more Famous, and their Fame spread farther than those of Stone, <hi>viz.</hi> to the View and Prospect of divers Nations, if Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into divers Languages, whereas Castles of Timber, Brick, or Stone, cannot be Removed nor Translated, if Built upon the Ground; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Minds Architecture and Castles sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Ruin, as Castles of Stone, which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Time, Accidents, and the Rage of VVars, by which they are Destroyed, or Moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Dust, and are Buried in Oblivion, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Poetical Castles are set in Fames Palace; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Building of Poetical Castles Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish and Ruin the Builder's Families, as Corporeal Castles of Timber, Brick, or Stone, for the most part do, VVasting their VVorldly VVealth so much, as they leave nothing for their Posterity, but leave them to Poverty, which Poverty forces them many times to Act Dishonourably, so that what Fame they get by building Brave and Sumptuous Castles, Houses, Tombes, and the like, they lose by their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Base, Sharking, Cheating, Robbing, and VVicked Actions; and so instead of Fame get Infamy; at best, those Builders are accounted but Vain and Prodigal, whenas the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Mind, which she names Castles in

by Force, but oftener by an Insinuating Perswasion, and Pleasing Temptation, like as the Lord <hi>G.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100053:126"/>
Poems, and Comedies, and Tragedies, in Verse, and Tunes set to them, and Sung, both in their Theatres of War and Peace, as in the Fields and Stages, the One rais'd up their Spirits to Action, the Other caused more Attention. But, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance you will say, that Oratory is Elegant Prose, and not Elegant Verse. Certainly, there is as much Oratory in Elegant Verse, as in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Prose, for as Oratory, which perchance some think onely Eloquent Prose, moves Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and makes all the Auditory to be of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours Opinion; so do Eloquent Verses: for who moves Passions, as Love, Hate, Anger, Grief, Pity, Piety, and the like, more than Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets? or who can Perswade more Powerfully than Poets? for so great a Power have Poets in their Poetry, as to make the Minds of Men to believe Feignings for Realities, and can there be better Orations, Arguments, and Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than in <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> and many other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets VVorks? But Oratory in Prose and Verse, is both to Move the Mind, and to Stir up the Spirits, as also to Quiet the Mind, and to Allay the Spirits, onely this Advantage Poets have over Oratours, that there is no Good, or Excellent Poet, but he Naturally is an Oratour, whereas there have been, and may be, very Good Oratours, which are no Good Poets; yet howsoever, both Eloquent Prose and Verse are Harmonious and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to the Ears and Mind.

               <p>I Do not VVonder, that some Persons which seem so Kind, as to be, as it were, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their Lives for the Sake of some others, they never Saw, nor Knew, before their Kind Meeting, yet the Next time of Meeting, strive to Affront those to whom they Made or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd such Services, Love, and Adventures, and if they should not endeavour to Affront them, yet will Look upon them, or Pass by them, as if they had never Seen, or Spoken to them; Neither do I wonder, that Others in Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power, will Advance Some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, when they have but a New Acquaintance, or rather, a Sight of them, to Place and Office, and before they are Setled in their Offices, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place them again, without any Reason, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either of Advancing or Displacing.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100053:128"/>
with my self, whether it be better to live a Long and Idle, than a Short, but Profitable Life, that is, to Imploy a Little time Well, or to Wast a Great Deal of Time to no Purpose; and I Conclude, that a Little Good is better than Nothing, or better than a Sum of Evil; for 'tis better through Industry to Leave a Little to After Age, than Die so Poor as to Leave Nothing, no not so much as After Ages may say, there Liv'd such a one in Former Ages, than to Die, and be quite Forgotten; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should I live out the Course of Nature, or could live so Long as <hi>Methusalem,</hi> when the Time were Past, it would seem as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and perchance I should be as Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Die then, as if I Died in my Youth, so that a Long, and a Short time of Life, is as one and the same; 'Tis true, Death is Terrible to Think of, but in Death no Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Remains; so as it is Life that is Painful both to the Body and Mind, and not Death, for the Mind in Life is Fearful, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is seldom at Ease. But howsoever, I will endeavour, Madam, so to Divide the time of my Bodily Life, as to Imploy part of my Time for Health, and part for Fame, and all for Gods Favour, and when I Die, I will Bequeath my Soul to Heaven, my Fame to Time, and my Body to Earth, there to be Dissolved and Transformed as Nature Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for to her it belongs.

where I shall be Buried, when Dead, or into what part of the Earth I shall be Thrown; but if I could have my Wish, I Would my Dust might be Inurned, and mix'd with the Dust of those I Love Best, although I think they would not Remain Long together, for I did observe, that in this last War the Urns of the Dead were Digged up, their Dust Dispersed, and their Bones Thrown about, and I suppose that in all Civil or Home-wars such Inhuman Acts are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; wherefore it is but a Folly to be Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and Concerned, where they shall be Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or for their Graves, or to Bestow much Cost on their Tombes, since not only Time, but VVars will Ruin them.

VVars, and that they, who before this time were able to Relieve many with their Wealth, now do Want Relief themselves; by which we may know, that neither Riches nor Peace is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and many are not only Ruin'd in their Estates, and Banished their Native Country, but Forsaken of their Friends, which is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Misery; but Misery and Friends seldom keep together, and it is to be observed, that a Civil VVar doth not only Abolish Laws, Dissolve Government, and Destroy the Plenty of a Kingdom, but it doth Unknit the Knot of Friendship, and Dissolve Natural Affections, for in Civil VVar, Brothers against Brothers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against Sons, and Sons against Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Enemies, and Spill each others Blood, Triumphing on their Graves; for when a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Inflamed with Civil War, the Minds of all the People are in a Fever of Fury, or a Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fever of Cruelty, which, by nothing but Letting Blood by the Surgeon of VVar, can be Cured, and that not a Little, but Most must Bleed, ere there will be a Perfect Cure; It is the Plague of the Mind, as well as the Plague of the Body, for the Minds of Men are Infected with Covetous Desires, Ambitious Designs, Treacherous Plots, and Murderous Intentions, and so General it is, that Few Minds escape the Infection, which shews, it proceeds from the Malignity of the Air, or the Influence of some Raging Planet, and if so, it proceeds from a Natural Cause, although it be an Unnatural

War; or else it proceeds from Unwise Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where many Errours gather into a Mass, or Tumor of Evil, which Rises into Blisters of Discontents, and then Breaks out into Civil War; or else Heaven sends it to Punish the Sins of the People. Besides, it is to be observed, that Vices Increase in a Civil War, by reason Civil Government is in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, Civil Magistrates Corrupted, Civil Laws Abolished, Civil Manners, and Decent Customs Banished, and in their Places is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, Robbing, Stabbing, Treachery, and Falshood, all the Evil Passions and Debauch'd Appetites are let Loose, to take their Liberty; But this is so commonly Known to those that have seen a Civil War, as I should not have needed to Mention it, although those that have Liv'd alwayes in Peace will not Believe it, but I have Suffered so much in it, as the Loss of some of my Nearest, and Dearest Friends, and the Ruin of those that did Remain, that I may desire to Forget it.

to the Life, a Mean Country Wench, as a Great Lady, a Courtesan, as a Chast VVoman, a Mad man, as a Man in his right Reason and Senses, a Drunkard, as a Sober man, a Knave, as an Honest man, and so a Clown, as a VVell-bred man, and a Fool, as a VVise man; nay, it Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses and Declares a Greater Wit, to Express, and Deliver to Posterity, the Extravagancies of Madness, the Subtilty of Knaves, the Ignorance of Clowns, and the Simplicity of Naturals, or the Craft of Feigned Fools, than to Express Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, Plain Honesty, Courtly Garbs, or Sensible Discourses, for 'tis harder to Express Nonsense than Sense, and Ordinary Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than that which is Unusual; and 'tis Harder, and Requires more Wit to Express a Jester, than a Grave Statesman; yet <hi>Shakespear</hi> did not want Wit, to Express to the Life all Sorts of Persons, of what Quality, Profession, Degree, Breeding, or Birth soever; nor did he want VVit to Express the Divers, and Different Humours, or Natures, or Several Passions in Mankind; and so VVell he hath Express'd in his Playes all Sorts of Persons, as one would think he had been Transformed into every one of those Persons he hath Described; and as sometimes one would think he was Really him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Clown or Jester he Feigns, so one would think, he was also the King, and Privy Counsellor; also as one would think he were Really the Coward he Feigns, so one would think he were the most Valiant, and Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

Who would not Swear he had been a Noble Lover, that could Woo so well? and there is not any person he hath Described in his Book, but his Readers might think they were VVell acquainted with them; indeed <hi>Shakespear</hi> had a Clear Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Quick VVit, a Spreading Fancy, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Observation, a Deep Apprehension, and a most Eloquent Elocution; truly, he was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Orator, as well as a Natural Poet, and he was not an Orator to Speak VVell only on

I should not have needed to VVrite this to you, for his VVorks would have Declared the same Truth: But I believe, those that Dispraised his Playes, Dispraised them more out of Envy, than Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity or Ignorance, for those that could Read his Playes, could not be so Foolish to Condemn them, only the Excellency of them caused an Envy to them.

Passage VVall'd up, and as for his Wife's Maids, he could not say any thing, for he never medled with them, but would tell his VVife; so the Hole of the Door being Closed, she was Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently well Satisfied with that, although not with her Husband, for he and she, it was said, Liv'd as Enemies, not as Friends in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; But she hearing other Reports, (for when her Humour was Known, her Neighbours took delight to Vex her, it being the Nature of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Add Discontent upon Discontent, and Affliction on Affliction, being never better Pleas'd than when Doing, or Speaking Ill, to some or others Disadvantage) after some Six Weeks, sent a Letter to my Husband, wherein, after some Complements, she made great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of her Husband, and Named which of my Maids she was Jealous of, saying, she had received Presents from her Husband, as Sweet-meats, and Linnen, and a great many words of I know not what, neither can I remember them, though I heard the Letter read, for being in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Language, I could not read it my self, but my Husband did read it to me; and when he had read it, Now, says he, what say you to this Letter? Truly, said I, I am of the Opinion, she would be Courted by some other than her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, since he leaves Courting of her, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses himself to others; next, I am of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, she would have all her Neighbours Wives, or at least some, and my self particularly, as Jealous as her self, otherwise she would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100053:134"/>
have VVritten to you, but to me, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Case concerning the VVomen in my House, and if I were of her Jealous Humour, I should Write to her Husband, how his VVife Writ a Letter to my Husband, Aggravating, (for Jealousie is alwayes Adding and Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) that you two held a Correspondence by Letters, and for any thing I knew, had Private Meetings, but being not Jealous, I Approve of her choice of VVriting to you, wherefore send for her she Accuses, and Examin her. Truly, not I, said my Husband, I am no Confessor, though I believe Confessors take great Pleasure in Young Maids Confessions, so my Husband caused me to Examin my Maid, whether she had received any Presents from <hi>C. K.</hi> she said, she never received any from him in her Life, nor had she any Acquaintance with him, but by Sight, as she had of most of the Town, seeing them in the Streets; but, said she, I believe these Sweet-meats, and Linnen she mentions in her Letter, is a Handkerchief with Sweet-meats, for the Weather being Hot, we usually have our Chamber Windows open, until we go to Bed, and my Chamber-fellow and I, as we were Undressing us one Night, there was flung into the Window a Lawn, Buttoned Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, tied up on two or three knots, with Sweet-meats in them; at the first we were Affrighted, to see a white Bulk come Flying, as we thought, into the Chamber, and Falling with a Noise upon the Ground; but at last we took it up, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100053:135"/>
found it was a Handkerchief full of Sweet-meats; at first, we Resolv'd to fling it back, but then we Consider'd, we had best Call out of the Window, and Ask who it was that flung them in, so we Call'd, but No body would An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and then we thought, that if we flung them out again, they would be taken up by some Stranger; and you were willing, said I, to Keep, and Eat them, you made so many Doubts? indeed, Madam, said she, we did Eat them soon after, but we knew not what to do with the Handkerchief, not knowing the Owner, yet we were Resolved to Ask of all our Acquaintance, if any would Own the Handkerchief; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Inquiry for the Owner, one of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance told us, a Fortnight after, it was <hi>C. K</hi>s. which when we Knew, we Durst not Send it to him, for Fear of his Wife, neither Durst we Give, or Fling it away, lest he should Desire it again, and this, upon the Salvation of my Soul, said she, is all the Linnen, or Sweet-meats we ever had of him; neither did we know they were his, until a Fortnight after. Now, if she should have been Judged by the Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Examination, she might have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a Criminal, whereas her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and other Witnesses, set her Free; but Jealousie and Suspicion, for the most part, are False Accusers, and Cruel Judges. By this we see how Unquiet and Restless some Married Persons are, being alwayes Tortured with their own Thoughts, and their Minds are
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100053:135"/>
Rack'd on the Wheels of Suspicion. But my Husband sent for the Divine that formerly came from her, and told him of her Letter, and of my Maids Confession, and that she had no Cause to be Jealous of her, for she was very Virtuous, neither had she any Acquaintance with her Husband. So the Divine went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and between, not to bring Unlawful Lovers together, for he was a very Worthy, and VVise man, but to Pacifie a Disquiet Mind, and to make Love and Unity between an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and his VVife. And so leaving them to Agree, I rest,</p>

Indeed, so Foolish are Most, especially Women, as when they see a Famous, Learned Man, or Witty Poet, or the like, they will streight say, Lord!

               <p>I May not Discommend the Old Historical, or Heroick Poets, for if I should, I should be Condemned for a Fool, as not having neither Judgment nor Understanding, yet I may say, my Reason believes they VVrit Unreasonably, not only of their Feigned Gods, but of their Feigned Fights, and of their Feigned Fortunes or Successes; The truth is, they are for the most part Romances, containing more Lies than Truth, more Impossibilities than Probabilities, for though Feigning is the Ground of Poetry, yet, methinks, such kind of Poetry should not have such kind of Feignings, for to Reason it can neither be Pleasant nor Profitable, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son takes Delight in Probabilities, not in Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities, for though the Ground or Subject of an Heroical Story, or Poem, may be Feigning, yet the several Actions should be Natural, not beyond the Power of Men, nor Unusual to their Practice; neither can it be Profitable, for what cannot be Practised, cannot be Imitated; the VVay of VVriting may be Imitated, but not the Actions; for what One man can Disorder, or Rout an Army, with his Single Strength or Courage? nay, what One man can Disorder, or Rout a Brigade, nay, a Company of an Hundred?
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100053:138"/>
The truth is, a Hundred to One is too great Odds to Encounter, and too Many for One man to Overcome; neither can I believe, a Hundred men should be so Afraid of One man, were he as Big, and as Strong as <hi>Goliah,</hi> so as to Run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, unless they did apprehend he had Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but yet when I remember the Story of <hi>Sampson,</hi> I Dare not say, it Cannot be, but I Dare say, it cannot be without a Miracle, wherefore most of the Heroick Poets make their chief He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes to have the Assistance of particular Gods and Goddesses, so as to Impower them above the Effects of Nature; but of all the Heroick Poems I have read, I like Sir <hi>W. D</hi>s. as being Most, and Nearest to the Natures, Humours, Actions, Practice, Designs, Effects, Faculties, and Natural Powers, and Abilities of Men or Human Life, containing no Impossibilities or Improbabilities: Indeed, such an Heroick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em it is, that there cannot be found any Fault therein, unless he seem'd to have too much Care or Pains taken in the Expression of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, for the Language is like so Curious and Finely Ingraven a Seal, as one cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily see the Figure Ingraven therein, without a Magnifying glass, or like as many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Figures, so Curiously Cut, as to be all in the Compass of a Cherry-stone, wherein they cannot be Distinguished, without often Perusal, and Strict Examination, and Quick and Ready Sight; But had the Language been as Easie, as Fine, and had not those
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100053:138"/>
Choice Expressions been so Closely Compact, but were as Usual, as his Descriptions are Natural, certainly it had been a President for all Heroick Poems; indeed, his Language or Expressions of his Descriptions are like Gold that is too Pure and Fine to be Wrought, and wants some Allay to make it Proper and Fit for Use; The Truth is, very Spruce Language, or Extraordinary Choice Phrases, take off the Pleasure of the Reader, being rather Tedious than Delightful, whereas Extraordinary, and Courtly Expressions, and Choice, and Nice Phrases, are to be Highly Commended, in comparison of Clownish, and Rude Expressions or Phrases, such as are in <hi>Homer,</hi> I know not whether they be so in the Original, surely in the Translation they are in many Places, where not onely the Men Speak Rude and Clownish, but he makes the Gods to Speak so too. Wherefore, for my part, I had rather read Sir <hi>W. D</hi>s. Work ten times, than <hi>Homer</hi> twice, as he is Translated. But I'le leave off Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Master-Poets as my Pupil-aged Wit cannot Understand, for should I live to <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>'s Age, my Wit would be but a Novice, my Judgment an Ignorant Fool, and my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Erroneous, for Women are neither fit to be Judges, Tutors, nor Disputers, neither are we fit to be Commanders, or Rulers, we are alwayes fitter to Learn than to Teach, and in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition rather to Obey than to Command, apter to Dispute than to Confute, to Prate

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100053:139"/>
or Dancing on a Carpet, might wear Feathers in their Hats, for the Head is not Imployed so much in those Actions as the Heels, only a Feather is a Fashion of no Use, but merely for Grace and Becoming. Many other Fashions I could Repeat for Use, and Action, but it were too Tedious. As for the Fashions for the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Year, In Winter, Sable Skins, or meaner Fur, to Wear about the Neck, and Muffs, are both Graceful and Useful, as to keep one from Cold; and for Summer, Fans, to Cool the Sultry Heat, and to Shadow the Face from the Sun, who seems to be an Enemy to Beauty, and strives to Burn it off, wherefore it may be thought Envious; Such, and many other seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fashions there are, according to the several Seasons of the Year. Besides, there are Fashions for Ease, which Religious persons Use, as only a Loose Garment, tied Loosly about their Wast, wherein is neither much Curiosity in Making, nor Labour in Dressing, nor Pain in Wearing, it is Quickly Put on, and as Quickly Pull'd off, a Garment fit for a Solitary, and Studious Life, wherein must be no Incumbrances on the Body, to Obstruct, or Hinder the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind; Also there be Fashions of Grandeur, which are more for Grace, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, than for Ease, or Use, as Gowns with Long Trains, Streight Bodies, Heavy Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries and Laces, Jewels in the Ears, and many the like, High Heel'd Shoes, Boot-hoses, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Roses, Hatbands, and many more, which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100053:140"/>
are Requisite for Grace &amp; Becoming. Again, there are Fashions to Distinguish Persons, as to know a Priest, a Lawyer, a Mayor and his Aldermen, a Constable, &amp; many other several Professions and Officers; and thus there should also be Degrees to Distinguish the Nobles from the Commons, but the Commons have Incroch'd so much upon the Nobles Prerogative of Fashions, as all Fashions are Common amongst them: also there are Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Times of Mirth, &amp; Fashions for Times of Mourning, for Publick Meetings &amp; Nuptials, as also for weeping Funerals; But Fashions of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur are fit only for Courts, at Masks, Plays, Balls, &amp; Triumphant Shews; Fashions of Cavalry are proper for the Field in time of War, as for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders or Generals; Fashions of Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fit for Cities, as for Magistrates, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Professions, Trades, &amp; the like; Fashions of Ease are fittest for Cloisters, and a Private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Life; and Fashions of Use are fit for all Sorts, Degrees, Professions or Qualities; But Fashions that are neither Useful, Easie, Proper, Becoming, nor Graceful, ought to be Banished, if any such there be. But, Madam, I shall Discourse so long of Fashions, as I shall Forget your Patience, and make you so Angry as to fling this Letter into the Fire, and so Burn all the Garmental Fashions in my Letter, where if all Fashions could be as Easily Consumed as my Letter, you would leave the world of Mankind Naked, unless they would Cloth themselves with Beasts Skins, or Fig-leaves, which would soon becom a Fashion too, if once worn: wherefore lest I should be stript of

'Tis true, Divine Poetical Raptures,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100053:141"/>
such as <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, are Commendable and Admirable, being an Effect of a Devout Soul, and Zealous Spirit, which Flames into Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Raptures, and is Inspired with a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, Delivering it self through Harmonious Numbers, Sympathetical Rithmes, Elegant Phrases, and Eloquent Language, all which is Presented to God from the Heart, as an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, or Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, or an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring of Mercy, or an Humble Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of sins, and Promise of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Sacred Poems are Express'd in a Tragick Vein concerning Sins, and in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Vein concerning Blessings, and Poets in their Morning Hymns are like the Larks that Begin the Day, and in their Evening Hymns like the Nightingals which Begin the Night. Thus Divine Poets are Heaven's Birds, that Sing to God, and their Divine Poems are their Brood, which are kept in the Cage of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and Sing their Parents Notes to After Ages. But, Madam, perchance you will think I am very Peremptory, to give my Opinion of the Poets VVork before I see it; but I give my Opinion only upon the Ground of his VVork, which is the Scripture, saying, it ought not to be Paraphrased, besides, I give it from my Conscience, not from my Conceited Brain, and perchance I may alter my Opinion, upon more Rational Arguments from those that are more Learned and Knowing than my self, and if your Opinion Differs from mine, pray

               <p>YOu desired me to send you the Sixteen Books I Writ in my Childhood, methinks
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100053:142"/>
they sound like the Twelve Labours of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> only that there are Four Labours more; but though mine were not so Profitable to the World, nor so Difficult to Atchieve, nor so Dangerous in their Encounters, yet you will find my Works like Infinite Nature, that hath neither Beginning nor End, and as Confused as the Chaos, wherein is neither Method nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but all Mix'd together without Separation, like Evening Light and Darkness, so in my Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Books is Sense and No Sense, Knowledg and Ignorance Mingled together, so that you will not know what to make of it; or in a Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Comparison, you will find every Book like a Frippery, or Brokers-shop, wherein is nothing but Remnants, Bits and Ends of Several things, or like Taylors Shreds, that are not fit for any Use; wherefore I cannot Imagine why you should Desire them, unless out of a Friendship, you will See, and Burn them before I Die, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I should Neglect the Sacrificing of them my self, for you are Pleased not only to send for One, but all the Sixteen. But, I suppose, you believe them to be so many several sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per folded into Quarters, or Half Quarters, as into little Baby-books, for it was in my Baby-years I Writ them, and it had been well they had been no Bigger than Baby-Books, but the least of these Books are two or the Quires of Paper; Neither can you Read them when you have them, unless you have the Art, or Gift to Read Unknown Letters, for the Letters are not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100053:143"/>
only Unlegible, but each Letter stands so Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly from th' other, as all the Lines of your Sight cannot Draw, or Bring them into Words, nay, they will sooner be Torn in pieces; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it will Weary your Eye-sight to Move from Letter to Letter, it will be almost as great a Journy for your Eyes, as it was for <hi>Coriat</hi>'s Feet, that Travelled a Foot to <hi>Mogorr,</hi> I know not whether his Journy Lamed them, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it Tired them: so will my Books do your Eyes, if they do not quite Blind them, I cannot say, in Reading them, but Endeavouring to Read Scribbles for Letters. Moreover, there are such huge Blots, as I may Similize them to Broad Seas, or Vast Mountains, which in a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milizing Line will Tire your Eyes to Spread to the Circumference, like as for the Feet to Walk to the Top of the <hi>Alps</hi>; Also there are Long, Hard Scratches, which will be as Bad for your Eyes, as Long, Stony Lanes would be to your Feet; wherefore let me perswade you as your Friend, not Desperately to Venture to Read them, since you can neither receive Profit nor Pleasure in the Labour; were there any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to Increase your Knowledge, or to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich your Understanding, you had some reason to Venture, but you will be so far from Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your Knowledge, as you will enter into a vast Wilderness, and Intricate Labyrinth, wherein you will Lose your Patience, and be so far from Inriching your Understanding, as you will Impoverish your present Memory;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100053:143"/>
and let me tell you, that my Sixteen Books will be as Tedious, Troublesome, and Dangerous, to your Understanding, as the Dry, Deep, Sandy, Barren Deserts of <hi>Arabia</hi> to Travellers, and so thick a Mist of Nonsense, and Clouds of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance will fly in the face of your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it will not only Blind it, but be apt to Smother it, not otherwise than the Clouds, or Hills of Sand, that Fly, and Blind, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Choak those that pass through those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.

Wherefore the Surest way for Women is not to Accompany any Man Singly, and Alone, but when there are more than they themselves, unless it be such Men as they have a near Relation to, as Husbands, Brothers, Fathers, Sons, Uncles, and the like; but VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are so far from Shunning Mens Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

as they go from place to place to Meet them, and will Invite them to Cards, Dancing, or other Meetings, and they seem Dull, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Indisposed, whenas they are not in the Company of Men, and for the most part, the Wilder the Men are, the better Pleased the Women are, at least they seem so. But, perchance Mrs. <hi>W.

               <p>YOu were pleased in your last Letter to tell me, that you had Heard of the Seven Wonders of the World, but you had onely Seen that which might be accounted the Eighth, which are those Books I sent you; But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, it is a greater VVonder to me, that you would take the Pains to Peruse them, than it was that I should VVrite, or Vvast so much Paper, for Girls are alwayes Busie to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, they will take delight to scratch a Coal upon a VVhite VVall, or Ink with a Pen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Paper, whenas they account it a Torment to be Taught a Fair Hand-writing, or the Art of Limning; and in my Opinion, there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument for Free VVill, than to Observe how Opposite Constraint and Inforcement is to the Nature of Mankind; But when I Consider, that Mankind for the most part Will what is VVorst, and most Hurtful for themselves, or their Kind, I then am apt to think Mankind are Predestinated so to do, otherwise it were strange that Mankind should VVilfully Hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they have that which is call'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which Informs them, that that which they VVill, is Hurtful for them, or to them.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100053:148"/>
bound to the Profession of a Scrivener, not to VVrite an Intelligible Hand, but to make VVast Paper, for they being paid for the most part by the Sheets, and not by the Letters, put as few Letters in a Sheet of Paper as subtilly they can, leaving a Large Space betwixt every Line, and they make their Letters as Big, and Broad as they may, as not to Mis-shape them, also with Large, and Long Flourishing Scratches; but my Paper Book is an Advantage to you, who pay nothing for the VVriting, but your Sight, although Sight, indeed, is more worth than <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Riches, for it is the most Curious, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and Pretious Jewel in Nature's Treasury; But, Madam, lest I should Doubly or Trebly Tire your Sight, as with my Books, and then with this Tedious Letter, I take my leave, and rest,</p>

such Poor, such be Kill'd in the Wars, and such Drown'd, or Killd with a Stone falling on their Heads; such be Burnt, such Hang'd, and such Escape those and the like Dangers; such Men and Women shall Love, and Marry, and such not, also how many Husbands such a Woman shall have, and such a one shall have None, and so for Men, Mistresses and Wives, for Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Disgraces, Honours and Dignities, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Authorities, and for all manner of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes or Accidents, I say, I believe the Planets are not the Causes of these Outward Effects; but as I believe the Stars and Planets have an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Bodies of men, as their Bodies have on the Planets and Elements, so they may have an Influence upon the Humours in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as upon Phlegm, Choler, Melancholy, Blood, and the like, and they may Work Effects either for Health, Sickness, Pains, and Sores, Rheums, and the like. But I am in Dispute with my self, whether they also have an Influence, or Work several Effects upon the Minds of Men, as upon their Bodies; and when I Consider the various Inconstancies of Mens Minds, and the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Changes which are in Mens Minds, I think they are Moved and Altered according to the Motions, and Influences, and Effects of each Planet, or Star. For if we do Observe, not only their Thoughts, Passions and Affections Vary and Alter Minutely, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly, but also their Capacities, Conceptions, Judgments,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100053:149"/>
Understandings, Opinions, and VVit; for most have Deeper Capacities, Higher Conceptions, Sounder Judgments, Clearer Understandings, Probabler Opinions, and Quicker Wits, at some, than at other times, as at some times they may be thought Wise men, and at other times mere Fools, sometimes they will speak very Wittily, at other times mere Nonsense, or at least, Words without Wit, sometimes they will be able to give as Wise Counsel as <hi>Nestor, Ulysses,</hi> or <hi>Achitophel,</hi> at other times, they are neither able to give, nor to take Counsel; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they Conceive, and Understand Readily and Clearly, whatsoever is Conceivable and Understandable by Mankind, at other times they are as if they had not Sense and Reason; The like for the Qualities, Passions, Affections, and Virtues of the Mind; as at some times they are very Valiant, at other times mere Cowards; sometimes Nobly Generous, other times Basely Covetous; sometimes Uprightly Just, other times Wrongfully Unjust; sometimes very Compassionate, other times very Cruel, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable; sometimes so Angry, as to be so Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious that none dare Speak to them, at other times so Patient, as to suffer any one to Pull them by the Nose; sometimes they Love to Death, and sometimes they Hate to Death, one and the same thing; and this is Usual, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral amongst Mankind, which makes me lean to the Opinion, that the Stars and the Planets have an Influence upon the Minds of Men; but
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100053:149"/>
I am absolutely of the Opinion, that they have no Influence or Power on the Educations of Mankind, no more than they have on the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes or Accidents of and to Mankind; for in those men that are Educated throughly Well, and Wisely, the Effects of Education are too Strong for the Effects of the Stars or Planets, so that some men may be Constantly Prudent, Just, Valiant, Generous, Understanding, Judicious, VVitty, and VVise. Also the Effects of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Effects of the Planets, may be Crossing, and Opposing each other, and then the Strongest Effects bear away the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, whether to Good or Ill; and this is the reason of Long Debates, Doubts, and Considerations, ere some men come to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions or Resolutions; and truly, I think the Senses have as great an Influence upon the Mind, as the Stars and Planets have, as Fair Objects, Melodious Sounds, Sweet Savours, and Delicious Touches, have as great an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Mind, and Cause as Various and Strong Effects, as the Stars and Planets do, or can.

the Body into a Hectick Fever, Burning the Intrals, and Noble Vital parts with a Smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat, which Dries those Parts, like as Neats-Tongues, Bacon, and Hung Beef is Dryed in Smothering Smoak; or it sets those Humours, Gather'd, and Heap'd up, on a Flame, like a Stack of Wet Hay, or a Chest full of Wet Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, wanting Vent to Breath out Vapor.

Body is Fat, and her Legs and Arms, Neck and Face, Lean, for those Parts that are next to the Mouth of the Veins, Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and grow rather too Big, as having more than Nature requires, for the Inward Parts are Doubly Fed, having the Food, not only that Belongs, or is Sufficient for them, but also that which Belongs to the Extreme Parts, as the Legs, Feet, Arms, Hands, Neck, and Face, so that a Stoppage of the Veins causes the Body to Swell, or Puff Outward, like as when ones Lips are Closed, and Ascending Vapor, or Forced Wind, Fills the Mouth, the Cheeks, and all the Face will Swell, and Puff out so much, as to be as Big as a Face and a Half; the same is with the Body, when the Mouths of the Sucking Veins are Stop'd; also it causes Vomitings, or Fluxes, for when the Veins are too Full of Wind, or Blood, or are Stop'd by Humour, or Dryness, the Body growing too full of Humour, Over-flows, and so Forces out a Passage, either at one, or both Ends of the Body, for the Veins being Over-full, can no more receive any Liquor into them, than when a Stomack is Over-fill'd with
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100053:154"/>
Meat or Drink, but are Forced to Cast out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Offer'd to them, so as the Veins become as an Over-charged Stomack, and when they are Stop'd, they are as if the Throat were Choak'd, or the Neck Strangled, and can receive Nothing, for not Any thing will Pass, which causes them to Cast back whatsoever is Offer'd to them, so that the Effect is as one, both of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-full, and Empty, Stop'd Veins, only Over-full Veins cause the Body to be Swell'd, and Puff'd, all over the Extreme Parts, as well as the Inward, or next Adjoyning Parts, whereas the Empty, Dry Veins, cause only the Inward, and Joyning Parts to the Mouths of the Veins to be Swell'd, or Puff'd out; but for Casting out from them, or Resisting, they are alike. Thus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I have Obeyed your Commands, in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to you my Opinion; and Begging your Pardon for being so Tedious in Explaning and Declaring it, I rest,</p>

               <p>YOu were pleased to tell me in your Letter, how much out of Countenance you were,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100053:154"/>
being Surprised with a Visit you Expected not; Truly, Madam, I am very Sensible of your Pain, insomuch as methinks I Feel what you Suffered, for I my self have been, and am still, so Troubled with that Imperfection, (if it may be call'd one) that I have been often so out of Countenance, as I have not only Pitied my self, but others have Pitied me, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I would not be in, and the Thoughts that Bashfulness leaves in the Mind, are as great an Affliction as the Mind can have for a Crimeless Defect, for 'tis no Crime to be Bashful, nor a Disgrace, neither to the Life, nor Soul, although it be a Disadvantage to the Person, for Bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Works divers Effects upon the Body, and in the Mind; As for the Mind, it Disturbs the Thoughts so much, as the Thoughts are all in a Confused Disorder, and not any one Thought moves Regularly, neither will they Suffer the Words to pass out of the Mouth, or if they do, they are Uttered without Sense, nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in no Language, being but Pieces of Words, or Pieces of the Letters of Words; and others, quite contrary, will speak so Much, and Fast, as none can Understand what they Say, or would Say, Indeed, so Fast, as they make nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stop, nor Distinction; Again, others will Speak so Shrill, and Loud, as it Deafens the Ears of the Hearers, and others so Soft and Low, as it cannot be Heard what they Say; and some when they are out of Countenance, will Laugh at every Word they Speak, or is Spoken
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100053:155"/>
to them, although the Subject be so Sad and Lamentable, as it is proper to be attended with Tears: And for the Body, when the Mind is Bashful, it hath Divers, and Several Misbecoming Motions, as in some their neather Lip will so Quiver, as it will Draw quite Awry, like as in a Convulsion, and in some, their Eyes will so Squint, as they can see nothing Perfectly, and some will Shake their Heads so much, as if they had the Shaking Palsie; and in some their Legs will so Tremble, as they can hardly bear up the Body from falling; and some, their whole Body will be as if they were in a Cold Fit of an Ague; and others, when they are out of Countenance, have such a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of Spirits, as they are forced often to Humm, to raise them up; and others, when they are out of Countenance, will look so Pale, as if they were Departing with Life, and on the Contrary, others will be so Red, having a Torrent of Blushes Flow to their Face, that they will appear as if they were Drunk, and that it were the Spirits of Wine which made that Firy and Flaming Colour, and many other Misbecoming Countenances, and several Misbecoming Garbs, Postures, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Senseless Words, which are not to be Express'd. But howsoever, a Bashful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Expresses a Sensible Mind, and a Modest Nature, and not a Guiltiness of Crimes, for those that are so Bold as to Commit a Crime, will not want Confidence to Out-face it.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100053:155"/>
VVherefore, Madam, let not your Bashful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour be a Disturbance to your Harmless Thoughts, and Virtuous Life, to which Thoughts and Life, I leave you, and rest,</p>

               <p>YOu did once, before your last Letter, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire me to give my Opinion concerning the Influence of the Stars, I did so, and now you Desire my Opinion again, which if I do, I may chance to Contradict my self; But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I believe the Planets, or Stars, have no more Influence upon the Bodies, Minds, and Natures of Men, than one Creature hath upon another, or several Creatures upon one, or one upon more; for though the Bodies, Humours, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and Minds of Men are subject to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and Changes, yet it is from their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Natures, as from the Nature of Mankind, and we see by Experience and Observation, that the Planets have not Power over Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and Education, which are more Firmly Setled, than to be Altered by the Various Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Stars and Planets, which Laws,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100053:156"/>
Customs, and Educations, have Power over the Appetites, Passions, and Constitutions of Men. But we may observe, that the Effects of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets Vary Perpetually, for if they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in their Effects, there would be no Change or Alteration, and if they had an Absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the rest of Nature's Works, as many think, or as others say, onely over Mankind, their Cross Effects or Influences would make such a Confusion, as it would make an Utter Destruction of that they have Power of, which would Cross and Hinder Natures Methodical Proceedings, and certain Rules and Decrees, by which she Governs, unless you will say, the Stars, or Planets, are the Fates and Destinies to all Mankind, if so, there needs no Education, Laws, or Justice; but the Stars and Planets are too Inconstant and Changing to Decree and Destinate any thing, for there is no Assurance or Certainty in the Effects or Influence of the Stars and Planets, there is more Assurance in the Educations, and Customs of Men, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and Education hath Stronger Effects, for Custom and Education can Alter the Unaptness in Natural Capacities and Understandings, the Dull Dispositions, Froward, or Evil Passions of the Mind; also it oftentimes Tempers the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Humours of the Body, and can Restrain the Unsatiable Appetites of the Body and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Long Custom Alters the Nature of Men: Besides, Healthful and Strong Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will become Sick and Faint with Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100053:156"/>
and Irregularities, and Sick and Weak Constitutions will grow Healthful and Strong with Temperance and Regularity; also Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation makes a Man a Thief, and a Thief an Honest Man, and it is Fortune that makes Kings and Beggars, and not the Planets, for all that are Born at one point of Time, have not the same Fortune, as when a King is Born, or else there would be thousands of Kings, so many Children being Born at the same point of Time. Likewise all that were Born in such or such a point of Time, would be Poets, Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and the like, whereas there are as Few of them as of Kings; also all that are Born in such a point of Time, would be Wise, Just, and Prudent men, according to the Influence of the Stars; but if so, I believe there would be more Wise, and Just men than there are, whereas now for One Wise man there are Millions of Fools; Besides, it would shew the Stars to have more Power, and greater Influence, to Produce Fools, Knaves, Slaves, and Beggars, than Wise, Just, Free, and Rich Noble men; and if the Planets had no Power over the Fortunes, nor over the Minds of Men, but over the Bodies of Men, then the Influence the Soul hath on the Body, would Contradict the Influence of the Planets, and the Planets Influence would Contradict the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Soul, so as by their Crossness the Body would be Perpetually Tortured, and the Mind Disquieted; and if the Planets had an Influence over the Soul and Body, then we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100053:157"/>
would be Good and Bad, Wicked and Pious, Valiant and Cowards, Sick and Well, Hungry and Dry, or otherwise have no Appetite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Planets please, or according to their Influences; also all men would be Good and Bad, Sick and Well, Wise and Fools, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and Cowardly, just at one time, as the Sign or Influence is, so that all men under the Domination of such Stars or Planets, would be alike at one Minute, and if all Men should Like or Love one Woman, at one Minute and Time, or all Women one Man, that is, as many as See her or him, that Woman would have more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Suters than she could Please or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and the Man more Mistresses than the Great <hi>Turk.</hi> Also, if it were according to the Dominion of the Planets, thousands on a Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den would be Inspired with Poetical Raptures, and soon after be Dull, and Stupid Dolts when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that Influence Changed: but I believe there is greater Influence from one Nation on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to Interest, Strength and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so from one Man to another, according to Interest, Power, and Authority, than the Stars and Planets have on Several Nations, and Several, and Particular Men, which Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces greater Effects, than the Planets Effects and Influences can do; not but that I believe the Planets can Work as Sudden Effects, nay, far Suddener and Immediate, as we see by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Heat, and Light of the Sun; but I believe, that Beauty and Wit have a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100053:157"/>
upon the Passions of the Mind, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Appetites of the Body, than the Stars; and why may not we think as well, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, especially the General Actions of men, might have as great an Influence or Power over the Stars and Planets, as the Stars and Planets are thought to have over Men? for I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the contrary, since they are Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not Gods. But surely, every seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral part and particle in Nature hath an Influence on each other, from which are produced seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effects, and Effects have Influence upon Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, some on some, and some on others, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they have all a Working Effect to each other, as many Grains of Corn are ground for one Loaf of Bread, many several Materials go to one House, many several Families to one Commonwealth, many several Nations, to one World, and many several Worlds to one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. Thus, Madam, I have Obeyed your second Command, concerning the Influences of the Stars and Planets, as I did your first, but in this Later Discourse, I seem to have no Belief that the Stars have an Influence over the Bodies or Minds, no more than the Bodies or Minds have over the Planets, and so over Fortune, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, Laws, Custom, and the like, whereas in my Former Letter, I said, they had over the Body, and was apt to Believe they had also over the Mind; but since I Writ the Former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning this Subject, I have thought of it more than I had then, and Believe every
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100053:158"/>
Creature hath some Influence to each other. But I leave both Letters, and the Opinions and Arguments written therein, to your Better Judgment, and rest,</p>

The like are the Bodies of Mankind, they are easier Cooled, when Inflamed, Applying Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquors, as Julips, Ptisan, Barly Water, and the like, than to Heat them with Cordials, when they are full of Raw, Crude, and Waterish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; for Fevers, although Violent, if they Proceed from no other Cause but a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heat, are Sooner, and Easier Cured, than Cold Palsies, and other Cold Diseases; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is better to take Hot things first, and Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>YOu Express'd in your last Letter, that Sir <hi>O. B.</hi> told an Acquaintance of yours, he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100053:165"/>
did not Understand my Philosophical and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Opinions, and I believe him, because he hath not a Philosophical Brain, and therefore cannot Understand Philosophical Reasons, but had he said, there was no Sense and Reason in those Opinions, I could not have Believed him, unless he would have Proved it, which I am Confident he Cannot: But it is impossible to Expect my Book should be Understood of every one that Reads it, for there is more Strength of Brain required to Understand it, than to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Horn-book; besides, it is harder, because they are New Opinions, never Vented before; as for Example, if a man did make an Oration in such a Language which his Auditors never heard before, and because they do not Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Language, would they Condemn this Oration? that were not only Unjust, but Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, to Condemn what they cannot Judg of, as not Understanding it; or would they say, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Understood, because they never Learn'd that Language? If every one were of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there would be no Languages Taught or Learned, but every one would keep to their Native Language; nay, all Languages would Cease, for they would not teach them their Children, because it would be a Lost Labour, &amp; so they would Forget whatever they did Learn themselves, or else that Opinion could not hold; wherefore, whatsoever hath been Invented, may be Taught, and Learned by good Capacities. But this is only to Express how Simply People
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100053:166"/>
Judg, or Spitefully Censure, and I believe that the Opinions or Doctrines of former Natural Philosophers, were no more Understood at first, than if they had Written, or Spoken in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Languages, till by Degrees their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was Learned, that is, their Opinions were Understood by those that did make it their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to Study, and so to Understand them, but they had this Advantage, being Men, that they had liberty not only to Write their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but to Preach, Teach, and Instruct others to Understand them; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> imposed five years Silence to his Pupils, because he would not have their Speaking Hinder their Studying, or Obstruct their Understanding, and there is not any Famous Philosopher, that ever I heard of, which did not Teach and Explane his Own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, besides Inscribing them either in Letters, Figures, Cifres, or the like. Wherefore I fear the Right Understanding of my Philosophical Opinions are likely to be Lost, for want of a Right Explanation, for they may be Interpreted not that way I Conceiv'd them, that is, not to my Sense or Meaning, for it is not Proper for my Sex to be a Publick Oratour, to Declare or Explane my Opinions in Schools, and if it were, yet I have neither Confidence nor Learning to Speak to an Assembly, nor in such Forms or Phrases, as Masters of Learning Use; Neither is it fit I should be a Private School-Mistress, to Teach and Instruct Scholars, although concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely my Philosophical Opinions, nor do I

believe I have so much Patience, being a Woman, for that Profession, as to Hammer, or Beat in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding into Dull Capacities, &amp; Hard Brains; wherefore I must leave that Work of mine Unexplaned by Words, though I have Written it as Plain fot Understanding, as the Nature, or Matter, or Subject, doth Afford, or give Way to; But I leave it to Heavens Protection, and Nature's Reward, as to Favour and Bless my Harmless Labours, and to Reward my Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Studies with Right Understanding, and Due Commendations, that neither Spite nor Ignorance may Condemn them, but that Time may Keep, and Fame Divulge them, that they may Live to and in After Ages, so that this VVork that Sir <hi>O.

But you may say, you ask'd my Opinion of two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poets, and I Talk of my self; Truly, Madam, I am forced to do so, in order to your Commands, at least to your Desires, for my
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100053:168"/>
Will is to Obey you, and first, to let you know, that though I am not a Learned, or Supreme Judg, yet I am an Inferiour Officer in the Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court, and therefore not altogether Ignorant in Poetical Causes or Cases; But, Madam, I am in a Dispute with my self, as whether it be Warrantable for me, a Private Person, to give my Judgment in so Publick a Cause, for though those two Persons, if they were Living, might with an United Consent appoint me to be a Judg between them, yet a Third Person, as your Ladiship, cannot Properly make a Judg without their Knowledg and Consent, unless you were a <hi>Caesar,</hi> and had the Power to make what Judges, or Laws you pleased; But yet by reason you are my <hi>Caesar,</hi> to Rule, Govern, and Command me, as you Please, I will Obey you, and as I hope, without Partiality, for I am neither of their Country, or their Kindred, nor have I taken Bribes from either, nor hope to have a Reward from any, but rather I fear a Censure for Punishment, howsoever, for your sake, I will Venture, and thus I give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That <hi>Virgil</hi> was the Craftier, but <hi>Ovid</hi> the Wittier man, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the better Flatterer, but <hi>Ovid</hi> the better Poet, that <hi>Virgil</hi> was the more Fortunate, and <hi>Ovid</hi> the more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. And to Prove <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Craft, he Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Emperour, and the most Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Rome</hi>; and as for his Flattery, he made the Ground of his Poems or Poetry, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Original of the Emperour, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100053:168"/>
Families of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether False or True, I leave to his own Belief and Knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Poetry, for the most part is Feigning, at least so Illustrated, that the End is False; yet howsoever he gain'd the Applause of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all the Chief of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and one Great and Eminent Persons Praise, is the Foundation of a Hundred Inferiour Persons Commendations, Admirations, Estimations, and Fame or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; Again, to Prove his good Fortune, he was in the Emperours Favour so much, as to be Honoured with his Company, Privacies, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, Affections, and Inriched with his Gifts, whereas <hi>Ovid</hi> was Banished from his Friends and Country, into an Unwholsom Air, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Fault was not so Notorious as to be Visible, or Publickly Known, so as one may Judg, that <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Banishment was through <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s Partial Envy to him for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s sake, and not for any Crime, for he Banished <hi>Ovid,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might Out-shine <hi>Virgil,</hi> his Flattering Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and Deifier, at least, Glorifier; but <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was too Rich, and Nobly born, to be a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, at least, so Gross a one as <hi>Virgil,</hi> he rather thought to be Flattered, than to Flatter; neither had he an Insinuating Craft to get Applause and Wealth, for he was Open and Free, not Bound up to Subtilty; And for his Wit, 'tis said, that his Prose was only Dissolved Verse, and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry was Brief, and yet Satisfactory, it was full of Fancy, yet Natural, Moral, and Human De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, it was full of Variety, yet Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100053:169"/>
so that his Poetry Express'd his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Understanding, Learning, Wit, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and Fancy; Neither did he spend his Reason, Judgment, Wit, and Fancy, on One Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Feigned Story, but on Hundreds of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Express'd himself in his <hi>Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> as much a Moral, and Natural Philosopher, a Courtly Lover, an Heroick Souldier, a Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and Prudent Commander, a Politick States-man, a Just Governour and Ruler, a Wise and Magnificent Prince, a Faithful Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, a Navigator, Fortificator, Architect, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer, and the like, as also a Learned Scholar, and had an Insight into Arts and Husbandry, as well as <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> nay far more, as having more Variety; neither was he so Palpable an Imitator as <hi>Virgil</hi> was; the truth is, in my Opinion, <hi>Ovid</hi> was the far Wiser, Witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Ingenious, and Nobler Poet, and by his Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we may perceive, that though he was not one of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Favourits, yet he was Nature's Favourite, and was Beloved of all the Muses, and though <hi>Caesar</hi> took away his Right of Human Inheritance, and Native Soil, yet he could not take away his Natural Poetical Birth, for he had his Worthy Due in the place he was Banished to, having, as I have heard, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honours given him after his Death, and great Respect and Love in his Life-time, by those People he Lived amongst, by which we may say, Happy <hi>Ovid,</hi> in an Unhappy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And for Language, wherein <hi>Virgil</hi> is so
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100053:169"/>
Highly Praised, I cannot Perceive in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but that <hi>Ovid</hi> is fully as Copious, Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, Sweet, Eloquent, and Illustrious, as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> I cannot tell what it is in Latin. But to Conclude, had <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Design been Favour, and his Poetry Flattery, fitted to the Genius, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or Pride of those Times he Liv'd in, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> would have been Buried in his Fame; but it is to be Observed, that not only the Inferiours of the same Time, Follow, Imitate, or Believe, according to a Grand Superiour, but Following Ages do the like, so Powerful and Lasting is a Grand Superiour's Esteem, Favour, or Opinion. And thus, Madam, I have given Judgment, at least my Opinion, for <hi>Ovid,</hi> not but that I do Highly Admire and Reverence <hi>Virgil,</hi> but yet not so much as I do sweet <hi>Ovid,</hi> whose Fancy, Wit, and Language, is like his Birth, Soft, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and Noble, Rational, Observing, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Judicious, Quick, Ingenious, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, Beautiful, Graceful, and Taking, or Moving, Heroick, Generous, and Magnificent, Eloquent, Elegant, and Fluent, Distinguishing, Similizing, Forming, Winding, Composing, Contriving and Uniting; to all which I leave his Poetry, and his Fame to Everlasting Life, or Memory, and rest,</p>

               <p>I Thank you for the Cup you sent me, but I cannot Guess whether it be Glass, Metal, or Stone, for it seems too Light to be Metal, too Thin to be Stone, and too Strong to be Glass, but I suppose it is of a Mix'd Nature, as many things are; as for Example, Feathers seem to be betwixt Hair and Wool, for the Quils seem to be somewhat like Soft Souls, being Hollow, and within them a Pith, somewhat like Brains, and the Small Sprigs of Feathers are like as Hair Growing thereupon, and Sprouting thereout, and the Downy part of Feathers which Grow towards the Bottom, or Root of the Quils, are of the Nature and Likeness of Wool; so the Scales of Fishes seem to be betwixt Sinews or Gristles, and Skin, for they are like Gristles in being Tough and Clammy, and like Skin in being Smooth, Slick, and Thinner than Sinews are; Also Horns of Beasts, Hoofs, and Claws, Bills of Fowls, and Nails of Men, are betwixt Bones and Gristles, as to be Harder than Gristles, and Softer than Bones. Also there are many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Creatures, which seem to be of a Mix'd Kind, as a Bat seems to be betwixt a Beast and a Bird, having a Body like a Mouse, and Wings like a Bird, and an Owl seems somewhat like
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100053:171"/>
a Cat, and hath the Nature of a Cat, to catch Mice, and many other Creatures could be brought for Examples, which would bee too Tedious for a Letter. But to return to your Present, which is now my Cup, I am so Pleased with it, as to my thinking my Drink is nothing so Tastable out of any other thing as out of that, for if I Drink out of any thing that is Metal, methinks my Drink tasts Brackish, as if it were mix'd with Mineral Waters, although it were Gold, and out of any thing made of Earth, methinks my Drink hath a Musty Tast, although out of Purceline; and out of Glass, it is so Cold in Winter time, that it Deads my Tast so much, as if it had no Tast at all. But these Faults are found only since I have the Cup you sent me; wherefore by this you may see, a New Acquaintance is Preferr'd before an Old, like as Men that find so many Sweet Graces in a New Mistress, at least do think so, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Foul Faults in a Wife, as the Wife is cast By, and the Mistress only made Use of. But 'tis most Probable, I am so Pleas'd with the Cup because it was yours, and now it is mine, yet it is yours still, for whatsoever is mine, is yours, for I my self am so, as,</p>

U.</hi> is so Sick; Truly, I do believe, she takes too many Cordial Waters; if there were a Mean betwixt her Diet and mine, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it would be better for us both, for as I Quench out my Spirits by Over-cooling and Moistening Drinks, as VVater, and Clarified VVhay, so she Burns up hers, with too Hot, and Dry Cordials, as Hot VVaters; but the Fire of Life should neither be Burnt up, nor Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, although Quenching is less Dangerous than Burning out, for if the Fuel of Life be Burnt to Ashes, there is no hopes of Reinkindling that Fire again, by reason those Ashes are Insipid, and yield no Nourishing Food, nor Oily Flame, but if it be only Quenched out, and the Fuel Remaining, 'tis probable it may be Inlightened again with a few live Coals, that is two or three Spoons full of Cordial VVater, so as that which will Kill her, if she take too much of it, may in Extremity Cure me, if I take a little; the Fuel of Life are the Vital Parts, the Fire of Life are the Vital Spirits, the Fuel of the Vital Parts is Food, the Fuel of the Vital Spirits is Radical Moisture, which is an Oyly, or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick Substance; when this Radical Moisture
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100053:172"/>
is too Thin, it Quenches the Spirits out, and when it is Consumed with Excessive Heat, as being Burnt up, or Evaporated, there is nothing for the Spirits to Feed on. Thus Radical Moisture is the Prolonging, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying of Life, 'tis the Oyl to the Lamp of Life. But Mrs. <hi>B. U.</hi> Drinks not Cordials through an Appetite to those Strong Liquors, no more than I do Drink Tastless Water; But we being both Studious Persons, are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, for all Students are Conceited more or less, especially concerning their Diets, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Persons either Change oftener in the Course of their Diet, than Fantastical Persons in the Fashion of their Clothes, or be so Obstinate in one particular Diet, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense nor Reason shall be able to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them from it, nay, they will rather Die in their Obstinacy; But I hope Mrs. <hi>B.

               <p>MY Thoughts, although not my Actions, have been so busily Imployed about Huswifry these three or four Dayes, as I could think of nothing else, for I hearing my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours should say, my Waiting-Maids were Spoil'd with Idleness, having nothing to do, but to Dress, Curl, and Adorn themselves, and they Excusing themselves, laying the Blame upon me, that I did not set them to any Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but whereas they were ready to Obey my Commands, I was so Slow in Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as I seldom took any Notice of them, or Spoke to them, and that the truth was, they oftener Heard of their Lady, than Heard, or Saw her themselves, I living so Studious a Life, as they did not See me above once a Week, nay, many times, not once in a Fortnight; wherefore, upon the Relation of these Complaints, I sent for the Governess of my House, and bid her give order to have Flax and Wheels Bought, for I, with my Maids, would sit and Spin. The Governess hearing me say so, Smiled, I ask'd her the Reason, she said, she Smil'd to think what Uneven Threads I would Spin, for, said she, though Nature hath made you a Spinster in Poetry, yet Education hath not made you a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100053:173"/>
Spinster in Huswifry, and you will Spoil more Flax, than Get Cloth by your Spinning, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Art that requires Practice to Learn it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, said she, the Noise the Wheels make with Turning round, will be Offensive to your Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I was very much Troubled to hear what she said, for I thought Spinning had been Easie, as not requiring much Skill to Draw, and Twist a Thread, nay, so Easie I thought it was, as I did imagine I should have Spun so Small, and Even a Thread, as to make Pure Fine Linnen Cloth, also, that my Maids and I should make so much, as I should not have needed to Buy any, either for Houshold Linnen, or Shifts. Then I bid her leave me, to Consider of some other Work; and when I was by my self alone, I call'd into my Mind several Sorts of Wrought Works, most of which, though I had Will, yet I had no Skill to Work, for which I did Inwardly Complain of my Education, that my Mother did not Force me to Learn to Work with a Needle, though she found me alwayes Unapt thereto; at last I Pitch'd upon Making of Silk Flowers, for I did Remember, when I was a Girl, I saw my Sisters make Silk Flowers, and I had made some, although Ill-favour'dly; wherefore I sent for the Governess of my House again, and told her, that I would have her Buy several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Silks, for I was Resolved to Imploy my Time in making Silk-Flowers; she told me, she would Obey my Commands, but, said she, Madam, neither You, nor any that Serves You,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100053:173"/>
can do them so Well, as those who make it their Trade, neither can you make them so Cheap, as they will Sell them out of their Shops, wherefore you had better Buy those Toyes, if you Desire them, for it will be an Unprofitable Employment, to Wast Time, with a Double Expence of Mony. Then I told her I would Preserve, for it was Summer time, and the Fruit Fresh, and Ripe upon the Trees; she ask'd me for whom I would Preserve, for I seldom did Eat Sweet-meats my self, nor made Banquets for Strangers, unless I meant to Feed my Houshold Servants with them; besides, said she, you may keep half a score Servants with the Mony that is laid out in Sugar and Coals, which go to the Preserving only of a Few Sweet-meats, that are good for nothing, but to Breed Obstructions, and Rot the Teeth. All which when I heard, I conceived she spoke Reason; at last I considered, that I and my Maids had better be Idle, than to Employ Time Unprofitably, and to spend Mony Idely; and after I had Mused some time, I told her, how I heard my Neighbours Condemn'd me, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my Servants be Idle without Employment, and that my Maids said it was my Fault, for they were willing to be Employed in Huswifry; she said, my Neighbours would find Fault, where no Fault was, and my Maids would Complain more if they were kept to Work, than when they had liberty to Play; besides, said she, none can want Employment, as long as there are
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100053:174"/>
Books to be Read, and they will never Inrich your Fortunes by their Working, nor their Own, unless they made a Trade of Working, &amp; then perchance they might get a poor Living, but not grow Rich by what they can do, whereas by Reading they will Inrich their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Increase their Knowledges, and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their Wit, all which may make their Life Happy, in being Content with any Fortune that not in their Power to Better, or in that, as to Manage a Plentiful Fortune Wisely, or to Indure a Low Fortune Patiently, and therefore they cannot Employ their Time better, than to Read, nor your Ladiship better than to Write, for any other Course of Life would be as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing, and Unnatural to you, as Writing is Delightful to you; besides, you are Naturally Addicted to Busie your time with Pen, Ink, and Paper; but, said I, not with Wit, for if Nature had given me as much Wit to Write, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath given me Leisure, my Writing might have been for some Use, but now my Time and Paper is Unprofitably VVasted in VVriting, as my Time and Flax would be in Spinning, but since I am fit for no other Employment but to Scratch Paper, leave me to that Employment, and let my Attending Maids have Books to read. Thus, Madam, for a time did I Trouble my Mind, and Busie my Thoughts to no Purpose, but was Forced to Return to my VVriting-VVork again, not knowing what else to do, and if I had been as Long Absent from my Lord as

                  <hi>Penelope</hi> was from her Husband <hi>Vlysses,</hi> I could have never Employed my Time as she did, for her work only Employed her Hands, and Eyes, her Ears were left open to Loves Pleadings, and her Tongue was at liberty to give her Suters Answers, whereas my VVork Employes all the Faculties and Powers of my Soul, Mind, and Spirits, as well as my Eyes and Hands, and my Thoughts are so Busie in my Brain, as they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regard, nor take Notice what Enters through the Ears; indeed those Passages are as Stop'd up, or Barr'd close, whereas had <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope</hi>'s Ears been so Barr'd, her Lovers Petitions, Sutes, and Pleadings, would have been kept without doors, like a Company of Beggars, they might have Knock'd, but not Entred, nor any of the Mind's Family would have ask'd them what they Desired; neither would the Tongue, the Mind's Almner, have given them one word of Answer, and then it was likely her Amorous Lovers would have gone away, and not stay'd to Feed upon her Cost and Charge, as they did.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100053:176"/>
not Readily make her Complaints, did as a Midwife, Help them forth, by asking her what the Cause of her Sadness was; with that Tears Flowed forth her Eyes, as Ushers to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; said she, although I was a Joyful Bride, yet I am an Unhappy Wife, for on my Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day I Joyed, because I had Married such a man as had Proved himself to be Valiant, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and Wise, all which I thought was a Greater Honour, to be the Wife of such a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, than if he had been Rich, Handsom, and Dignified with Title, although he did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Want those, which was an Addition to my Joy; nor did I think my self Unhappy, that he Married me not through his Own Choice, but his Friends Perswasions, or that he did seem not to Love me, for I thought when Time had Proved my Virtue, Duty, and Obedience, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice would have Perswaded him to have Loved me; neither did I think my self Unhappy, that he Endeavoured to make me a Servant, nay a Slave to his Mistress, because I thought he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by this means to keep me from Jealousie, and to learn me Patience; neither did I think my self Unhappy, that he Tortured me, nay Threatned Death to me, to Force me to Serve his Concubines, because I took more Comfort in that my Resolution was so Strong, as neither Pain, nor Fear of Death could Alter it, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried more in my Sufferings, than Grieved for my Pains, as that I would rather Die than do a Base Act, as to be a Bawd to my Husbands
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100053:177"/>
VVhores; But my Unhappiness is, that my Husband will be Divorced from me, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement is far VVorse than Death, or Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pains in Life, for in the Grave I shall lie in Rest and Peace, and if I be not Remembred with Honour, yet I Die not in Disgrace; and for the Pains in Life, it Learns me to Practise Moral Philosophy; but to be Divorced, is to Live in Disgrace and Scorn, which is VVorse than any Pain, or Death, for he having got the Reputation of a VVorthy Man, the VVorld will think I am a very Unworthy VVoman if he Forsakes me, and that he knows me to be guilty of some Notorious Faults, but that he will not Divulge them, for Fear of his Own Dishonour, or out of Respect to the Female Sex. Thus, by a Divorcement, I shall be left to the Censure, and Scandal of the VVorld, whilst he will be thought a Wise man for Parting from me, as being not Honourable for him to Live with me; with that she Wept, as if her Eyes had been two Perpetual Springs, and mean'd to make a Deluge of their Tears, and with seeing her, my Eyes began to Drop too; at last I told her, I did verily believe her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did but Pretend a Divorce, only to Fright her to what he would have her, and intended not a Divorce to Grieve her, for though he was a man that did take a liberty of Variety of VVomen, knowing that Liberty could be no Dishonour to the Masculine Sex; and though he loved a VVanton Mistress, yet certainly he
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100053:177"/>
was not so Unjust, or Unwise, as to Hate a Chast VVife, or to Part from a Virtuous Wife, for the sake of a Lewd Mistress, and therefore I thought she might take Comfort, and the best Remedy, at least, Cordial, for Grief, was Patience, for though her Husband was an Independent to Amour, yet he was an Orthodox to Honour, and Moral Honesty, only he wanted some Temperance, at which she Smil'd; by that I perceiv'd her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and my Opinion had somewat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Heavy Oppression of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after some time, she took her leave of me, giving me Thanks both for hearing her Discourse of her own Grief, and for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting her; and by this Relation you have as it were Received the same Visit, as also a Visit from me, so as we have been both with you, onely a Letter doth Carry us to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a Coach.

               <p>YOu writ in your last Letter, that Mrs. <hi>P.C.</hi> drinks New Milk every Morning Fasting, for Nourishment, and to Increase Natural Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; truly, I believe she had better Drink Cream, for as Milk hath Thin Whay in it, so it hath also Hard, Dry Curds in it, for Milk is Compounded by Nature, of three Substances, as Butter, Curd, and Whay, as the Oyly, Earthy, and Watery Part, whereas Cream hath only the Oily and Watery Part, for Thick Cream cannot be turned into a Hard Curd, which makes it so much the Better, for Dry Curd is of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Horn, as we may observe by such Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as are made of Fleeted Milk, which are Tough, Hard, and Insipid, whereas Cream-Cheeses are only Press'd Butter; indeed, it is not to be done, as to make a Cheese, or Cheese-Curd, only of Thich Cream, unless there be VVater, or Thin Milk mix'd with it. 'Tis true, the VVhay of Cream, which is Butter-milk, will Curdle, that is, when the Oily Part is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of it, and this is the reason that I say Cream is more Nourishing, and Moistening than Milk; but I may chance to Plead the Good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Cream, and leave out the Evil, as I did once for Brown Bread, which was, that Brown Bread in Effect was much Cooler than White,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100053:178"/>
my reason was, that the Flowry part being Boulted out, wherein lies the Strength, and so consequently the Heat, the Remainder, as the Branny part, was like Grains, which is the Insipid part of Barley, so that Brown Bread in Effect, is like Small Ale, and VVhite Bread like Strong, and for this Reason I did eat Brown Bread, but my VVeak Stomack soon grew Sick, for though my Reason found out the Cool Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet it did not perceive, that the Grossness made it Hard of Digestion, until Experience Taught it: so some may Object, that Cream being Thicker than Milk, may not pass out of the Stomack so Easily, but surely, if the Milk Curdles in the Stomack, as certainly it most U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually doth, those Curds will not only be Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Digest, but Breed great Obstructions, whereas Cream, which is as Butter, will make the Body Soluble. Yet though I Argue for it, I Eat little of it, by reason the nature of Cream is Hot, and my Diet is for the most part Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; some may say, by reason Milk Nourishes Children, it may Nourish those that are Grown up to Years, but Experience tells us, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind, for the most part, Alters with Time, and that which is Natural to a Child, may be Unnatural to a Man; but perchance some have Childish Constitutions all their Life-time, and the truth is, that Diet is much according to the Constitution, for, that which will Agree with some, will Disagree with others, and for Milk, it better Agrees with VVeak Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100053:179"/>
than Strong, yet VVomens Milk, and Asses Milk doth Agree better than any other Milk, by reason those Milks are Thinner, and not so full of Curds. But leaving Mrs. <hi>P. C.</hi> to her Milk, I rest,</p>

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100053:179"/>
to be as Good a Husband as I am a VVife, and with this Joyful Relation, her Blood Flush'd into her Cheeks, which shew'd, that her Cold, Dark, Melancholy Thoughts were Dispersed, like as the Sun breaks through Dark, and Broken Clouds, which Clouds, when Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Obscured his Light, and Abated his Heat; the truth is, her Joy was so much, as I may say it was Contagious and Infectious, for it Affected me with Joy, to See, and Observe her, and if all her Neighbours were the like Affected, she might do as the man, that call'd his Neighbours and Friends, to Rejoyce at the Finding his Lost Sheep; but her Husbands Affections were not so much Lost, as Hidden, or Obscured from her Knowledge; and truly, she deserves to be Loved, for her Virtue, Chastity, Love, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for there are but Few VVomen that make so good VVives as she, for many Wives Dislike their Husbands, not out of a Dislike to their Faults, but out of Love to Variety, and some Hate their Husbands through Hate to their Faults, making no Distinction between the Man and the Faults, nay, some Dislike their Husbands Virtues, and Good Qualities, through a Dislike to their Persons, and many Wives care not whether their Husbands Love or Hate them, Live From, or With them, nay, for the most part, they love their Husbands Absence better than their Presence, and will make Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels to Part; but the Lady <hi>M.

               <p>I Am sorry to hear you are not Well, but if your Disease be only a Faint-tiredness, or Weakness, when you stand still any time, since you can Walk an hour together, and find no Weariness, but rather Ease, there is no Danger of Death, for to be Weary when you Stand still, so as to be near Fainting, and to find Rest and Ease by Walking, is a Natural Effect of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cause, the reason is, that when any one Stands still, the Nerves and Sinews are Stretch'd straight out at Length, but when one VValks or Moves, they have Liberty, as being Unbent, and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100053:180"/>
Unstretch'd; as for Example, when Mankind Stands, their Legs, Thighs, Hams, and Back, are Straight, as one Straight Line, but when they Go, their Legs Tuck up, as first one Leg, then th' other, which Pulling, or Tucking up, Slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all the Nerves and Sinews, from the Back Downwards, and that gives Ease; for 'tis not only Change that gives Ease, but the Slacking of the Nerves and Sinews, which are as if they were Stretch'd upon a Rack, when they are Drawn Straight out at Length by Standing, but it shews, your Sinews and Nerves are not very Tough and Strong, but rather Tender and VVeak, being soon VVeary in Standing Still, for the Nerves and Sinews are as Strings, or Cords, which Tie, or Knit the several Parts of the Body together, where some are Stronger, and Tougher, as not easily Stretch'd; like as VVyer, or Lute-strings, or Bow-strings, some are so Hard, as they will sooner Break than Stretch, others so Limber, as to Stretch into a Hairs Smallness, which makes them not so Firm nor Steady, but apt to Tremble and Shake, at the least Touch, or Motion of the Air, whenas those that are Hard and Tough, require some Strength to Stir them. The like is with the Nerves and Sinews, those that are Weak and Tender, when Stretch'd, are apt to Move, which is the reason that many with Standing Long, will so Tremble and Shake, as to be ready to fall to the Ground, the Lower Parts of their Body being not able to bear them
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100053:181"/>
up, being as it were, Loose, or Untied, or Over-stretch'd; and this is the reason that when Soft and Delicate Persons take up a great VVeight, or hold a VVeight something above their Strength, their Arms, or Hands, or Bodies, will be as if they had the Shaking Palsie in them for an hour after, for the Weight did Over-stretch their Sinews and Nerves. But, Madam, I am Troubled with the same Tenderness, insomuch as it is Tiresom to my Life, and certainly the best Remedy will be to endeavour to Strengthen our Sinews and Nerves, only the Mischief will be, that what is good to Strengthen the Sinews and Nerves, is Hurtful, and apt to Obstruct the Liver, Splene, and Veins, so as the Remedy may prove worse than the Disease, for Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous Meats are Good for the Sinews and Nerves, but Nought for Obstructions. But Physicians perchance can tell Remedies, for I that am none may be Mistaken in the Cause, and Ignorant of the Cure, wherefore I will leave you to the Advice of the Learned Practicers, and rest,</p>

               <p>YOu were pleased to tell me in your last Letter, that the Lady <hi>D. M.</hi> and you were Fall'n out, about some Speeches she should
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100053:182"/>
Speak in your Dispraise, and those, when you were not by to Answer for your self. Truly, Madam, I cannot Imagine what Fault she could perceive in your Ladiship, to Dispraise you, unless Envy have power to make Virtue Vice, Beauty Deformity, and to turn the Graces into Furies; But, Madam, I have often Observed, that Women with Women seldom Agree, for our Sex is so Self-loving, as we cannot Indure a Competitor, much less a Superiour, especially for Beauty, Wit, and Worth; Birth, Title, and Wealth are somewhat Easier to Indure, yet neither so well, but that we are apt to look a Squint upon them that Surpass us therein, and therefore the less Acquaintance we have with each other, the better, unless they be Chosen by an Immaculate, and Pure Sympathy, and Honour Knit the Knot of Friendship, otherwise the more Acquaintance we have, the more Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we have; wherefore to Live Quietly, Peaceably, and Easily, is to be Strangers to our own Sex, and to Live Honourably, is to be Strangers to the Masculine Sex, for Masculine Acquaintance most commonly Causes Suspicion, and a Masculine Friendship never fails of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion; wherefore a Retired Life is most Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as being most Free from Censure, Scandals, Disputes, and Effeminate Quarrels, I mean not Retired from those we have Relation to, as by Nature, Birth, Marriage, Breeding, Obligation, and the like, for that were to be Buried Quick, but to be Retired from those we call Strangers,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100053:183"/>
such as we have no Relation to, or Obligation from; but our Sex is so far from Retirement, as they seek all Occasions, and let no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty slip, by which they can go to Publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or Private Visitings, or Home-Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they will Ruin their Friends, Fortunes, or Fame, rather than Miss, or Want Company. But if this Letter were not written to you, but to another Lady, it were Probable that Lady would become my Enemy upon this Subject, as speaking so much against our Sex; wherefore there is Male-Gossipping, and Male-Brabling as well as Female, and there are more Effeminate Men than Masculine Women, that is, there are few Women so Wise as Men should be, and many Men as Foolish as Women can be; But now you may think me like a Priest of a Parish, that Exclames against his Parishioners Faults, but never Mentions his own, or perhaps hath the the same Faults, but thinks to Obscure them by speaking against them in other Persons; And therefore being already sensible of my Fault, in writing so Long a Letter to you, I do Beg your Pardon, only Subscribing my self,</p>

               <p>YOu desire me to give my reason why much Cream is apt to make a Cake Heavy, I say, the same reason that much Butter makes Pye-crust Heavy, for it is much Moisture that causes such things to be Heavy, like as Dough is much Heavier than when it is throughly Baked, for the Fire Drying up the Moisture, causes it to be Light; also when the Sun Drinks up the Moisture of the Earth, it causes it to be Dusty, and Dust is Lighter than Water, and much Lighter than Dirt, which is Earth and Water mix'd together, for although Rarified VVater is so Light as to Ascend, yet when VVater is an United Body, it is Heavy, even so Heavy, as to Descend Weightily; Indeed Vapor one may say is the Dusty Part of Water; but leaving Dust and VVater, I return to Cake and Pye-crust, Cream and Butter; the more Cakes and Pies are Baked, the Lighter they will be, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100053:184"/>
much Lighter, if the Flower be Dried before it is Mix'd, and by reason Cream and Butter are of a very Moist Nature, when there is much of them in Cakes, and such like Meats, it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily Dried up, which makes them require so much the more Baking and VVorking; but many Good Huswifes put the Fault in the Cream and Butter, when it is the Fault of the Oven, and many Impatient Huswives will have their Cake before it is Baked, they will not stay the time, their Appetites being Hotter than their Ovens; but there is an Old Saying, Too much Cost Spoils a Pudding, and in my Opinion, it is too much Hast that Spoils it, for Good Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents VVell ordered, cannot be Amiss.

Opinions, and cannot write More, nor Better of it, than I have done there, unless I had more Learning, or Judgment, or VVit, or Conceptions, or Understanding; but yet to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, I'le send you the same Opinion, or but little different, which is, that if there were no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> but that all the Universe were full, only the Gross Bodies Moved in the Thin Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as is held by many they do, then the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of each Solid or Bulky Body must be fitted just to their Measures, and their Places must be Supplied so, as when they Move, the Liquid, or Rare Bodies must Contract and Dilate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Motion of those Bulky Bodies, to fill up their former Places, or following Places, and to Contract, to make Room and Place for those Solid and Grosser Bodies, otherwise there would be a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or a Stoppage of all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motions. But I cannot conceive how the Thin or Rare Matter, can Contract or Dilate, if there be no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> for to my Reason, there must be a Space to Dilate, and Contract into, so as the Rare Parts must be Porous to Contract, and there must be Empty Places, or Space to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and if they say the Space or Place is the Place or Space where the Solid Bodies were in, which they fill up as soon as they Moved out, yet the Space or Place must be Empty before the Rare Bodies Enter, for two Bodies cannot be in one Place at one Time, and if the Great, or Solid Bodies, leave no Places or Spaces, but alwayes Move in Full
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100053:185"/>
Matter, I cannot Imagine how they should Move if all Places be Full, although they should move in Rare, or Thin Matter, for as I said, the Thin Matter must be Porous to Contract and Dilate, to make VVay, or Fill up, for if there were not Pores, or Spongy, or Hollow Spaces and Places, that which is Liquid and Rare would be as Firm as Brass or Glass, nay more, for those, no doubt, are Porous, for if there were no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> every part would be Press'd, and Joyn'd into a Firm Body or Substance, nay surely there would be great Confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Works of Nature. But why may not Dilatation and Contraction cause <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> to be sometimes more, and sometimes less? But one would think there were no <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, because Nature is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or seems to be so, as to make VVay for Life by Death, as if she had no Room, or Space for Life, but what was caused by Death.

Action, much less of their Designs; but you tell me, he mentions an Entertainment my Lord made the King, where he sayes it cost 5000 l. or thereabout, Condemning another Writer of the same Subject, for saying it cost more; let me tell you, Madam, that neither of them was my Lords Steward, nor Treasurer, to know the Expences, but only what they have heard Reported; and therefore in this I cannot say <hi>S.

But, Madam, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire me to ask my Lord concerning his Army, <hi>viz.</hi> the Number, and by what Power he rais'd so many men, as also of the several Successes, and how many several Armies were against him, I desire you will pardon me, if I do not send you a Relation, by reason I intend to Write the History of my Lord's Life, if I live, and he pleases to Inform me, as he hath promised he will, in which History I intend to Write all the Several Passages, and Particular Actions of the Wars in those Parts, where my Lord was the Chief for the King, as being General to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the Kingdom of that side, and I will Write it Truly, Honestly, and Uprightly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Aggravation, or Feigned Illustration, for my Lord and I believe that the Chief Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion, Honour, and Honesty, is Speaking Truth, and Doing Justly in all our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and I take Heaven to witness, that I have Observed in him, and Found in my self, not so much as an Inclination to do otherwise, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a Delight and Pleasure in Truth and Right; But, Madam, to return to speak of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Histories, they are for the most part mere Fables, and it is almost impossible they should be otherwise, unless every Particular Author

And, Madam, by reason you desire some particular Passages and Affairs concerning my Lord's Actions, I shall be the more earnest with him to set some time apart to Declare them to me; in the mean time, I rest,</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100053:189"/>
deserve it, but so full of Detraction the World is, that neither Maids, VVives, nor VVidows, can Escape their Slandering Tongues, whether Old, Ill favour'd, Poor, or Diseased, much less those that are Young, Beautiful, Rich, and Healthful, nay, not Incloistered Women, which have Vowed Virginity, are free from Slanders, only I believe Sucking Females are not subject to be Mistrusted; and it is not only Men that Slander Women, but one Woman Slanders an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, indeed, VVomen are the Chief Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourers of their own Sex, not so much by their Crimes, as by the Reproaches of each other, some through Envy, and some through Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; but 'tis alwayes a certain Rule, that those that are Guilty, will never fail to Accuse the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, thinking it Hides their Faults, or at least Lessens them, in having it thought that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther VVomen are as Bad as they themselves; some may say, then it is to no purpose to live a Strict Life, since a Cloister cannot secure them from Slandering Tongues; I answer, that Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders must not Deterr Virtuous VVomen from a Reserved Behaviour and Course of Life, but these must Endeavour by their Actions and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Life, to prove Slanders to be Slanders; and say all VVomen were Slandered, and none did Escape, yet Heaven forbid that Virtuous VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should be thought Guilty, no, their Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life will Quit them, and Beget thoughts of Respect and Esteem in every Mind, even in their Enemies, for though Ill-natur'd Minds have
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100053:190"/>
Ill-spoken Tongues, yet they cannot Believe what they speak, if they have no Ground, nor Probability for their Belief. Wherefore Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should behave themselves so as to get a Good Belief, if they cannot get a Good Report, but if VVomen behave themselves so as to cause a Suspicion, they are Justly Served if they be Censured both in VVords and Thoughts. And as Virtuous VVomen Suffer in Report through the Envy, and Jealousie, and the like, of their own Sex, so through the Base Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory of some Men, who think it an Honour to be thought Servants to Fair Ladies, especially if they be Eminent Persons, Professing in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies how much they are in Love with them, and going to every Place or Company they are in, where every Particular will Address him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to one he Pretends to be in Love with, and Scrape, and Complement only to her, whereupon the Company straight is apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine she hath given him some Signs or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Incourage his Hopes, for if he had no Hopes, he would Cease or Desist from his Courtships, and he is Pleased they should Think so, although he Knows the contrary; and when he is with his Companions, they will Jest and Sport with his Pretended Amorous Passions, and Name the Lady to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he Shrugs, Sighs, and Lifts up his Eyes, Professing himself an Unfortunate Man, but he will Order these Actions so, as to make the Company Believe he is not in Despair. Besides,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100053:190"/>
the very Joyning of a Mans &amp; Womans Names begets in time a Suspicion, especially in those that are Strangers to the Lady, when perchance the Lady Hates that Man worse than Death, out of fear she might Suffer in her Reputation, through his Vain Folly; nay many times such Men will Pretend to be in Love with such or such a Lady, although they have no Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all with her; and some are so Basely VVicked, as to Report they have Favours from such and such Ladies, when all is False they say; yet these are most Inferiour Persons, whereas those of the First Description are often amongst the Higher Sort. But then for a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Womans Comfort, the Reports, or Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that are Raised by such Unworthy Persons, Vanish like the Steam or Breath upon a Glass, which leaves no Stain behind it; for the Base Humour of the Man is soon perceived, and then the Credulous Suspecters and Rash Reporters Condemn the Man, and Extoll the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Scorn the Man, and Honour the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the which Wipes away all Dusty Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and so I hope will be the Aspersion of the Lady <hi>H.

But my Concernment for her hath made me forget I was writing a Letter, which should be Brief, wherefore, I pray Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, Dear Madam, and I will promise you the next shall be Shorter, yet my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

               <p>YOu were pleased in your last Letter to tell me, that Learned men are held now in as much Derision and Scorn, as Poets and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were some twenty years since, 'tis a sign that Ignorance hath gotten the Mastery, and that Learning is beaten out of Schools and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and 'tis no wonder, since the Protectors of Learning, as Royalty, Nobility, and Gentry, are Beaten out of Power; but these are Punished now, for Undervaluing the Poets and Souldiers,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100053:193"/>
a Poet and a Captain were names of Derision, they would look upon a Poet, as a Poor, Sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fellow, and upon a Commander, as a Man out of Fashion, which was a sign they had lived Long in Peace; indeed, a Poet and a Captain were accounted names of such Reproach, as Men thought it a Disgrace to be seen in their Companies, especially Young Fluttering Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, who would Shun them more than the Pox, and your Grave Formalists would cast a Despising Smile on them, and Busie Statesmen did think it were fitter they should be Banished, than Live in a Commonwealth, although a Commonwealth could neither have Pleasure nor Security without them, and in Danger they would have Desired, nay Flatter'd the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Guard them with their Courage, and to Direct, and Advise them with their Skill, also they would have Intreated the Poet to Grace their Triumphs; and if it were not for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, they could neither have Masks to Please their Eyes and Ears, nor Playes to Feed their Thoughts, and Entertain their Time; but though they Despised the Poet, yet they would Steal the Poets VVit, although they could not Steal his VVorth, to Court their Mistresses, or to Entertain Visitors: Thus they did Basely Steal, Proudly Scorn, Vainly Despise, Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Detract, Foolishly Laugh at Poets and Souldiers, who yet are Persons that are most Honoured by Renown, and Best Entertain'd by Fame, Fame placing them in the Chiefest Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

in her Palace, for Souldiers and Poets are Fames Nobles, and so Greater Men to After Posterity, and more Honoured, than Bare Titles in the Present Age; and of all Degrees there have been and will be Poets and Souldiers, from the Palace to the Cottage, and they are so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of Fame, as Fame Advances those whom Poets Favour; but those that do Despise, or give not an Honourable Respect to those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wherein lives Wit and Courage, let them Live in Fear, and Die in Oblivion, and I believe your Ladiship will say Amen to it, as not only being a Lover of Merit, but a Possessor, for which I am,</p>

O.</hi> said she had been Mistaken, for it was only a Different Opinion from the Opinion he Profess'd before; <hi>G.B.</hi> said that was no wonder, for many did Change their Party for Interest, and it was to be Observed, that what Opinion a King or Chief Governour did Profess, the most part of their Subjects did the same, and so many Strangers that did but dwell in their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, either for Safety, or Traffick, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but Natives Changed out of hope of Preferment, as some for Honours, Offices, and Commands, others to Enjoy their Estates, and to save Fines, or Taxes, or the like, some through Perswasion of Friends, some for Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake, and some for fear of Banishment or Death: Thus some for Fear, and some for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, some through Covetousness, and some for Humor, changed their Opinions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but few for Conscience, and none for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for Opinions in Religion are all built upon Faith, wherein Reason hath no Place, at least no Foundation; but if any Changed for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, said she, it were the Meaner, and most Ignorant sort of People, who are most apt to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100053:194"/>
Fear, for Moral Conscience, said she, is the most Tender Effect of a Fearful Passion, but Divine Conscience is an Effect of Grace, which the Common People hath but little of: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mrs. <hi>D. O.</hi> told Mrs. <hi>G. B.</hi> that her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course proceeded from an Uncharitable Mind; Mrs. <hi>G.

O.</hi> had Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served otherwise, she desired her to tell; <hi>D.O.</hi> said, she did not take so much notice of the World of Mankind; then said <hi>G.B.</hi> you did not well to Judg me; And hereupon <hi>D. O.</hi> ask'd her of her Opinion, as whether she thought Sir <hi>B. C.</hi> was not in a Dangerous Condition; <hi>G.B.</hi> ask'd her, whether she meant Dangerous to his Soul, Body, or Estate; <hi>D. O.</hi> said, for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul; Truly, answered <hi>G. B.</hi> I do believe, that the Great Omnipotent God is Good, Wise, Powerful, Knowing, Fore-seeing, and Just, as not to Damn a man for that which he could not possibly know, or for that which Nature made him to do, neither was he Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as not to Fore-see what Man could, or would do, and if Man could do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods Permission, Gods Mercy would not Permit, or Suffer Man to Damn himself, for that would be to Make Man to that End, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it before, as Fore-seeing it, and if he gave Man a Free-Will, that were to give away one
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100053:195"/>
of his Attributes, and so to make Man Great, and himself Less, and only to Impower Man to Damn himself; or for God to Make Man, and then Damn him, whereby to shew his Power, would neither stand with God's Justice nor Goodness; but certainly God could shew his Power other wayes, than by Damning those Creatures he Made, or Makes; and that God be as much, if not more Glorified by the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as by the Blessed, is but an Odd Belief, that Gods Glory should Arise from Torments, as if God had no other way to be Glorified, this would not Express Justice so much as Severity, if not Cruelty, as first, to Fore-see the Evil, then to make the Creature, and at last to Suffer that Evil, and to Damn the Creature for the Evil; neither, said she, can that Rational Part that God hath given me, perceive how it can stand with his Goodness and Mercy, or his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory, to Suffer more Devils, than to Make Saints; neither doth it stand with his Wisdom and Power, to have more Enemies than Friends, for Wicked men and Devils are said to be the Enemies, and Good men and Saints to be the Friends, and Servants of God; but most Men have Blasphemous Opinions, as to make God either Cruel, or Ignorant, as not to Fore-know, or else to Make to Damn. But the Lady <hi>W. N.</hi> who was also Present at their Discourse, prayed Mrs. <hi>G. B.</hi> to Break off, since Man was so Ignorant, as he Knew not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet would Pretend to Know God, and his
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100053:195"/>
Attributes, Counsels, Laws, Rules, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, also whom he Loved, and whom he Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who should be Damned, and who should be Saved, what Angels were in Heaven, and what Devils in Hell, who Served him a Right, and who Served him a Wrong way; also Man is so Presumptuous, as to Assimilize God, as also to Pretend to know what God sayes, making him to Speak like Man; also to Express him to have Passions; but if God be Absolute, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible, it is an High Presumption to Assimilize God to any Creature; besides, it is Absurd and Ridiculous to Compare that which is Incomprehensible, for if he cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, how shall he be Express'd? Also to say God's Goodness and Humanity is such, as to Bow to Man, since Man cannot Fully, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Rise to Him, for 'tis Ridiculous to think that God's Great Omnipotency, or Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibility, can either Bow, Submit, or Humble it self; for God cannot Lessen himself, no more than Heighten himself, for he cannot be More nor Less, there are no Degrees in God, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, nor Dilatations, for he is all Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Indeed he is that which no Creature can tell, but something that is too Great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be Declared, his Works are only a Glimpse of his Might; yet Proud Men call themselves God's Friends; O Foolish and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Men!

               <p>I Am so full of Fear, as I write this Letter with great Difficulty, for all this City hath been in an Uproar, and all through a Factious Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the Common Council, and those they call the Lords, which are the Higher Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, the Common People gather together in Multitudes, Pretending for the Right of their Privileges, but it is thought the Design is to Plunder the Merchants Houses, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by the last they seem to Regard, and Covet more the Goods of the World than Heaven; indeed the World makes men apt to Forget Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as loving Mammon more than God; the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100053:197"/>
truth is, they have Plunder'd one of the Chief Magistrates, and were hardly kept from Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Bishop, which Act Expresses their Covetousness, and Divulges their Designs; and this Disorder causes the Trumpets to Sound, the Drums to Beat, the Souldiers to Arm, and the Women to Weep, and to make it the more Fearful, the Great Bell, which is only Rung in time of Danger, either in cases of Fire, or War, or Mutinies, or the like, sounds Dolefully, all which makes me Tremble Fearfully, and that which increases my Fear the more, is, that my Maids being possess'd with the like Fear, come often to me with Masker'd Faces, and tell me Divers, and Different Reports, some, that the Army is coming to Destroy the City, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the Souldiers have liberty to Abuse all the Women, others, that all in the City shall be put to the Sword; the Best Report is, that all shall be Plunder'd, but for this last, my Husband and I am safe, for we are Plunder-Free, having had all our Goods and Estate taken from us in our own Country, so that now we have no such Goods or Wealth as is worth the Taking; the truth is, we are rather in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Plunder, than to be Plunder'd, so that if they will but spare our Persons and Lives, I fear not our Goods, the only Misery is, that we cannot well go out of this City, by reason we have here some Credit to take up Monies, or Provisions, in time of Necessity, for my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath Lived here so Long, as he can Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

the Privilege of a Burger, and therefore we may rise up with the Tumult, and cry out Mutinously for our Rights and Privileges. But for all this I am Extremely Afraid, insomuch that at every Noise I hear, if I be not with my Husband, I run to find him out, so that I write this Letter but by Starts, yet my Husband en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Allay my Fears, telling me, that the Beating of Drums, and Blowing of Trumpets, and Arming of Souldiers, is the Way and Means to Quiet this Mutiny, and to keep us in Peace and Safety, but for all that, I hear my Husband say, that it is a Scurvy Business, and a Dangerous Example; Howsoever, I leave all to his Prudence and Care; for I believe, if he did perceive any great Danger, he would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me out of the City, but then he must Go with me, for I will not Part from him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding not my Safety when he is in Danger, and I had rather Die with him than Live after him.

Excellent Works quite out of Tune and Time, neither Humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sense nor Words, but alwayes persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same Tune, which was Dull, and Flat, and made my Sense of Hearing as Dull as his Reading, but yet it was better than if he had made a greater Noise in his Reading, for that would have put me beyond all Patience, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or VVounding my Ears, which would have Discomposed my Thoughts extremely, for my Thoughts live so Peaceably and Silently, and take such Delight therein, as they Hate a Noise; but in truth I never heard any man Read VVell but my Husband, and have heard him say, he never heard any man Read VVell but <hi>B.

               <p>THe Lady <hi>F. N.</hi> and her Pretty Young Daughter had th' other day a Quarrel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as her Mother intended to Whip her, but she Disputed so well for her self, as her Mother Forgave her Fault, and the chief Cause of the Forgiveness was, that she told her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she had rather be Racked as a Traitor, than be Whip'd as a Slave, although, said she, I have neither Committed Treason, nor Deserved Thraldome or Slavery; besides, said she, I am Ten years of Age, too Old to be Whip'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Old enough for an Husband; but whilst the Daughter and Mother were Disputing, in came the Father, and Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> who found her Weeping, but they Comforted her, saying, they came Purposely to Save her; she told them, that as long as she was in her Mothers Power, she was subject to be Whipped; Sir <hi>W.

S.</hi> said, she was too Young for a VVife; the Father told him, that Three or Four years would make her Old enough; he said, not for him, for he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100053:199"/>
be a Nurse, nor a Tutor, for he knew VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not Capable to be Instructed, until they were Thirteen or Fourteen years of Age, and then they must have some time to Learn, Seven years at least, neither can they Keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they ought; but when I Marry, said he, I will Marry a VVife of such an Age, as hath been Instructed both to know Good and Evil, to know Evil by Relation, and Good by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; such a one as can be a Companion, and is not a Nursling; such a one as can Converse Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and not one that can speak a VVitty VVord or two by Chance, as Children do; such a one as may bring me Strong, Healthful Children, not Children that will be Children all the time of their Lives, if they Live, as being Infirm, VVeak, and Sickly; or else do Die as soon as they are Born, and from the VVomb, go into the Grave; and to have a VVife that is fit for Breed and Conversation, she must be Two or Three and Twenty at least; the truth is, said he, I had rather Marry a VVife of Four-score, than of Fourteen, for I could take more Content to Admire Antiquity, or to Listen to an Aged Sybil, or Read in an Old Chronicle, than to Play with a Baby, to Listen to a Parrat, or to Read the Horn-book, there being so much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Youth and Age; but when I Marry, said he, I will Marry a VVife that's near to my own Age, for if I Marry a VVife much Younger than my self, I shall be Jealous of her, and if I Marry one much Older than my self,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100053:200"/>
my VVife will be Jealous of me, so as we shall be Unhappy either wayes; besides, in Unequal Ages Men and their VVives are apt to Upbraid one anothers Age, but when their Age is Equal, neither hath Cause to Dislike each others, and for the most part in Equal Ages are Equal Loves, and Fearless Lives, as neither of them is Jealous, and if we have Equal Strength and Constitutions, we shall not Out-live one another Long, nor Wish one anothers Death, nor grow Weary of one anothers Life; but I will, if you will Consent, Keep your Daughter as a Baby, or a Toy for a Closet, but not take her for a Wife, to Govern my House and Family; by my Faith, said her Father, she shall be no Toy, if I can help it, but if you will take her for a VVife, I will give her ten Thousand Pound, and if I have no more Children, I will Double, or Treble it; said Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> I am Content, for though she be too Young to Govern my Family, I am Old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Dispose of her Wealth, and for Society and Conversation, I know no better Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no better Governour, nor no better Friend than Mony, it is Beloved of every one, but Loves no man, so as I shall not Fear Mony will Cuckold me, it will rather Bawd for me, and so for Love to Mony I will take your Daughter to VVife; VVhereat her Father said he should have her, and so much Mony too.

end of the String, and when they had an Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to lay by their Muffs, they flung them behind their Backs, which seems like as Poor, Beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souldiers Knapsacks, or as Tinkers Budgets, and the String about their Neck seems like as if they were going to be Hang'd for Stealing some Bread and Cheese, or for Robbing an Apple-Orchard, or for Stealing Ragged Linnen off the Hedges, or some such Petty, or VVorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less things; But Men are as Inconstant in their Fashions as VVomen, if not more, so as it is to be hoped they will Change to a more Manly Fashion than Muffs, and a more Handsome Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Boot-hose tied up to their short Breeches, which Boot-hose about the Knees appear like Wens, and Swell'd Sores ready to be Lanced, to let out the Corruption that is Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered therein; truly, to me it would appear more seemly for VVomen to wear Swords, than Men to wear Muffs, for Women, though Weak, and Unskilful to Handle and Use a Sword, yet had they Courage, they might make a shift to Assist an Assaulted Friend, or to Protect their Honour against Violation, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Muff doth as it were Tie up a Mans Hands, and is a Hinderance either to Assault or Defend. But Women have no Occasion to wear Swords, for they are Protected by the Civil Laws of all Nations, besides, all Noble Gentlemen are Guards to the Female Sex, and for the Assistance of Friends, there be few that are Assaulted in their own Houses, and Women are not suffered
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100053:204"/>
to Fight in the VVar; neither are they Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for Seconds, nor is it fit they should be in Drunken Quarrels; and as for Thieves, it is an Old Saying, Thieves are too Strong for True men, for Thieves will seldom Assault One, under Two or Three, not but that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to do their Endeavour to Assist a Friend in Distress, though they were sure to do them no Good, but their striving to Help must do them no Hurt, by hindering them to Help themselves; as for Example, some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that see an Enemy Assault their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Sons, Father or Brother, or are by when they Quarrel with any other Man, will in a Fright take hold of their Friends, thinking to Pull them from Hurt, whenas that holding may be the Cause of their being Kill'd, as not being suffered to Defend themselves. Thus may their Loving Fear be the Cause of their Death; but I have wandered too far, from Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and VVomen, to Swords and Death; wherefore leaving all to Fates and Fashions, I rest,</p>

               <p>I Hear by your last Letter, that the Lady <hi>H. W.</hi> doth Entertain a Maid-servant that hath lately Served in my House, and therefore desires you to write to me, to send her word whether she was a Good Servant when she Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and whether she was Trusty and Chast; first, she must Excuse me, for I will not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise a Servant out of my Service, unless it were as a Punishment to some Notorious Faults; for Servants may be Better and Worse in Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Services, according to the Several Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Places, or Labours they are Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; for some Servants may be very Proper and Fit, Industrious, and Prudent in some sorts of Places or Labours, as to be Excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and in others be very Ill Servants, so as it may be the Fault of the Master or Mistress not to Imploy them Properly, or that perhaps such Places which are Proper for such a Servant are Supplied; and perchance a Servant may See his own Errours, and Repent the Faults Committed in one Service, as not to do the like in another, so as it may be Injustice for a Master or Mistress to Dispraise a Servant, which may prove to his Ruin, as to hinder him from a Good Service; Neither ought a Master or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100053:205"/>
to give a Servant an Undeserved Praise, for that were to speak Untruth, besides, it would be a Cheat to Prefer a Servant with a False Report, or to Cozen a Master with a Servants Undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Praise, like as Tradesmen do put off Ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities upon their Word, that they are Good, and the Buyer relying upon the Sellers Word, as believing him to be a True Speaker, is Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened; nay, if the Wares be Good, Praise is their Due, but yet Sellers must Speak their Praise but of that which they have found Good and Serviceable in them; wherefore the best way is to let every Master or Mistress prove their Servants by their Services. The next is, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>H. W.</hi> would know whether she be Trusty and Chast? As for Trust, I Intrust my Servants as Little as I can, but just what of Necessity I must, for there is an Old Saying, that in Trust lies Treason, and I will not Tempt, or Inable them to be Traitors, if I can Avoid it; As for the Chastity of my Servants, I do not Inquire what Constitution they are of, but what Service they are fit for in my Houshold Affairs; neither am I Porter, or Spy of my Maids Lower Parts, it is too Foul an Office or Imployment for any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress; but if I hear they do not Demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Good and Honest Servants ought, in an Honourable, Govern'd House, they have Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Gone, paying them such Wages as their Bargain was. But the truth is, though my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is pleased to make me Mistress of his House &amp; Houshold-servants, yet I seldom take any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:100053:206"/>
or turn them away, for I have an Under-Officer as my Lieutenant-General, which is the Governess of my House, &amp; she receives my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Orders, and Executes the Particular Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Affairs, which belongs to the Government of a Mistress that hath a Master, which is a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

her Beauty was likely to Last, being more in Favour than Colour, for indeed she had Extraordinary Well-favour'd and Pleasing Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in her Face, but now they are Alter'd, &amp; that in Few Years, which shews, Time was more Spiteful &amp; Mischievous to her Face, than it Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is to others, &amp; as Time was Spiteful to her, so was also Fortune, for she is yet Unmarried, and begins now to be Melancholy, some say, for want of a Husband; for indeed most Maids ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a great Misfortune to live Long Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, it seems they Know not, or will not Believe the Cares and Troubles that Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Married Life; but perchance her Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly may proceed from the Decay of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, seeing her self Neglected, and not Regarded, for now when she goes to Church, not any body takes a Particular Notice of her, by which we may observe, that Flourishing Beauties are like as Flourishing Favorites, Admired, Flattered, and Followed for the time they are in Favour; or like Conquering Generals, being Famous whilst they gain Victories, but if Fortune Frowns, they are Neglected, if not Despised, the like for Beauty when Faded; and Fortune for the most part is an Enemy to Beauty, for she doth not so often Advance the Owners, as those that are but Indifferent.

               <p>YOu Express'd in your last Letter, that Sir <hi>W.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:100053:209"/>
had Wit, and were Wise, there would be no Fools; but Mankind is not only Foolish, but False, I mean most Men, in truth there is no Trust in them, concerning which I have heard my Husband say, that the Wisest thing for this VVorld is, to Believe as Little as a man can, and for the next VVorld, to Believe as Much as a Man can; indeed, Facility and Credulity in this World, are great Enemies to a man's self, for they often Betray him into Misfortune and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness, at least into great Errors and Follies, for which he is never Pitied, but Scorned. But I will write you my Husbands Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Natures of Men, in his own words; said he, The Disposition of Mankind for the most part is such, as you shall seldom see them Smile or Laugh, but at the Follies or Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of other Men, which shews they have so much Love for Themselves, as they have no room left for Others, nay, you shall hardly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with any speaking of other men, but they will find some Fault or other with them, for finding Fault shews they could Mend it, and by that means they think they cry themselves up still for the Wiser, nay, you shall meet with Few Discoursing of others, but they will lay Load on them, even sometimes to Railing, though they never Offended them, which shews most Extreme Ill Natures, and if they do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, it is very Coldly, saying, He hath his Faults for all that as well as other men, and the Epilogue of their Discourse is, He hath Rare
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100053:209"/>
Parts, but for this, and but for that, and but for the other; but if they hear any thing to a man's Prejudice, how Rejoyced they are, and will Believe it presently, though it be never so Improbable, and bring Reasons to Fortifie the Prejudice; and if it be any thing to a Mans Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation, they will Pull it down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently by Detracting, saying it is Impossible it should be so, and Fortifie it with the best Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they have: Certainly they think other Mens Faults make them Virtuous, though they have ten times more Faults themselves; but surely their Faults do not Glorifie them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept others would take Warning by them not to Do the like, which I dare Answer for, they will not. But every Man hath his Weak and his Strong Side, and if he do Compare himself with another, he doth it not Justly, for he Compares his Strong Parts with the other mans Weak Parts, and it seems Truth when so Compared, and makes him Proud, but did he Compare his Weak Parts with the other's Weak Parts, and his Strong Parts with the other's Strong Parts, truly I doubt then he would be much out of Countenance. But some have no Strong Parts to Compare, and yet will Rail on others, and that is Craftily done, to Pull down others, to make them Equal to themselves, and then they are as Fine men as any; but I will, said he, End my Discourse with a Saying of that Noble Sir <hi>Philip Sidny,</hi> concerning those that will; says he, Hath a man any Good thing in him? Love him for that,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100053:210"/>
for there are many that have none, and One Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or Good Quality, is worth a Thousand Vices, and I can make a Benefit of his Good, and leave his Vices to him to Mend, without Playing the part of his Schoolmaster; which was most VVisely, Nobly, and Honourably said. By this, Madam, we may perceive, though Mankind is Generally Bad, yet some Particulars are VVise, VVitty, Good, and Noble, and I wish for the sake of Mankind all were so, but though this cannot be hoped, yet I am,</p>

I answer'd, I would not be Forced, neither with Pain, nor Death; said they, this was Easie to Say so, but Hard to Do it; I replyed, it was true, but yet there have been Examples, that Resolution and Patience

               <p>MY Imployment continues as yet, which is, to read <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives, and amongst the rest, I find Described the Life of <hi>Cato Uticensis,</hi> whose Story, if true, makes me love the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this <hi>Cato,</hi> for his Courage, Honesty, and Wisdom, and for the Love to his Country; but yet I cannot Allow his Death for the Love of his Country, for surely he Mistook the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and Ground of his Love; for put the case <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> had been alive when his Son did Conquer <hi>Persia,</hi> and he seeing his Son follow the Fashions of the <hi>Persians,</hi> should have Kill'd himself for the Change of Fashions, from the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to the <hi>Persians,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was from a Worse to a Better) or he should have kill'd himself, if the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100053:212"/>
of <hi>Macedonia</hi> should have been Changed into the Laws and Customs of the <hi>Persians,</hi> although it might have made the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> Flourish the more, and be more Happy and Peaceable; or put the case a man that hath been Born and Bred in this Country, and should chance to be carried into <hi>Turky,</hi> as there to live, should Kill himself for Changing Countries, although he neither Changed his Religion, nor lived in less Safety, Peace, or Plenty, and had all his Friends near, and round about him; or if one of the States should make himself Monarch, all the rest should Kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, having as much Plenty, and Prosperity, and more Safety than they had, this would seem Strange, and like a Lunacy, as a Defect of Reason, indeed a mere Madness. The same is with <hi>Cato,</hi> for he perceiving his Country was like to be Govern'd as a Monarchy, which was before a Republick, Kill'd himself, although he knew the old Government was so Corrupted, as it caused great Riots, Tumults, Seditions, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Slaughters, Killing and Murdering even in the Market-place, so as it could not be Worse what Chance soever came, but was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable a Change of Government might make it more Peaceable and Safe; wherefore <hi>Cato</hi> did not Kill himself for the Peace and Safety of his Country, but for the Government, as choosing rather to have it Governed Ill by the Old way, than to have it Govern'd VVell another way; but if the Change of Government had been like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to Alter their Religion, to Destroy their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to Torture their Friends, to Disperse the Ashes of their Dead Ancestors, and to Pull down their Monuments, and his Country to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, Possess'd, Ruled and Governed by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he had Chosen Well, to have Voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Died, rather than to Live to see those Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Calamities and Destructions, but he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Country fell unto the Government of a Noble Native, who had Conquer'd many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Inlarge it, and Brought in much Wealth to Inrich it, and many Vassals to Serve it, and had not only Courage, but Power and Skill to Protect it, Prudence and Justice to Rule and Govern it, and Clemency and Tenderness to Love it, and yet <hi>Cato</hi> to Kill himself, because <hi>Caesar</hi> was to be Chief in it, was strange; yet howsoever <hi>Cato</hi> did Nobler to Kill himself, than those that Killed <hi>Caesar,</hi> for <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death shew'd only a Dislike to the Change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not a Hate to the Man that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereas the Murderers of <hi>Caesar</hi> shew'd more an Envy to the Governour, than a Dislike to the Government; But the Wisest men may Err sometimes, so did <hi>Cato</hi> in his Death in my Opinion; Wherefore leaving Honest <hi>Cato</hi> to Honourable Fame, I rest,</p>

               <p>TO give you a Relation of the Four Rich Widows, as you desired me in your last Letter, is, that one of them seems Grave and Formal, the other Jolly and Merry, the third Sad and Sighing, the fourth seems neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Merry, nor very Sad; The first Mourns Ceremoniously, and all her Family, the second Mourns after the <hi>French</hi> Mode, the third Mourns Dolefully, as to sit in Darkness, the fourth Regards not what Mourning she wears; the first keeps an Hospitable House, and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all Company, the second goes to all Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings, and is Entertained, the third Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Condoling Visits, the fourth follows her dead Husbands Will, and endeavours to Execute his Living Desires, which he would have Performed when Dead; the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Wise Widow, the second a Brave Widow, the third a Sorrowful Widow, the fourth a Good Widow. Now to give my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, I cannot, for Women cannot be Judged of, their Natures being past finding out, for a Woman cannot Guess at her self, should she Study all her Life time; the truth is, our Sex is so Various and Inconstant, that the Length of Time cannot Prove us, no not Death it self, for a Woman may Die in a Humour,

               <p>THe Four Rich VVidows I formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a Letter to you, give me leave now to tell you, one of them is Married again, and another of them is Dead; the Sighing, VVeeping VVidow is Married to a man that was an Under-officer of her Former Husband's, but I know not why she should Marry him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less out of Charity, for he is miserably Poor, neither hath he such VVorth and Merit as her former Husband had, also he is reported to be Debauch'd, if so, it is likely he will love his Pleasures better than his VVife, and will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with her Estate; wherefore 'tis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, she will have as much cause to VVeep and Mourn for her Second Marriage, as for the Death of her First Husband. But the Good VVidow is Dead, and in the time of her Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I went to Visit her, and being with her, I
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:100053:214"/>
told her I was sorry she was so Ill, she answer'd me, that she was never so Well since her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Died, for I account my self Well, said she, when my Mind is free from Trouble, although my Body be Sick; for when my Body was in Health, my Mind was Sick with Discontented Thoughts, that Nature should make me of a Longer Life than my Husband, but now, said she, I am near a Perfect Health both in Mind and Body, for in Death there is no Sickness, and this Sick Body of mine, is but as a Medicine to a Perfect Cure; I told her, it Proved her Love to her Husband was a Firm Love, as to Continue to Death; I hope, said she, to Continue in Death as much as to Death; but, said she, my Love to my Husband was not only a Matrimonial Love, as betwixt Man and Wife, but a Natural Love, as the Love of Brethren, Parents, and Children, also a Sympathetical Love, as the Love of Friends, likewise a Customary Love, as the Love of Acquaintance, a Loyal Love, as the Love of a Subject, an Obedient Love, as the Love of a Servant, a Moral Love, as the Love to Virtue, an Uniting Love, as the Love of Soul and Body, a Pious Love, as the Love to Heaven, all which several Loves did Meet and Intermix, making one Mass of Love, but Death seized on this Treasure of Love, and left me Poor, and having no more such Love in Store, it made my Life to Pine away, like those that Starve for Want, but now, said she, Death hath Invited me to a Feast of Joyes; with that she turned her head and Died.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100053:214"/>
As for the other two Widows, <hi>viz.</hi> the Formal and Grave, and the Merry and Gay Widow, they are neither Married nor Dead, they Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Courtship before Marriage, and will use all means to keep back Death; the Formal Widow loves to be Courted <hi>incognito,</hi> the Gay Widow takes a Pride to have Publick Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, both taking Pleasure in Variety of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or rather Flatterers. By this you may know that the one Widow hath done Foolishly, the two others Wickedly, the last Died Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly.

               <p>GIve me leave to tell you, that I write this Letter with no Small Difficulty, for though I sit so near the Fire, as I have Burn'd a part of my Clothes, yet the Cold is so Furious, as it doth not only Freez the Ink in the Standish, but in the Pen I am writing with, so that I am but a Cold Writer, nay, the very Thoughts seem to be Frozen in my Brain, for they Love very Slowly, as if they were Stupified, only my
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100053:215"/>
Love to your Ladiship keeps Warm in my Heart; indeed, your Love doth help to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Fire of Life; I know not how Cold it is at the Poles, for I never was there in Person, but in my Imagination yet, it cannot be Colder there, than it is here at this present time; for my part, I could almost think, that this Cold hath Travell'd from the Poles hither, but this thought of mine would be Contradicted through two Reasons, the One, that Cold Moves Slowly, although to bring Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Reason, it seems Probable that Cold is very Quick, for it catches every Mankind by the Fingers, and by the Noses, as Soon as it comes near them, even as Soon as Burning Fire would do, and much Sooner; the Other Reason is, that Cold in the Long Journy would get it self a Heat, and so Wast by the way; but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these Reasons, Though the Senses know not from what Places, or Parts, Cold comes, or what it Causes, yet they know that we have here at this time Cold with all its Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Strength, as an Army of Flakes of Snow, with Ammunition of Hail for Bullets, and VVind for Powder, also Huge Ships of Ice, which Float in the Main Sea, and Stop up all the Narrow Rivers; also Cold and its Army Shooting forth the Peircing Darts, which fly so Thick and Fast, and are so Sharp, as they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into every Pore of the Flesh of all Animal Creatures, whereby many Animals are Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Numbness, and Die Insensibly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:100053:215"/>
Mankind bring what Strength they can get against Cold, as an Army of Furs, where every Hair stands out like a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Pikes, to Resist Cold's Assault; and Ammunition of Coals serves for Bullets, and Ashes for Powder, with great Loggs for Cannons, Billets for Muskets and Carbines, Brush Faggots for Pistols, where the Bellows as Fire-locks, make them fly up in a Flame; also great Pieces of Beef for Ships for Men of VVar, with Cabbage for Sails, Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages for Tacklings, Carrots for Guns, and Marrow-bones for Masts, Ballasted with Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Pitch'd or Tarr'd with Mustard, the Card and Needle being Brewis and Neats Tongues, the Steers-men Cooks, besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pinnaces of Pork, Mutton, and Veal, and Flying Boats, which are Turkies, Capons, Geese, and the like, all which Swim in a Large Sea of VVine, Beer, and Ale; yet for all this we are Beaten into the Chimney-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and there we sit Shaking and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling like a Company of Cowards, that dare not stir from their Shelter; and many in the Sea-fight have been Drowned, from whence some have been taken up Dead-Drunk, then carried and Buried in a Feather-bed, where, after a Long Sleep, they may have a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but how they will be Judged at that time they Rise, whether Damned with Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or Saved by Excuse, I cannot tell.

then the Mistress appears like a Pale Ghost, or Dead Body in a Winding sheet, being all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with white Snow, and the Sled, when the Mistress is Seated again, instead of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chair, seems like a Virgins Funeral Herse, carried, and Buried by Torch-light, and her Feathers seem like a Silver Crown, that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually is laid thereon, also the Sled is Drawn then in a Slow, Funeral Pace, for fear of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Fall.

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100053:218"/>
not according to their Appetites, but according to the Time, by reason Lent is only for Fish, or other such Cold and Spare meat, and therefore they Prudently will Surfet of Flesh this Shrove-tide, that they may not Covet Flesh, as to have a Longing desire thereto; also there Sporting is after the same kind and like for the same End, by reason they are to Pray as well as to Fast, like as those that will, or think it Lawful to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what Sins they can, or please, before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Penance and Pardon; But truly, these are Harmless Sports, consisting only in several Attires, or Accoustrements, as to wear Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, &amp;c. and some of the Women do Accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre themselves in Mens Habits, and the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort of Men in Womens Habits, where the Women seem to be well Pleased, and take a Pride to be Accoustred like Men, but the Men seem to be more out of Countenance to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coustred like Women, as counting it a Disgrace to their Manhood, although they do not seem so, being dress'd in the most Ill-favour'd dress that can be Devised, to Imitate Devils, but whether they Imitate them Rightly for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form, I know not, for I believe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were in Hell to Learn, or Know how Devils are Formed, or Bodied, or Accoustred, I believe they may Sooner, and more Aptly Imitate their Wickedness than their Figures; but these Sports I went abroad to See, being Perswaded to go forth, by reason it was very Fair Weather, and Sun-shiny Dayes, although to my Sense of

Feeling, I had Frost and Snow within me, or was as if I had been Shaken with a Cold North-wind, having a Cold Fit of an Ague upon me, which Cold and Stormy Indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Body, did Dull, and Darken the Mirth of Pleasure, as Dark Clouds do the Light of the Sun, for Health and Sickness are like Fair and Foul Dayes. But the sorts or kinds of Sports are done for this Year, and all the Men, Women, and Children, were Marked the next day, which was Ash-wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday, with a Black Mourning Cross on their Forheads, I know not whether it be to Cross out their Former Sins, or a Barricado to Keep out Following Sins, although I fear it is not in the power of a Cross to keep back Sin, I know not what it can do to keep back Punishment, but they all seem to be very Devout in Frequenting the Churches. Yet this is but the Beginning of Lent, but towards the later End, I suppose they will be as if they were half, or three parts Tired, not so much with Fasting as Praying, for though they eat not Flesh meat, yet they eat oftener other Good meats, as Fish, Spoon-meat, Sweet-meats, and the like, also they have the liberty to Drink more VVine; indeed most Christians all the Lent time, as also on many Fasting dayes in the Year, live for the manner of Diet somewhat like the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> or <hi>Gentils</hi>; But I, being not well in Health, have the liberty to Eat what
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100053:219"/>
will or can; and so leaving the Generality to their Lent-diet, I rest,</p>

               <p>TO tell you what Pastimes this City hath, they be several Sights and Shews, which are to be seen for Mony, for even Pastime is Bought; for at several times of the Year come hither Dancers on the Ropes, Tumblers, Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Private Stage-Players, Mountebanks, Monsters, and several Beasts, as Dromedaries, Camels, Lions, Acting Baboons, and Apes, and many the like, which would be as Tedious to me to Relate as to See, for I would not take the pains to See them, unless some Few; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest there was a Woman brought to me, who was like a Shagg-dog, not in Shape, but Hair, as Grown all over her Body, which Sight stay'd in my Memory, not for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness, but Strangeness, as she troubled my Mind a Long time, but at last my Mind kick'd her Figure out, bidding it to be gone, as a Dog-like Creature; and though I am of so Dull and Lazy a Nature, as seldom to take the Pains to See Unusual Objects, yet here coming an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:100053:220"/>
Mountebank, who had with him several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to Dance, and Act upon the open Stage, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so one which did Act the part of a Fool, and that all to draw a Company of People together, to hear him tell the Virtues, or rather Lies of his Drugs, Cures, and Skill, and to Intice, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to Buy, and to be Cozened and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, both in Words, Drugs, and Mony; I saw this Fool Act his Part so Well, that many of the People bought more Drugs for the Fool's sake, than for the Apocryphal Physician's, which was the Mountebank; indeed, Madam, a Fool's Part, as it is the Pleasantest, so it is the most Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to Act, I say, to Act it Well, for it doth require more Ingenuity and Wit than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part Acted on the Stage, for though the World is full of Fools, yet there are not many Feigned Fools, for most men endeavour to seem Wiser than they are, but Feigned Fools endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to seem Foolisher than they are; But where there is one Feigned Fool in the World, there are a thousand Feigned Wise men, and where there is one Professed Mountebank, or Jugler, there are thousands that are so, but will not be Known, or Thought to be so. Upon this Profess'd Mountebank's Stage, there were two Handsom Women Actors, both Sisters, the one of them was the Mountebank's, th'other the Fool's Wife, and as the Saying is, that Fools have Fortune, his Wife was far the Handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and better Actor, and Danced better than th' other; indeed she was the Best Female Actor
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:100053:220"/>
that ever I saw; and for Acting a Man's Part, she did it so Naturally as if she had been of that Sex, and yet she was of a Neat, Slender Shape; but being in her Dublet and Breeches, and a Sword hanging by her side, one would have believed she never had worn a Petticoat, and had been more used to Handle a Sword than a Distaff; and when she Danced in a Masculine Habit, she would Caper Higher, and Oftener than any of the Men, although they were great Masters in the Art of Dancing, and when she Danced after the Fashion of her own Sex, she Danced Justly, Evenly, Smoothly, and Gracefully; wherefore in this VVoman, and the Fool her Husband, I took such Delight, to see them Act upon the Stage, as I caused a Room to be hired in the next House to the Stage, and went every day to See them, not to Hear what they said, for I did not Understand their Language, &amp; their Actions did much delight my Sight, for I believe they were better than their Wit, which, as I suppose, were but some Stale, Bald Jests, and Broken Pieces, or Senseless Speeches, taken out of some Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or such like Foolish Books; But after they had been in this City some Short time (for so it seem'd to me) to my great Grief, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate Commanded them out of the Town, for fear of the Plague, which was then in the City, although some said, the Physicians through En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the Mountebank, Bribed them out; the truth is, they had Reason, for the Mountebank was then so much in Request, as most of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:100053:221"/>
People made him their Doctor, and <hi>Iaen Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> (for so the Fool was named) was their Apothecary; But they being gone, I was troubled for the Loss of that Pastime which I took in Seeing them Act; wherefore to please me, my Fancy set up a Stage in my Brain, and then brought out some Incorporeal Drugs for Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Diseases, to be Bought by Incorporeal People, and the Incorporeal Thoughts were the several Actors, and my VVit play'd the Jack Fool, which Pleased me so much, as to make me Laugh Loud at the Actions in my Mind, whereas otherwise I seldom Laugh Heartily, as the Phrase is; but after my Thoughts had Acted, Danced, and Played the Fool, some seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times of Contemplating, my Philosophical and Physical Opinions, which are as the Doctors of, and in the Mind, went to the Judgment, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Discretion, Consideration, and the like, as to the Magistrates, and told them, it was very Unprofitable to let such Idle Company be in the Mind, which Robbed the multitude of Thoughts, of Time and Treasure; whereupon the Magistrates of the Mind Commanded the Fancy-Stage to be taken down, &amp; the Thought-Actors to go out, and would not Suffer them to Cheat, or Fool any Longer; And so leaving my Mind Free of such Strangers, I rest,</p>

Use, it becomes Invisible, for though the Owner knows he hath it, yet he cannot find it, and the Purse is a Sensible Purse, for it knows as well as the Owner, to what use his Stores shall be Employed; Why, said the Lord <hi>C.

               <p>IN your last Letter you Express'd to me, that Mr. <hi>F.

he was more Artificial with Formality, than Women with Vanity, and that all Men were as much Artified as Women, and I having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, after I had read your Letter, made a Copy of Verses upon the Theme of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I confess they are not Good ones, but such as they are, I send them you, as following.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>THou Seeming Wise man, what is that to thee,</l>
                  <l>If I to Please my self, Accoustre me</l>
                  <l>According to my Mind? Must nought be worn</l>
                  <l>That doth the Body Handsomly Adorn?</l>
                  <l>If we must nothing Artificial wear,</l>
                  <l>Then go stark Nak'd, and all the Body Bare,</l>
                  <l>For if thou wear'st a Rag, though ne'r so Plain,</l>
                  <l>Yet Artificial still thou wilt remain;</l>
                  <l>Nay, if with Fig-leaves thou dost make thy
Breeches,</l>
                  <l>'Tis Artificial still, if sow'd with Stitches;</l>

                  <l>But if thou Artificial things think'st Vain,</l>
                  <l>Then like a Beast in Woods and Fields remain,</l>

                  <l>For Nature's not so Bountiful to give</l>
                  <l>All Creatures a Sufficiency to Live;</l>
                  <l>For if that Art did not Increase the Store</l>

               <p>YOu were pleased to desire me to send you word how the Poets were Feasted, and I my self amongst the rest, which was thus; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sent the Muses to Invite all the Poets to a Banquet of Wit, and Invited also me a Poetess, or rather Poetastress; I went, and entred into a Large Room of Imagination, Hung with Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Hangings of Conception, wherein were the Pictures of <hi>Ideas,</hi> in which Room were a number of Poets met, as Nature's Guests, which when I Saw, I was extremely out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as being all Men, and never a Woman but my self, insomuch as I knew not how to Behave my self, but at last, holding up my Head, which was bent downwards through Bashfulness, I saw my Lord one of the Chief Guests amongst them, which Sight gave me Confidence, insomuch as I went to him, and stood close by him, but the Muses to Oblige one of their Sex, came to me, and Saluted me, and bid me very Welcom, and after they had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:100053:226"/>
me, they Crowned every Poet there with Poetical Bayes, and Placed every one in a Chair of Celestial Flame, which had you seen, you would have thought we had been in so many Firy Chariots ready to Ascend up to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; then was every one Placed round about the Table, and we took our Places according to every ones Poetical Inspiration, but the Table we were set to, was a strange Table, for never was seen the like, it was made of all the Famous Old Poets Sculs, and the Table-cloth or Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was made of their Brains, which Brains were Spun by the Muses, for they are Spinsters of Mens Brains, as the Fates are of the Lives of Men; but these Old Poets Brains were Spun into Cobweb Threads, as Soft and Thin as Air, and then VVomen into a Piece, or VVeb, and Old Time was the VVeaver which VVeaved this VVeb like Damask or Diaper, in VVorks and Figures of Golden Numbers. Thus we see Nature Transforms Souls into Tables, and Brains into Table Coverings, the Napkins for the Hands was Pure Fine VVhite Paper, all over-wrought with Black Letters, and the Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es round about were Gilded; also there were upon the Table, Plates, Salt-sellers, Knives and Forks, the Plates were made of the Films or Drums of Sensible Ears, and the Knives that were to cut the Meat laid thereon, were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Tongues, the Trencher Salt-sellers, which were set by every Plate, were made of the Chrystalline part of Observing Eyes, and the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:100053:226"/>
Salt that was put therein, was made of Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Salt-tears, which usually Flow from a Tragick Vein, the Forks that were to bear up the Meat to the Tast of the Understanding, were Writing pens; The Table being thus Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Ordered, and the Guests set round, ready for the Feast, in came the Muses with Basons of Water, fetch'd from the Well, or Spring of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi> for the Poets to Wash before they did Eat, and after they had Wash'd, the Muses carried those Basons forth, and then brought in many several Dishes of Poetical Meats, Placing them on the Table; the first was a Great dish of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, Excellently well Dress'd, and Curious Sawce made of Metaphors, Similitudes, and Fancies, and round the Sides or Verges of the Dish, were laid Numbers and Rimes, like as we use on Corporeal Dishes and Meats, to lay Dates, or Flowers, or Slices of Limmons, or the like; then was there a Dish of Songs, brought by the Lyricks, it was very Delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meat, and had a most Sweet Relish, it was Dress'd vvith a Compounded Savvce of many several Airs, Notes, and Strains; then vvere there tvvo Dishes of Epigrams, I think one of them was <hi>Martial</hi>'s, for they were Powdered, or Brined Highly with Satyrical Salt, the other Dish was so Luscious with Flattery, as I could not Feed much thereon; then there vvas a Dish of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithalamiums, but that Meat vvas Dress'd so Strong and Rank, as it vvas Nauseous
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:100053:227"/>
to me; then there was a Hash of Anagrams, Letters, and Names, Hashed, or Minced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I did not like it; then there was a Dish of Funeral Elegies well Drest, but it was so Sad and Heavy Meat, as I durst not Feed much thereon; then there was a Dish of Comedies, Excellently well Drest, with Scenes, the Sawce was Compounded, but very Savoury, being Compounded of divers Humors, and the Dish Graced or Garnished with Smiles and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the next dish to that were Tragedies, but those were Drest as we Dress Corporeal Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Mutton, or Venison, in the Blood, Stuff'd with Sighs, as the other with Herbs, and Salted with Tears. Then came an Olio, or Bisk of Characters, and after that was a Dish of Morals, which is a Meat more Wholsome than Pleasant, the Chief Sawce was Temperance, but it was mix'd with other several Virtues and Passions; then was a Dish of Natural Philosophy, a Dish I love to Feed on, although the Meat is very Hard, and not Easily to be Digested; it is Drest with Divers and Different Compounds and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, as the four Elements, and all manner of Vegetables and Minerals, the Gold is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and the Iron or Steel is Strengthening, as also Opening Obstructions, which is very Wholsom; then there were Joynted, or rather I may say Chop'd, Animals, as Blood, Bones, and Flesh, all Chop'd, Stew'd, Boiled, and Bak'd together in their own Fat or Grease; this Dish was so Great and Full, as it might have Fed
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:100053:227"/>
Numbers, indeed it was an Infinite Hash, and an Infinite deal of Meat; then there was a Grand Sallet of Rhetorick, with Oyl of Eloquence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Bag-pudding of Sciences, made of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Cream, Logistical Eggs, and Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spices, which were Strewed as Thick as the Stars of the Skie; Likewise a Great Pie of Arts, Made, or Rais'd by Prentices, and Bak'd in the Oven of Time, Heated with the Fire of Labour, and was seven years a Baking, the Crust was Hard, Strong, and Thick; then there was a Quelquechose of Rallery, but whatsoever the Meat was, the Sawce was Naught, for it was made of Ingredients, as bad as Poor People Dress their Corporeal Meat with, as Lamp-oyl, Dead Vinegar, Rotten Pepper, and Stinking Garlick, as Foolish Jests, Dull, Spiteful Replies, Rude Familiarity, often Repetitions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, so as there was Sweet, Bitter, Sour, and altogether Mix'd, of this Dish I Tasted not, I was Sick at the Presence of it; as for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, it was Musick of all sorts, Sweet, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious; the Drink we had at this Feast was Animal Spirits instead of Sack, and Vital Spirits for Rhenish Wine, but when we had Feasted as much as we would, or could, we Rose from the Table, saying a Grace of Thanks to Nature, and intending to take our Leaves, but the Muses per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded us to walk up to the Top of <hi>Pernassus</hi> Hill, to Digest our Feast, lest we should Surfet, and when we came up to the Top of the Hill, we saw round about a most Pleasant Prospect of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:100053:228"/>
Nature's Works, but because we should see Farther than her Ordinary Work, the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses gave every one a Prospective Glass, where we saw other Worlds, Creatures, and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stials, but some saw not so Far, or so Much as others, not but that the Prospective Glasses were all of an Equal Goodness, but some had not so Good an Eye-sight as others; and after we had walked down the Hill, every one took his leave of the Muses &amp; Departed, but the Lyrick, and the Comick Muse did so Imbrace and Kiss my Lord, as they made me almost Jealous, for though all the Muses made Civil and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Addresses to him, yet not so Pleasant, and so Galliard as these two were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I made the more Hast to Depart, that I might Separate my Lord from them, and so returning home to my House, I rest,</p>

Affection to you, for certainly my Love for you is more than a Sisters Love, nay, such a Love, as when I Lived with you, it could not choose but be somwhat Troublesome, by reason my Love was Accompanied with such Fears, as it would neither let you Rest, Pray, nor Eat in Quiet, for though it was a Watchful Love, yet it was a Fearful Love, for I remember I have oftentimes Waked you out of your Sleep, when you did Sleep Quietly, with Soft Breathing, fearing you had been Dead, and oftener have I laid my Face over your Mouth, to feel if you Breath'd, insomuch as I have kept my Self Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to Watch your Sleeps, and as Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some I was to you concerning your Feeding, as I was in your Sleeping, for I was Afraid that that which was to Nourish you, should Kill you, and I remember, I was so doubtful of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Meat you did eat, as you were used to tell me, I was <hi>Sancapancha</hi>'s Doctor; Neither could I let you Pray in Quiet, for I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Knock'd at your Closet door, when I thought you were Longer at your Prayers than Usual, or at least, I did think the time Longer, so as I could not forbear to ask you how you did, and whether you were Well, and many the like Impertinencies which my Extraordinary Love Troubled you with, of which Trouble you are now Quit, living so far asunder; But though I am too far off to Watch, yet I Pray for your Health and Long Life, and though I thought it was impossible I could Love any
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:100053:229"/>
Creature better than you, yet I find by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I do, for since I am Married, I Love my Husband a Degree above you, yet howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my several Affections are like God and Nature, both Infinite, and if Love Lives in the Soul, and the Soul never Dies, my several Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may be Eternal. But you may say, if my Love was so Troublesome to you, what is it to my Husband? I must tell you, I have some more Discretion now than I had then, and though Extraordinary Love will hardly Allow, or Admit Discretion, yet Reason doth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Love, and brings many Arguments not to be Impertinently Troublesom; but though I do not ask my Husband so many Impertinent Questions as I did you, yet my Love to him is not less Watchful, Careful, and Fearful, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, if more can be, and all the Powers and Endeavours of my Life are ready to Serve him and you, only he must be Served first, which I am confident you will take no Exception at, but Approve of, for you are a Wife, and know what the Love to a Husband is, and so leaving you to your Beloved Husband, I rest,</p>

                  <hi>Dear Sister</hi> Ann,</p>
               <p>I Cannot Advise you to Marry, unless Men's Souls, Minds, and Appetites, were as Visible to your Knowledge as their Persons to your Eyes, for though there may be much Deceit even in Outward Forms, or Aspects, yet not so much, but (if there be Defects) there will be some Appearance, but the Defects of the Mind, Soul, or Appetites, may be so Obscured, as not to be Perceived till you find you are Unhappy by them; indeed there is so much Danger in Marrying, as I wonder how any dare Venture, yet there is less Danger for Women than Men, by reason a Man may receive a Fix'd Disgrace both to himself and his Posterity, by the Wifes Adultery, where the Wife can receive no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour if she be Honest and Chast; but though she can receive no Dishonour by her Husband's Adultery, yet she may be very Unhappy by his Opposite Disposition, Cross Humours, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Passions, which Antipathy may not only be a Hindrance to the Peace of this Life, and Tranquillity of the Mind, but Indanger the Glory of a Future Life, for Mankind is apt from the Troubles of their Minds, to Curse Fortune, and to Murmur against Heaven, unless they have a Supernatural Patience; besides, Men are most
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:100053:230"/>
apt to run into Vices in a Discontented Humor, and are alwayes Wandering Abroad to Divert their Home-Disquiets, not that they need to go out of Doors to Seek Vice, for Vice Dwells in most Houses or Families, but that by going into many Houses or Families, they may take Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from every one, for Vice many times is Multiplied by Acquaintance, I mean General Acquaintance, not Particular Societies; but I speak not this, as Believing you can be Infected, being Secured by the Antidote of Virtue, the Spirit of Grace, and the Balsam of Honour, which Nature, Heaven, and Education gave you; but though you cannot be Infected, yet should you seek Diversion by much Company, being of the Female Sex, you might be Suspected; Neither will I have you think by this Discourse, as if I did not Approve of Marriage, for if you do, you Mistake me, there being no Life I Approve so well of, as a Married Life, where as much Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy Joyns Souls, and Affection Hearts, as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony Joyns Hands; but to live with Antipathy must needs be very Unhappy, and if you be so, there is no way to Help your self, for if you be once Tied with the Matrimonial Bond, there can be no Honourable Divorce but by Death, for all other Divorces are Marked with some Disgrace, either more or less, and the Least Disgrace is too Much; wherefore, if you Marry, choose a Husband rather by the Ear than the Eye, for the World seldom gives an Undeserved Praise, but often Detracts from the Deserver, for it seldom
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:100053:230"/>
gives Merit its Due; But the Safest Way is to Live a Single Life, for all Wives, if they be not Slaves, yet they are Servants, although to be a Servant to a Worthy Husband, is both Pleasure and Honour, for true Affection takes more Pleasure to Serve than to be Served, and it is an Honour to Obey the Meritorious; but where there is a Hazard in the Choice, and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in not Choosing, the Best is to be Mistress of your self, which in a Single Life you are. But whether Married or not Married, my Wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Prayers are, that you may be as Happy as this World can make you, and in that I shall be a Sharer with you, as being</p>

               <p>THe last VVeek your Sister <hi>Kath'rine</hi> and your Sister <hi>Frances</hi> were to Visit me, and so well Pleased I was with their Neighbourly, and Friendly Visit, as their Good Company put me into a Frolick Humour, and for a Pastime I Sung to them some Pieces of Old Ballads; whereupon they desired me to Sing one of the Songs my Lord made, your Brother Set, and you were pleased to Sing; I told them first, I
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:100053:231"/>
could not Sing any of those Songs, but if I could, I prayed them to Pardon me, for neither my Voice, nor my Skill, was not Proper, nor Fit for them, and neither having Skill nor Voice, if I should offer to Sing any of them, I should so much Disadvantage my Lord's Poetical Wit, and your Brother's Musical Composition, as the Fancy would be Obscured in the one, and the Art in the other, nay, instead of Musick, I should make Discord, and instead of Wit, Sing Nonsense, knowing not how to Humour the VVords, nor Relish the Notes, whereas your Harmonious Voice gives their VVorks both Grace and Pleasure, and Invites and Draws the Soul from all other Parts of the Body, with all the Loving and Amorous Passions, to sit in the Hollow Cavern of the Ear, as in a Vaulted Room, wherein it Listens with Delight, and is Ravished with Admiration; wherefore their VVorks and your Voice are only fit for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Souls, and not to be Sung to Dull, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listning Ears, whereas my Voice and those Songs, would be as Disagreeing as your Voice and Old Ballads, for the Vulgar and Plainer a Voice is, the Better it is for an Old Ballad; for a Sweet Voice, with Quavers, and Trilloes, and the like, would be as Improper for an Old Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad, as Golden Laces on a Thrum Suit of Cloth, Diamond Buckles on Clouted or Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Shoes, or a Feather on a Monks Hood; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should Old Ballads be Sung so much in a Tune as in a Tone, which Tone is betwixt
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:100053:231"/>
Speaking and Singing, for the Sound is more than Plain Speaking, and less than Clear Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Rumming or Humming of a VVheel should be the Musick to that Tone, for the Humming is the Noise the Wheel makes in the Turning round, which is not like the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick of the Spheres; and Ballads are only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be Sung by Spinsters, and that only in Cold Winter Nights, when a Company of Good Huswifes are Drawing a Thread of Flax; but as these Draw Threads of Flax, so Time Draws their Thread of Life, as their VVeb makes them Smocks, so Times Web makes them Deaths Shirts, to which, as to Death, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those Good Huswifes are Married, and lie in the Bed of Earth, their House being the Grave, and their Dwelling in the Region of Oblivion; and this is the Fate of Poor Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Ballad-Singers, whenas such a Singer as you, such a Composer as your Brother, such a Poet as my Lord, are Cloth'd with Renown, Marry Fame, and Live in Eternity, wherein Death hath no Power, Time no Limit, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies Shears are Useless; but though I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Sing an Old Ballad, yet not to Dwell in Oblivion, for I love your Company so well, as I would Live in Eternity with you, and would be Clothed as you, with Renown, for no Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Garments Please me so well, and though the Stuff or Substance is not the same with yours, the Substances being as Different as the Several Qualities, Faculties, Proprieties, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100053:232"/>
or Sweet Graces, and the like, yet I will have as Good as I can get, I will Search Nature's Ware-house, or Shop, and though I cannot have a Piece or Measure of Silver Sound, or Broccaded Art, yet certainly I hope to get a Piece or Measure of Three-poil'd Philosophy, or Flower'd Fancy, for though my Lord hath taken many several Pieces or Packs out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Shop, and hath Inhaunced the Prices, yet he must not Ingross this last Commodity to himself; 'Tis true, he hath Ingross'd two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, as Weapons, and Riding, out of Art's Shop, the Hand-maid of Nature, yet sure he will be never able to Ingross all the several Kinds, and divers Sorts of Wares that Nature and Art yet have in their Store-houses. But I perceive that you three, as my Lord, You, and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do Traffick so much with Nature and Art, as I shall be but as a Pedlar; Howbeit, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have some Dealings than none at all, and I will rather Trade with Toyes, than Starve for want of a Living, and in order to make my self Capable, I have bound my self Prentice to my Lord, and am willing to Serve out my Time, but my Lord is so Generous, as to give me my Freedom, and I must also desire you to give me at present so much Freedom, as to Subscribe my self,</p>

               <p>I Am of your Opinion, that most of Mankind are of Lazy Dispositions, and love not to Trouble themselves in Publick Affairs, but though they be Lazy to the Publick Good, yet
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:100053:234"/>
they are Active and Industrious to and for their Private Pleasure, or their Particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; and though Mankind are Lazy to the Publick Good, yet they are oftentimes Active to the Publick Hurt, either for their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Covetous Ends, or many times through Envy and Malice to some Particular Person who is more Eminent than the rest, for rather than they will Suffer One to Over-top All, they will Ruin All to Pull down that One; the truth is, Men are not like Beasts, to Work to a General Profit, but like Drones, to Rob the Particular Labours in the Commonwealth; neither is it amongst Mankind as amongst Beasts, for amongst Beasts there are more Bees than Drones, but amongst Mankind there are more Drones, as I may say, than Bees, that is, there are more Unprofitable, than Good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths men; But Nature seems to be in Fault that Mankind is so Bad, for if it were only Custom, the Evil would be but in some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nations, and not throughout the whole World as it is; but as Nature hath not made all Creatures alike, for all Flies are not like the Bee, nor all Worms like the Ant, nor all Beasts like the Sheep, nor all Birds like the Nightingal; so indeed Mankind is of a mix'd Nature, and as it were a Composition of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animal Creatures, for one may perceive the Natures of other Animal Creatures mix'd in Man, and there is no Motion that belongs most Properly to other Creatures, but Man can Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate

                  <hi>Madam</hi> Eleonora Duarti,</p>
               <p>THe last time I was to Visit you, we fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Discourse of the Elixar, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Stone, you being of the Opinion that Gold might be made by the Art of Chymistry, I of the Opinion, it could not be made any other wayes than by the Natural way, as in the Earth. But it may be questionable, whether Gold is made by an Increasable way, or whether it was made all at first, and that there is no more than what was made when the World was made, for I cannot find a Reason against it, but that Gold may be as the Sun, which is Undecayable, and not Increasable, for it is to be Observed, that what is not Decayable, is not Increasable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would be Infinite in this World, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, which World, or Universe, hath no Room, or Place for Infinite, and the Sun which is Undecayable, Produces no other Suns, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it Multiply it self, nor Alter from it self; the like of Gold, we cannot make Gold to be no Gold, for Pure Gold cannot be turned into Dross, or into other Dust, whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, as Minerals, and so Vegetables, and Animals, may, and do Transmigrate, except the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is as Impossible to Fix the Elixar, as to
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:100053:235"/>
Fix the Sun. But the Difference betwixt the Sun and Gold, for the matter of Outward Form, as well as Several Effects, is, that the Sun is one Entire Body, which is Spherical, and Gold is in many several Parts, which lies in many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places in the Earth; but Stars which are of the like Undecayable Nature as the Sun, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in Several Bodies, and at Several Distances, and yet they are Stars nevertheless, and all seem to be as of one Kind or Sort, only some are Fix'd, and others Moveable; so Gold is Gold though in Several Parts, and Several Distances, only I think none is Fix'd, but what cannot be found, for though Gold is not Moveable in it self, yet it is subject to be Moved, and so may the Fix'd Stars, for any Reason to the contrary that ever I heard; And as for Effects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, as the Sun and Stars have several Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Influences upon other Creatures, yet we cannot perceive that other Creatures have Effects or Influences upon the Stars or Sun; so Gold hath an Influence, and Works several Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon other Creatures, but none upon Gold, I mean in Altring or Changing its Nature, so that Gold seems to me to be the Sun, or Stars of the Earth, which Men in these Ages Adore, as the Heathen did the Sun, and by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice one may believe men Commit Idolatry to it; and in comparison to Gold, all other Metals are like Meteors, which do Shine like Stars, but their Light goes oftentimes out, leaving a Jel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Slime, as Dross. So other Metals may be
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:100053:236"/>
Changed from what they were, as from one Metal into another, or from being Metal, but Gold cannot, at least could not as yet, be Altred by the Art of Man, so as it seems that Gold is of as Durable a Nature as the Sun or Stars; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I readily believe Gold can Increase, or Multiply it self, no more than the Sun or Stars, for any thing we can perceive; neither can I readily believe, that Gold can be Increased by the Art of Man, as by Chimistry, by reason Artificial Limbicks are not like the Natural Limbick of the Earth, nor the Fire that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists use is not like the Fire of the Sun, or the Constant Fire in the Centre of the Earth; wherefore it is not Probable, that Art should Increase Gold by a Small Artificial Limbick, and a Wasting, Uncertain Fire, which must be alwayes Renewed, and Blown, and if it be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that Art can Increase, or Multiply Gold, it is less Probable that Art can Create Gold or any other Creature, though Chymists Pretend they can, they may Imitate Nature by Art, but not Create as Nature doth; as for Natural Poets, who are far beyond Artificial Chymists, their Creation of Fancies is by a Natural way, not an Artificial, and if Gold could be Created as Fancies, Chymists would be Rich, and not so Poor as Poets are, but surely it is impossible for Art to do as Nature doth, for Art neither Knows, nor can Comprehend, at least not put in Practice, the Subtil, and Intricate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Divers Temperaments and Substances
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:100053:236"/>
put together; neither doth Art know the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Motions and Mixtures, to Create so as Nature doth, for some Creatures in Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more Curiosity than others, and some more Several, and Subtil Mixtures than others, and some require Longer Time and Pains than others, so as Man may as well believe he can Create a World, as Create Gold, or any other Creature, as Animals and Vegetables, as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists believe they can do by their Art; Men like Painters, may Draw to the Life the Figures of Creatures, but not Create Living Figures, or Real Creatures; 'tis true, Art may Hinder, or Oppose, or Hasten Nature's Works, to a more Sudden Maturity, but not in an Unnatural way; and as for Opposing, or Hindring Nature, Man may Set a Slip, or Kernel, or Seed, and when it is Fix'd, or hath taken Root, Man can Pull it up, and Dissolve it, so as not to be capable to Grow and Increase, nay, man can Dissolve it from its Nature, and Turn it into some other Nature, yet it is Natural for such Dissolvable Creatures to be Transformed into other things, so as it is but a Natural way; but Man cannot Create by Art, for that were an Unnatural way, Man may Increase and Multiply, not only his own Kind, but all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasable things, but they must be done after their Natural way, or else Man cannot Increase and Multiply. Some, as Chymists, Conceive, or Imagine (for it is but Imaginable) that there are Seeds, or Slips, or Branches of Gold, which may be Producible as Plants are, but I know not
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:100053:237"/>
where they should find them, nor do I believe if they should Search for them, they would find them, first, as not knowing where they lie, for what Man can Search all the Earth, or Fathom the Earth, or Dig to the Centre of the Earth? next, they do not Know those Branches, Slips, or Seeds to be such; thirdly, if they did Know them, and Had them, yet they Know not how, or when, or where to Set, or Ingraft those Slips or Branches, or to Sow those Seeds, or to Order them in their Limbicks; but I perceive they would make their Limbicks their Increasable Grounds, and every Limbick should be as an Acre of Ground, or a Field, indeed every Still would be worth a Lordship, nay, a Kingdom; fourthly, Man knows not the Time those Slips, Branches, or Seeds, require to be brought to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, for all Creatures are not brought to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity in the same distance of Time; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Animal Creatures, some are Produced in a Month, some in no less time than a Year; so for Plants, some are at Maturity in a Few Hours, at least Dayes, and others not under an Hundred Years, as Oaks; so for any thing we know, Gold could not be brought to Maturity under an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, nay a Thousand, Hasten Nature what they can, and nothing can be Hastened in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural way; nay, in some Creatures Art can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Hasten Nature, as Animals cannot be Hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Perfection sooner than their Natural Time, Art may cause Abortion, as to make the Womb cast forth the Burden before the Natural
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:100053:237"/>
Time of Birth, but not to bring it to Perfection, and if Man, which is Decayable and Increasable, yet is Ten Months, or say Seven, e're he comes to Maturity, well may Gold, which seems of an Unalterable, or Undecayable Nature, be Seven Ages; and though the Elements seem to be both Decayable and Increasable as Mankind is, yet not the Fix'd, or Celestial Elements, for though Fire Begets Fire, when Fuel is put to it, and goes out for want of Fuel, or may be Quenched out, (for if it did Increase and not Decrease, it would Burn all the World) and though Water be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasable (although not so Increasing as Fire) as also Decayable, as to Evaporate from its Nature, for else it would Drown the World, yet I do not perceive the Sun or the Earth to be Increasable or Decayable, for if the Sea and Earth did Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, the Terrestrial Globe would grow so Big, as the Sun could not Compass it in a Year, and it might grow so Big as not to be Compassed in Many Years; but we observe by the Motion of the Sun, that it is neither Decayable nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasable, for if it were Decayable, the Compass of the Sun would be in a Less Circle, as to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the Terrestrial Globe in Less than a Year, but whatsoever is not Decayable, is not Increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and whatsoever is Increasable is Decayable; and since we find by Experience that Gold is not Decayable, as not to be Changed from its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> from being Gold, it may be faithfully believed it is not Increasable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there would be a Word, nay Worlds of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:100053:238"/>
Gold. Thus, Madam <hi>Eleonora,</hi> I cannot perceive in my Reason, that Gold can be either Created, or Multiplied by Art, wherefore in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chymists may Break their Limbicks, and Quench out their Fire, and Endeavour to get Natural Gold a Provident way, and not to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish themselves with Art. But leaving them to their Brittle Limbicks, and Quenchable, or Decayable Fire, their Great Expences, and Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Profit, I rest,</p>

               <p>YOu may think it a Presumption and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon your Profession, to give my Opinion of Mrs. <hi>T</hi>s. Disease, but it is neither Presumption, nor Confidence of my Judgment, that causes this Writing to you, but an Affection to your Patient, who deserves my Concernment concerning her Malady, which Forces me to write to you my Opinion, which is, that I do believe her Pain and that which Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, is Caused through an Inward Heat, which Rarfies the Humors into a Fluent Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, also it Rarifies the Blood, making it to Flow, or Overflow, for Cold is not so Active, but Congeals &amp; Thickens, as we shall see when any Body is let Blood, the Blood whilst it is Hot, runs Freely forth of the Veins, and remains Thin and Fluid when it is out, but when it hath stood some Time, and begins to be Cold, it Thickens, and Congeals to a Cake; so when any hath used Exercise, which Heats, and Thins the Blood, the Colour appears in the Skin, Caused by the Flowing to the Outward Parts; the like in Hot Weather, whereas in Cold Weather, or when the Blood is not Heated, the Skin appears Pale and Lank; wherefore my Opinion is, that her Pain Proceeds from Heat, for it is to be Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that all Inflamations are Painful, as all Sores or Swellings that are Inflamed, whereas those
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:100053:239"/>
Sores that are not Inflamed, or those Swellings we call White Swellings, are not Painful, also for the Gout, the Pain is caused through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation; but mistake me not, I mean all Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Pains, for there be many other Pains, as some which are caused through Wind, and those Pains are Painful Stitches, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly caused from Hot Humours, as Bilious Choler, or some Salt Flegm, also Headaches are caused for the most part from Hot Vapours, or Rheums, the Stone in the Kidnies and Bladder is caused through Heat, so that most Pains are caused through Heat, unless it be Child-bearing Pains, and such like; and these Considerations make me believe that Mrs. <hi>T</hi>s. Pain in her Back is Produced from Heat; for although it be an Intermitting Pain, and not Constant, yet it may nevertheless be Produced from Heat; as for Example, the Gout is not a Continual Pain, but it is only Painful when the Inflamed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor falls on the Joynt, yet for the most part it alwayes Falls or Resorts to one and the same Place, wherefore I believe Cooling Medicines must be her Cure, for I do not perceive that Purging, Sweating, and Dry Dieting, which are all Heating, do her any Good, but she seems rather the Worse, and Trial is the True Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of Experience. But you may use the Old Saying to me, which is, Physician Cure thy self; I answer, that all Preachers do not Practise what they Preach, and some may give better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel than take Good Counsel, also <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:100053:240"/>
that a Wise Saying may pass through a Fool's Mouth, and the best Physicians when they are Sick, Rely not upon their own Skill for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but will send for other Physicians, for no man can Judg well of himself, either for Health, Sickness, or any other thing, by reason Partial Self-love, Fearful Doubts, Flattering Hopes, Bribe, Corrupt, or Terrifie the Judgment; but setting aside my own Judgment as Weak, either for my self or others, and Relying on yours in Case of your Patient, I rest,</p>

               <p>I Received your Letter, and am Glad to see you write, that you doubt not of Curing Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> of her Painful Disease; as for the Numbness in her Hand, Thigh, Leg, and Foot, give me leave to tell you my Opinion, which is, that it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from a Coldness but a Dryness, for if it were only a Stupifying Cold, her Sweating would have Rarified and Evaporated that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd Cold, or her Purging would have Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Driven out that Gross, Cold Humor, or her Dry, Strict Diet would have Consumed that Obstructed Cold, or Cold Obstruction, but she hath felt that Numb Disease since she hath used those Remedies, at least, it is more Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which shews, it Proceeds not from Cold,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:100053:240"/>
but Dryness, which Inward Heat and Dryness causes a Cold outward Effect, for Numbness and Deadness of Parts Proceed from Divers, and Different Causes, as from Cold, either Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, by the Cold Weather, or Climat, or Clothing, or the like, or by Inward Cold, as by Overcooling Meats, or Drinks, or Cold Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, or want of Blood, or too much Watry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which Quench out the Natural Heat, and this Numbness is easily Cured. Another Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Proceeds from Obstructions of the Inward Parts, or Veins, either by Clammy Humors, or by Burnt and Adust Humors. Another Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Proceeds from a Driness of some Particular Parts, which being Insipid, cannot be Active, or Move according to their Functions, or Faculties, or Proprieties, and a Ceasing of Motion is Death. Another Numbness Proceeds from some Cold, or Thick Gross Humors that fall upon the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news or Muscles. Another Numbness is caused through Excessive Heat, which hath Burnt out the Natural Heat. Another Numbness Proceeds from a Decay of some Noble Parts, and this Numbness is Incurable. But the Reason why I think Mrs. <hi>T</hi>s.

               <p>I Hope you will not be Angry, that I do not take your Advice to Leave the Country, and Live in the City, for I have so many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which perswade me not to do it, as this Letter cannot Compass, yet lest I should Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, I'l set down some Few: The first is, that it is more Agreeing with my Humor to live in the Country, for Naturally my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is a Solitary, Musing, and Contemplating Humor, and my Delight is, to Write those Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Conceptions which my Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth Produce; all which would be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd with the several Noises that are made in Populous Cities. The second Reason is, the Preserving of my Health, for I have not a very Strong Body, nor a very Healthful Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although, I thank God, not any Particular Disease, yet so I am, as I do not find my self so Healthful as I wish I were, and therefore a Great and Populous City is not so well agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Health, as the Sweet, and Fresh Air in the Country, where the Sun and the Wind have Freedom and Power to Disperse, and so to Destroy Malignant Vapors. The third Reason is, that my Husband had an House in the City, but by the Occasion of the Civil Wars, his Estate being Torn in pieces, amongst many Parts which are quite taken from
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:100053:242"/>
him, and his Posterity, the said House is one, so that we have no House for the present in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Live in; But if I had one, truly, Madam, I should not be willing to Live there, for I am so much pleased with a Solitary Country Life, that I cannot bring any Argument to my self, which can Induce or Perswade me to a City Life, which is but a Gossiping, and Vain Life, where there are in Conversations more Idle Words Spoken, than Good Works Done, and more Mony Spent than their Estates are able to Pay; and if I Lived there, and should not Speak Idely, and Spend Vainly, as others do, I should be out of the Fashion, and there is an Old Saying, Better be out of the World than out of the Fashion; But your Chief Argument to perswade me to Live in the City, is, that in a Great and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous City there are many Learned and Witty Persons, with whom I might Converse, whose Conversation would Increase my Knowledge, Better my Understanding, Quicken my Wit, and by Practice Refine my Speech or Language; Truly, Madam, the Advantage would be Great if I could Alter the Nature of our Sex, as not to Speak much, but that is Impossible, for all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so I amongst the rest, are more apt to Talk, than to Learn with Attention, so that I should rather Discover my Imperfections by the Superfluity of my Discourse, than gain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause by my Wit, for I, in my Conversation, Speak, as I may say, without Thinking, or rather Considering, but when I Write, I Think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:100053:242"/>
Speaking; wherefore the Wisest way for me is, rather to Write than to Speak, for then my Speech will not Disgrace my Writings; for most men Judge their Acquaintance rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Words than their Works, and those are most Applauded that are least Known, for the least Errour either in Discourse or Behaviour makes not only the Person of less Esteem, but all the Labours of their Life, were they never so Exact, Wise, or Heroick; wherefore it is a Madness to desire to Converse with much Company, especially for those that desire to keep up a Fame once gotten, unless it be in Publick Actions or Employments; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth that last, unless their Actions are like <hi>Pyramids</hi> which rise still Higher and Higher. But for the most part Man's Nature is so Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as to desire to do VVonders, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themselves with a Mean, and then their Building proves like <hi>Babels</hi> Tower, full of Confusion. But, Madam, I only desire to keep up those small Mole-hills I have made, that is, the Reputation of my Books, whereas if I did appear to the Publick VVorld, I should be found a Blind Creature as a Mole is, not Blind of the Eyes of my Head, but my Understanding, which is VVorse. And as for Conversation and Company, give me leave to tell you, Madam, I do not want a VVise, and VVitty Companion, so long as my Lord Lives, neither can I want Friends so long as you both Live, which I pray God to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:100053:243"/>
continue to many Years, for these are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Prayers of,</p>

               <p>AS I began this Book with those Letters to you, so I will End it, hoping you will Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for Mixing some other Letters with those to your self, for the Assurance and Belief of your Pardon Perswaded me to do it, they are only to my Near and Dear Relations, and Kind and Obliging Friends. But, Madam, I know your Nature and Friendship is such, that what is Fit and Convenient for me to do, you will Approve, and upon that ground, I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident you will not be Angry with me, that I do not Joyn the Answers to those Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you were pleased to Propound several Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Questions to me to Resolve, to this Book, for truly, Madam, they are so many, and my Answers to them so Long, that if I should have Joyned them to these, it would have been as a Type, or Resemblance of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature, and I am careful not to be too Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, or Wearisom to my Readers. Besides, the said Letters containing nothing but Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:100053:243"/>
Questions and Answers, are not so Fit or Proper for this Book, wherein are only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Humors; wherefore I am Resolved to put your Philosophical Questions and my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in a Book by themselves. 'Tis true, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Questions are Subtiler than I have Wit to Answer, but according to my Duty, and the Laws of Friendship, I have done as much as I was able, and more I hope you do not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and therefore, though I have not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd them so well as I should have done, and have more reason to fear rather to be Censured, than to hope for any Applause for Publishing them, yet I am satisfied that I have Answer'd your Desire, for I had rather the World should Condemn me for a Fool, than you for the Breach, or but a Neglect in Friendship, for as long as I Live I shall Prove my self,</p>
