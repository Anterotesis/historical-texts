            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Brigadier <hi>ROOKWOOD</hi>'s Paper.</head>
                  <p>HAving committed the Juſtice of my Cauſe, and recommended my Soul to God, on whoſe Mercies, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, I wholly caſt my ſelf, I had once reſolved to dye in Silence; but ſecond Thoughts of my Duty to others, chiefly to my True and Liege Soveraign King <hi>James,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to leave this behind me.</p>
                  <p>I do therefore with all Truth and Sincerity declare and avow, That I never knew, ſaw, or heard of any Order or Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> for the Aſſaſſinating the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Attacking his Guards; but I am certainly inform'd, That he, the beſt of Kings, had often rejected Propoſals of that Nature when made unto him.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I think he knew the leaſt of the particular Deſign of the Attacking the Guards at his Landing, ſo much talked of, in which I was ingaged as a Soldier by my immediate Commander, much againſt my Judgement; but his Soldier I was, and as ſuch, I was to obey and act according to Command.</p>
                  <p>Theſe twelve Years I have ſerved my true King and Maſter, King <hi>James,</hi> and freely now lay down my Life in his Cauſe. I ever abhor'd Treachery, even to an Enemy: If it be a guilt, to have complied with what I thought, and ſtill think to have been my Duty, I am guilty; no other guilt do I own.</p>
                  <p>As I beg of all to forgive me, ſo I forgive all from my heart, even the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who as a Soldier ought to have conſidered my Caſe, before he ſign'd the Warrant for my Death. I pray God may open his Eyes, and render him ſenſible of the much Blood from all Parts crying out againſt him, ſo to prevent a heavier Execution hanging over his Head, than what he inflicts on me.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt place, I dye in the Religion I was Baptized, <hi>(viz.) Roman Catholick,</hi> and humbly beg the Prayers of all Good People for a happy Reſurrection, and of all Catholicks for the good of my Soul. As for being ingag'd in this for which I dye, it was never ſo poſitive that I had a Horſe, from the beginning to the very laſt, nor never ſee any ſo allotted for me, or the two Men I was to provide, as was ſworn again me at my Trial; nor had I any on that account; nor was I at any of their Meetings when they ſettled any ſuch thing: And as for any Order or Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> I never ſee any ſince I came laſt into <hi>England,</hi> which is now about five years; and I am confident, none that knows King <hi>James,</hi> will believe he would give any ſuch Order.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I muſt confeſs, I believ'd King <hi>James</hi> was a coming to Aſſert his own Right; and I ſhould, if on Shore, have done any thing in my power to have aſſiſted him, and in order to that, I ſhould have been glad to have a Horſe, but never had any.</p>
                  <p>And as for being concern'd in any Bloody Affair, I never was in my Life, but have done my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevent, as much as I could, on all occaſions; and if the Killing the moſt miſerable Creature in the World (or greateſt Enemy) would now ſave my Life, Reſtore the King, and make me one of the greateſt Men in <hi>England,</hi> I would firſt chuſe to dye, becauſe againſt the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>If any who are now Sufferers on this account, think I have been too forward, and a Promoter of this Deſign, I do now declare it was never my Inclination to do any raſh thing. However, I beg their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and of all the World I have offended, either in Thought, Word, or any Action whatſoever, and do freely forgive my Enemies, and hope through the Mercy of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all my Sius. Good God preſerve the King, Queen, Prince, and Princeſs, and all that Royal Blood of <hi>Stewards,</hi> and may <hi>England</hi> never want one of that Direct Line to Govern them, and make them once more happy. I have had the Honour to ſerve my Royal Maſter in ſeveral Commiſſions, and the laſt as Major, and ſtrive ever to ſerve him to the beſt of my Power, and ever to be Juſt to thoſe who I had the Honour to Command. Lord Jeſus into thy Hands I Recommend my Spirit! O Jeſus receive my Soul!</p>
