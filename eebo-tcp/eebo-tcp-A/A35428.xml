            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO A Reverend Minister OF THE GOSPEL, OF THE Presbyterian Perswasion.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>REVEREND SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN in the <hi>doctrinal Truths</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion,</hi> and in the <hi>substantial parts</hi> of Divine Worship, all sober <hi>Pretestants</hi> of Episcopal and Presbyterian Perswasion, are firmly united together; our sad Divisions about Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Government (which have these many years mischief'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41528:6"/>
us) are certainly incosistent with the <hi>Gospel of peace and love,</hi> subservient to <hi>Popery</hi> which would swallow us up quick, and scandalous to all thinking Men. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjure you by the bleeding Wounds of our <hi>Holy Mother</hi> who received us by one <hi>Baptism,</hi> unto the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>one Lord, and one Faith,</hi> that when the Episcopal Clergy are of so reconciling inclinations, you neglect not this opportunity of shewing your abhorrence of wilful se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. And that my fervent persuance after Peace, may have the honour to contribute in any way for so happy an accommodation among Christian Brethren; suffer me in all that tender Compassion that becometh a Minister of Salvation by a dying Saviour, to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of these three Matters of Fact. 1<hi>st.</hi> That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> never confest any Divine Right in <hi>Presbytery.</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi> That the Solemn League never ajbur'd the <hi>president Bishop</hi> regulated by Canons, and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by assisting Miisters. 3<hi>dly.</hi> That the Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in <hi>England,</hi> for providing against violation of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> petitioned for such an Episcopacy as is liker to our present Establishment, than any other seen by the Christian World these thousand years.</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> The representative Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest any <hi>Divine Right</hi> in <hi>Presbytery.</hi> Since the Blessed <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>; we have but two of her Confessions, the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in <hi>K. I.</hi> I. his Reign, avoweth in its 19 Act about the Notes of Holy Church, that <hi>that Ecclesiastical Discipline is rightly administred as God's Word prescribes, whereby Vice is repressed and Virtue nourished.</hi> And lest it should be imagined that <hi>Presbytery</hi> can only afford such a <hi>Discipline</hi>; in the 21 Act it avoweth, <hi>that no Polity can be appointed for all Ages, times, and places.</hi> And after all, Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is thus left to be of <hi>Human Institution</hi>; the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41528:6"/>
Magistrate is confest in the 25 Article, to have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power to settle it. Then for the other Confession made at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by being voiced unto by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners which were sent from this place, and afterwards approved by the general Assembly here, it's adopted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the National Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>: And it's well enough known, that the 25<hi>th. Ch.</hi> thereof asserts the <hi>Supream Civil Magistrate</hi> his power of Establishing the external Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church: Yea, and the <hi>General Assembly</hi> here in the <hi>Act of Approbation</hi> of that Confession, for all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation that the 31 <hi>ch.</hi> concerning Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, should not encroach upon the intrinsick Power of the Church, takes no notice if the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath a <hi>Divine Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>Soelmn League</hi> did not abjure the <hi>President Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> regulated by Canons, and ballanced by Assistant Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. For since the <hi>General Assembly</hi> here in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by her Acts acknowledgeth, that the <hi>Solemn League</hi> strikes against the same <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> against which the National Covenant was levelled; then doubtless the single judgment of the Royal Martyr, (the best Protestant and Casuist of his time) about the Sense of the National Covenant, must weigh down the Opinion of all the diffusive Church of <hi>Brittain,</hi> in this Question; and the World knows that his Princely desire of a <hi>Regulation,</hi> always hated the <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Episcopacy. Then for the Church Representative of both Kingdoms, neither the Synod of <hi>Westminster</hi> in her Directory for Church Government, nor the <hi>General Assembly</hi> here convened, in her Act of Approbation of that Directory, do any thing in condemnation of a president Bishop.</p>
            <p>But, 3<hi>dly,</hi> The Reverend Ministers of the Presbyterian Perswasion in <hi>England,</hi> petitioned <hi>An.</hi> 1661, the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. for such an Episcopacy, as is liker our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41528:7"/>
Establishment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than any other that hath been seen by the Christian Church these thousand years. Their Petitions are printed in two Papers of Proposals, in which they insist upon the Form of a Synodical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conjunct with a fixed Presidency, according to Arch-Bishop <hi>Vshers</hi> Reduction; and the last Motive inducing them to desire such a Government, is plainly this, in words. <hi>That it will save the Nation from the violation of the Solemn Vow and Covenant, without wronging the Church at all, or breaking any other Oath.</hi> Now Reverend Brother, you know as well as my self, that the foresaid Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by that most Reverend Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker our present Episcopal Government, consider'd in its Nature, than hath ever been seen in any National Church since the Blessed Reformation: Yea, so very like in the weekly Session, Monthly Presbytery, and Diocesan Synod, that with a due Modification, whereunto the Regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy will be found complying, you should not be able to know the difference. Therefore beseeching the Author of Peace, and lover of Concord, that all of us of Episcopal and Presbyterian Perswasion, having <hi>one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptism,</hi> may be brought to be all <hi>of one mind and judgment, perfectly join'd together without all Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> I rest, though unknown as yet,</p>
