         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir Iohn Sommers, K<hi rend="sup">t.</hi>

               <salute>May it please Your Lordship,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving undertaken to collect a
short Account of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Affairs, I here presume to
present it to Your Lordship; and were
the <hi>Performance</hi> in any degree answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:102323:4"/>
to the Nobleness of the <hi>Subject,</hi>
and the Greatness of Your Lordship's
Skill in this, as well as in all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
Parts of Learning, I might justly
hope to find it in some measure
acceptable. But how mean soever
the <hi>Performance</hi> is, I have still some
fair Prospect of the <hi>Design;</hi> and I was
almost assur'd, from Your Lordship's
generous Inclinations, to promote the
best and most useful Parts of Learning,
that <hi>such a Design,</hi> cou'd not, by any
other Means, be so acceptable to the
<hi>Publick,</hi> as by having the Advantage
of Your Lordship's Name before it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I cannot pretend to any
such Knowledge of the Law, as to
understand which is the surest Method
of attaining to Perfection in it. But,
as I am inform'd, some lay their
Foundation in the ancient Histories
<pb facs="tcp:102323:4"/>
of the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans:</hi>
Others, I am told, only by the
Way of <hi>Institutes, Reports,</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
arrive to a considerable Fame
and Practice. But some there are,
whose generous Industry carries 'em
yet further, who think it necessary to
spend some time in the <hi>Roman History,
Classical Authors, Civil Law,</hi> and the
<hi>Pleadings of Cicero.</hi> And, I need not
go about to acquaint the World,
That Your Lordship's Excellency
in all these, together with Your
great natural Endowments, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Improvements, did not only
give Your Lordship very high Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
over Others, at Your first Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but in a very short time rais'd
You to the highest Dignity in the <hi>Law,</hi>
and the utmost Favour of the greatest
Prince in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102323:5"/>
I speak not this, my Lord, so
much to celebrate the singular Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Justice of His Majesty, in
advancing Your Lordship to this most
honourable Station, as to shew the
World what peculiar Reason I had to
offer this humble Address, and how
ambitious I was of appearing,</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE are requir'd so many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
and Accomplishments in an
<hi>Historian,</hi> and so much Care and
Niceness in writing an <hi>History,</hi> that some have
reckon'd it <hi>One of the most difficult Labours
that Human Nature is capable of.</hi> And this
seems the more probable from the small Number
of good Histories that ever yet appear'd in the
World. Even the principal Writers of the
<hi>Roman History,</hi> who are doubtless as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
as any in the World, have not been free
from Faults, or at least from Criticks, who
have been very ready to make their several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon 'em. <hi>Polybius,</hi> say they, is a
very good Author, but is too much addicted to
Preaching. <hi>Dionysius Hal.</hi> is a very great
Critick, but too morose, and may rather be
plac'd among the Writers of <hi>Antiquities</hi> than
<hi>History. Diodorus Siculus</hi> spends too much
<pb facs="tcp:102323:6"/>
time in Fables, and is not free from trifling,
and has but little of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs. <hi>Dion
Cassius,</hi> they look upon to be fickle, partial,
a great Flatterer, and as great a Reviler.
<hi>Appian</hi> is very well for Military Discipline,
but is often out in the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs. <hi>Caesar</hi>
only wrote of some of his own Matters, and
was so Modest and Iust as not to call his
Book <hi>History,</hi> but <hi>Commentaries.</hi> Neither
will <hi>Plutarch</hi> nor <hi>Suetonius</hi> go for <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
they being only <hi>Biographers. Livy,</hi>
say they, is indeed a great Man, but he is a
little too verbose and circumstantial, and too
much given to Prodigies and <hi>Patavinity.
Salust</hi> is blam'd for his <hi>Preface,</hi> which, they
say, is not only large enough for the History
of the World, but might as well stand before
any other Book whatsoever. And something
they have to say of all the rest, which I need
not trouble the Reader withal.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding these several Censures,
most of these Authors are very extraordinary
in their kind, and generally are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Patterns to imitate; if it be done with
Iudgment. But how extraordinary soever
they are, they are either all Fragments, or else
so unfinish'd, that a compleat Body of the
<pb facs="tcp:102323:6"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> History, for six or seven hundred
Years, can never be gotten out of any one of 'em.
So that he, who expects to have any tolerable
Account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs, for so long a
time, from old Writers, must, besides his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, put
himself to a considerable Expence both of Money
and Time; except he will content himself with
that little he can learn from <hi>Florus,</hi> and such
other immethodical and imperfect Epitomies.
This Consideration is sufficient to vindicate my
<hi>Design,</hi> in this following <hi>Collection;</hi> and
I know none which is of it self more useful
for Young Scholars or Gentlemen, or perhaps
more entertaining. There never was any thing
of this kind in our Language before, nor any
thing relating to the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs, but either
what has been intermix'd with much more other
History, or what has contain'd but a few Years
of this Part. Of these I find none of any
Note besides <hi>Raleigh, Ross, Howel,</hi> the
Author of the <hi>History of the two Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virates,</hi>
and <hi>Pedro Mexia,</hi> Author of the
<hi>Imperial History;</hi> the two last of which are
Translations.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Account of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
begins at the Building of the City, but
<pb facs="tcp:102323:7"/>
contains but 586 Years, ending at the second
<hi>Macedonian</hi> War: And tho' it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
but the last hundred Years is written with
very much Spirit and Iudgment, and all
of it with as much Skill and Clearness;
yet, besides the Inconveniency of being so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd
with other Matters, all before the
first <hi>Punick</hi> War, bear no manner of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the rest, as to length. <hi>Ross</hi> carries
on Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Design, but after such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
Manner, either for Length or
Vigour, that I need not say any more of him.
<hi>Howel</hi> is much more exact, both for Method
and Proportion in the <hi>Roman</hi> History, than
Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> and does not only continue it as
far as this goes, but above 300 Years further;
which he has done with wonderful Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.
Yet notwithstanding all his Method, he
has not justly proportion'd his Matter; his 57
Years Period, after the Expulsion of the Kings,
is too long for the rest of his History; many
memorable Actions, between that and the first
<hi>Triumvirate,</hi> are too short; the first <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi>
it self is too long in his second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and too short in the first; and the
second <hi>Triumvirate</hi> is too short in both.
Besides, he is often too flat and insipid to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:102323:7"/>
us throughly, and the Actions of the
bravest Men are related too coldly and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'dly
to move us as they ought; which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his frequent Want of <hi>Transitions</hi>
and Words of <hi>Connection,</hi> and his often mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of critical Learning, makes him far less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
than otherwise he might be. And what still
adds to these Imperfections, is the Obscurity of
his <hi>Stile,</hi> which proceeds sometimes from his
unlucky or unnatural Misplacing of his Words,
and sometimes from his affecting a Shortness,
without throughly considering and pre-observing
the Dangers that attend that useful Way of
Writing. His <hi>Collections</hi> indeed are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
both for their Usefulness and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness;
his <hi>Decision</hi>'s very just and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and his <hi>Learning</hi> very uncommon and
curious: In short, we may say, that no Man
ever more truly and carefully brought together
the principal Matters of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
than he; and that he was an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Collector</hi> and <hi>Compiler,</hi> tho' at the
same time he was but an indifferent <hi>Historian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fear I have been too long upon this last,
but still I must beg the Reader's leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the two remaining. <hi>The History of
the two Triumvirates</hi> is a Translation from
<pb facs="tcp:102323:8"/>
the <hi>French,</hi> and contains only 30 Years, but
of the busiest Time of the Common-wealth. It
is a History very ingeniously writ, handsomly
put together, and faithfully collected; and is
far more pleasant and palatable than <hi>Howel</hi>'s.
Yet as few Years as it contains, it is manifestly
too tedious in many Places, which is occasion'd
sometimes from the natural Verboseness of the
<hi>French</hi> Temper, and sometimes from the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>'s
descending too particularly to the lesser
and more private Actions of Mankind; which
makes him fall from the Majesty of a <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
to that of a <hi>Biographer.</hi> And, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his being so very particular, he has
wholly left out all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wars with the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> which gain'd him so much Glory and
Reputation, and was the Original of all his
future Greatness. <hi>Pedro Mexia</hi> is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
from the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and contains the
<hi>Lives</hi> of all the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
to his own Time, which plainly shews
him a <hi>Biographer;</hi> tho', besides, he has many
excellent Marks of a <hi>Historian.</hi> He begins
almost at the latter end of this History, and in
effect contains not much more than 33 Years
of it; and in that short Space he is extreamly
imperfect in one of the most principal Actions of
<pb facs="tcp:102323:8"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> History, namely, the Settlement of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by <hi>Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, I suppose it will be expected
that my own Piece is every way faultless, and
has all the Perfections that can be desir'd from
a Book of this Size or Proportion; but I will
not be so foolishly vain as to pretend to that;
I can only say, that I have in some measure
endeavour'd to avoid the Defects and Faults
of those Writers whom I have here taken
notice of, and likewise to imitate their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
especially those of the Ancients, as far
as the Compass I have taken wou'd admit of,
which has been a severe Curb to me. But to
come closer to the Matter, it will be convenient to
let the Reader know, in short, what he is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from this Book. It is an intire, tho' short,
Account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs, for 727 Years,
in which Compass of Time, the most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
things were Acted, and the most famous
of the <hi>Classical</hi> Authors flourish'd. It is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
with the utmost Fidelity from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians whatsoever,
but more especially from these seven most noted,
<hi>Dionysius Hal. Livy, Plutarch, Polybius,
Dion Cassius, Appian,</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi> I found
it very inconvenient to crowd the Margent of
<pb facs="tcp:102323:9"/>
every Page with these and many other Names,
as many do; but, when it is needful, I quote
'em in the Body of the Book, particularly when
any uncommon Story is related, or any doubtful
Point is to be decided. I have likewise been
oblig'd to some of our Modern Writers, but to
none so much as <hi>Howel,</hi> and the <hi>History of
the two Triumvirates,</hi> both whose accurate
<hi>Collections</hi> have often sav'd me much Trouble,
tho' I examin'd the Originals from whence they
had 'em. Upon that Account I have copy'd 'em
in many Places, and that too almost verbally,
whenever I found it both for the Ease of my
self and the Advantage of my Book: For I
am never cautious in <hi>Borrowing,</hi> as long as I
acknowledge it, and can benefit my Reader,
whose Good I always study before my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>The Method of the whole I have endeavour'd
to make as easie and as natural as I cou'd, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
and distinguishing the <hi>Books, Chapters,</hi>
and <hi>Sections,</hi> with all the Skill and Iudgment
I had; so that I hope it will be all of it
clearly comprehended, and the principal Matters
as easily remember'd. Nothing is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
than convenient resting Places for a
Reader to take Breath at; and the want of
<pb facs="tcp:102323:9"/>
this or the like Method will appear apparently
in any Man's reading over <hi>Livy.</hi> For tho'
the <hi>Regal State</hi> may there be clearly enough
comprehended, by reason of the Nature of the
Subject; yet the vast Variety of the Matter that
follows, will not be master'd and retain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
toiling and sweating: For it is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
when the Reader must separate and
distinguish the Matter, where the Author has
not done it. Then to make it still more Clear,
I have all the way intermix'd so much <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology</hi>
and <hi>Geography,</hi> as is necessary to
illustrate the Story.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Stile,</hi> I have made it as plain
and intelligible as I cou'd; and as I have no
ways affected Flourishes and the <hi>French</hi> Finery,
so for the most part I have avoided all Meanness
of Words or Expressions, endeavouring in some
measure to preserve the Gravity which belongs to
<hi>History,</hi> and which ought not to be omitted in a
<hi>Collection:</hi> Yet I must acknowledge, that I
have bestow'd too little Pains in the perfecting
of the <hi>Stile</hi> in some places; at least not so much
as I shou'd have done, had it been a Translation
of any ancient Author; I mean as to the Nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our Tongue, and the Perfection of Periods.
The <hi>Speeches</hi> are generally the most carefully
<pb facs="tcp:102323:10"/>
done, tho' I cou'd scarce take any verbally, by
reason of the little Compass I was allow'd: And
upon that account I was forc'd in some places
to follow their Sense at a distance, which some
that are over nice will scarcely allow to a
faithful <hi>Historian.</hi> And this little Compass
likewise hinder'd me from having all the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
I cou'd have desir'd, tho' those are the
principal Beauties belonging to the Way and
Manner of writing Historical Matters.</p>
            <p>To come to the <hi>Use</hi> of this Book; It will
be particularly useful to Young Students and
Gentlemen, by giving 'em an Insight into the
principal of the <hi>Roman Customs, Laws,</hi> and
<hi>Magistrates;</hi> I mean such of 'em as cannot be
so clearly learnt from <hi>Rosinus,</hi> and Books of
mere <hi>Antiquities.</hi> It is the Historical Account
of all the various Occasions and Circumstances
that can best clear some of these things. The
<hi>Tribunes of the People</hi> may serve for one
Instance of this; for no Man can throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Nature of those Magistrates, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reading the History of their Creation, and
likewise their chief Actions afterwards. And
still that this Book might be as compleat as I
cou'd make it, I have at the most convenient
Places intermix'd the <hi>History of the Roman
<pb facs="tcp:102323:10"/>
Learning,</hi> and given a short Account of all the
Principal <hi>Authors,</hi> as far as this History rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
But still I have taken care to join all
this to the rest, in such a manner as both might
make but one entire Body.</p>
            <p>But to shew more noble Uses of this Book,
and that I may incite all Gentlemen to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>Roman History,</hi> of which
this is an <hi>Introduction,</hi> I shall give 'em the
sence of what a very Ingenious Man says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>Subject.</hi> It is the Story of the Fate
and Fortunes of a City that rais'd it self to an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Empire, and became the Metropolis of the
whole World; and all from a Troop of Vagabond
Shepherds, pack'd together upon the Banks of
<hi>Tiber.</hi> It is a long Train of the Adventures
of a People, scandalous as it were in their Origine,
coming of an Extraction in a manner Infamous,
born and nurs'd up in Plunderings and Murders,
and train'd up in Villanies; who became Wise,
Frugal, Iust, Passionately studious of Glory, till
they infinitely over-topp'd the rest of Mankind:
A People whose Prudence in their Counsels, whose
Maturity of Deliberations, whose Diligence in
Execution, whose profound Secrecy in the most
important Affairs, and whose noble Resolution
in unavoidable Dangers, and the greatest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:102323:11"/>
tremities, ought to be remember'd to all Ages.
It is a History of a State that grew so mighty
from so small Beginnings, of its Progress, its
strange Changes, the Revolutions of its Power
and Greatness, its amazing Exaltation, and the
miraculous and almost unconceivable Pitch of
Glory it arriv'd at; and all by its patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
of Hardships, by its Perseverance in
Labours, by its exact Observation of Laws, by
the inviolable Severity of its Discipline in the
Duties of Peace and War, and by training up a
well regulated and couragious Soldiery, encourag'd
and elevated with the sole Prospect of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
the <hi>Roman</hi> Name. It was a Nation
that was Virtuous through a true Principle of
Honour; whose Valour was more the Product
of the Head than Heart; a Nation that court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or avoided Danger, from a result of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and knew as well when to expose it self,
as when to retreat, by the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and obtain'd the Sovereignty over the rest
of the World, more by the Reputation of its
Virtue, than the Force of its Arms.</p>

            <head>AN
ADVERTISEMENT
OF THIS
Second Edition.</head>
            <p>IN the Preface to this <hi>History,</hi> I acknowledg'd
that I had not bestow'd sufficient Pains in
the perfecting the Stile in some places; which
proceeded not only from a want of Time, but
also from the great Care I had upon me of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the <hi>Matter,</hi> and proportioning its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts to that small Compass to which I
was over-strictly confin'd. The principal Fault,
besides a little Abruptness in some few Periods,
was the having Expressions in several Places
somewhat too low and vulgar for <hi>History,</hi> which
requires the utmost <hi>Purity</hi> as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Strength.</hi> This Fault is in a great Measure
corrected in this Edition; which I assert with
the greater Freedom, because I have been much
assisted by Persons of the greatest Judgment in
these Matters, whose Names I ought not to
mention without their particular Leave.</p>
            <p>In examining the <hi>Stile,</hi> I likewise found the
<hi>Matter</hi> in many Places defective, and capable
of great Improvements with no great Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for which reason I have made several
considerable Additions in most Parts of this
History, especially in the last Book, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb facs="tcp:102323:12"/>
in the third and Fourth Chapters,
where several Material Actions were manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too shortly and lamely related. I am tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible that I have disoblig'd those Persons
who have bought the First Edition, in not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
these Additions in distinct Places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might have had 'em without buying
the whole; but I hope they will the more
readily pardon me, since these Additions are
of that Nature, that in many Places it wou'd
be as difficult to separate 'em from the Body
of the Book, as to separate the Alterations
made in the <hi>Style.</hi> I undertook this <hi>Second
Edition</hi> the more willingly, because the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the First was so small, and therefore
the less Injury done to the World; but I
here promise never to make any further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to it for the future, nor any Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
except those of the <hi>Press:</hi> Of which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I. IN relating such great and remarkable Affairs
as those of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it will be necessary
to give some Account of the Original of
that People: And, to make the Account as
clear and intelligible as I can, it may not be amiss
first to observe, that that Country which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
call'd <hi>Italy,</hi> of which <hi>Rome</hi> was afterwards the
chief City, did not contain above one half of what
now goes by that Name. But as small as it was, it
contain'd many distinct Nations and People; the
principal of which were the <hi>Aborigines, Sabines, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurians,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102323:15"/>
or <hi>Tuscans, Umbri, Samnites, Campani, Apulii,
Calabri, Lucanii,</hi> and <hi>Brutii;</hi> and others of inferior
Note which were often dependant on these. As for
the rest of what is now call'd <hi>Italy,</hi> that was principally
possess'd by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who had driven out the <hi>Hetruri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and settl'd themselves in these Parts; being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
into several Names, as the <hi>Senones,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subres,</hi>
&amp;c. This Part went by the Name of <hi>Gallia
Cis-Alpina</hi> and <hi>Togata,</hi> to distinguish it from that <hi>Gaul</hi>
which is now call'd <hi>France,</hi> and was almost the same
with the present <hi>Lombardy:</hi> The chief Inhabitants of
it, besides the several Nations of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> were the
<hi>Ligures</hi> and the <hi>Veneti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all the foremention'd People, the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
call'd by the Name of <hi>Latines,</hi> were of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Note; not upon the account of any particular
Excellency, but as being better known, and much
more enquir'd after by all Historians. These were
of the Posterity of the <hi>Oenotrians,</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> People of
<hi>Arcadia,</hi> who had driven out the <hi>Siculi,</hi> the first Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of these Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> They possess'd the

                     </note> a small Country along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Tiber,</hi> about 30 Miles in length, and 16 in breadth,
containing near a fourth Part of that little Province
in the Pope's Dominions now call'd <hi>Campagna-di-Roma.</hi>
We find these govern'd by their own Kings
nigh 200 Years before the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and
above 1300 before <hi>Christ;</hi> the first Kings we hear of
in <hi>Italy,</hi> or in all <hi>Europe,</hi> except <hi>Greece.</hi> These Kings
kept their Courts at <hi>Laurentum,</hi> a City about 5 Miles
off the Mouth of the River <hi>Tiber;</hi> and were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of a mixt People: For first, some <hi>Pelasgians</hi>
out of <hi>Thessaly</hi> settled among 'em; soon after, <hi>Saturn</hi>

But the last who settled in this Country, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> were some Relicts of the <hi>Trojans,</hi>
under the Conduct of their Prince <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who had
left his native Country, and his inrag'd Enemies, to
seek out Foreign Habitations. These were about
1200 in all, tho' some will allow but half that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and arriv'd in these Parts three Years after the
destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and above 400 before the building
of <hi>Rome, A. M. 2824. Aeneas</hi> at his first landing,
was very civilly entertain'd by <hi>Latinus,</hi> the King then
reigning, as a Person of great Renown, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated him honourably, but gave him his only
Daughter <hi>Lavinia</hi> in Marriage. This occasion'd a
War between him and <hi>Turnus,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Rutuli,</hi>
their near Neighbours, who had formerly made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to her; but these Wars soon ended in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
death, which did not only free <hi>Aeneas</hi> from a
Rival, but secur'd his Kingdom, which <hi>Latinus</hi> gave
him for his Daughters Portion after his decease. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
thus settled, soon after built the City of <hi>Lavini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
in honour of his Wife, about five or six Miles
East of <hi>Laurentum,</hi> where he kept his Court; and the
more to oblige his Subjects, caus'd both them and
his own Country-men to be call'd by the common
Name of <hi>Latini:</hi> But ingaging in a bloody War with
<hi>Mezentius,</hi> a King of the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> he was slain,
after a short Reign of four Years. His Subjects, in
honour to his Memory, dedicated a Chappel to him,
under the Title of <hi>Iupiter Indiges.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iupiter Indiges.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the death of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> his Son <hi>Ascanius</hi> succeeded
him in the Throne; but <hi>Lavinia,</hi> being left with

was there deliver'd of a Son, who from the place of
his Birth had the Name of <hi>Silvius.</hi> Thirty Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the building of <hi>Lavinium, Ascanius</hi> left it to his
Mother-in-Law, and founded <hi>Alba-Longa,</hi> about 12

had a Son call'd <hi>Iulus,</hi> from whom came the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102323:16"/>
Family of the <hi>Iulii;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iulii.</note> this Son after his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death, contended with <hi>Silvius</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but the People, judging that to belong to <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
Race, gave the Kingdom to <hi>Silvius,</hi> and the
Priesthood to <hi>Iulus,</hi> in whose Family it thenceforth
continu'd. After <hi>Silvius,</hi> succeeded 13 Kings of
the same Race, for nigh 400 Years, who all had
their Seats at <hi>Alba,</hi> and many of them likewise had
the Name of <hi>Silvius:</hi> These Kings were as following;
<hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> who reign'd 31 Years, <hi>Latinus,</hi> who
reign'd 51, <hi>Alba 39, Capetus</hi> I. 26, <hi>Capys 28, Cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
II. 13, <hi>Tiberinus 8, Agrippa 24, Alladius 19, Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus
37, Procas 23, Amulius</hi> 42, and <hi>Numitor,</hi> who
was the last King of <hi>Alba.</hi> Except the two last, we
have but little remarkable concerning these Kings,
only <hi>Tiberinus</hi> gave Name to the River <hi>Tiber,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tiber.</note> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drown'd in it, it being before call'd <hi>Albula;</hi> and
<hi>Aventinus</hi> gave Name to Mount <hi>Aventine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aventine.</note> one of the
seven Hills of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were call'd the Kings of <hi>Alba,</hi> or of Old <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
which scarce contain'd the sixth part of what
was call'd <hi>Latium</hi> in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Reign;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>New</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> which then
comprehended not only the Old <hi>Latini,</hi> but also the
<hi>Rutuli, Aequi, Hernici, Volsci,</hi> and <hi>Arunci.</hi> This
Kingdom, tho' very Small, according to the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
before given of it, was very Fruitful, Populous,
and full of Towns; and <hi>Alba</hi> it self was a great and
flourishing City, and had been the Mother of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Latine</hi> Towns, when it was destroy'd by <hi>Tullus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilius</hi>
the third King of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. But to come close to the <hi>Roman Story, Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
and <hi>Numitor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. M. 3209.</note> the two last of these Kings, were
Brothers; and it was agreed between 'em, that <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Eldest, should have the Kingdom, and
<hi>Amulius</hi> the Treasure and Gold that was brought
from <hi>Troy.</hi> But Money having the Advantage of
meer Authority, <hi>Amulius</hi> soon got his Brother out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102323:16"/>
his Kingdom; and, to secure it to himself against the
Pretensions of his Posterity, caus'd his Son <hi>Lausus</hi> to
be Murther'd in a pretended Hunting, and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Rhea</hi> to be made a <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgin. In the fourth
Year of her Priesthood, going to fetch Water, she
was met and ravish'd by some Lover, or probably
by <hi>Amulius</hi> himself, rather, as was suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his other Designs, than to gratifie his Lust. But for
the Honour of the Cause, the Fact was laid upon
<hi>Mars,</hi> in whose Grove it was committed, who came
to her, as they will have it, in a most dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with Thunder and Lightning. <hi>Rhea</hi> proving with
Child, was deliver'd of two Boys, and thereupon
was condemn'd to Death, or perpetual Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and her Children were thrown into the River.
But the Wind and Stream were both so favourable,
that at the fall of the Water, they were left safe upon
dry Ground, and there happily found by <hi>Faustulus,
Amulius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who, for her Infamous Life, was call'd <hi>Lupa;</hi>
and this probably might occasion the famous Story
of their being nourished by a <hi>Wolf:</hi> The Names of
these Twins were <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Children, grown up, prov'd Active and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious,
suitable to the Greatness of their Birth; but
the Meanness of their Education gave 'em occasion of
falling out with some of <hi>Numitor</hi>'s Herds-Men; in
which contest <hi>Remus</hi> was taken Prisoner, and brought
before the King. Upon which <hi>Faustulus</hi> discover'd to
<hi>Romulus</hi> all the Particulars of his Birth and hard
Usage from <hi>Amulius;</hi> begging him to be assistant in
the Rescue of <hi>Remus. Romulus</hi> soon drew together
a great Number of Herds-Men and inferiour People,
who hated <hi>Amulius,</hi> whom he divided into Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
consisting of an hundred Men each; every
Captain carrying a small Bundle of Grass and
Shrubs ty'd to a Pole. The <hi>Latines</hi> call such Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<hi>Manipuli;</hi> from whence it is, that in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102323:17"/>
they call their Captains <hi>Manipulares.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Manipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> 
                     <hi>Remus</hi>
gaining upon the Citizens within, and <hi>Romulus</hi> make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Attacks from without, <hi>Amulius</hi> not knowing
what Expedient to think of for his Security, in that
Amazement and Distraction, was taken and slain;
the Brothers settling their Grand-Father <hi>Numitor</hi> in
his Throne, after he had been depos'd forty two
Years.</p>
                  <p>The Affairs of <hi>Alba</hi> succeeding thus prosperously,<note place="margin">A. M. 3251.</note>
the Young-Men, ambitious of Glory, were desirous
of Founding a City in the Place where they were
brought up; which Design was approv'd of by their
Grand-Father, who appointed 'em Land, with such
of his Subjects as he knew were of his Brother's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and likewise gave free Liberty to all others
who were willing, to settle themselves in this new
Colony. Most of the <hi>Trojans</hi> came in, (of which
there remain'd fifty Families in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Time, as
<hi>Dionysius</hi> informs us) and also all the Inhabitants
about the <hi>Palatine-Hill,</hi> where the City was built,
which was about 14 Miles North-West of <hi>Alba,</hi>
upon the River <hi>Tiber.</hi> For the more speedy carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on this Work, the People were divided into
two Parts, who were to work by way of Emulation:
But what was design'd for a considerable Advantage,
prov'd a greater Inconveniency; for it gave birth to
two Factions, whereof one preferr'd <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the
other <hi>Remus;</hi> which swell'd 'em with the ambitious
Desires of Preeminence. This soon appear'd in their
Disagreement about the Place of Building, <hi>Romulus</hi>
contending for the <hi>Palatine,</hi> where they were brought
up, and <hi>Remus</hi> for the <hi>Aventine-Hill.</hi> Upon which, the
Matter was brought before their Grand-Father <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitor,</hi>
who advis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d 'em both to go apart, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the flying of Birds; and the most Fortunate of
the two shou'd be counted the Founder of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.
They both took their Stations upon their own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102323:17"/>
Hills, and <hi>Remus</hi> first had a flight of 6 Vultures,
but <hi>Romulus</hi> having, or pretending to have, double
the Number, both were saluted by the Title of <hi>King.</hi>
This widned the Breach, and the Contention grew
so hot as to come to a Battel, wherein <hi>Remus</hi> was
worsted and slain, with several others, particularly
<hi>Faustulus</hi> and his Brother <hi>Plistinus.</hi> But it is likewise
said, that before the Battel, <hi>Remus</hi> gave his Brother
many great Provocations, particularly by leaping
over his Wall, to ridicule him for the Lowness of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Romulus,</hi> now sole Commander, and Eighteen
Years of Age, began the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> in the
fourth Year of the sixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> according to
<hi>Varro</hi>'s Account, which was in the Year of the World
3252, the sixth Year of <hi>Iotham</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
the seventh of <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> 431 Years after
the Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> 120 after the Building of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> 214 before the Beginning of the <hi>Persian</hi>
Empire, and 752 before <hi>Christ;</hi> And having got <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs,</hi>
and such sort of People from <hi>Hetruria,</hi> he set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it with much Ceremony, on the 21 Day of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
according to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which Day the <hi>Romans</hi>
Anniversarily kept Holy, calling it their Country's
Birth-Day. He took in the Mount <hi>Palatine</hi> only, and
with a Heifer and a young Bullock, plow'd up a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
where the Wall was design'd; which Custom
was afterwards observ'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> both in the
building and razing of Cities; and where-ever a
Gate was to be made, the Plow was lifted up, which
occasion'd it to be call'd <hi>Porta, a portando aratrum:</hi> All
within this Line was call'd <hi>Pomaerium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pomaerium,</note> from <hi>Post-Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
or <hi>Pone Maenia.</hi> The City was almost square,
containing at first about 1000 Houses, and was nigh
a Mile in Compass, with four Gates, namely <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nula,
Ianualis, Mucionis,</hi> and <hi>Carmentalis;</hi> and a small
Territory belonging to it of 7 or 8 Miles long.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see <hi>Rome</hi> in its Original, a small incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
beggarly Place, with Dominions still of less
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102323:18"/>
Note; which yet from this mean and contemptible
Beginning became Mistress of the World; being
first founded and supported by its <hi>Kings,</hi> then
strengthened and enlarged by its <hi>Consuls,</hi> and at last
brought to its utmost Perfection by its <hi>Emperors.</hi> As
for the Arts and Contrivances, the Policy and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Strength and Valour, and the gradual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
with the extraordinary Fortune, which
contributed to make the <hi>Romans</hi> Masters of such vast

and each <hi>Tribe</hi> was divided into ten <hi>Curiae,</hi> which
were much the same as our <hi>Parishes,</hi> as the <hi>Tribes</hi>

Each <hi>Curia</hi> was likewise by <hi>Romulus</hi> subdivided
into ten <hi>Decuriae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Decuria.</note> over which were appointed distinct
Officers. According to the number of the <hi>Curiae,</hi> he
divided the Lands into thirty Parts, reserving one
Portion for Publick Uses, and another for Religious
Ceremonies. In all Matters of Importance, for
many Years, the People gave their Votes according
to the <hi>Curiae,</hi> and to what the major Part of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae</hi>
agreed, was reckon'd the Resolution of the whole
Assembly, each single Man having a Vote; and this
made that Assembly call'd <hi>Comitia Curiata.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Romulus</hi> made also another Distinction of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
according to their Honour and Dignity, which
was into <hi>Patritians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Patritians. Plebeians.</note> The former, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Elder and more nobly descended, were to take
care about the Religious Rites, bear Offices of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
administer Justice, and be assistant to the
King in his Government: The latter to till the
Fields, feed Cattel, and follow Trades; but not to have
any Share in the Government, to avoid the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
of a Popular Power. To bind the Principal
each to the other, he recommended certain of the
<hi>Plebeians</hi> to the Protection of the <hi>Patritians,</hi> liberty
being given to the <hi>Plebeians</hi> to chuse their own <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Patrons. Clients.</note>
The Duty of these <hi>Patrons</hi> was to advise their
<hi>Clients</hi> in Points of Law, to manage their Suits, to
take care of 'em, absent and present, as their own
Children; and by all Ways and Methods to secure
their Peace and Happiness. On the other side, the
Duty of the <hi>Clients</hi> was to help their <hi>Patrons</hi> with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon many Occasions, to ransom them or their
Sons if taken Prisoners, and to bear the Charges of
their Magistracy, and other honourable Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
They were never to accuse each other, or
take contrary Sides; for if they did, any one might
lawfully kill them without Examination. So that this

                     <hi>Patronage</hi> was an Obligation as effectual as any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity
or Alliance; and it was the Glory of the
Nobility to have a great Number of <hi>Clients,</hi> and to
treat 'em civilly. This <hi>Patronage</hi> had admirable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
towards the firm Union of the People, for above
600 Years after, till <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> broke the Peace
of the City: And because the <hi>Plebeians</hi> in the City
receiv'd such Advantage from this Constitution, in
imitation thereof, afterwards all <hi>Colonies, Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
and <hi>Conquer'd</hi> Cities, had their <hi>Patrons,</hi> to whom
frequently the <hi>Senate</hi> wou'd remit such Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
as were brought before 'em, and ratifie their
Judgment.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Romulus</hi> chose 100 Men out of the
<hi>Patritians</hi> to assist him in the Government. This
number he call'd a <hi>Senate,</hi>

was call'd <hi>Praefectus Urbis.</hi>

proceeded to settle the Authorities of <hi>King,
Senate,</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> The King's Office at home, was,
<hi>To take care of the Religious Rites; to preserve the Laws
and Customs; to decide the chief Causes between Man and
Man, and refer the less Matters to the Senate, into which
he had an Inspection; to call the Senate, assemble the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
first giving his own Opinion, then ratifying what was
approv'd of by the major Part:</hi> Abroad, and in the
Wars, <hi>He had absolute Authority.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi>'s Office
was, <hi>To debate and resolve about such things as the King
propos'd, which were decreed by the Majority of Voices.</hi>
To the People he committed three Things; <hi>To create
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102323:20"/>
Magistrates, make Laws, and resolve about any War that
was propos'd by the King;</hi> yet still in such a manner as
the Authority of the <hi>Senate</hi> always interpos'd.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that <hi>Romulus</hi> did, was to take care
of a Guard for his Person; and therefore he order'd
the <hi>Curiae</hi> to chuse him out 300 lusty young Men,
ten out of each;<note place="margin">Celeres.</note> and these were call'd <hi>Celeres, à ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leritate</hi>
from their Activity and Readiness to assist the
King upon all Occasions. They were commanded
by a <hi>Tribune</hi> or Colonel,<note place="margin">Tribunus Celerum.</note> call'd <hi>Tribunus Celerum,</hi> three
<hi>Centurions,</hi> and other Inferiour Officers. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
with their Spears, defended the King in the
City, and in Battels were the foremost Leaders,
Charging first and Retreating last. Besides these, he
had for his Attendance,<note place="margin">Lictors.</note> twelve <hi>Lictors</hi> or <hi>Sergeants,</hi>
who punish'd Offenders, and executed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
these always going before him in Publick,
with their Bundles of Rods, call'd <hi>Fasces,</hi> and their
<hi>Axes,</hi> signifying different Punishments, according to
Mens different Crimes. Thus <hi>Romulus,</hi> with all the
Industry and Prudence imaginable, took care to settle
the State, being very exact in Justice, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all sordid Arts and Trades, especially such as
were subservient to Luxury, which being left wholly
to Slaves and Strangers, the <hi>Romans</hi> for many Years
scorn'd to be concern'd in 'em. This is the Form of
the Common-wealth, as <hi>Romulus</hi> first establish'd it,
which in general was so excellent, that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
by <hi>Dionysius</hi> above all the Constitutions, even
of his own Country-men the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and by its
Healthfulness, and robust Constitution, had all the
manifest Signs of a thriving and long-liv'd State.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Romulus,</hi> finding he was encompass'd with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
powerful Nations,<note place="margin">U. C. 4.</note> who, with envious Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the extraordinary Growth of his City, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
how much it was fill'd by Fugitives, who had
no Wives, he bethought himself of Means to contract
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102323:21"/>
Alliance with his Neighbours, and to procure Wives
for his Subjects, which was his second Device to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the City: Therefore, by Advice of his Grand-Father
<hi>Numitor,</hi> and the Consent of the <hi>Senate,</hi> he
proclaim'd a Solemn Feast and Publick Games, in
Honour of <hi>Neptune,</hi> thro' all the Country thereabouts.
This immediately occasion'd a great Concourse of all
sorts of People, who came flocking in, with their
Wives and Children, from several Neighbouring Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to behold these Pompous Shows, together with
the new City. In the mid'st of the Solemnity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Signal given, the <hi>Romans,</hi> with their drawn
Swords, seiz'd on such Virgins as they cou'd most
conveniently catch, and by main Force carry'd 'em
to their Houses. The Number of these amounted
to 683, for whom <hi>Romulus</hi> chose so many Husbands,
and marry'd 'em after their own Country Rites,
making 'em sign a Covenant or Agreement, with
the Ceremonies of Fire and Water; which Custom
continu'd among the <hi>Romans</hi> for many Ages.</p>
                  <p>This Act was highly resented by most of their
Neighbours, especially the <hi>Sabines,</hi> who were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
concern'd; but their Backwardness in their
Preparations made the Cities <hi>Caenina, Antemna,</hi> and
<hi>Crustumium,</hi> begin the War first. The two former
(three or four Miles North of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Inhabited
by the <hi>Aborigines) Romulus</hi> soon subdu'd, with the
Death of their King <hi>Acron,</hi> whom he slew in a
single Combat; and afterwards the latter, a Colony
of <hi>Alba,</hi> a little way within the Country of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</hi>
The Lands were divided between some of the
<hi>Romans</hi> and the old Inhabitants, of whom 3000 were
made Free of <hi>Rome,</hi> without losing their former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states;
so that the Foot-men of the City were now
much increas'd. For this Victory <hi>Romulus</hi> first Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd,
and bringing home the Spoils of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cron,</hi>

which the <hi>Romans</hi> nam'd <hi>Opima Spolia,</hi> or <hi>Royal

                     <hi>Capitoline</hi> for a Temple to <hi>Iupiter Feretrius,</hi>

either <hi>à ferendo</hi> to bear, or rather from <hi>ferire</hi> to strike;
and this was the Place where the <hi>Capitol</hi> afterwards
stood. The Valour of <hi>Romulus</hi> and his good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in this War, together with his Clemency to the
Conquer'd, had so great Effects, that not only many
eminent Men went over to him with their Families,
(amongst whom was <hi>Caelius,</hi> who gave Name to a
Hill in the City) but some whole Nations commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves to his Protection, and receiv'd Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This notable Success was a great Disappointment
to the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 6.</note> who resolving to correct their former
Carelessness by double Diligence, assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at <hi>Cures</hi> their Metropolis, proclaim'd War against
<hi>Rome,</hi> and made choice of <hi>Tatius</hi> their King for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
On the other side, <hi>Romulus</hi> made all possible
Provision for Resistance, fortifying the <hi>Capitoline</hi> and
<hi>Aventine</hi> Hills, and receiving Auxiliary-Troops, both
from <hi>Hetruria</hi> and his Grand-Father <hi>Numitor.</hi> The
<hi>Sabines</hi> to have the fairer Pretence, first demanded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Virgins, and to have the Authors of
the Injury deliver'd up to them; but receiving no
satisfactory Answer, both Armies drew out into the
Field, the <hi>Sabines,</hi> being 25000 Foot, and 1000 Horse,
and the <hi>Romans</hi> 20000 Poot and 800 Horse; a great
Number for a new built City. <hi>Tatius</hi> encamp'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Capitoline</hi> and <hi>Quirinal,</hi> but found 'em too
well fortify'd to be attack'd; but one <hi>Tarpeia,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Tarpeius,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Capitoline,</hi> call'd to
his Men from above, and agreed to betray the Place
into their Hands, which was in a short Time effected.
What she requir'd of 'em, as a Reward for this, was
what they wore on their left Arms, meaning their
Bracelets; but they threw their Targets upon her,
which they wore on their left Arms, and press'd her
to Death. From hence this Hill was call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d <hi>Tarpeius,</hi> till
the building of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> which made it lose the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102323:22"/>
Name, except that part of it which was call'd the
<hi>Tarpeian Rock,</hi> from whence they threw Malefactors
down headlong.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sabines,</hi> now Masters of the <hi>Capitoline,</hi> had the
Advantage of continuing the War at their pleasure;
and for a long time only light Skirmishes pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Parties, with little or no Advantage to
either side: But the Tediousness and Charge of the
War so wearied out both <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi> that
they very much desir'd a Peace, but neither side
wou'd stoop to sue for it. Thus they continu'd for a
very considerable time, till both resolving to do their
utmost, they came to a general Battel, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
several Days with almost equal Success. In
the last Contest, the <hi>Romans</hi> were much worsted in
the beginning, and fled to the <hi>Palatium;</hi> but rallying
and renewing the Fight with Success against the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
the Women who were stolen and marry'd to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and the cause of this War, through the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions
of <hi>Hersilia,</hi> one of the principal among 'em,
ran desperately into the midst of the Darts and dead
Bodies, with their Children in their Arms, and their
Hair about their Ears, making such lamentable
Shrieks and Out-crys, that both Armies immediately
desisted. These became Mediators, and made Peace
between the Fathers and Son-in-Laws, after the War
had lasted six Years. The Articles were, First, <hi>That</hi>
Romulus <hi>and</hi> Tatius <hi>shou'd reign jointly in</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">U. C. 12.</note>
                     <hi>with equal Power and Prerogative:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the

                     <hi>from</hi> Cures <hi>the native Place of</hi> Tatius:
Thirdly, <hi>That now the two Nations shou'd become one, and
as many of the</hi> Sabines <hi>as were willing, shou'd be made
Free of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>The City being now much increas'd by the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> Mount <hi>Capitoline</hi> was taken in,
built upon, and laid out for their Habitation. <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
chose out 100 of the most noble of the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102323:22"/>
and added 'em to the <hi>Senate,</hi> so that it now consisted
of 200 Persons.<note place="margin">Legions.</note> The <hi>Legions,</hi> (so call'd <hi>ab eligendo,</hi>
because they were choice select Men) which before
contain'd 3000 Men, were now encreas'd also to
4000, whence a <hi>Legion</hi> was call'd <hi>Quadrata;</hi> yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a <hi>Legion</hi> compris'd as many Men as was
found convenient for the Service of the Common-wealth.
Several new Feasts were instituted upon the
account of this Union, as <hi>Matronalia, Carmentala,</hi> &amp;c.
and a particular Respect was had to those Women
who procur'd this happy Reconciliation, and several
Privileges were allow'd 'em, particularly they were
exempted from all Work unless Spinning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Cloth. Now the <hi>Tribes</hi> were call'd by distinct
Names; the first <hi>Rhamnenses,</hi> from <hi>Romulus;</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Tatienses,</hi> from <hi>Tatius;</hi> and the third <hi>Luceres,</hi>
from the <hi>Lucus</hi> or Grove where the <hi>Asylum</hi> stood. For
five Years the two King's reign'd quietly and
peaceably together; but in the sixth, <hi>Tatius</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
some of his Friends who had robb'd and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the <hi>Lavinians,</hi> and killing the Ambassadors who
were sent to demand Satisfaction, was slain by the
<hi>Lavinians</hi> at his going to sacrifice there. <hi>Romulus,</hi>
like a generous Prince, made Satisfaction to the
injured Persons, and bury'd <hi>Tatius</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> very
honourably.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 18.</note> once more sole Monarch of <hi>Rome,</hi>
march'd against <hi>Fidenae,</hi> and subdu'd it, a Town five
Miles off <hi>Rome,</hi> that had seiz'd on Provisions coming
thither in time of Famine; and soon after, he took
<hi>Cameria,</hi> an <hi>Alban</hi> Colony not far distant; into both
which he sent a sufficient Number of <hi>Romans</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
'em, according to his usual Custom. Then he
punish'd the <hi>Crustumini,</hi> who had kill'd their Planters
which he had plac'd among 'em; and over all these
he obtain'd a second Triumph. The Action of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
against the <hi>Fidenates</hi> was extremely resented
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102323:23"/>
by the <hi>Veientes</hi> their Neighbours, who immediately
by an Embassy requir'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to withdraw
their Garrison, and restore the Inhabitants to all
their former Privileges. These <hi>Veientes</hi> were one of
the twelve Nations of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> a powerful People,
inhabiting a strong City, and of extraordinary
Largeness, situated upon a craggy Rock about
twelve Miles North of <hi>Rome.</hi> Their Demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rejected, they began their Acts of Hostility, and
both Armies met at <hi>Fidenae;</hi> where, after two sharp
Engagements, <hi>Romulus</hi> became Conqueror. The
<hi>Veientes</hi> were now forc'd to betake themselves to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
and so enter'd into a League with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
for 100 Years,<note place="margin">U. C. 21.</note> upon these Articles; <hi>To quit a
seventh part of their Dominions, with their Salt-pits nigh
the River, and to give up fifty Hostages of the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Families. Romulus</hi> for this, triumph'd a third
time, leading with him their General, an aged Man,
who had so badly perform'd his Duty, that he was
afterwards personated by an old Man in all Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>
                  <p>This was the last War manag'd by <hi>Romulus,</hi> who
after that imploy'd most of his Time in settling the
Government, and placing it upon the surest Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He made many good and profitable Laws,
most of which were unwritten. Particularly he made
one concerning Marriages, where the Authority of the
Husband was so well and conveniently settl'd, that for
520 Years, a Divorce was not known in <hi>Rome.</hi> He
gave Fathers absolute Power over their Sons, to sell,
imprison, scourge, or kill 'em, tho' in never so great
an Office, and that as long as they liv'd. He appointed
no Punishment for real <hi>Parricide,</hi> but call'd all Murder
by that Name; thinking the latter a destable Crime,
but the other impossible: And it was a indeed Crime
never known in <hi>Rome</hi> for 600 Years. For the Peoples
Way of Living, he enjoy'd two Courses of Life,
<hi>Warfare</hi> and <hi>Husbandry,</hi> equally dividing the Lands,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102323:23"/>
Slaves, and Money, taken from the Enemy; he
appointed a <hi>Market</hi> once in nine Days, which from
thence was call'd <hi>Nundinae.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nundin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> When any Town was
taken, he suffer'd no Prisoner of Man's Age to be
slain or sold, or their Lands left untill'd, but order'd
a Colony from <hi>Rome</hi> to cultivate them, and some
of the Strangers to be admitted to the Freedom
and Privileges of the City; and this was his third
Contrivance to encrease the City. As to Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
that might arise upon any Injuries, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
decided 'em, or referr'd 'em to others, infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
speedy Punishments according to the Nature
of the Crime. Finding publick Spectacles to have a
great Influence upon the People, he set up his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat
in the most conspicuous Place in the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
where his Guard of 300 <hi>Celeres,</hi> and his twelve

                  <p>In the latter end of his Reign, whether swell'd
with the Imagination of his former Successes and
present Security, or carry'd away with some pleasing
Notions of Arbitrary Government, he began to grow
very Tyrannical, inlarging his Prerogative beyond
those Bounds he had formerly set to it, and making
use of the Senate only to ratifie his Commands.
Tho' he was extreamly belov'd by the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet these Actions gain'd him the Hatred of the
Nobility and Senate, and brought him to an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Death; he being torn in pieces, as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
in the Senate House, the Senators carrying his
Body out by Piece-meal under their Gowns to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Discovery. The Senators took an occasion from
the Secrefie of the Fact, and the Concealment of the
Body, to persuade the Multitude that he was taken
up among the Gods; and <hi>Iulius Proculus,</hi> one of the
chief of the Nobility, did almost put all out of

founded a City whose Empire and Glory shou'd far surpass all
others. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their strict Exercise of Temperance and Fortitude, no human
Power shou'd e'er withstand the</hi> Roman <hi>Arms; and he
wou'd always be a propitious God to 'em, under the Name of</hi>
Quirinus.<note place="margin">Quirinus.</note> The Day, in which he was said to be
taken up, was kept after that as a great Holy-Day;
and a Temple was built in Honour of him on one
of the Seven Hills, from him call'd by the Name of
<hi>Quirinalis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He reign'd 37 Years, in which space he very much
advanc'd the State of the City, leaving in it 46000
Foot and 1000 Horse; a happy Increase for so short
a time. After his Grand-Father <hi>Numitor</hi>'s decease,
the Kingdom of <hi>Alba</hi> fell to him, which he govern'd
by Deputies; and the more to please that People,
he allow'd 'em the Privileges of a Free-State, which
probably occasion'd the Senate to bear his Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the worse. So now the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted

the greatest Vertue, Knowledge and Abilities of that
time, and had withdrawn himself from the Noises
and Troubles of the World; therefore Ambassadors,
one a <hi>Roman,</hi> and the other a <hi>Sabine,</hi> were dispatch'd
to him to offer him the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Ambassadors finding him with his Father and
Kinsman</hi> Marcius, <hi>by their Speakers,</hi> Proculus <hi>and</hi> Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
<hi>told him the occasion of their coming: To whom
the elected King made this philosophical and modest
Answer:</hi> Since every Alteration of a Man's Life is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hazardous in the Attempt, as well as dangerous in the
Consequence; it wou'd be the highest Indiscretion for one,
who, in his own Opinion, is sufficiently Happy, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or admit of any Change; tho' there were nothing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102323:26"/>
more in it than the preferring a turbulent and uncertain
Life, before a constant Quiet and certain Security. For my
part, <hi>Romans,</hi> I must freely tell you, That I am not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd,
but even deterr'd from accepting your generous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
even by what is commonly reported of your famous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi>
who was not only suspected of contriving <hi>Tatius's</hi>
death, but was likewise suppos'd to fall himself by the Rage
of the <hi>Senate.</hi> And if <hi>Romulus</hi> himself, sprung, as they
say, from Divine Race, miraculously preserv'd, and as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously
brought up, labour'd under such vast Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
how successful can I hope to be, begotten by a mere Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and brought up the ordinary Way, when I come to struggle
with such insuperable Difficulties? Besides, you much mistake
your Person, as well as forget your Interest and Glory, when
you think I can be any ways serviceable to you: For my
Temper naturally leads me to Peace, to Books, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Gods; but you <hi>Romans</hi> require a vigorous and
active King, who may diligently cherish that Warlike Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
which your late Success has excited: And therefore such
a Prince as shou'd come to inculcate Peace, Iustice, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
into the Minds of a Martial Nation, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
appear not only strange and ridiculous to the World, but
also mean and despicable to his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>were much surpriz'd at this Answer,
but still were very urgent with him to accept of the
Kingdom; in which they were not a little assisted by
his Father and</hi> Marcius, <hi>who return'd him this Reply:</hi>
Tho' you remain contented with your present fortune, and
court neither Riches nor Power; yet you may reasonably
imagine that such large Talents of Iustice, Moderation, and
Piety, were never given you by the Gods to lie useless and
conceal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d: And you are sensible these are Vertues that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have a greater Influence upon Mankind, than when they
so publickly appear in the Person of a King. <hi>Tatius,</hi> tho'
a Foreigner, was highly esteem'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the
Memory of <hi>Romulus,</hi> was so precious to 'em, that after his
decease, they voted him Divine Honours: And if the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People shou'd break out into a furious Desire of War,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102323:26"/>
what can better manage the Reins of that Passion than such
a moderating Hand as Yours? And who knows but that the
People, being ever Victorious, may be satiated with the
Spoils and Trophies they have gain'd, and gladly entertain
a mild and peaceful Prince, who being a lover of Iustice
and Equity, may settle the City in a strong and inseparable
Union, and in a sure and lasting Happiness? <hi>These Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Persuasions, together with the Ambassadors
Entreaties, at last prevail'd upon</hi> Numa <hi>to accept of
the Kingdom; and after a solemn Sacrifice he went
for</hi> Rome. <hi>He was met by the Way by the</hi> Senate
<hi>and People, who with a general Consent invested
him with the Regal Authority; and so universal was
the Joy, that they seem'd not so much to receive a
King, as the addition of a new Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Numa</hi> being a Person of extraordinary Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Policy,<note place="margin">U. C. 40.</note> as well as Devotion, thought it
most convenient to raise and strengthen that City by
wholsome Laws, and Religious Customs, which had
been founded upon War and Bloodshed; judging it
as necessary to employ a People well at home, as to
exercise 'em abroad. The first thing he did was to
disband the Royal Guard of the 300 <hi>Celeres,</hi> lest the
Maintenance of such a Force might seem to argue
a Diffidence of them that chose him, saying, <hi>That he
wou'd not Rule over that People of whom he conceiv'd the
least Distrust.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ianus.</note> Next he built a Temple to <hi>Ianus,</hi>
which was always to stand open in time of War, and to
be shut in time of Peace, as it continu'd all his Reign;
which, as some observe, never hapned but four times
from his Reign to that of <hi>Tiberius Caesar.</hi> To the two
<hi>Flamens</hi> or High-Priests of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> he added
a third of <hi>Quirinus</hi> or <hi>Romulus;</hi> and to this Prince also
is ascrib'd the bringing in of the <hi>Pontifices,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pontifices.</note> whereof he
himself was one, and officiated accordingly. He
also ordain'd the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vestal</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> being four in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to whom he gave very great Privileges; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102323:27"/>
when they went abroad they had the <hi>Fasces</hi>
carry'd before 'em, and in their Walks, if they met
with a Malefactor leading to Execution, they had
the Power of freeing him from Death, upon Oath
given that the Meeting was meerly Accidental. He
also Instituted the Orders of the <hi>Salii</hi> and the <hi>Feciales,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salii. Feciales.</note>
Priests devoted to <hi>Mars;</hi> the former were to carry
those Sacred Shields call'd <hi>Ancilia,</hi> and the latter to
judge of the Equity of War, and proclaim it with
much Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>This Prince, tho' naturally averse to all Wars, yet
consider'd that Peace and Security might too much
soften and degenerate the Minds of the Multitude;
therefore he us'd his utmost Endeavours to imprint
on their Minds the Notions of Religion and Vertue,
and the due Reverence of God: And to gain the
more Credit and Obedience to his Constitutions, he
pretended he had often and immediate Converse
with the Goddess <hi>Eg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ria,</hi> and wou'd be often telling
them that strange Visions and Apparitions were seen,
and Prophetick Voices heard; which Stories had
great and remarkable Effects upon a People so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously
inclin'd. Yet his Religion was of a refin'd
Nature, being much like that of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> afterwards;
and as he taught, <hi>That the Principle of all Things was
not to be perceiv'd by Sence, nor was liable to Motion,
but was Invisible, Immortal, and to be apprehended by the
Understanding alone;</hi> so <hi>Numa</hi> forbad the <hi>Romans</hi> to
use the Image of any God, which represented him
under the Form of a Man, or any other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
And this was strictly observ'd in all their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Sacred Places, for 170 Years at the least;
they holding it a great Crime to liken such superiour
Beings to Things so much below 'em.</p>
                  <p>For the Encouragement of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> he divided
those Lands which <hi>Romulus</hi> had gain'd in War among
the poorer sort, causing his Subjects to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Husbandry, and by such kind of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102323:27"/>
to cultivate their Minds as well as the Earth:
Then he divided all the Lands into several Parcels,
to which he gave the name of <hi>Pagi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pagus.</note> or Boroughs;
and over every one of these he ordain'd a Chief, or
Arbitrator in Judicial Causes. And that he might
take away all Distinction of <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Sabine,</hi> which
threatn'd the State with endless Factions and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Divisions, he divided all the Inhabitants accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their several <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Occupations,</hi> making e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Art a particular <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Society,</hi> and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to every one their respective Courts and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and this was his Master-piece in Politicks. He
much abated the Rigour of that Law made by <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
concerning the Power of Fathers over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
making it unlawful for 'em to sell their Sons
after Marriage, because it was very unjust that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had marry'd a Free-Man shou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to live with a Slave. He also prescrib'd Rules
concerning Mourning; a Child of Three Years, and
so upwards to Ten, was to be mourn'd for so many
Months as it was Years old; and the longest time of
Mourning for any Person, was not to exceed the
term of Ten Months: Which also was the Time
appointed for Widdows, before which, they cou'd
not, without great Indecency, marry again; but in
case Circumstances were such as not to admit of
so long a Term, they were first to sacrifice a Cow
with a Calf for Expiation of their Fault.</p>
                  <p>One of the principal Things done by this Prince
was the Reformation of the Year, which, in <hi>Romulus</hi>'s
Time was much out of Order, some Months having
more than 35 Days, and some fewer than twenty.
<hi>Numa</hi> finding the <hi>Solar</hi> Year to exceed the <hi>Lunar</hi> by
eleven Days, doubled these eleven Days, and every
other Year inserted a Month after <hi>February,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 22 Days, which was by the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd
<hi>Mercedonius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mercedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> because it was the usual time for paying
of Wages. He likewise chang'd the Order of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102323:28"/>
Months, making <hi>Ianuary</hi> and <hi>February</hi> the first and
second Months, which were the two last in <hi>Romulus's</hi>
Days.<note place="margin">The Months.</note> 
                     <hi>Ianuary</hi> had its name from <hi>Ianus,</hi> the most
ancient God or King in <hi>Italy. February</hi> was so call'd
from the <hi>Expiations</hi> which us'd to be in it, signify'd
by the wor'd <hi>Februa. March,</hi> so call'd from <hi>Mars,</hi>
the suppos'd Father of <hi>Romulus,</hi> which, upon that
account, had been plac'd first. <hi>April</hi> from <hi>Aphrodite</hi>
or <hi>Venus,</hi> because of the Superstitious Worship which
was perform'd in it, when the Women were crown'd
with Myrtle. <hi>May,</hi> so nam'd from <hi>Maia,</hi> the Mother
of <hi>Mercury,</hi> to whom this Month was made Sacred.
<hi>Iune,</hi> from <hi>Iuno,</hi> or as some will have it, from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus,</hi>
because the Season is warm, and, as it were,
<hi>Iuvenile.</hi> The rest had their Names from their
Order, as <hi>Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and <hi>December;</hi> only <hi>Quintilis</hi> and <hi>Sextilis</hi> were

<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Augustus.</hi>

                     <hi>Numa</hi> was marry'd to <hi>Tatia,</hi> King <hi>Tatius</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by whom he had one Daughter nam'd <hi>Pompilia;</hi>
and after a Reign of 43 Years, being above 80 Years
old, he dy'd, and was bury'd with great Honour
and Solemnity. He forbad his Body to be burnt, as
it was usual in those days, but was bury'd in a Stone
Coffin, under the Hill <hi>Ianiculum;</hi> and the Books of
his Ceremonies were laid by him in another, being
Twelve, written in <hi>Latin,</hi> and as many in <hi>Greek:</hi>
These were taken up about 400 Years after; and
because it was thought a piece of Impiety to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
such Mysteries to the Multitude, were burnt
by Order of the <hi>Senate.</hi> He kept the State in such a
constant Peace, by his prudent Management, as did
very much contribute to the Strength and Security
of the City, and he much improv'd and polish'd the

of <hi>Hersilia.</hi> He was of a bold and fiery Temper,
and one who often sought and greedily embrac'd all
Occasions of War; led to it partly by his own proper
Inclination, and partly by the Glory and Renown
of his Grand-Father. As he thought the Love of his
Subjects the most necessary thing to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of a Warlike Prince; so in the beginning of
his Reign he purchas'd the good Opinion of the
Poorer sort, by dividing to them, Man by Man, that
Portion of Land which his Predecessors, the two
former Kings had kept to bear their Charges, saying,
<hi>That his own Inheritance was sufficient for his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</hi>
That none of these might want Room, he
enlarg'd the City, and took in the Hill <hi>Caelius,</hi> where
he also had his Palace; and all such as had now
gotten Ground, and wanted Habitations, built upon
it; so the City encreas'd in Bulk every day.</p>

had procur'd some Persons to Rob and Pillage in the

Injury; which, when they did, he perswaded the

caus'd 'em to take up Arms: But that there might be
some Appearance of Reason, and for the greater For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
Ambassadors were sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to demand
Restitution. <hi>Hostilius</hi> presently perceiv'd the Design,

wou'd bear the greatest Blame, by nobly
treating the Ambassadors, cunningly delay'd giving
Answer, till he cou'd send to demand Restitution at

Audience to the <hi>Alban</hi> Ambassadors, telling them,
<hi>How he had receiv'd such an Answer from</hi> Alba <hi>as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd

call'd <hi>Cluilius Ditch;</hi> where, when they expected to
have decided the Quarrel, <hi>Cluilius</hi> was found dead in

is uncertain. In his Place was chosen <hi>Metius Fuffetius,</hi>
a Person who had no other Qualifications to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

<hi>Numa</hi>'s Reign were preparing and seeking for an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to shake off their Yoak, had now drawn
their Forces together at <hi>Fidenae,</hi> with Design to fall
upon both <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Albans,</hi> after they had weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102323:29"/>
themselves in Battel. The News of these Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
at first put the Armies to a stand, and made
'em both decline Fighting for a while; till at last <hi>Fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetius</hi>
fearing these People, and <hi>Hostilius</hi> desiring to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them, came both to a sort of an Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
agreeing, <hi>That for the Safety of both Nations, the
Quarrel shou'd be decided by a Combat of three Persons on
each side, and the Conquering Party shou'd obtain the Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and Command over the other.</hi> These Proposals
were no sooner ratify'd, but many Valiant Persons,
ambitious of the Honour of serving their Country,
offer'd themselves to be the Combatants, but cou'd not
be accepted of, others being before agreed upon: For
it hapned that one <hi>Segvinius</hi> of <hi>Alba</hi> had formerly
two Daughters, one marry'd to <hi>Curiatius</hi> an <hi>Alban,</hi>
and the other to <hi>Horatius</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> who being both
with Child at the same time, were deliver'd of Three
Sons at a Birth. Now, to these two Ternions of
Brothers was this great Combat committed, as being
of equal Years, Strength, and Courage; and all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Consanguinity and private Affections dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd
withal.</p>
                  <p>Now was the Fate of <hi>Rome</hi> to be decided by Six
Persons only, which rais'd all Peoples Hopes and
Fears to a more than ordinary Pitch: The Lists were
prepar'd between the two Armies, Judges were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and the Combat perform'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Pomp and Solemnity, and with as much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Resolution on both Sides. The <hi>Curiatii</hi> were
in a short time all wounded, but two of the <hi>Horatii</hi>
were slain downright, and the third, unhurt, left
to oppose three Adversaries. At this the <hi>Albans</hi> gave a
great Shout; but he, not the least daunted, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retreated as tho' he had wholly fled, and drawing
'em out severally, so as to have but one against him
at once, he slew 'em all, and <hi>Rome</hi> became Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.
At his return to the City, his Sister met
him with many provoking and reproachful Words,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102323:30"/>
for imbruing his Hands in the Blood of his Cozen-Germains,
whereof one was contracted to her; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <hi>Horatius,</hi> elevated with the Honour of his
Conquest, and transported with the Love of his
Country, slew her upon the Spot. For which Fact,
when he was accused, <hi>Hostilius</hi> avoided giving Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himself, but hereupon created those Officers,
call'd <hi>Duumviri,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Duumviri.</note> for Capital Punishments, and they
Condemn'd him: But there lying an Appeal from
these Officers to the People, they gave him his Life
at the Request of his Father, who esteem'd it as a
great and Heroick Act, and gave his Daughter Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
Burial, <hi>for a dreadful Example to all who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
Private Respect before the Publick Good. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilius</hi>
dealt very gently with the <hi>Albans,</hi> but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
for the Advantages gain'd over
them, had a Triumph.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Veientes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 85.</note> finding that they
were like to be call'd to an Account for their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Practices, now broke into open Rebellion;
and <hi>Fuffetius</hi> enrag'd at the Event of the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and hoping to free himself from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Power, privately encourag'd 'em with large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Assistance if they stood in need of it. The
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Albans</hi> now made up one Army, and
were advancing towards the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Veientes;</hi>
but, upon their nigh Approach, <hi>Fuffetius,</hi> who had
laid all his Designs before-hand, drew off all the
<hi>Alban</hi> Troops on one side, with a Resolution of
joining with the prevailing Party. The <hi>Romans,</hi>
apprehending the danger of their Separation, and
fearing some Treachery, were greatly discourag'd
at it; but <hi>Hostilius,</hi> tho' satisfy'd of the Villany, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gave it out as publickly as he cou'd, <hi>That
it was done by his Order, and was all a Stratagem to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
the Enemy:</hi> At this unexpected Report the <hi>Fidenates</hi>
and their Companions were quite disheartned, upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102323:30"/>
Suspicion of their Friends Infidelity, and, in a short
time were put to the Rout by the <hi>Romans;</hi> for which
Victory <hi>Hostilius</hi> triumph'd a second Time. After the
Battel, <hi>Fuffetius</hi> join'd with the <hi>Romans</hi> again, like one
that had done nothing amiss; but <hi>Hostilius,</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the whole Body of the <hi>Albans,</hi> and then laying
before them all his treacherous Practices and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Designs, caus'd him to be torn in pieces by
Horses; having before-hand sent <hi>Marcus Horatius</hi> to
<hi>Alba,</hi> who utterly demolish'd that City, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
the Inhabitants to <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus fell the City
of <hi>Alba,</hi> once famous for its Riches and Number of
Inhabitants, after it had flourished 487 Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> grew much in Strength, Riches, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
out of the Ruins of <hi>Alba;</hi> Mount <hi>Caelius</hi> being
appointed for the Inhabitants that came from thence;
and the King allowing 'em all the <hi>Roman</hi> Privileges.
He chose the Nobility of the <hi>Albans</hi> into the <hi>Senate,</hi>
particularly the <hi>Tullii, Servilii, Quintii, Geganii, Curiatii,</hi>
and the <hi>Claelii;</hi> and that he might out of those new
People make some Addition to the Strength of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Order, he chose ten Troops of Horse out of the
<hi>Albans:</hi> In Confidence of this his Strength, after an

He met 'em at the Wood call'd <hi>Malitiosa Sylva,</hi> where,

This War lasted most of the rest of his Days, and
in the latter end of his Reign, <hi>Rome</hi> was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Plagues and Famines, and as much
frightn'd with Prodigies. Then <hi>Hostilius</hi> began to
think of bringing in the Religious Ceremonies of
<hi>Numa,</hi> which he had all this time took little Notice
of; but soon after he died, after a Reign of 32
Years; some say by Lightning, with his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
tho' more probably by some treasonable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.
In this Reign, the 300 <hi>Celeres</hi> were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assum'd,
which had been dif-us'd in the last; and the
City was very much increas'd, tho' the Dominions
were little different from those in <hi>Romulus</hi>'s Days, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they seem'd to have a surer Footing in some Places
than before.</p>

fell into an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> as formerly; and in

                     </hi>
Arm, which he cou'd not stretch out in length, as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
has it: He was Grand-Son to <hi>Numa,</hi> the second
King of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Pompilia</hi> his Daughter, and <hi>Marcius</hi>
his Kinsman, who was the Son of that <hi>Marcius</hi> who
had persuaded <hi>Numa</hi> to accept of the Kingdom, and
after <hi>Numa's</hi> death had kill'd himself because he did
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102323:31"/>
not succeed him. This Prince was much of the
same Temper with his Grand-Father <hi>Numa;</hi> and
considering that much of the Religion, and many of
the Ceremonies had been neglected in the last Reign,
he set himself to restore them to their former Use.
For that reason he insinuated to the People, that the
Diseases, Pestilence, and other innumerable Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which had lately befallen the City, together with
the disasterous End of <hi>Hostilius,</hi> proceeded from want
of Devotion and a Neglect of their Gods. He highly
commended the Orders and Institutions of <hi>Numa,</hi>
and wou'd be often shewing the great Blessings of the
State, and how much it flourish'd under that happy
Reign; advising his Subjects to return to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
and more peaceable Employments, and to
lay aside all Sorts of Violence, and all Profit that
arises from War and Bloodshed.</p>
                  <p>The State thus setled,<note place="margin">U. C. 116.</note> he expected, as his Grand-Father
had done, to pass his time free from all Wars
and Troubles; but he soon found his Designs cross'd,
and was compell'd to be a Warrior against his Will,
and was scarce ever free from publick Perils and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
He had scarce began his Reign, and modell'd
the Commonwealth, when the <hi>Latines</hi> contemning
him as a sluggish Prince, and unfit for Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
made Incursions into the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories.
Upon which, he was oblig'd to make all necessary
Preparations for a War, proclaiming it according to
the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> appointed by his Grand-Father <hi>Numa.</hi>
First an Ambassador was sent to the Frontiers of the
Agressor's Country, who in a Woollen Shash, and a
peculiar Dress, and likewise in a solemn Form of
Speech, demanded Satisfaction; which not being
granted in 33 Days, after a Consultation with the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
the <hi>Feciales</hi> or <hi>Heraulds</hi> were immediately sent
in their proper Habits,<note place="margin">Feciales.</note> with Javelins headed with
Iron, or all bloody and burnt at the end; where
in the Presence of three young Men at least, they in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102323:32"/>
the Name of the Gods and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proclaim'd War with that Country, and then
threw their Javelins into their Confines. This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
was brought in by <hi>Numa,</hi> the Rules whereof
were taken from the <hi>Aequicoli,</hi> a very ancient People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ancus</hi> began this War with good Success, and first
took <hi>Politorium</hi> by Storm, a Town of the <hi>Latines,</hi> 14
or 15 Miles South-East of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Inhabitants of
which, according to the usual Custom, he transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Rome,</hi> allowing them the Privileges of Free
Citizens. And whereas the old <hi>Romans</hi> inhabited
the <hi>Palatine,</hi> the <hi>Sabines</hi> the <hi>Capitoline,</hi> and the <hi>Albans</hi>
the <hi>Caelian,</hi> he granted the <hi>Aventine</hi> Hill for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
to possess; the number of whom were encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
upon the subduing of <hi>Tellene</hi> and <hi>Ficania,</hi> two <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Towns nigh <hi>Politorium,</hi> which he took soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He is a little time likewise took <hi>Medallia,</hi> a
Place of considerable Strength, and also <hi>Politorium</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
for the <hi>Latines</hi> finding it empty had possess'd
themselves of it, which made <hi>Ancus</hi> intirely demolish
it. The <hi>Latines,</hi> inrag'd at their Losses, made greater
Preparations for the next Campaign; but, at several
times, he ruin'd their Designs, broke their united
Forces,<note place="margin">U. C. 117.</note> forc'd 'em to beg Peace, and obtain'd a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over 'em. Not long after he subdu'd the <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
Veientes,</hi> and the <hi>Volsci,</hi> who had fallen out with
him; and likewise such of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> who, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
felt the strength of <hi>Rome,</hi> had sorely repin'd at
the exceeding Growth of an upstart City. These
latter he overthrew again,<note place="margin">U. C. 120.</note> and obtain'd over them a
second Triumph.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Ancus</hi> did not only perform many great Acts
abroad, but also did many noble Works at home:
First upon the Account of the Success of his Arms,
he re-built the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Feretrius</hi> after a
more stately and magnificent manner than before.
He fortify'd the Hill <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> on the other side of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102323:32"/>
the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> for the greater strengthening of the
City, and to prevent its being a Refuge for Enemies,
uniting it to the City with a wooden Bridge over
that River. He likewise made a large Ditch call'd
<hi>Fossa Quiritium,</hi> which was no small Defence against
such as came from the Plains. And now, the City
having receiv'd a vast Increase, seeing that such Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of People of all sorts cou'd not but produce
many Criminals, he built a large Prison for Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
in the Heart of the City, just facing the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
to be a Terror to their growing Boldness. He
did not only enlarge the <hi>Pomaerium</hi> of the City, but
likewise its Dominions; for having taken from the
<hi>Veientes</hi> the <hi>Maesian</hi> Forest, his Territories reach'd to the
Sea,<note place="margin">U. C. 127.</note> upon which, at the Mouth of the River <hi>Tiber,</hi>
he built a Town call'd <hi>Ostia,</hi> nigh ten Miles South
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to secure the Advantages of Trade to his
Subjects; for thither Commodities being brought by
Ships, were in lesser Vessels convey'd up the <hi>Tiber</hi>
to this City; and about this Town, many Salt-pits
were made.</p>
                  <p>This Prince, as well as his Predecessors, was very
ready and careful to incourage Strangers; and by
reason of the frequent Advancement of such, and
the great Privileges they receiv'd, many came daily
hither, and often such as were of good Note. Among
these <hi>Lucumon</hi> an <hi>Hetrurian</hi> was one, a Person of great
Accomplishments as well as large Possessions, who
came hither from <hi>Tarquinia</hi> in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> with his Wife
<hi>Tanaquil,</hi> and several Followers. He was Son to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maratus</hi>
a rich Merchant of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who had left his
Country upon the account of the Troubles at that
time, and settled in <hi>Tarquinia,</hi> where marrying a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Matron, he had this Son, besides another who
died Childless. <hi>Lucumon</hi> finding no Incouragement
in his own Country, being the Son of a Foreigner,
remov'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where by his Hospitality and
Bounty he soon became known to the King; having
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102323:33"/>
now taken upon him the Name of <hi>Lucius,</hi> adding that
of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> from the Place of his Birth. He was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
treated by <hi>Ancus,</hi> to whom he generously
offer'd his whole Patrimony for the Publick Good,
and by that means obtain'd Freedom for himself and
Followers, with Lands both for Building and for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance.
<hi>Ancus</hi> in a little time chose him into the
<hi>Senate,</hi> for he was greatly esteem'd by the King, and
as much belov'd by the People; no Man being more
hardy in War, or more prudent in Councel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ancus</hi> bestow'd most of his latter Time in inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Subjects and improving the City, and at the
end of 24 Years Reign he died; a Prince not inferior
to any of his Predecessors, either for the Glory
he gain'd in Peace or War. He left behind him two
Sons, both under Age, which he committed to the
Guardianship of the foremention'd <hi>Lucius Tarquinius,</hi>
as the fittest Person he cou'd employ in such an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions were now encreas'd
beyond what they were in the last Reign, by a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Part of <hi>Hetruria</hi> taken from the <hi>Veientes,</hi> and a
much better Footing in <hi>Latium.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102323:33"/>
busie about the Election of a King, having
great hopes of it himself: Therefore to remove all
Obstacles to his Designs, he sent <hi>Ancus</hi>'s two Sons out a
Hunting, the eldest being then nigh 14 Years of Age,
and assembling the People, he made a plausible
Speech to 'em, wherein he plainly begg'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
urging the Examples of <hi>Tatius</hi> and <hi>Numa; the
first an Enemy as well as a Stranger, and the second whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unacquainted with the City; whereas he himself was so
great a Friend to the City, that he had spent all his Riches
upon it; and so well acquainted with it, that he had been
train'd up several Years both in Civil and Military Affairs
under their King.</hi> Then he cunningly insinuated his
past Services, and insisting more than ordinary upon
his Liberality, he obtain'd the Kingdom, being the
first who obtain'd it by his own ambitious seeking.
At the beginning of his Reign, the better to gain
the Love of the Common People, he chose out 100
of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> who for Valour or Wisdom were
most Eminent, and added them to the <hi>Senate,</hi> which
made up the Number 300; those of <hi>Romulus</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Virgins from four to seven; but <hi>Plutarch</hi> says there
were but two before.</p>
                  <p>His first War was with the <hi>Latines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 139.</note> from whom he

Issue of his Brother, surnam'd <hi>Egerius</hi> from his

the <hi>Latines</hi> great Supplies from <hi>Hetruria,</hi> he

                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Tarquin</hi> was no less mindful of strengthning
the City at home, than of enlarging his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
abroad; for when he found leisure, he built
the Walls of the City, which before were patch'd
up in haste, with large square Stone, each consisting
of a Load Weight. Then he took care of the other
publick Buildings of the City, adorning the <hi>Forum</hi>
with lofty <hi>Portico's, Galleries,</hi> and <hi>Shops,</hi> being a Prince
much delighted with stately Buildings and noble
Sights.<note place="margin">Cloacae.</note> He likewise made many <hi>Cloacae</hi> or <hi>Common-Sewers,</hi>
to drain the City, and carry the Filth of it
into the <hi>Tiber;</hi> a Work of such vast Charge and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that when they were afterwards stopp'd, the
<hi>Censors</hi> spent a Thousand Talents only to clear 'em;
a Work likewise so admirable, that <hi>Dionysius</hi> thinks,
that from the Magnificence of these, as well as their
<hi>Aquaeducts</hi> and <hi>High-ways,</hi> the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire appear'd. In the <hi>Circus Maximus,</hi> that vast
Place for Games and Exercises between the <hi>Palatine</hi>
and <hi>Aventine</hi> Hills, he caus'd Seats to be rais'd for the
Spectators, with great Skill and Charge; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
distinguish'd all their Places according to their
several Ranks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dignities. In the <hi>Sabine</hi> War he
vow'd a Temple to <hi>Iupiter, Iuno,</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> if he
got the Victory; for that reason afterwards he, with
wonderful Cost levelled the Rock on the <hi>Capitoline,</hi>
and form'd a Plat for building it, but liv'd not to go
on with it any further; and this was the beginning
of the <hi>Capitol.</hi>

                     <hi>Tarquin</hi> had design'd after these things, to have
added three Centuries of the <hi>Celeres</hi> to those three
Instituted by <hi>Romulus,</hi> but was forbidden by <hi>Actius
Naevius</hi> to alter the Constitutions of that King;
therefore without creating of new <hi>Centuries,</hi> he
doubled the Number of the former. This <hi>Naevius</hi>
was the most famous <hi>Augur</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> ever knew;
and <hi>Tarquin</hi> one time, to try him, ask'd him, <hi>If what

the Reputation of <hi>Augury,</hi> especially of <hi>Naevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
Skill therein; but his being suddenly miss'd soon

Throne, accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Objections, and clear'd him of that Scandal. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Design, they pretended Repentance,
and were easily receiv'd into Favour; but three Years
after, they disguised several of their Companions
like Shepherds, and appearing in Court, pretended
a Quarrel, and demanded Justice of the King. <hi>Tarquin</hi>
appearing, they set upon him, and kill'd him; but
were soon caught, and receiv'd their just Reward.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell <hi>Lucius Tarquinius,</hi> for distinction surnam'd

and Magnificence began to appear much more
in this Reign than in the former; and this King was
the first that ever Triumph'd in a Chariot: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

II. Not long after his Settlement,<note place="margin">U. C. 177.</note> according to his
Promise, he divided the publick Lands among the
poorer Sort; and in the <hi>Curiata Comitia,</hi> preferr'd fifty
several Laws concerning Contracts and Injuries. He
very much enlarg'd the City, taking in three Hills to
the four former, namely, the <hi>Quirinal,</hi> the <hi>Viminal,</hi>
and the <hi>Esquiline;</hi> on the latter of which he dwelt
himself, and compass'd the whole Seven with a
stately Wall: Some say the Walls were never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
further, tho' vast Suburbs were afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
After this, he divided the City into four Parts,
and instead of three, made four <hi>Tribes,</hi> which he
call'd by the names of <hi>Palatina, Suburana, Collina,</hi>
and <hi>Esquilina.</hi> As <hi>Romulus,</hi> according to their Seats
and Communions in Sacrifices, distinguish'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

their Estates and Riches, distinguish'd 'em into six
<hi>Ranks</hi> call'd <hi>Classes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Classes.</note> His principal Design was to know
how many were fit to bear Arms, and what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
might be supply'd for Wars and other Uses. These
<hi>Classes</hi> were each divided into <hi>Centuries</hi> (the Word here
signifying such a particular Division,<note place="margin">Centuries.</note> and not 100 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)
which made up 193 in all. The first consisted
of such as were worth 110000 <hi>Asses,</hi> (each answering
to <hi>obq</hi> of our Money) and contain'd 98 <hi>Centuries,</hi> the
<hi>Equites</hi> or <hi>Knights</hi> being reckon'd in: The second va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd
at 75000 <hi>Asses,</hi> containing 22 <hi>Centuries,</hi> taking

likewise 22 <hi>Centuries;</hi> the fourth at 25000 <hi>Asses,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
20 <hi>Centuries;</hi> the fifth at 11000 <hi>Asses,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

rest of the poorer Sort and Multitude, excepting Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Slaves, which made up but one <hi>Century.</hi>

the richer, went to War by Turns, and paid but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Tribute; and the poorer Sort scarce bore any
Share at all. This seem'd very just to him, that they
who were most concern'd shou'd take most Pains,
and bear the greatest Charge; the <hi>Romans</hi> at that
time maintaining themselves in the Wars without any
Pay from the Publick. But to the richer Sort, who
sustain'd most of the Charge and Danger, the King
made a sufficient Recompence, by giving 'em much
the larger Authority in the Government, which he
Politickly brought about this way: Formerly the
Matters of the greatest Concern, namely, <hi>The Creation
of all Magistrates, making or repealing of Laws,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing
of Peace and War,</hi> were all voted in the <hi>Comitia
Curiata;</hi> where every particular and private Person
having an equal Vote, the <hi>Plebeians</hi> being most nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
had in a manner the whole Power in their
Hands. But <hi>Tullius,</hi> upon these and the like occasions,
assembled the People according to their <hi>Centuries,</hi>
which were call'd <hi>Comitia Centuriata,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Comitia Centuriata.</note> where the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians</hi>
must of necessity be out-voted, having little
more than the Shadow of Authority; which they,
for many Years, were sufficiently satisfy'd withal;
either for that they perceived not the Design, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because they were thereby freed from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the Charges, Troubles, and Dangers of
the Publick.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Census</hi> or Tax, <hi>Tullius</hi> first instituted the
<hi>Lustrum</hi> to be Celebrated,<note place="margin">Lustrum. U. C. 187.</note> so call'd <hi>à luendo,</hi> from
Paying. On a certain day after the <hi>Valuation</hi> or <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
he ordain'd all the Citizens to meet in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Martius,</hi> all in Armour, each Man in his proper
<hi>Class</hi> and <hi>Century;</hi> where, by solemn Sacrifices, the
City was <hi>Expiated</hi> or <hi>Lustrated.</hi> This great Solemnity
was call'd <hi>Salitaurilia,</hi> or rather <hi>Suovetaurilia,</hi> because
a Hog, a Sheep, and an Ox were there Sacrific'd.
These things perform'd, the <hi>Lustrum</hi> was finish'd,
which, because of the continual Change of Mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102323:39"/>
he order'd shou'd be reiterated every five Years;
so that the old and proper <hi>Lustrum</hi> contain'd five
Years compleat, which was as often as this <hi>Tax</hi> or
<hi>Valuation,</hi> call'd <hi>Census,</hi> was made; tho' afterwards
the <hi>Iulian Lustrum</hi> contain'd but four. <hi>Tullius</hi> held
the <hi>Lustrum</hi> four times in his Reign, and at the first
were found 84700 free Citizens; but, to encrease
their Number, he brought in the Custom of making
Slaves Free of the Common-wealth, either for their
Money or their Deserts, who being <hi>Manumitted,</hi> he
distributed into the four <hi>Tribes</hi> of the City. <hi>Slaves,</hi>
as was hinted before, had never any Vote in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and these were either made or born so;
the former sort were taken in War, thence properly
call'd <hi>Mancipia;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mancipia.</note> and the latter sort came of Parents
who were such, or of the Mother only.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Division of the City it self, this Prince
took an extraordinary Care about the <hi>Roman</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
dividing the whole Territory into 26 Parts,
which he likewise call'd by the name of <hi>Tribes;</hi> and
these he again distinguish'd into their several <hi>Pagi,</hi>
appointing for 'em their respective Officers and Places
of Worship, as <hi>Numa</hi> had done when the Dominions
were much smaller. In his way of judging of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
he gave away much of the Kingly Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;
for whereas the former Princes call'd before
themselves all Controversies, and took Cognizance
of Crimes committed against private Persons, as well
as the Publick, he separated their Causes, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Judge only of such as respected the Common-wealth,
referring the Quarrels of particular Persons to
others, to whom he prescrib'd Laws and Rules to go
by; and if any Controversie arose between particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Towns, it was to be decided by the Judgment of
others. After he had thus order'd the Common-wealth,
he caus'd the <hi>Latines</hi> to build a Temple to
<hi>Diana,</hi> upon the <hi>Aventine</hi>-Hill, at which place they
shou'd meet and Feast every Year, and so preserve
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102323:40"/>
themselves as one Body Politick in Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
To all these things we may add, that he was
the first who Coin'd Money in <hi>Rome,</hi> stamping it
with the Image of a Sheep, whence it had the Name
of <hi>Pecunia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pecunia.</note> whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> before this time us'd
it in a rude Lump or Mass.</p>
                  <p>III. At the same time that <hi>Tullius</hi> was settling and
ordering the Affairs of the Common-wealth at
home, he was often employ'd in many and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wars abroad: For the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> looking upon
him as an obscure Man, and a private Person, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to pay him Obedience, and renounc'd the
League made with his Predecessor <hi>Tarquin.</hi> He had
Wars with 'em for 20 Years successively, overthrew
'em in many Battels, and Triumph'd over 'em three
several times; the first time in the Year 182, the
second in 186, and the third time in 188. And at
last he so weakned and harras'd them, that they
were willing to beg Peace of him, which he granted
'em upon the same Terms that <hi>Tarquin</hi> before had
impos'd upon 'em; only from three of the twelve
Nations, namely, the <hi>Veientes,</hi> the <hi>Caeretanes,</hi> and the
<hi>Tarquinii,</hi> which had been Principals in the Revolt,
he took part of their Lands, and divided 'em among
such as were lately made free of <hi>Rome.</hi> At the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of these Wars, he built two Temples, both
dedicated to <hi>Fortune,</hi> one to <hi>Fortuna Bona,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Fortuna Virilis.</hi> In the latter end of his Reign
he design'd to have laid down his Office, and restor'd
absolute Liberty, with the Care of the Common-wealth
to the People, and was preparing a Model
for that purpose, but liv'd not to perform it; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
old, and not far from the natural Period of his
Life, he was slain by his Daughter and Son-in-Law,
after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tullius</hi> had two Daughters, whom he marry'd to
<hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Grandsons, <hi>Lucius Tarquinius</hi> and <hi>Aruns Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius.</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:102323:40"/>
The first, of a proud <hi>tyrannical</hi> Nature, had
a very modest good Wife; and the last, of a mild
sweet Temper, had a haughty wicked Woman. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
inrag'd at <hi>Tullius</hi> for possessing his Grand-Father's
Throne, and finding his Brother's Wife of a fiery
Temper, and rather more cruel than himself, agreed
with her to change Husbands; both promising to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
their Consorts, which they soon effected, and
were marry'd together. After this, they resolv'd the
utter Ruine of the King, raising what Factions they
cou'd against him, alledging his illegal Title, then
claim'd the Crown as Heirs to <hi>Tarquin.</hi> But <hi>Tullius</hi>
by his great Modesty and prudent Management, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
all their Designs, and came off with great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
both with the <hi>Senate</hi> and the People; which
brought <hi>Lucius</hi> to a feign'd Repentance on his side,
and that produc'd a real Reconciliation on the King's.
<hi>Lucius,</hi> cover'd with this Disguise, took an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one day, when most of the People were out of the
City, to go to the <hi>Senate-House,</hi> with the Robes and
Royal Ensigns as King; and getting together such of
the Fathers as were his special Friends, he boldly took
Possession of the King's Throne. <hi>Tullius</hi> unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a few Followers hastned thither, and going
to thrust him out, <hi>Lucius</hi> threw him down the Stairs.
The old Man, hardly recovering his Spirits, was led
homewards in great Disorder, when <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Wife
coming to see the Event, saluted her Husband King,
and advis'd him to send after <hi>Tullius,</hi> and dispatch
him; which was immediately perform'd. In her Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
home, coming to the Place where the Body lay,
weltring in Blood, and as yet almost gasping, her
Charioteer stood still, startl'd and amaz'd at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Spectacle, not having Room to pass by it:
Whereupon she in a Rage threw her Footstool at his
Head, and in a barbarous manner forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her over it; the Place which before was call'd <hi>Cyprius
Vicus,</hi> was after this Act call'd <hi>Sceleratus.</hi>

                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:102323:41"/>
This was the End of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> a Prince of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Justice and Moderation, after a prosperous
Reign of 44 Years; but the less pity'd upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his undue Admission to the Crown, which
made most of the <hi>Patritians</hi> espouse his Successor's
part; especially since he was about altering the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which wou'd have prov'd the Weakning,
if not the Ruine of their Authority. He left the
<hi>Roman</hi> Dominions in much the same Condition as
they were in the last Reign, only he got a larger
Footing in <hi>Hetruria.</hi>

He murder'd such as he suspected to be of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>'s

of his Tyranny, he kept a stronger Guard than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102323:41"/>
he decided himself, assisted by his intimate
Friends; and executed, banish'd, and fin'd, all at
his own Pleasure. He endeavour'd to establish his
Tyranny with the more Security, by great Alliances,
marrying his Daughter to <hi>Octavius Mamilius,</hi> the
greatest Man among the <hi>Latines,</hi> being descended
from <hi>Telegonus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ulysses</hi> by <hi>Circe;</hi> and by his
false Accusations and a cunning Device, caus'd 'em
to stone <hi>Turnus Herdonius,</hi> who had discover'd to 'em
his Baseness and Villany. He neither consider'd the

of many of the higher Rank, whose Wealth he
seiz'd on for his own use, resolving to chuse no more
in their Places, that their Power might decrease in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly,
and in time be worn out.</p>
                  <p>Among those whom he murder'd for their Estates,
<hi>Marcus Iunius</hi> was one; a most eminent Man among

and marry'd to <hi>Tarquina,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Tarquinius
Priscus,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Lucius Iunius.</hi> This <hi>Lucius</hi>
was nobly educated, and had an admirable Wit and
Knowledge, with a profound Judgment and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
but after <hi>Tarquin</hi> had privily murder'd his
Father and his eldest Brother, the better to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and revenge his Father, he counterfeited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Fool, and thence had the Surname of <hi>Brutus.
Tarquin</hi> thinking his Folly real, despis'd the Man;
and having possess'd himself of his Estate, kept him
as an Ideot in his House, suffering him to converse
with his Children, not out of any Respect as a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but to make 'em Sport by his ridiculous Words
and Actions. It hapn'd in the time of a great Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
he sent his two Sons <hi>Sextus</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Oracle, and with them <hi>Brutus,</hi> as a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for their Diversion. The Sons were well pleas'd
with his Company, and laugh'd very heartily to see
him offer a wooden Staff to <hi>Apollo,</hi> wherein he had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102323:42"/>
secretly convey'd Gold. The young Men having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
their Father's Commands, enquir'd of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
<hi>Which of them shou'd be Prince of</hi> Rome? It was
answer'd, <hi>He who first shou'd kiss his Mother;</hi> which
the Sons misunderstanding, agreed to do it both at
their return, and reign jointly together. But <hi>Brutus,</hi>
knowing the meaning of the Oracle, as soon as they
arriv'd at <hi>Italy,</hi> pretended to fall down by chance, and
kiss'd the Earth, which is the common Mother of
all Men. After this, he ever made it his Business to
find Opportunities of ruining the Tyrant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the Liberties of <hi>Rome;</hi> all which he carry'd
on by a profound Secrecy and a wonderful Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Tarquin</hi> being a Warlike Prince, first march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Sabines,</hi> who refus'd to pay him Obedience,
and soo reduc'd them to Submission; over whom he
obtain'd a Triumph.<note place="margin">U. C. 223.</note> Soon after, he began a War with
the <hi>Volsci,</hi> a People bordering on <hi>Latium,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
with some little Intermissions above 200
Years: From these he took <hi>Suessa-Pometia,</hi> a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
City about 26 Miles South-East of <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he found great Spoils and Plunder; and over them
he obtain'd a second Triumph. Next he fell upon
<hi>Gabii,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 225.</note> a City of great Note, 10 or 11 Miles East of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which had taken part with <hi>Suessa-Pometia:</hi> He
invested it, but meeting with great Difficulties, he
caus'd his eldest Son <hi>Sextus</hi> to counterfeit Desertion,
upon Pretence of barbarous Usage from his Father;
who being honourably receiv'd by the <hi>Gabines,</hi> by
his cunning and insinuating Behaviour, got to be
their Governour. After some time he sent to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to know what Measures to take; <hi>Tarquin</hi> took
the Messenger into the Garden, and, in imitation of
<hi>Thrasybulus</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> cut down the tallest Poppies
before his Face, then dismiss'd him without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Answer. <hi>Sextus,</hi> knowing the meaning of all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102323:42"/>
that, put to death the most principal Citizens, and
easily betray'd the Place into his Father's Hands.<note place="margin">U. C. 232.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, <hi>Tarquin</hi> made a League with the <hi>Aequi,</hi> a
neighbouring People between the <hi>Volsci</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
and renew'd that with the <hi>Hetrurians.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tarquin,</hi> having gain'd great Riches and Spoils from
<hi>Suessa-Pometia,</hi> resolv'd to set about the Temple his
Grand-Father had design'd; and when he found some
Respite from War, he employ'd a great number of
Workmen about it.<note place="margin">U. C. 240.</note> At their digging to lay the
Foundation, a Man's Head was found bleeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
belonging to one <hi>Tolus,</hi> which gave the Name
of <hi>CAPITOL</hi> to the Building.<note place="margin">Capitol.</note> It was seated upon
a high Crag or Rock on Mount <hi>Capitoline,</hi> which
from <hi>Romulus</hi>'s time had been call'd <hi>Mons Tarpeius,</hi> and
before that <hi>Saturnius.</hi> It was eight Acres in compass,
200 Foot long, and as many broad wanting 15 Foot,
its height being equal to its length; a most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Building, dedicated to <hi>Iupiter</hi> in Chief, but
containing three Temples within the same Walls, the
middle belonging to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and the other two to
<hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> all under the same Roof. It had
a noble Front, looking towards the <hi>South,</hi> to the
grand <hi>Forum,</hi> the most frequented part of the whole
City. It had also a stately Porch or Gallery, with
three Rows of Pillars, each side having a double Row;
and to this they ascended by an hundred Steps,
with large Spaces between several of 'em. To carry
on this great Work, <hi>Tarquin</hi> employ'd much of the
Publick Money and Stock, and likewise the Labour
of the Common People; but the Building was not
finish'd till two Years after his Banishment.</p>
                  <p>The Building of the <hi>Capitol</hi> was not only counted
a great Ornament to the City, in respect of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
but was likewise look'd upon as a very great
Blessing upon the account of Religion: And in the
same Reign another, as great in their Opinion, hapned
likewise to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was this. A certain
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102323:43"/>
strange Woman came to the King, offering to fell
him nine Books of the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sibyl</hi>'s Books.</note> He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to buy 'em at her Rate, she departed, and
burning three of 'em, return'd, demanding as much
for the six remaining. Being laugh'd at for a Mad-Woman,
she again departed, and burning half of 'em,
return'd with the other three, still asking as much as
at first. <hi>Tarquin,</hi> surpriz'd at the Strangeness of the
Thing, immediately sent for the <hi>Augurs</hi> to know her
Meaning; who much blam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d him for not buying the
nine, and advis'd him to buy the three at the same
Rate. The Woman, after the Sale and Delivery, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
him to have a special care of 'em, vanish'd,
and was never after seen, as <hi>Dionysius</hi> relates the Story.
<hi>Tarquin</hi> chose two Men out of the Nobility to keep
them, to whom he allow'd two Publick Servants;
but afterwards, in the time of the Common-wealth,
they were kept with the greatest Care imaginable,
fifteen of the most eminent Persons of the Nobility
being chosen and appointed to keep 'em in a Stone
Chest, in a Vault under the <hi>Capitol;</hi> and these were
exempted from all other Burthens both Military and
Civil; and for them only it was lawful to look in
'em. These Magistrates from their Number were
afterwards call'd <hi>Quindecemviri.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri.</note> These Oracles were
consulted by the <hi>Senate</hi>'s Decree in times of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

Wives, spending her Time in Ease and Idleness, but

At Midnight he found Means to convey himself into
her Bed-Chamber, approach'd her Bed-side with his

Breast, threatned her with present Death if she offer'd
to stir or speak. The poor Lady, affrighted out of her
Sleep, and seeing Death so nigh, was in the greatest

Passion, withal, endeavour'd to corrupt her with the

in vain. At last he told her, <hi>If she wou'd not yield, he
wou'd first kill her, then lay his own Slave dead by her side,
and report it was for surprizing her in Adultery with him;</hi>
by which means he obtain'd his End; and in the
Morning he departed. <hi>Lucretia,</hi> inrag'd at this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

                     </gap>d the Knife to the rest, who, all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102323:44"/>
wondring at so extraordinary a Change in <hi>Brutus,</hi>
swore as he had done; and turning their effeminate
Sorrow to a masculine Fury, they resolv'd to follow
his Instructions, and extirpate Kingly Government.
<hi>Brutus,</hi> as soon as he could, procur'd the Gates of
the City to be shut, that all might be kept secret
from <hi>Tarquin,</hi> till such time as the People might be
assembled, the dead Body expos'd, and a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
for <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Banishment procur'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Senate being assembled, all shew'd their Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to banish</hi> Tarquin, <hi>but at first had very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Opinions concerning the new Modelling of the
Government, which probably might make it a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Business.</hi> Brutus <hi>represented to 'em the absolute
Necessity of a quick Dispatch, and immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
'em a Form of Government; shewing them,</hi>
That before <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s violating his own and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
Oath, <hi>Rome</hi> had been happy and famous, both
for her Acts abroad, and her Constitutions at home; and
that the <hi>Regal Power</hi> had at last been dangerous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
destructive to the Security of the State, and the Safety
of the People; and therefore was not to be trusted in one
Man's hands, but two were to be chosen, who shou'd govern
with equal Authority and Command. Then, because Names
alone were offensive to many People, he thought that of
<hi>Kingdom</hi> was to be left off, and the other of <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
to be assum'd; and, instead of the Title of <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Monarch,</hi> some more Modest and Popular was to be
invented; as likewise were some of their <hi>Ensigns</hi> to be laid
aside, and others to be retain'd. That the main and only
thing to keep these Magistrates in Order, was, to prevent
their perpetual Power; and if they were <hi>Annual,</hi> after the
manner of <hi>Athens,</hi> each might learn both how to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and how to Govern. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That the Name of <hi>King</hi>
might not be wholly lost, the Title was to be given to one who
shou'd be call'd <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rex Sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> who having this Honour for
Life, and Immunity from Warfare, shou'd only concern himself
with those <hi>Religious Rites</hi> which the King had Charge of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102323:45"/>
before. <hi>The Particulars of this Speech were all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of by the</hi> Senate, <hi>who immediately issued out
a Decree for the King's Banishment in this Form,</hi>
That the <hi>Tarquinii</hi> should be banish'd with all their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
and that it should be Capital for any one to speak or
act for their Return.</p>
                  <p>Brutus <hi>having procur'd thus much, the</hi> Comitia <hi>were

<hi>to their great Surprise, discover'd himself, telling 'em
the Reasons of his long and strange Dissimulation,
and the great Occasion of their present Meeting,

that it was a shame to think of Commanding the <hi>Volsci,

In the mean time, <hi>Tarquin</hi> having heard
something of these Transactions, came riding in all

him; but finding the Gates fast shut, and the Walls

                     </gap>d to the
Camp. But <hi>Brutus</hi> foreseeing his sudden Coming,
had industriously got before him to the Army another
Way, and acquainted them with the Decree both of
Senate and People, pressing 'em hard to a Revolt.
Immediately their Suffrages were call'd over accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their <hi>Centuries,</hi> and they unanimously agreed
to do exactly as their Friends in the City had done;
so that when <hi>Tarquin</hi> return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, they refus'd to admit
him. Thus frustrated of his Hopes, he went to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii,</hi>
or to <hi>Caere</hi> in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> now Grey-headed, having
reign'd 25 Years.<note place="margin">U. C. 245.</note> 
                     <hi>Herminius</hi> and <hi>Horatius,</hi> Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the Army, made a Truce with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for 15 Years, and raising the Siege before <hi>Ardea,</hi>
return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with all their Forces.</p>
                  <p>IV. Such was the End of the <hi>Regal State of Rome,
245</hi> Years after the Building of the City, in the first
Year of the <hi>68th. Olympiad, A. M.</hi> 3496, 31 Years
after the Ruine of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire, and the
setting up of the <hi>Persian,</hi> 179 before the beginning
of the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and 507 before our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi>
occasion'd by a Man who knew neither how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
according to the Laws, nor yet to reign against
them. The <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions now contain'd most
of Old <hi>Latium,</hi> with the greatest part of the <hi>Sabines</hi>
Country, a considerable part of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102323:46"/>
of the <hi>Veientes, Caeretanes,</hi> and <hi>Tarquinii,</hi> besides
some small Parts of the <hi>Volsci</hi> and <hi>Aequi;</hi> being much
about 40 Miles long and 30 broad; a Spot of Ground
not so large by a fourth part as either the Dukedoms
of <hi>Modena, Parma,</hi> or <hi>Mantua,</hi> and not much larger
than the Territory of the Commonwealth of <hi>Luca:</hi>
so that this was rightly term'd by Historians, the
<hi>Infancy</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially since most of these Parts
were both able and ready to Revolt upon every little
Occasion, as the <hi>Romans</hi> often found afterwards;
so that it cost 'em many Years trouble, and many
hazardous Wars before they cou'd wholly subdue
'em, and much enlarge their Dominions.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon the City it self at this time, we
may find it encreased after a far greater Proportion
than formerly, and its large Extent, its numerous
Inhabitants, and its magnificent Structures, were
happy Fore-runners of its future Grandeur and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
And these, together with the wise Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of its Prince, and the great Prudence and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of its <hi>Senate,</hi> were the main Supporters and
Preservers of it, in the midst of so many envious
Neighbours and powerful Enemies; tho' indeed
the Inhabitants themselves were an extream rough
and unpolish'd People, little acquainted with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Learning, and far unlike their Successors in
Skill and Conduct: Their Engagements were more
like so many Tumults than real Battels, where Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
in Fighting generally supply'd the place of
Discipline in War; only they had the good Fortune
to deal with Neighbours who had more Barbarity and
Ignorance than themselves. In short, what may
truly be affirm'd of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> is, they were a
People of most extraordinary Courage and Fierceness,
a People of prodigious Hardiness and Austerity of Life,
a People of indefatigable Industry, and wonderful Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their Country; and from these main Springs
afterwards proceeded many great and noble Actions.</p>

Before the Conclusion of this First Book, to make
the <hi>Roman History</hi> as clear and intelligible as possible,
it may be convenient to give a Hint of the several
Countries the <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards became Masters of.
First <hi>Gaul,</hi> which was then inhabited by an uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,
tho' a Warlike People, was broken and divided
into a great number of petty Governments. <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Germany</hi> was much in the same Condition, and
<hi>Britain</hi> not much better, as likewise was <hi>Dacia</hi> and
<hi>Illyricum. Greece</hi> was in a most flourishing wealthy
Condition, under several Monarchs of Renown, and
powerful Common-wealths, but not long after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
subject to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire. <hi>Asia Minor</hi>
was almost in the same Condition, then subjected to
the <hi>Persian,</hi> and next to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empires, but
at last partly freed from the latter. <hi>Armenia</hi> was a
considerable Monarchy. <hi>Syria, Chaldea, Assyria,</hi> and
<hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> were all powerful States, but successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subject to the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empires, the
first of which prov'd a separate Kingdom. <hi>Iudaea</hi> was
a small but noble Kingdom. <hi>Egypt</hi> was also a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Kingdom, subject to its own Kings. <hi>Africa</hi>
was a powerful and growing Common-wealth, who
had <hi>Sicily</hi> in a great measure. As for <hi>Italy</hi> it self, that
was divided among many petty Nations and People,
as was observ'd in the beginning.</p>

the Common Good of the People: They

than 43 Years old, or nigh, and of excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
as long as there was little or no Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The <hi>Consular</hi> Power was at first equal to the
<hi>Regal,</hi> till in a short time <hi>Poplicola</hi> brought in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>Appealing</hi> to the People: Yet, after this,
their Authority was very large, for <hi>they were the Heads
of the People and Senate, superiour to all other Magistrates,
govern'd the State, dispos'd of the Publick Revenues, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister'd
Iustice, call'd and dismiss'd the Senate, and all
General Assemblies, had all the Laws enacted in their
Names, led Armies, appointed Officers, treated with all
Foreign Princes and Ambassadors, and transacted many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Things in their own Names.</hi> They had also the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Ornaments us'd by the Kings, as the <hi>Golden Crown,
Sceptre, Purple Robes, White Robes</hi> the twelve <hi>Lictors,</hi>
with the <hi>Axes</hi> and <hi>Fasces,</hi> the <hi>Ivory</hi> and <hi>Curule</hi> Chairs;
only to prevent the People's Jealousies, the <hi>Crowns</hi> and
<hi>Sceptres</hi> were never us'd but upon extraordinary Days
of Triumph; and commonly one was attended by
the <hi>Axes,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Rods,</hi> changing each
Month. The first Consuls were <hi>L. Iunius Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>L. Tarquinius Collatinus,</hi> who had been the Authors of
this Settlement; and they immediately reviv'd the
Laws of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> concerning Publick Meetings
and Assemblies, with other things that conduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to
the Satisfaction of the common sort, who look'd
upon their ancient Rights as newly recover'd.</p>
                  <p>Before Affairs were perfectly settled in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
some Ambassadors from <hi>Hetruria</hi> arriv'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> in behalf of the late King <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who was
now so mortifi'd, and so sensible of his Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he made very large Promises of observing
all regular Administration for the future, <hi>If they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102323:48"/>
wou'd receive him as their lawful King.</hi> When this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
cou'd not be heard, the Ambassadors only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd,
<hi>That he might have his Goods return'd him, at least
such as were his Grand-father</hi> Priscus'<hi>s, who had deserv'd
no Ill at their hands.</hi> But <hi>Brutus</hi> very violently oppos'd
that Demand, as being almost as dangerous as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he esteeming it no good Policy to furnish an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
with Money against themselves; however his
Collegue <hi>Collatine</hi> most readily comply'd with it, but
putting it to the Vote, it pass'd in the Negative, the
Voices being very nigh equal. The Ambassadors
meeting with no Success, according to their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
made several plausible Excuses for tarrying in
<hi>Rome</hi> longer than ordinary; and in that time, by their
cunning Management and fair Promises, found means
to draw over some of <hi>Collatine</hi>'s Family to their sides,
namely, two of the <hi>Aquilii,</hi> and three of the <hi>Vitellii,</hi>
together with <hi>Brutus</hi>'s two Sons, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
These, with some other, all join'd in a Conspiracy,
keeping their private Meetings at the House of the
<hi>Aquilii,</hi> there to consult about, and manage their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
which were to kill both the <hi>Consuls,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to re-inthrone <hi>Tarquin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Conspirators cou'd not long conceal their
Practices, but were discover'd by a Slave call'd <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius,</hi>
who had accidentally hid himself in the same
Room, fearing to be found there, and not having
time to come out. Now <hi>Vindicius,</hi> fearing to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this strange Accident to either of the Consuls,
upon the Account of such a nigh Relation, went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>Valerius,</hi> afterwards call'd <hi>Poplicola,</hi> a great
Assistant in this Revolution, and laid open the
whole Plot. <hi>Valerius</hi> was much startled at the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
therefore to proceed warily, he first secur'd
the Slave to have him in readiness; then sending
his Brother <hi>Marcus</hi> to beset the King's Palace, and
watch all the Servants there, he himself, with his
Friends and Clients went to the House of the <hi>Aquilii,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102323:49"/>
where he seiz'd on several Letters writ to <hi>Tarquin</hi> by
these Conspirators. The <hi>Aquilii</hi> being abroad, met
'em at the Gate, where they endeavour'd to recover
the Letters by force of Arms; but <hi>Valerius,</hi> by the
help of his Followers, violently dragg'd 'em to the
<hi>Forum,</hi> where he found some of the King's Servants
with other Letters, who had been likewise forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his Brother <hi>Marcus.</hi> The People throng'd on
all sides, but the Consul's Sons drew the Eyes of the
whole Multitude upon 'em, and several Tumults were
like to arise, till both the Consuls came, and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tribunal, appeas'd all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vindicius</hi> was immediately sent for by <hi>Valerius</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and coming before the Consuls, he related the
whole Story at large, and for a greater Proof against
'em, the Letters were read publickly before all, <hi>Brutus</hi>
all the while inwardly burning with Rage and Fury.
The Accused Parties pleaded nothing for themselves,
but all stood wonderfully astonish'd, and in a profound
Silence; till at last some, to flatter <hi>Brutus,</hi> propos'd
Banishment as a sufficient Punishment, and <hi>Colatine</hi>'s
Tears, with <hi>Valerius</hi>'s Silence, gave the Prisoners great
Hopes of Mercy. But <hi>Brutus</hi> at last rose up, with a
stern Majesty, and a Resolution to do something that
the World shou'd wonder at, he call'd aloud to both
his Sons, <hi>Canst not thou,</hi> O Titus, <hi>nor thou,</hi> Tiberius, <hi>make
any Defence against these Crimes, now laid to your charge?</hi>
This Question he put to them three several times, and
receiving no Answer, he turn'd himself to the Lictors
and Executioners, saying, <hi>Now 'tis your Part to perform
the rest.</hi> Nor could all the Sentiments of Paternal Pity,
nor all the sad pleading Looks of the People, nor yet
the lamentable Complaints of the unhappy Youths,
move the Firmness of his Resolution; but presently
the Lictors seiz'd on the two Young Men, and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
'em, ty'd their Hands behind 'em, then tore their
Bodies with Scourges, and presently after beheaded
'em; <hi>Brutus</hi> all the time gazing on the cruel Spectacle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102323:49"/>
with a most steady Look and unalter'd Countenance,
while the Multitude look'd on with a strange Mixture
of Pity and Amazement. <hi>Brutus</hi> after this Execution
immediately departed out of the Assembly, leaving
the rest of the Criminals to the Discretion of his
Collegue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Collatine</hi>'s Backwardness in punishing the Prisoners,
encourag'd the <hi>Aquilii</hi> to desire some time to answer,
and to have their Slave <hi>Vindicius</hi> deliver'd up to 'em,
and not to continue in the hands of their Accusers.
<hi>Collatine</hi> was ready to do both, and to dismiss the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
when <hi>Valerius,</hi> who had the Slave in his hands,
wou'd neither deliver him, nor suffer the People to
break up without censuring the Accused; but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
laid hands on the <hi>Aquilii,</hi> and sent for <hi>Brutus,</hi>
exclaiming against <hi>Collatine</hi>'s partial Dealings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Consul in a Rage commanded the Lictors
to take away <hi>Vindicius,</hi> who laying hold on him by
Violence, were assaulted by <hi>Valerius</hi>'s Friends, the
People all the while crying out for <hi>Brutus.</hi> Upon his
appearing, Silence being made, he told the People, <hi>He
had already shewn himself a sufficient Lover of his Country
by his Iustice to his Sons, and left the other Delinquents to
them, giving leave to every Man to speak freely.</hi> They
immediately put it to the Vote, and condemn'd 'em
to be beheaded, which was presently executed. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>
finding the People so enrag'd at him, partly for
the sake of his nigh Relation to <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and partly for
his unfortunate Behaviour in this Business, willingly
resign'd his Place, and departed the City. <hi>Valerius</hi> was
strait chosen Consul in his room, who, to reward <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius,</hi>
made him Free, allowing him some Privileges
above former <hi>Freed Men;</hi> and from him a perfect and
full Manumission was afterwards call'd <hi>Vindicta.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vindicta.</note> This
done, the Consuls divided <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Goods among
the People, demolish'd his Palace, and laid the <hi>Campus
Martius,</hi> which he had kept to himself, open as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where happening to be Corn which had been
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102323:50"/>
newly cut down, they threw it into the River; and
after that the Trees that grew there, which fastning
in the Ground, and stopping the Rubbish that was
brought down by the Stream, at last grew into an
Island,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Tarquin</hi> now finding all his Endeavours ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,<note place="margin">U. C. 246.</note>
drew together a considerable Army of <hi>Hetrurians,</hi>
and advanced towards <hi>Rome.</hi> The Consuls likewise
drew out theirs to oppose him, and upon their joyning,
the two Generals, <hi>Aruns</hi> the Son of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi>
the Consul, imprudently singled out each other, and
fighting with more Zeal and Fury than Conduct and
Discretion, were both Slain. A very bloody Battel
follow'd between both Armies, which the Night
parted, but with such equal Fortune, that neither Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had much reason to boast; but in the Night-time,
either from a Voice out of a Grove, as the common
Story goes, <hi>That the</hi> Hetrurians <hi>had lost one Man more
than the</hi> Romans, or from some other extraordinary
Fright, the Enemy abandon'd their Camp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen upon by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were nigh 5000 taken
Prisoners, having lost 11300 in the Battel before.
For this Victory, <hi>Valerius</hi> triumph'd at his return to
the City, after a more magnificent Manner than any
before him; whose Example was always observ'd by
Posterity. Soon after, he bury'd his Collegue <hi>Brutus</hi>
with great Honour, he himself making a Funeral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in his Commendation; and this Custom was
continu'd in <hi>Rome</hi> for the future, upon the Death of
all great and memorable Persons. There was such an
universal Concern through all the City for <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
Death, that the Women by general consent mourn'd
for him a whole Twelvemonth, which was two
Months more than <hi>Numa</hi> had appointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valerius</hi> now sole Governour, deferr'd the Election
of another Consul, that he might the more easily
settle the Common-wealth himself; but the People
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102323:50"/>
complaining, and fearing another <hi>Tarquin,</hi> he soon let
'em see their Mistake by his Courteous Behaviour and
ready Compliance with all their Desires, even to the
demolishing his own House, which they thought
too large and stately for him. His courteous and
obliging Carriage, and his Bowing to the People
in the Assembly, got him the name of <hi>Poplicola.</hi>
He first fill'd up the Senate, which wanted 164 Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
then made several Laws in favour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and for the Retrenchment of the <hi>Consular</hi> Power.
By one, he allow'd an <hi>Appeal</hi> from the Consuls to the
People. By another, he made it Death for any Man
to take any Magistrate's Office without the Peoples
Consent. A third, gave Relief to poor Citizens, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the payment of Tribute. Another punish'd
Disobedience to Consuls, and appointed a Penalty of
five Oxen, and two Sheep; a Sheep being in those days
valu'd at ten <hi>Oboli,</hi> (each <hi>Obolus 1 d. 1 q.</hi>) and an Ox
at a hundred. Another Law gave Power to any Man
to kill the Person unheard, who affected the Supreme
Power, if he cou'd demonstrate the Crime. The last
Law was for the Creation of two <hi>Quaestors</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Treasurers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaestors.</note> who were to take care of the Publick
Monies and Contributions, and appointed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Saturn</hi> for the <hi>Aerarium</hi> or Treasury. These
Officers were so nam'd <hi>à quaerendo,</hi> because they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
after the Publick Money, and likewise after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors.
Some say <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> had their <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
but then they were for Punishment, such as
were afterwards the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> for Capital Matters.
This <hi>Quaestorship</hi> was the first step to the Offices of
Magistracy, and they were likewise to keep the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Ensigns in the Treasury, to sell Plunder and
Booty, lodge and carry out Ambassadors, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other things of the like Nature. Their Number
was afterwards very much encreas'd, till in the time
of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> they came to forty, some being us'd
for the Armies, and others for the Provinces. Of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102323:51"/>
which, these two of the first Creation were term'd
<hi>Urbani,</hi> the rest <hi>Provinciales,</hi> and <hi>Militares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poplicola</hi> having thus setled Affairs, held an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for the Election of another Consul; where <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi>
the Father of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> was chosen, to whom,
as being the Elder, <hi>Poplicola</hi> granted the <hi>Fasces,</hi> or
Bundle of Rods, which respect of Age was ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by their Successors. <hi>Lucretius</hi> dying a few days
after his Creation, was succeeded by <hi>M. Horatius,</hi> in
whose time the <hi>Capitol</hi> was finish'd, and the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it fell to <hi>Horatius,</hi> much against <hi>Poplicola's</hi> will,
who was forc'd to be abroad in the Wars at the
same time. This was perform'd with great Pomp
and Solemnity, and with as great a Concourse
of People of all sorts. In the same Year was the first
League made between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
according to <hi>Polybius;</hi> wherein it was provided, that
the <hi>Romans</hi> shou'd not Sail beyond the <hi>Fair Promontory,</hi>
which lay before <hi>Carthage</hi> towards the <hi>North;</hi> but
were allow'd to Traffick in all that Part of <hi>Africa</hi>
on this side the <hi>Promontory,</hi> as also in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and
that part of <hi>Sicily</hi> that was then under the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
From whence it appears, that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
look'd upon <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> as all their own,
but <hi>Sicily</hi> only in part; but the <hi>Romans</hi> included in
this League only <hi>Latium,</hi> making no mention of
the rest of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was not then in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
In a little time after <hi>Horatius's</hi> Election, the
time coming for new Consuls to be made, <hi>Poplicola</hi>
was chosen a second time, and with him <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>III. Before <hi>Poplicola's</hi> second Consulship was expir'd,<note place="margin">U. C. 247.</note>
                     <hi>Tarquin</hi> after his last Defeat, had betaken himself to
the <hi>Clusini,</hi> one of the twelve Nations of <hi>Hetruria,</hi>
and had procur'd <hi>Porsena,</hi> King of <hi>Clusium,</hi> and of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102323:51"/>
great Power, to undertake his Quarrel. <hi>Poplicola</hi> to
appear as magnificent as this King, founded the City
<hi>Sigliucia,</hi> or rather <hi>Signia,</hi> while he was approaching,
which he fortify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d with great Expence, and planted
it with a Colony of 700 Inhabitants. But <hi>Porsena</hi>
march'd directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> laid a close Siege to it, and
made a furious Attack upon the Place; in which
Contest the two Consuls with much difficulty repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> were both wounded and carri'd
off. Upon which the <hi>Romans</hi> were much dishearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and flying in great Disorder, were closely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
by the Enemy to the Bridge, who wou'd also
undoubtedly have enter'd the Town with 'em, had
not <hi>Horatius Coecles,</hi> with only <hi>Herminius</hi> and <hi>Lartius,</hi>
most valiantly oppos'd 'em. <hi>Coecles</hi> defended the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
with a wonderful Bravery, till his own Party
found time to break down the Bridge, then cast
himself arm'd, as he was, into the River, and swam
over to his Friends, having receiv'd a Wound with a
Spear in his Passage over. <hi>Poplicola,</hi> to reward him for
this extraordinary Piece of Service, gave him several
great Privileges, and appointed a Statue to be erected
to his Memory in the Temple of <hi>Vulcan. Porsena</hi>
held the Siege a long time, and reduc'd the City to
great Straits; but <hi>Poplicola,</hi> now exercising his third
Consulship, together with his last years Collegue,
drew out his Forces, engag'd the King, overthrew
him, and kill'd 5000 of his Men.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, the Siege continud'd, till <hi>Mutius,</hi> a Man
of a most undaunted Courage, resolving to attempt
the Life of <hi>Porsena,</hi> tho' amidst his own Soldiers, put on
a <hi>Tuscan</hi> Habit, and using that Language, came into
the Camp, where by a Mistake he stabb'd the King's
Secretary, who sat nigh him, instead of the King
himself. Being apprehended, and ready to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
he like a Person more dreadful to others than
fearful himself, told 'em, <hi>That he was a</hi> Roman, <hi>and
knew as well how to suffer as to act.</hi> Upon which he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102323:52"/>
couragiously thrust his Right-hand into the Fire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to punish it for so great a Mistake, all the
while beholding <hi>Porsena</hi> with a steady and angry
Countenance, who struck and amaz'd at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Resolution, dismiss'd him with much
Applause, and reach'd him his Sword back from
his Throne. <hi>Mutius</hi> taking it with his Left-hand
(whence he had the Name of <hi>Scaevola</hi>) told the
King, <hi>That the Nobleness of his Generosity had more van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
him than all the Terrors of his Threats; and that
in requital he wou'd reveal a Secret to him, which no Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shou'd ever have extorted from him: That Three
hundred</hi> Romans <hi>in the Camp were now waiting for his
Life; that the first Attempt was appointed for him; but
now he was extreamly satisfy'd that he had so happily miss'd
killing a Person, whose Magnanimity better entitl'd him
to the Friendship, than the Hatred of the</hi> Roman <hi>Nation.

                        </gap>rsena</hi> hearing this, was immediately inclin'd to an
Accommodation, not out of Fear of the 300 Men,
but in Admiration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Courage. <hi>Poplicola</hi>
was well pleas'd with the Proposal, and agreed to
make him Arbitrator between <hi>Tarquin</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
but <hi>Tarquin</hi> resolutely refus'd to admit of any
Judge; much less <hi>Porsena, Who,</hi> as he said, <hi>had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him Aid, and now basely falsify'd his Word. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sena,</hi>
angry at this, immediately made Peace with
the <hi>Romans</hi> upon these Articles, <hi>That the</hi> Romans
<hi>shou'd quit those</hi> Tuscan <hi>Lands, which they had taken

                  <p>For the ratifying this Peace the <hi>Romans</hi> depos'd
Twenty Hostages, Ten young Men, and as many

<hi>Virago,</hi> and one of the Hostages, got from her Keepers,
and at the Head of the rest of the Virgins, swam over
the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> amidst the Darts of the Enemies;
and being all got home, they presented themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102323:52"/>
                     <hi>Poplicola;</hi> but he fearing the dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
such an Act might occasion, sent them all
back to <hi>Porsena;</hi> which <hi>Tarquin</hi> understanding, laid
an Ambuscade for them and their Convoy, but they
were rescu'd by <hi>Aruns, Porsena's</hi> Son. <hi>Porsena</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, was so much taken with the extraordinary
Courage and good Behaviour of <hi>Claelia,</hi> presented her
with one of his own Horses sumptuously equip'd, and
gave her Power of disposing of a set number of the
Hostages, which she did with much Discretion, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out the Youngest, as being less able to bear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Hardships. Then to give a further Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his great Respect to the <hi>Romans,</hi> besides other
pieces of Magnificence, he commanded all his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to leave the Camp with only their Arms, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Romans</hi> his Tents well furnish'd with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and Riches. On the other side, the <hi>Romans</hi> to
shew their Gratitude, and to preserve his Memory,
erected a Statue for him by the Senate House; and
another to <hi>Claelia,</hi> as <hi>Livy</hi> relates it, which was a <hi>Maid
on Horseback,</hi> in the Street call'd <hi>Via Sacra;</hi> giving
likewise to <hi>Mutius</hi> a Field beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
call'd <hi>Mutia Prata.</hi> Thus ended the <hi>Hetrurian</hi>
War, much to <hi>Tarquin's</hi> Dissatisfaction; and soon
after <hi>Herminius</hi> and <hi>Lartius,</hi> who had so bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the Bridge, were together chosen <hi>Consuls.</hi>

                  <p>IV. A Year or two after,<note place="margin">U. C. 249.</note> the <hi>Sabines</hi> began to be
very troublesome, making Incursions into the <hi>Roman</hi>
Territories. <hi>M. Valerius</hi> being one of the Consuls, by
the Instructions of his Brother <hi>Poplicola,</hi> obtain'd great
Honours, overthrowing 'em twice, the last time kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
13000, with little or no Loss to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his Triumph, he had the additional Honour of
a House built for him at the publick Charge. The
Year following, when <hi>Poplicola</hi> was Consul the fourth

Clausus,</hi> an Eminent Man among the <hi>Sabines</hi> for

the War, first retarded their Preparations, then after
a short time came over to the <hi>Romans</hi> with 5000 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of his Friends and Dependants. These had a
considerable quantity of Land, and large Priviledges
allow'd 'em, besides their Freedom, especially <hi>Clausus</hi>
himself, who was made also a Senator; and the <hi>Claus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any in <hi>Rome.</hi> Soon after this, the <hi>Tribes</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi>
State were encreas'd from Four to One and twenty,
and one of the four in the City was call'd <hi>Tribus Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
from the foremention'd <hi>Appius Claudius;</hi> and this
remarkable Change happ'ned in the 250th Year of
this City, but upon what Account, and by whose
Means it was effected, Historians are very silent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sabines</hi> having made all necessary Preparations,
advanc'd with all the Troops to <hi>Fidenae,</hi> laying an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscade
of 2000 Foot; whereof <hi>Poplicola</hi> having some
Notice by Deserters, he divided his Forces into three
Parts, and taking the advantage of a Mist, fell upon
the Enemy on so many Sides, that only the nigh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>Fidenae</hi> sav'd 'em from being all cut off; the
<hi>Romans</hi> obtaining large Plunder, and <hi>Poplicola</hi> a noble
Triumph. Not long after, <hi>Poplicola</hi> having ended
his Consulship, dy'd; and the People, as well upon
the account of his Poverty, as to shew their Respect
to so great and serviceable a Person, decree'd he shou'd
be bury'd at the Publick Charge, and by a favour pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to that Family alone, within the City. This
was perform'd with an equal Mixture of Pomp and
Sorrow; the Women, by a general Consent, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him a whole Year, as they had before done
for <hi>Brutus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 251.</note> In the same Year, <hi>Posthumius</hi> and <hi>Meneni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being Consuls, the <hi>Sabines</hi> once more drawing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a numerous Army, march'd up almost to the
Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> As the Consuls advanc'd towards
'em, <hi>Posthumius</hi> fell into an Ambuscade, lost many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102323:53"/>
of his Men, and narrowly escap'd himself; which
unfortunate Disadvantage put the Citizens into so
great a Consternation, that they ran back with all
speed to their Walls, expecting when the Enemy
shou'd attack the City: But the Enemy making no
such Attempt, they march'd out again, resolving to
redeem their lost Credit; and <hi>Posthumius</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
than the rest, behav'd himself nobly, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his Collegue, obtain'd a notable Victory,
which had been finish'd with the entire Ruine of the
<hi>Sabines,</hi> had not the Night interpos'd.</p>
                  <p>For the greatness of this Victory, the Senate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<hi>Menenius</hi> a full Triumph; but <hi>Posthumius,</hi> by
reason of his ill Success in the beginning, had only
an inferior one,<note place="margin">Ovation.</note> which the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>Ovation,</hi> so
nam'd from the Letter O, as it is said, which the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in way of Joy were wont to eccho at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from Victory, whereas in Triumphs they cri'd

properly so call'd, in these Particulars; namely, that
in an Ovation, the General enter'd the City on foot,
and not in a Chariot; that he was met only by the
Knights and Gentlemen, not by the Senators in their
Robes; that he himself had only the <hi>pretexta toga,</hi>
the ordinary Habit of Consuls and Praetors, and not
the Robe interwoven with Gold: And lastly, That
he had not a Sceptre in his Hand, but had only Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and a Wreath of Myrtle on his Head.<note place="margin">U. C. 252.</note> The Year
following, <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Virginius</hi> being Consuls, the

which Defeat forc'd 'em to beg Peace, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
it with Corn, Money, and part of their Lands.
While <hi>Cassius</hi> did this good Service against the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
his Collegue <hi>Virginius</hi> subdu'd the <hi>Camarinaeans,</hi> who
had revolted, and having executed the Ring-Leaders,
he sold the rest, and demolish'd the City: And thus
ended the Contests with the <hi>Sabines</hi> for a while.</p>

V. <hi>Tarquin</hi> still restless and unsatisfy'd,<note place="margin">U. C. 254.</note> by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of <hi>Mamilius Octavius,</hi> his Son-in-Law, stirr'd
up the whole Body of the <hi>Latines</hi> to declare War
against <hi>Rome;</hi> and moreover, had procur'd <hi>Fidenae</hi> to
revolt. But the Senate prudently declin'd making
War with all the <hi>Latines,</hi> well knowing that many of
'em were rather inclin'd to live in Peace; therefore
at first they block'd up <hi>Fidenae,</hi> which had receiv'd
some of <hi>Tarquin's</hi> Forces. <hi>Tarquin</hi> meeting with no
greet Success, now endeavour'd to accomplish his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
a more easie Way, by fomenting Differences and
Quarrels between the Rich and Poorer sort of <hi>Rome;</hi>
for the effecting of which, he happen'd on a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Opportunity for his purpose. For about this
time, the common People, who were burden'd by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
were much dissatisfi'd with the present State of
Affairs, especially with the unreasonable Severity of
Creditors, who generally seiz'd upon the Body of their
Debtors, and us'd 'em worse than Slaves. <hi>Tarquin</hi>
being sensible of all this, sent certain of his Friends
with good quantities of Gold, giving 'em some in hand,
and promising more after the King's Restoration, and
thereby procur'd a Conspiracy of many poor Citizens,
and discontented Slaves. But the whole Matter was
soon discover'd to <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> one of the Consuls, who
after he had return'd a very civil Denial to the <hi>Latin</hi>
Ambassadors, then present about Business, by a Wile
drew the Conspirators into the <hi>Forum;</hi> where incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
'em about, he put 'em all to the Sword.</p>
                  <p>These dangerous Stirs being thus allay'd for a time,
the Consuls of this and the following Year look'd
abroad, and in no long time <hi>Fidenae</hi> was yielded to
<hi>Largius Flavius.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> now inrag'd at the Loss
of this Town, began to complain of their principal
Men; which Opportunity <hi>Tarquin</hi> and <hi>Mamilius</hi> so far
improv'd, as to procure all the <hi>Latin</hi> Cities, 24 in
number, to declare War against the <hi>Romans;</hi> withal
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102323:54"/>
ingaging them, that none shou'd forsake the Interest
of the Associates, nor make any separate Peace,
which they seal'd with dreadful Oaths and Curses
against them who shou'd break the Confederacy, who
were to be held as Enemies by all the rest.<note place="margin">U. C. 255.</note> The <hi>Latines</hi>
made extraordinary Preparations, as likewise did the
<hi>Romans,</hi> but the latter cou'd procure no Auxiliaries
abroad, therefore were forc'd to rely all upon their
Domestick Strength, which Necessity made the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort more couragious and valiant. But in levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, to the great surprize of the Consuls and
Senate, the poorer sort and Debtors, which were
very numerous, refus'd to list themselves, except
their Debts were all remitted by a Decree of Senate;
nay, some began to talk of leaving the City, <hi>since
they cou'd have no happy Life while they were there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Patritians</hi> endeavour'd to appease the Multitude
by gentle words, but all in vain; upon which the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
fell into a serious Debate about this weighty Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
There are some for a free Remission of all
Debts, as the safest and securest Method at that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
others urg'd the dangerous Consequences of
this Condescention, advising 'em to list such as wou'd
give in their Names, and slight the rest. Between these
two Extreams, several other Methods were propos'd;
but at length this Order prevail'd, <hi>That all Suits and
Processes concerning Debts shou'd cease till this War was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd.</hi>
This Expedient, tho' in some measure useful,
had not the intended Effect upon the unruly Minds
of the Multitude, therefore the Senate was put upon
another. Whereas by the Laws of <hi>Poplicola,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular
Authority was much restrain'd and diminish'd
by the Appeal to the People, so that no Man cou'd be
oblig'd to go into the War against his Will; therefore
they found it necessary at this time, <hi>as well as upon
the account of the Wars abroad, as the Troubles at home,</hi>
to create a particular Magistrate, from whom shou'd
lie no Appeal, and who for a set Time shou'd be the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102323:55"/>
sole Governour. This Supream Officer was call'd
<hi>Dictator; Largius Flavius</hi> was the first that was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Senate; and this was the first Intermission
of the Consular Power, about ten Years after their
first Creation, and afterwards prov'd the Ruine of

more Power than both the Consuls; so nam'd <hi>à di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctando,</hi>
from dictating or commanding what was to
be done. He was also call'd <hi>Magister Populi,</hi> and
<hi>Praetor Maximus,</hi> and was always created in the
Night-time by the <hi>Senate's</hi> Order, and Nomination
of the Consuls without the People; and was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
made, either upon some urgent Occasion of
War and Sedition, or in the times of Plagues and
Famines, or for the Celebration of some particular
Games, or whenever else there was need of a sudden
and extraordinary Command; and this was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Means of preserving the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
from Ruine. His Authority was absolute,
he <hi>had Power of Peace and War, to levy Forces, to lead 'em
out, to disband 'em, and to act all things according to his
Pleasure, without referring them to the Senate;</hi> and upon
his Creation, all other Magistrates, except the <hi>Tribunes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102323:55"/>
of the People,</hi> laid down their Offices, and the whole
Government was left in his Hands. He had 24 Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
of <hi>Rods</hi> carry'd before him, with as many <hi>Axes,</hi>
and he punish'd as he pleas'd without any Appeal;
hence this Office came to be so terrible, that the
Edict of a <hi>Dictator</hi> was observ'd as the Command of
a Deity. But then this extraordinary Power was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
both by Time and Place; for the Office was
never to continue above six Months; nor was the
<hi>Dictator</hi> allow'd to march out of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor ever on
Horseback without leave, to shew that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Strength lay in the Infantry. The <hi>Dictator</hi> upon his
Creation, always made choice of another Officer,
one that had either been <hi>Consul</hi> or <hi>Praetor,</hi> to assist
him;<note place="margin">Magister Equitum.</note> this Officer was call'd <hi>Magister Equitum,</hi> who
had chief Command over the Horse-men, as the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi>

so as to be obedient to the <hi>Dictator's</hi> Orders, and never

                  <p>
                     <hi>Largius Flavius,</hi> one of the Consuls for this Year,
being, as was said before, made <hi>Dictator,</hi> chose <hi>Sp. Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> who had been Consul
in the Year 252, and immediately appear'd in Publick
with his 24 <hi>Axes</hi> and <hi>Rods</hi> before him; which
soon chang'd the Face of Affairs in the City. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with these and other Ensigns of Power terrify'd
and stopp'd the Seditious Murmurs of the Multitude,
he began the <hi>Census,</hi> after the Pattern of <hi>Servius Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
the sixth King, according to the <hi>Tribes,</hi> taking the
Names and Ages of such as were cessed, and of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
In a short time, the Fear of losing Freedom
and Estates, so far prevail'd, that 150700 of full
Age gave in their Names, which he distributed into
four Parts, taking one for himself, ordering a second
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and the two remaning to
two Persons Commissioned on purpose, one of which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102323:56"/>
was to continue in the City for the Defence of it
Affairs thus setled, he sent some private Ministers,
who dealt privately with several <hi>Latine</hi> Cities, and
procur'd 'em to suspend the War, and make a Truce
for one Year, notwithstanding the great Oppositions
made by <hi>Tarquin</hi> and <hi>Mamilius,</hi> for whose sakes they
undertook the Quarrel. Upon this, <hi>Largius</hi> return'd
home with his Army, and before his six Months were
out, he laid down his Office, and the Consular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
took place again, no Citizen being punish'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Death or Banishment, or cruelly us'd in all
that time; and this Carriage was imitated by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
for many Ages; and notwithstanding the
Vastness of this Authority, it was very rarely abus'd;
nor was the Commonwealth any ways prejudic'd by
it, till <hi>Sylla's</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>When the Truce between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi>
was at an end, both Parties prepar'd to take the Field,
the former chearfully, and the latter unwillingly. The
<hi>Latins</hi> were so strong, that the <hi>Romans</hi> thought it
convenient to create a <hi>Dictator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>ii.</hi> U. C. 257.</note> and accordingly <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius</hi>
the Senior Consul nominated <hi>Posthumius</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
who chose <hi>Ebutius Helva</hi> for his <hi>Master of the
Horse;</hi> and hastning his Levies, divided his Troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
four Parts, reserving one to himself, assigning the
second to <hi>Virginius,</hi> the third to <hi>Ebutius,</hi> and the fourth
to <hi>Sempronius,</hi> who was to defend the City. Upon
Intelligence that the <hi>Latines</hi> had taken the Field, <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius</hi>
advanc'd with all speed to the Lake <hi>Regillus,</hi>
14 Miles <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Tusculum,</hi> where he fortifi'd
himself against the Enemy, who as yet were not all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
but expected Aid from the <hi>Volsci.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi>
divided themselves into three parts, and were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
posted as to cut off all Provisions from the
<hi>Latine</hi> Camp, designing to starve 'em; but the News of
the March of the <hi>Volsci</hi> alter'd their Measures, making
'em resolve to engage. The <hi>Roman</hi> Army consisted of
24000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, and the Enemy of 40000
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102323:56"/>
Foot, and 3000 Horse, <hi>Tarquin's</hi> Son <hi>Titus</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the main Body, his Brother <hi>Sextus</hi> the Left Wing,
and <hi>Mamilius</hi> the Right: <hi>Posthumius</hi> stood against <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Ebutius</hi> against <hi>Sextus,</hi> and <hi>Virginius</hi> against <hi>Mami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and so began a bloody Battel. <hi>Florus</hi> says that
<hi>Posthumius</hi> cast one of the Ensigns among the Enemy,
that his Men might be the more eager to fall upon
'em and recover it; and that <hi>Ebutius</hi> commanded the
Bridles to be taken off the Horses, that they might
Charge with the greater Violence and Fury. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
at last fell on the <hi>Romans</hi> side; and the Battel
was fought with so much Bravery and Courage, that
it was reported that the Gods themselves were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
particularly <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> mounted on milk
white Steeds. The <hi>Latines</hi> lost <hi>Mamilius</hi> and <hi>Sextus,</hi>
and were so broken, that scarce a fourth Part of 'em
escap'd; and from the Place of this Victory, <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius</hi>
obtain'd the Sirname of <hi>Rhegillensis;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others likewise gaining great Honour, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Caius Marcius,</hi> afterwards call'd <hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Battel was over, the <hi>Volsci</hi> arriv'd at the
Camp, whereof one Party was for attacking the
<hi>Romans</hi> now weary; but another Party, willing to
ingratiate themselves with the Conquerors, prevail'd
to send to the <hi>Dictator,</hi> to let him understand, <hi>That
they came to his Assistance.</hi> But <hi>Posthumius</hi> convinc'd 'em
of their Falshood by their own Letters which he had
intercepted, and giving leave to the Messenger
to return, whom the Multitude wou'd have pull'd in
pieces, resolv'd to fall on 'em the next Day; but in
the Night they abandon'd their Camp and fled. The
<hi>Latines,</hi> now in a very bad Condition, sent in the
humblest manner imaginable to beg Peace of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
and their Ambassadors with so many Tears
and submissive Intreaties laid all the Blame on the
Nobility, that the Motion of <hi>Largius</hi> prevail'd in
their behalf for the former League to be renew'd.
Thus ended all the Wars made upon the <hi>Tarquin's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102323:57"/>
which had been carry'd on for 13 Years. As
for <hi>Tarquin</hi> himself, the only Person left of all his
Family, now abandon'd by the <hi>Latines, Hetrurians,
Sabines,</hi> with the rest of the Neighbouring People,
who all refus'd to harbour him, he went into <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
to <hi>Aristodemus</hi> Prince of <hi>Cuma,</hi> where he shortly
after dy'd, being about 90 Years of Age, and the
last King that <hi>Rome</hi> ever saw.</p>
                  <p>II. Upon the finishing of this War,<note place="margin">U. C. 258.</note> 
                     <hi>Posthumius</hi> laid
down his Office, and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the <hi>Sabine,</hi> and
<hi>Servilius Priscus</hi> were made Consuls for the Year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
and now the Courts of Justice were again
open'd, and Processes against Debtors reviv'd. This
caus'd great Disturbances among the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Plebeians</hi> alledging their Inability of paying
their Debts upon the account of their Losses by the
Enemies Incursions, and their want of Tillage; which
Plea their Creditors likewise made use of, shewing that
these Losses were such as made the remitting of their
Debts impossible; which occasion'd many Tumults
and Quarrels. The Consuls endeavour'd to divert
these threatning Mischiefs, by making War against
the <hi>Volsci,</hi> who had lately assisted the <hi>Latines;</hi> but none
of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> wou'd List themselves, making grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Complaints against the intollerable Severity of
their Creditors, and declaring, <hi>That they had ventur'd
their Lives to preserve the Liberty of the State abroad, and
in requital were made Slaves by their Countrymen at home.</hi>
Now <hi>Servilius</hi> was willing to comply in some measure
with the Poor, but <hi>Appius</hi> very hotly oppos'd it as the
most dangerous Remedy in the World; and the Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the Consuls added much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity. However, the Senate at last was
forc'd to have recourse to the Popularity of <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
who with fair Words and Promises perswaded
the People into the Field; where when he had by his
good Services deserv'd a Triumph, the Honour was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102323:57"/>
deni'd him by the Insinuation of his Collegue <hi>Appius,</hi>
who represented to the Senate, <hi>That by bearing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with the Multitude, he had impair'd the Dignity of
his Order.</hi> The People now expecting the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of <hi>Servilius's</hi> Promises, were wholly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by <hi>Appius's</hi> Contrivances, which doubled
their Rage, and made 'em carry all things by open
Force, rescuing their Companions out of the hands
of the Serjeants, holding Secret Cabals, denying
ever to touch a Weapon till their Burdens were
remov'd.</p>
                  <p>These dangerous Stirs put the Senate to a great
stand; <hi>Appius</hi> still urg'd, <hi>That nothing ought to be granted
to the Rabble;</hi> and the better to quell the Disturbances,
procur'd a <hi>Dictator</hi> to be created,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>iii.</hi> U. C. 259.</note> which most suppos'd
wou'd be himself: But the present Consuls made
choice of <hi>M. Valerius,</hi> a popular Man, supposing that
the Terror of the Office alone wou'd perform the
Work, and that a Person of a mild and moderate
Temper wou'd best manage it. <hi>Valerius</hi> chose <hi>Servilius</hi>
the late Consul for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and he
minding the Pleasure of the People more than his
own Authority, told 'em, <hi>That if they wou'd freely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, not only what they justly requir'd concerning their
Debts, but other Rewards shou'd be granted 'em;</hi> by which
means he procur'd ten Legions to be listed. With
these he march'd against the <hi>Volsci, Aequi,</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi>
who were all up in Arms; and having reduc'd 'em, he
divided some Lands he had taken from the <hi>Volsci,</hi>
among the Soldiers. At his return he requested the
Senate, that his and their Promises might be made
good, but was check'd for his too great Compliance
with the Multitude; and because he was an old
Man, above Seventy, unfit as he said to contend, and
unwilling to shew his utmost Authority, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
laid down his Office. This more inflam'd the
common People, who now had their private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations,
designing to separate themselves from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102323:58"/>
                     <hi>Patritians;</hi> which when the Senate perceiv'd, order
was given to the Consuls not to disband the Army,
pretending that the <hi>Sabines</hi> and <hi>Aequi</hi> had new Designs
against <hi>Rome.</hi> Now the Soldiers being strictly bound
by their Oath, call'd <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> at their first Listing,
cou'd not forsake their Standards; but the Consuls
having their Camps nigh each other, by the Advice
of one <hi>Sicinius Bellulus,</hi> they all remov'd to one of
them; and then taking away the Ensigns and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards
from the Consuls, they retir'd to a Mountain
afterwards call'd <hi>Mons Sacer,</hi> three Miles North of
<hi>Rome</hi> by the River <hi>Anio,</hi> now call'd <hi>Taverone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this News, the whole City was in a strange
Consternation and Tumult; insomuch that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritians</hi>
fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d least Civil Wars shou'd insue, for the
<hi>Plebeians</hi> growing extream high, many of 'em left
the Town and flock'd to the Army, tho' the other
hinder'd it as much as possible. The Fathers had
great Contests among themselves, some pleading for
the Multitude, others urging nothing but right down
Force; till the former sort prevail'd to send a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the Armies, desiring 'em <hi>To return home, and
declare their Demands;</hi> withal promising 'em, <hi>To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their Crimes, and to reward their good Services.</hi> But
this Message was receiv'd with disdainful Words, and
violent Complaints, intermix'd with threatning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
which the more sensibly afflicted the Fathers,
as not knowing which way to procure a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
since they cou'd no longer keep the People in
the City from going over to the Army. Now was
the time for electing of new Consuls at hand, but
the Stirs were so violent,<note place="margin">Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</note> that no <hi>Candidates</hi> (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
because they su'd for the Place in <hi>white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>)
wou'd stand for the Office, nor any accept
of it; till at last the Consuls by their sole Authority
appointed <hi>Posthumius Cominius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 260.</note> and <hi>Sp. Cassius,</hi> who
had been Consuls before, and were equally in favour
with the Nobility and Commons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102323:58"/>
                     <hi>The Consuls immediately call'd the Senate, and
consulted 'em about the Return of the Commons.</hi>
Agrippa Menenius, <hi>a very discreet Person, and a great
Orator in those days, urg'd</hi> the great Necessity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
and a Compliance with the People, since the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Dominions cou'd neither be encreas'd, nor yet preserv'd
without the Inferior sort. Valerius <hi>the last</hi> Dictator <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
him, and upbraided the Senate</hi> for not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him when he foretold these Distempers; that now they
ought to heal the Wound before it was gone too far; that
there were several Reasons the <hi>Roman</hi> People had to separate
themselves from the better sort, all which had great and
plausible Appearances of Iustice. <hi>But</hi> Appius, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his usual Manner, violently declaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the</hi> Insolence of the Mob, and the Imprudence of
the Senate in any sort of Compliances; that if they granted
these Things when Enemies, which they refus'd when Friends,
they wou'd not rest here, but require a Communication of all
Honours, and what not? So that at last the whole Power
of the State wou'd come into the hands of the Rabble. <hi>This
Speech so pleas'd and transported some of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sort of his Party, that nothing cou'd be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by reason of the Heats on both Sides. This put
the Consuls upon dismissing the Senate for that time,
admonishing the younger sort,</hi> to carry themselves more
modestly for the future, or else they wou'd prefer a Law to
limit a certain Age for Senators; <hi>exhorting likewise the
graver sort to Concord, letting them know,</hi> That
they had a Way to end the Controversie, by referring the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the People, who had a Right to judge of it, as a Case of
Peace and War. <hi>Upon which, the Senate broke up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the next Meeting, the Senate almost unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
agreed to treat with the People, tho' <hi>Appius</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it what he cou'd; and <hi>Menenius</hi> with nine others
were Commission'd with full Power to compose the
Differences. At their first arrival at the Camp, their
Proposals cou'd not be heard through the Instigations
of two cunning and turbulent Fellows, <hi>Sicinius</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102323:59"/>
                     <hi>Lucius Iunius,</hi> who out of Conceit had likewise affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the Name of <hi>Brutus;</hi> but by degrees they were so
far appeas'd as to listen to the Commissioners. <hi>Menenius</hi>
finding the Rage and Violence of the People too great
to hearken much to Rhetorick, bethought himself of a
more effectual Way, and such as was more likely to
make Impression; therefore laying aside his former
Way of Speeches and Oratory, after a short Promise
or two of discharging all disabled Debtors, he in a
plain and familiar Way began thus: <hi>Once upon a time,
the Members and Parts of Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s Body fell out with the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
alledging, that they were all forc'd to toil and moil to
provide Necessaries for the Belly, whilst that liv'd idle and
lazy in the Midst of the Body, and did nothing but enjoy
its Pleasures. Whereupon they resolv'd that the Hands shou'd
not lift the Meat to the Mouth, nor the Mouth receive, nor
yet the Teeth chew it; by which Means while they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to famish the Belly, they themselves and the whole
Body were all starv'd for want of the Nourishment they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from it.</hi> This Story, and his home Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, had so great an Effect upon the People,
that they unanimously cry'd out, <hi>He shou'd lead 'em
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me without Delay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Multitude were so well satisfi'd, that they were
ready to depart with no other Security than the
bare Words of the Commissioners; but <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi>
before-mention'd, kept 'em from that, alledging,
<hi>That tho' they were gratefully to acknowledge the kind Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of the Senate, yet some Persons of revengeful Tempers
might notwithstanding reserve their Anger for a more
convenient Opportunity; and that therefore it was necessary
for the Security of the Commons, to have certain Officers
created Yearly out of their own Body, whose Power shou'd
be to give Relief to such</hi> Plebeians <hi>as were injur'd, and suffer
none to be defrauded of their Rights.</hi> This was greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of by the Multitude, and closely insisted on
and urg'd to <hi>Menenius</hi> and his Fellow Commissioners;
who thought it not proper to yield to a Matter of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102323:59"/>
that great Consequence without leave from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
but demanded time to know their Pleasures.
Upon the Debate of this Matter in the Senate House,
<hi>Valerius</hi> thought the Favour was to be granted to the
Commons, but <hi>Appius</hi> most violently oppos'd it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
the Gods, and truly foretelling, <hi>What vast
Troubles and Calamities the Granting it wou'd certainly
bring upon the Common-wealth;</hi> yet the Majority, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
out with the present Misfortunes, and desiring
Peace, gave it in Favour of the People, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
were immediately dispatch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>em with
the Resolution of the House. The Commons by
the Advice of <hi>Menenius,</hi> first sent to have a Religious
Confirmation of this Privilege from the Senate, and
afterwards in the Assembly of the <hi>Curiae,</hi> or <hi>Curiata
Comitia,</hi> elected <hi>I. Brutus</hi> and <hi>Sicinius Bellulus,</hi> to
whom they afterwards join'd <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>P. Licinius,</hi> and
<hi>Icilius Ruga,</hi> which made five in all.</p>
                  <p>These Officers were call'd <hi>Tribunes of the People,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because they were elected by the <hi>Tribes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tribuni Plebis.</note> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were first made out of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
of the Soldiers. They were first five in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
37 Years after, five more were added, and this
number of Ten so continu'd; and they were always
elected by the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and ever out of their Body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
once, and most commonly of the lower sort, till
by a Law made afterwards, they were order'd to be
created out of such of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> as were Senators.
They had the Power of <hi>Interposing,</hi> and the Design of
that Power was to relieve the Oppressed, and to be a
Shield to keep off all Evil and Mischief. They null'd
all such <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Commands</hi> of the Senate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
as they reckon'd unjust, and of all other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
except the <hi>Dictators;</hi> and to shew their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to protect the meanest, their Doors stood open
Night and Day to their Complaints. They at first had
their Seats plac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d before the doors of the Senate-House,
tho' afterwards they enter'd in, where examining the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102323:60"/>
Decrees of the Fathers, they either interpos'd by the
word <hi>Veto</hi> or <hi>Vetamus</hi> solemnly pronounc'd, or else
sign'd 'em with the Letter <hi>T,</hi> which made 'em pass.
They procur'd themselves to be accounted <hi>Sacrosancti,</hi>
so as by a Law made they were free from all manner
of Compulsion, and were inviolable, either by Word
or Deed, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>evere Penalties laid on such as broke it;
and lest the People shou'd afterwards repeal this Law,
they made all the Citizens take the most solemn Oath
imaginable to preserve it intire and untouch'd. As for
the <hi>Ensigns</hi> of their Office, they had no <hi>Toga Pretexta,
Lictors</hi> or <hi>Curule Chair,</hi> but only a sort of a <hi>Beadle,</hi> call'd
<hi>Viator,</hi> went before 'em. The want of these Attendants,
their not entring at the beginning of the year, and their
not laying down their Office upon the Creation of a
<hi>Dictator,</hi> made some hold 'em to be no <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but
rather a Curb and Restraint to all others. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the disproportionate Greatness of these <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
Power, it was considerably limited by these two
Things, which they scarcely perceiv'd at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
The first was their Confinement to the City
Walls, out of which they had no authority; neither was
it lawful for 'em to be absent from the City a day, <hi>Dion</hi>
says not an hour: The second was their Number, for
any one of the ten had a Negative Vote, and this was
the only effectual means to moderate the Power which
they afterwards assum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d; the <hi>Patritians</hi> generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
with one of the ten to be of their side, which
was sufficient to hinder the Designs of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>This was the first great Retrenchment of the <hi>Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Power,</hi> besides what had been caus'd by <hi>Poplicola</hi>
before: and now the Commonwealth was turn'd from
an <hi>Aristocrac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> to a <hi>Democracy,</hi> or at least to a Mixture
of both. The Awe which this <hi>Sacrosanct</hi> Magistracy
had upon most People, gave 'em occasion afterwards
to enlarge their Power and Authority, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
most extravagantly Imperious, assembling and
dismissing the Senate, imprisoning the Consuls, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102323:60"/>
the like, as shall be more particularly shewn after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
So that they often prov'd the Cause of many
dangerous Seditions and Tumults, and were the
greatest Disturbers of the Peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
insomuch that they were by some Authors
call'd <hi>Pestes Reipublicae.</hi> This remarkable Innovation
on the Government hapned in the 260th Year of
the City, 46 after the Ruine of the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and
the Beginning of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and in the
third Year of the <hi>71st Olympiad.</hi>

of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to determine some particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
to look after such as held more Land than
the Laws allow'd 'em; to accuse such Matrons as
liv'd Scandalously; to punish excessive Usur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Extortioners; to restrain Tipling and Gaming-houses;
to Fine Persons for lewd and uncivil Words or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
to Correct false Weights and Measures; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Bread-Corn and Oyl in the time of Famine, and
to see that the same was not hoarded up, nor the

Provisions were sent to the Armies, and the like.
About 127 Years after, were added two more out of
the <hi>Patritians,</hi> call'd <hi>Aediles Curules,</hi> who shall be
spoken of in their proper Place.</p>
                  <p>After the Commons had obtain'd these Officers, and
what else they desir'd, they readily listed themselves to
go against the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lsci,</hi> under <hi>Posthumius</hi> the Consul. He
soon took <hi>Longula</hi> and <hi>Polustia</hi> from 'em, then invested
<hi>Corioli,</hi> a strong City, and the Metropolis of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the <hi>Antiates</hi> marching to its relief, he left part
of his Army under <hi>T. Largius,</hi> and with the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to give the Enemy Battel. <hi>Largius</hi> in the mean
time attempting to Storm the Town, the Besieg'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him with so much Courage and Vigour, that
the <hi>Romans</hi> were driven back to their Trenches in
great Disorder; but <hi>Caius Marcius,</hi> a valiant <hi>Patritian</hi>
formerly mention'd, with a small Party, most coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
stood the Enemies Shock, and with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Bravery forc'd 'em back into the Town, whom he
follow'd so close at their Heels, that he went in with
'em: By which the Besieg'd were so terrifi'd, that not
considering their own Numbers, they fled to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part of the City, suffering him to let the rest of
the Army into the Town, which they soon possess'd
themselves of. Which done, <hi>Marcius</hi> wou'd not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Soldiers to stay for Plunder, but hastned 'em
to joyn the Consul with all Speed; and whilst the
Armies were approaching, desir'd leave of <hi>Posthumius</hi>
to engage in the main Body with his Party, where
the chief Strength of the Enemy lay; and having
obtain'd that Post, he behav'd himself with that
admirable Courage and Conduct, that the Enemy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102323:61"/>
were soon overthrown. The Consul gave him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Commendations, owning him to be the chief
Cause of the Victory, and offer'd him a large Share
of the Booty before the Division among the Soldiers.
But he modestly refus'd all but one single Horse, which
gain'd him greater Honour among the Soldiers, and
caus'd <hi>Posthumius</hi> to bestow the Surname of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
upon him, for his incomparable Valour shewn at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioli.</hi>
The <hi>Volsci</hi> by this Overthrow were forc'd to
Submission, and made their Peace. This same Year
was the League of Confederacy renew'd with the
<hi>Latines,</hi> and likewise a third <hi>Feria</hi> or Holy-day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Senate for the Union of the Nobility and
Commons, the first being for the Conquest of <hi>Hetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
in the fifth Kings Reign, and the second for the
Banishment of <hi>Tarquin.</hi> This Year also dy'd <hi>Meneni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
whom the People out of Gratitude bury'd at the
publick Charge, because he dy'd Poor, and Money
was bestow'd on his Children. Now likewise was the
<hi>Census</hi> perform'd and 110000 Heads were cessed.</p>
                  <p>II. The Year following,<note place="margin">U. C. 261.</note> there was a great Famine in
the City, occasion'd chiefly by the want of Tillage
during the late Separation. This put the Senate upon
sending to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and several Parts of <hi>Italy</hi> to buy Corn;
but notwithstanding this Care, the Common sort,
now extreamly pinch'd with Want, grew very tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent,
laying all the Blame upon the <hi>Patritians.</hi> This
Advantage the <hi>Volsci</hi> endeavour'd to improve, but were
diverted by a grievous Plague, which so rag'd among
'em, that <hi>Velitra</hi> a Noble City of that Country being
exhausted of its Inhabitants, they begg'd of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to send a Colony thither. Which occasion'd
many of the <hi>Romans,</hi> tho' unwillingly, to be sent
thither, and also to <hi>Norba,</hi> a <hi>Latine</hi> Town. Upon
which the rest were so inrag'd, imagining it a Design
to destroy 'em, that they call'd the <hi>Tribunes</hi> into the
<hi>Comitium,</hi> where they and the Consuls had a violent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102323:62"/>
Contest; which occasion'd a Law to be made, <hi>That
no Man shou'd dare to interrupt the</hi> Tribunes, <hi>when they
spoke to the People.</hi> This still bred greater Aniniosities
between the Senate and People; but the Consuls to
divert 'em, and to ease their Wants, offer'd to lead
'em into the Enemies Country; but few or none
wou'd List themselves; so that <hi>Marcius Coriolanus</hi>
with some <hi>Patritians,</hi> and a few of their <hi>Clients,</hi>
made Incursions, and return'd home laden with
Booty; the Knowledge of which put the poorer sort
into a fresh Murmuring against the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who had
disswaded them from the Expedition. So that now
the City was almost all in a Flame and Confusion,
but more from the Infirmity of the Government,
than the Disposition of the People.</p>
                  <p>These Tumults and Disturbances were considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
appeas'd by the happy Arrival of great Quantities
of Corn from <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was bought at a cheap
Rate, and half given in by <hi>Gelon</hi> of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Now the
<hi>Patritians</hi> considering at what Rates to dispose of the
Corn, <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> incens'd at the Behaviour of the
Commons, counsell'd 'em <hi>to keep it up at a high rate, and
to shew no Favour, nor give any Incouragement to the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the</hi> Tribunes <hi>and the Rabble; but wholly to take
away the</hi> Tribune-<hi>ship, as the only Way to remedy the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
of the State.</hi> Upon Notice of this, the Multitude
in a mad Fury wou'd have fall'n upon the Senate, but
were stopp'd by the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who laid all the Blame
upon <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and sent the <hi>Aediles</hi> to apprehend him,
and bring him before the People. The <hi>Aediles</hi> going to
execute their Office, were repuls'd and beaten by the
young <hi>Patritians,</hi> who were gather'd about <hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
This put all in a greater Flame than ever, and the
whole City tumultuously assembled together, where
the <hi>Tribunes</hi> decreed, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> shou'd immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be cast down headlong from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock.
The <hi>Aediles</hi> strait seiz'd on him, and the <hi>Patritians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
rescu'd him, and there was nothing but Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102323:62"/>
and Uproars in all Places: But the Senate by
selling of Corn at low Rates, and by good Words and
Entreaties, so far appeas'd 'em, that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> null'd
their former Decree, and set him a Day to Answer
for himself before the People. The Consuls finding
their Authority was like to be much weakned, after
long Debates and much Difficulty, procur'd the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
to sue out this Decree from the Senate, which was
granted; and the third Market-day after was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his Tryal. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> demanded of the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
what they wou'd lay to his Charge; who after some
Consultation, told him, <hi>They intended to accuse him of
Aiming at Sovereignty and Tyranny;</hi> whereupon he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put himself upon Tryal, not refusing the severest
Punishment if they cou'd prove that against him.</p>
                  <p>When the appointed day was come, all Persons were
fill'd with great Expectations, and a vast Concourse of
Country People early in the morning had plac'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the <hi>Forum,</hi> and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> assembled the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
separating the <hi>Tribes</hi> from one another with Cords,
and ordering them to give their Votes according to
their <hi>Tribes,</hi> and not according to their <hi>Centuries;</hi> which
Innovation the <hi>Patritians</hi> much complain'd of, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some Debate, admitted it. <hi>Minucius,</hi> the Consul,
began first, <hi>Declaring the great Worth of the Person to be
try'd, signifying that the Senate became Petitioners in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
and desiring the</hi> Tribunes <hi>that they wou'd keep wholly
to their first Impeachment, namely, his aiming at Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
which they promis'd to do. <hi>Sicinius,</hi> one of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
enviously urg'd all he cou'd imagine would make
for his Purpose, putting the worst Construction upon
all his Actions: But when <hi>Coriolanus</hi> came to speak,
his Affairs soon seem'd to be in a more favourable
Condition; for his graceful relating all his great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the State, his shewing his Scars receiv'd all over
his Body, and the Cries and Lamentations of such as
he had sav'd in the Wars, made such a powerful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon the People, that they generally cry'd out,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102323:63"/>
                     <hi>He was to be releas'd.</hi> But <hi>Decius,</hi> another of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
a cunning and spiteful Fellow, stood up, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
<hi>That he wou'd wave all Words and Expressions,
and insist on his Actions, which wou'd make good the Charge
of Tyranny: There was a certain Law, that all Booty and
Plunder gain'd in War shou'd be appropriated to the Publick
Use, and be given into the Hand of the</hi> Quaestor, <hi>untouch'd
by the General. Now, whereas that Law had ever been
look'd upon as inviolable,</hi> Coriolanus <hi>had wilfully broke it:
For in the late Incursion into the Territories of</hi> Antium,
<hi>where he had got great plenty of Slaves, Cattel, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
he neither deliver'd these things to the</hi> Quaestor, <hi>nor
paid any Money into the Treasury, but divided the Booty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Friends, which was a manifest Argument that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
design'd to Enslave his Country; it being the constant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all that affect Tyranny, by such Means to procure
themselves Instruments for their Purpose. Coriolanus</hi> was
strangely surpriz'd at so unexpected a Charge; and
the <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Patritians</hi> being likewise utterly to seek
for an Answer, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> immediately nam'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Banishment, and gather'd the Votes of the <hi>Tribes,</hi>
where only nine of the one and twenty clear'd him,
so he stood condemn'd by the Majority. This was
the first Sentence pass'd by the People upon any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritian,</hi>
and henceforth the <hi>Tribunes</hi> usually <hi>set a Day</hi>
to whomsoever they pleas'd; whereby the Power of
the Commons was very much enlarg'd, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the <hi>Patritians</hi> more and more diminish'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> accompany'd home with the Sighs and
Tears of a great many, took his leave of his Mother,
Wife, and Children, who all made lamentable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints;
but he, like a true <hi>Roman,</hi> with small Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Concern, bad 'em bear all chearfully,
and departed the City without any thing to bear his
Charges, attended only by a few of his <hi>Clients.</hi> Thus
he went to <hi>Antium,</hi> and apply'd himself to <hi>Tullus At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
a Man of great Note among the <hi>Volsci,</hi> of a
Magnanimous Spirit, and a Violent Enemy of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102323:63"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> where throwing himself at his Feet, he begg'd
of him <hi>to Revenge his Countries Losses by his Death, or his
own Wrongs by</hi> Rome'<hi>s Destruction, which by her unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Carriage towards him, had now forfeited all that Duty
and Service she might have justly expected at his Hands.
Tullus</hi> most readily espous'd his Quarrel, and by his
Advice sent many of the <hi>Volsci</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of seeing some Solemn Games at that time ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated,
but with Design to make a Breach between
the two Nations. These <hi>Volsci</hi> procur'd a Person to
go to the Consuls, and accuse the Strangers of having
some dangerous Design against the City, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
occasion'd an Order from the Consuls, <hi>That
all Strangers shou'd depart by Sun-set.</hi> This Order <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
represented to his Country-men as a Breach of
the Peace, and so aggravated the Matter, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
'em to send to <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand all the Towns
and Territories which the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken from 'em.
The Senate receiv'd this Message with great Scorn,
telling them, <hi>That if the</hi> Volsci <hi>were the first that took up
Arms, the</hi> Romans <hi>wou'd be the last that shou'd lay 'em
down.</hi> Upon which Answer, the <hi>Volsci</hi> made all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Preparations for a War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 265.</note> together with <hi>Tullus,</hi> was made General
of the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and accordingly invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
ravaging and laying Waste all such Lands as
belong'd to the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but not suffering those of
the Nobility to be injur'd in any part. This rais'd new
Commotions between the Nobility and Commons;
the former upbraiding the latter with Ingratitude to
so considerable and deserving a Person; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
charging the other with Treachery to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and saying, <hi>It was by their Procurement that he
invaded their Dominions. Coriolanus</hi> returning with
his Men richly laden with Booty, was sent out soon
after with the sole Command of half the Forces, and
taking <hi>Circaeum,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, he then fell upon
the <hi>Latines,</hi> who immediately sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102323:64"/>
but the Commons Averseness to the Wars, and
the approaching End of the present Consuls Office,
render'd their Message of no Effect. But <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
still proceeded with great Success, taking <hi>Tolerium,
Lavici, Pes,</hi> and <hi>Bola,</hi> all by Storm, plundering them,
and making the Inhabitants Prisoners of War. Such
as yielded he treated mildly, others he put to the
Sword; and the <hi>Volsci</hi> now so admir'd his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courage and Conduct, that they left their Towns
bare, flocking in great Numbers to him, and owning
him for their sole Commander. At <hi>Rome</hi> there was
nothing but Confusion and Despair, and all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Satisfaction was by venting their Rage against
one another; but soon after, when News was brought
that <hi>Lavinium</hi> was invested, the Commons all cry'd
out, <hi>That</hi> Coriolanus <hi>was to be restor'd, and his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
repeal'd.</hi> The Senate utterly refus'd to assent to
this, either out of Desire to oppose the People in all
Things, or out of Scorn to have his Restoration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to the Commons, or else out of a just Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who was now become an
open Enemy to all his Country in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coriolanus</hi> understanding the Dissentions of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
immediately rose up from before <hi>Lavinium,</hi> and
advancing towards <hi>Rome,</hi> Encamp'd at <hi>Clulius's
Ditch,</hi> five Miles from the City. This struck the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
with such a Terror, that now both Senate and
People unanimously agreed to send Ambassadors to
him with Proposals of Restoration. The Ambassadors
behav'd themselves with all possible Respect; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, and their being <hi>Patritians,</hi> and
his Choicest Friends, he receiv'd 'em with all the
Sternness and Severity of a most Injur'd Person; and
in a Council of War made Answer, <hi>That if they hop'd
for Peace, they must immediately restore all the Towns and
Territories taken from the</hi> Volsci; <hi>and make 'em Free of
the City as the</hi> Latines <hi>were; and for that he wou'd give
'em thirty Days to consider of it. And this he spoke as he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102323:64"/>
was General of the</hi> Volsci, <hi>and not as he was a</hi> Roman,
<hi>ungratefully us'd, and barbarously treated by his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men.</hi>
This Space of Time he employ'd in subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Seven great and strong Towns; and at the end
of it, another Ambassy was dispatch'd to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
That <hi>they were still</hi> Romans, <hi>and that neither
Constraint nor Fear shou'd influence their Souls to stoop to
any Thing that is Base, but desir'd him to draw off his
Troops, and consult in Common. And that if he thought the</hi>
Volsci <hi>were to be gratifi'd, they wou'd yield to him, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they wou'd lay down their Arms. Coriolanus,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more moderate, repli'd, <hi>That now he behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not as General of the</hi> Volsci, <hi>but as a</hi> Roman <hi>Citezen,
and desir'd that having a Respect to Interest and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they wou'd return in three Days with a Grant of his
former Demands, or else he must proceed in his Enterprize.</hi>
The Senate being reduc'd to this Extremity, their
Courages began to fail 'em, and as their last Remedy,
order'd all the <hi>Pontifices, Priests, Governours</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houses, and <hi>Augurs,</hi> all in their proper Ornaments
and Habits, to go in Solemn Procession, and humbly
to beg for an Accommodation. But this Pompous
Train, with all their earnest Prayers and Supplications
did not in the least move <hi>Coriolanus;</hi> he still insisting,
<hi>That they shou'd either accept of his Proposals, or else they
must expect the utmost Severity of War and Bloodshed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the Return of the Priests, the whole City
was full of Tumults, Trembling, and Amazement, the
Men running in Disorder to the Walls, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Confusion to the Temples; especially to that of
<hi>Iupiter</hi> in the <hi>Capitol.</hi> Among which, was <hi>Valeria,
Poplicola</hi>'s Sister, who put 'em in mind of going to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turia,
Coriolanus</hi>'s Mother, with his Wife <hi>Volumnia,</hi> to
get them to intercede for their Country. <hi>Veturia</hi> was
very ready to undertake so pious a Work, tho' with
little hopes of succeeding; and thereupon set forward,
accompani'd with many of these Ladies, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-Law,
and her two Grand-Children. <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102323:65"/>
discovering this Mournful Company, fully resolv'd to
give 'em a Denial; but perceiving his Mother among
'em, immediately descended from his Tribunal, and
went to meet her; courteously receiving her with his
Wife and Children, and carefully listning to her Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which she urg'd with all the Skill and Rhetorick
she cou'd, from the Consideration of the <hi>impending
Ruine of his Country, and of the certain infamy which he
wou'd incur if Victorious, and the unavoidable Dishonour he
wou'd receive if he were Successless in his Attempts.</hi> But
this not prevailing, she put him in mind, <hi>How much
the Sacred Ties of Nature and Religion, together with her
most tender Education of him in her Widowhood, had ingag'd
him to Obedience, or at least to a Compliance:</hi> Declaring
likewise, <hi>That he shou'd not stir one Foot towards the tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of his Country, without first trampling upon the
dead Body of her who brought him into the World.</hi> And
in Conclusion, with his Wife and Children, cast her
self at his Feet, Embracing and Kissing 'em; which
with the lamentable Sighs and Tears of the fair Train,
so far mov'd his great Spirit, that lifting 'em up, and
embracing 'em, he cry'd, <hi>O Mother, you have gain'd the
Victory, most fortunate for my Country, but most destructive
to my self;</hi> and accordingly drew off the <hi>Volsci</hi> into their
own Country. <hi>Tullus,</hi> who now envy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d his Glory,
represented this Act to the <hi>Volsci</hi> as the highest Piece
of Treason against 'em, and procur'd him to be cut
in Pieces, scarce allowing him to speak for himself,
as <hi>Dionysius</hi> relates it. This was against the Consent
of the greatest Part of the <hi>Volsci,</hi> who bury'd him
Honourably, adoring his Tomb with Arms and
Trophies as a Great General, and a Famous Warrior,
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Women themselves were permitted to
mourn for him 10 Months, all acknowledging him to be
the most valiant and most couragious Man in this age.</p>
                  <p>III. Great and many Publick Rejoycings were
made at <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s Retreat,<note place="margin">U. C. 266.</note> and the Senate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102323:65"/>
decreed to grant the Women what Honours they
wou'd demand; but they only desir'd to have a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
ded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Place where they had deliver'd their Country, which
was done at the Publick Charge. The Consuls soon
after took the Field with a considerable Army, but
had no occasion to use it; for the <hi>Volsci</hi> and <hi>Aequi</hi>
joyning Forces, had such violent Contests about a
General, as they almost ruin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d each other. The year
following the New Consuls, <hi>Aquilius</hi> and <hi>Sicinius,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
one the <hi>Hernici,</hi> and the other the <hi>Volsci,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom fell <hi>Tullus</hi> their General. The next
Year, the Consuls, <hi>Virginius</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> took the Field,
the <hi>Aequi</hi> falling to the former, as the <hi>Volsci</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici</hi>
did to the latter: But the <hi>Volsci</hi> immediately
begg'd Peace, having lost their best Men in the last
Battel; as soon after did the <hi>Hernici,</hi> who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
any longer to contend with the <hi>Romans</hi> for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority.
<hi>Cassius</hi> having receiv'd Money and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from 'em as Persons who own'd themselves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
made a Truce, but referr'd the Articles to
the Senate. But the Fathers, after resolving to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of their Alliance, left the Conditions of the
League to <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Discretion; who now affecting So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
and desiring Popularity, granted 'em equal
Privileges with the <hi>Latines,</hi> which together with his
Triumph lately obtain'd without performing any
thing for it, procur'd him much Envy and Hatred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cassius</hi> now grown Insolent by his three Consulships,<note place="margin">U. C. 268.</note>
and his two Triumphs, was resolv'd to push on his
Design of Sovereignty; and the more to gain the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the People, propos'd the Division of some late
conquer'd Lands among the Meaner Sort, together
with such Publick Grounds, which through the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the Magistrates had been seiz'd on by the Rich.
Then he recounted to the People his many Services
to the State under his three Consulships, insinuating,
<hi>That his extraordinary Care and wise Management in those
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102323:66"/>
Times, had shewn him no less than sole Governour; and
that since he had already taken Charge of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
it was but just and reasonable he shou'd continue to
do it.</hi> This Speech, tho' so strongly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avouring of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
wou'd have been far more serviceable to him,
had he not brought in the <hi>Latines</hi> and the <hi>Hernici</hi> as
Sharers in these Lands, which he did to gain their
Favours, tho' with the weakning his Interest with
the Common People. This Proposal concerning the
Lands, met with many Oppositions in the Senate,
created Fears and Jealousies among some, and caus'd
various Discourses among others: But the Commons
Forwardness, and the Disturbances that were like to
follow, caus'd the Senate after many Debates, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>their Resolution for dividing the Lands among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
withal excluding all new Allies and Associates, as
having no Reason to expect a Share of what was gain'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Times.</hi> This was the famous <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law,<note place="margin">Lex Agra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria.</note>
which afterwards occasion'd such Mischiefs and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances;
but at present the Promise of it appeas'd
the People, and ruin'd <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Designs: For the year
after his Consulship, the <hi>Quaestors</hi> set a day to him to
answer to the Charge of Aiming at Tyranny, before
the People; where he was accus'd of a Multitude of
Crimes of that Nature; and notwithstanding his
premeditated Orations, his many Services, and the
Intercession of all his Friends and Clients in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was condemn'd to be thrown down the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peian</hi>
Rock, and was straight executed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Soon after his Death, the Commons were very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
for the Execution of the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, which
<hi>Cassius</hi> had set on foot; but the Senate being resolv'd
to divert it as much as possible, caus'd the Consuls to
prepare for an Expedition. The <hi>Plebeians</hi> inrag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

their Disappointment, and the Loss of a Person
whom they expected to have been so serviceable to
'em, refus'd to List themselves, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> always
protecting 'em from Punishment; but the Name of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102323:66"/>
a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and their suspecting <hi>Appius</hi> to be the Man,
soon frighted 'em into a Compliance; so <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
one of the Consuls, wasted the Territories of the <hi>Vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes,</hi>
as <hi>Fabius</hi> the other, did those of the <hi>Aequi.</hi> Not
long after, the Commons refusing to List themselves,
the Consuls found means to sit in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi>
out of the City, where the <hi>Tribunes</hi> had no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and there they severely punish'd and fin'd such
as did not appear, to the great Mortification of the
Popular Faction. A third time the Consuls gain'd
their Designs by getting over one of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to
their side; a way they were often forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to make use
of afterwards. In the mean time, they had several
Wars abroad with the <hi>Volsci</hi> and <hi>Aequi,</hi> and soon after
the <hi>Veientes;</hi> there being many Ravages on both sides,
with some Battels, but of no great Note or Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
At home were greater Contests and Quarrels
between the <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> concerning this <hi>Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Law; the former always declining the execution
of it, and the latter as constantly urging it, but with
no other effect than the blowing up of Dissentions,
and the increasing of Factions. And this was the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
and unhappy State of <hi>Rome</hi> for about five
Years together, as may be seen at large in <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. In the midst of these Troubles,<note place="margin">U. C. 274.</note> when <hi>Fabius</hi>
and <hi>Virginius</hi> were Consuls, two Years after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s
Expedition into <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Veientes</hi> by the Assistance
of other of the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> march'd with a powerful
Army against the <hi>Romans. Virginius</hi> oppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d 'em with
another, but was so overpower'd by 'em, that he had
lost his Army, had not <hi>Fabius</hi> came from the <hi>Aequi</hi>
with timely Succour, and brought him off. Upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Retreat, the <hi>Veientes</hi> made Incursions almost to
the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great Injury and Dishonour
of the City; and what added more to their Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
was the lowness of the Treasury, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of the People about the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law. This
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102323:67"/>
reduc'd the Senate to very great Extremities, till at last
the whole Family of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> a noble Stock, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
offer'd their Service to be a constant Guard to
the Frontiers, without any Charge to the Publick,
which was gratefully accepted by the Senate. They
were in Number 306, which with their Clients and
Friends, made up 4000, all commanded by <hi>Marcus,</hi>
the last years Consul; and to them was afterwards
sent another Company under <hi>Fabius</hi> the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.
These brave Adventurers fortifi'd themselves in a
Castle, which they call'd <hi>Cremera,</hi> as standing upon a
River of the same Name, nigh the Frontiers of the
<hi>Veientes,</hi> from which they made great Incursions, and
extreamly annoy'd the Enemy. The following Year,
the <hi>Veientes, Volsci,</hi> and <hi>Aequi,</hi> all agreeing upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
great Preparations were made by the Senate;
<hi>Aemilius</hi> one Consul, led an Army against the <hi>Veientes,</hi>
with whom was join'd <hi>Baebius,</hi> as <hi>Pre-Consul; Servilius</hi>
the other Consul, led another against the <hi>Volsci;</hi> and
<hi>Furius</hi> a third, against the <hi>Aequi.</hi> The latter soon
finish'd his Work; <hi>Servilius</hi> was forc'd to draw out
the War at length; but <hi>Aemilius</hi> engag'd the <hi>Veien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
and their Allies, and overthrew 'em; then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon their Camp, forc'd 'em to beg Peace; the
Conditions of which being left to his Discretion
by the Senate, he made a League with 'em upon
Terms so little Advantageous to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that
they gain'd him much Hatred, and lost him the
Honour of a Triumph; which so enrag'd him, that
he immediately disbanded his Troops, endeavouring
still more to incence the Commons against the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
                  <p>The Year following, when <hi>Horatius</hi> and <hi>Menenius</hi>
were Consuls, eleven Cities of <hi>Hetruria</hi> declar'd against
the <hi>Veientes</hi> for making Peace without their Consent,
and forc'd 'em to break it. Their Pretence against
<hi>Rome</hi> was, that the <hi>Fabii</hi> were not drawn off from
<hi>Cremera,</hi> upon which they advanc'd towards 'em with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102323:67"/>
a powerful Army; whereupon <hi>Menenius</hi> was order'd
against <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and <hi>Horatius</hi> against the <hi>Volsci.</hi> The
<hi>Veientes</hi> not daring to Attack this Valiant Body of the
<hi>Fabii</hi> in their Fortress, drew 'em out by a Stratagem,
causing several Herds of Cattle, and Flocks of Sheep
to be driven to the neighbouring Places, and laying
several great Parties in Ambuscade. The Design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> took,
and the <hi>Fabian</hi> Adventurers were all unfortunately
cut off; tho' at first by forming themselves into a
Wedge, they gain'd the top of a Hill, and there
though wholly encompassed, made an incredible
Slaughter of the Enemy.<note place="margin">U. C. 276.</note> 
                     <hi>Livy</hi> says, That none of
this Family was left, but only one young Lad, from
whom afterwards sprung <hi>Fabius Maximus;</hi> but <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
much questions this Tradition. The <hi>Veientes,</hi>
now Masters of <hi>Cremera,</hi> advanc'd boldly towards
the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which lay encamp'd not far off,
and might have reliev'd the <hi>Fabii:</hi> Then taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>Menenius</hi>'s Unskilfulness, they possess'd
themselves of a Hill nigh his Camp, from whence
they streightned him so, that he was forc'd to Fight
upon very unequal Terms, and his Army was much
worsted. The <hi>Romans</hi> quitted their Camp, and fled
in such Disorder, that had the <hi>Veientes</hi> been mindful
of any thing but Plunder, they might have destroy'd
'em all. The next day they enter'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
and possess'd themselves of the Hill <hi>Ianicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
two Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the great Damage and
Disgrace of the City: But <hi>Horatius,</hi> the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
returning from the <hi>Volsci,</hi> overthrew 'em twice,
and much eas'd the People, but cou'd not yet
wholly dislodge the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>The Year following, <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Virginius,</hi> two
experienc'd Warriors, were made Consuls, which gave
great Hopes to the People, who were now extreamly
streightned for want of Corn and Trade, which was
the more felt by reason of the Populousness of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for at the next <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

People were ready upon every Opportunity to seize
on the Stores of the Rich; and the Consuls endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to appease 'em by buying what Corn they

Sale, till their Levies and Troops were compleated.
When they had rais'd a sufficient Number of Men,
one Night they drew out their Troops from the City,
towards the Enemy, and passing the River before day,
unexpectedly fell upon 'em, entirely routed em, and
clear'd the Hill, they retiring in great Disorder to
their own Territories. This Campaign ended, <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>

and severely fin'd for suffering the <hi>Fabii</hi> to be cut off,
whom the People so gratefully esteem'd, that they
plac'd the day of their Defeat among their <hi>Nefasti,</hi> or
unlucky days, whereon no Work of great consequence
was to be undertaken. The War was still carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and within two years after, the <hi>Veientes</hi> were so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd,
having been overthrown in Battel, together
with their Confederates the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and now closely
hem'd in, that they begg'd Peace of the <hi>Romans:</hi> And
having purchas'd leave to send to the Senate, with a
whole Years Pay for the Consuls Army, and Money
for two Months Provision, they obtain'd a Truce for
Forty Years. Thus ended the War with the <hi>Veien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
after Seven Years Contests on both sides.</p>
                  <p>V. The following year,<note place="margin">U. C. 280.</note> 
                     <hi>Aemilius</hi> and <hi>Vopiscus</hi> being
Consuls, the old Stirs about the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
by <hi>Genutius,</hi> one of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who boldly set a
day to <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Furius,</hi> the last Years Consuls, to
answer before the People, why they did not divide
the Lands. This Quarrel had like to have been fatal
to the City, had not <hi>Genutius's</hi> sudden Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it; after which the Sedition might have been
quite appeas'd, had the Consuls born their Success
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102323:68"/>
with Moderation: But, making new Levies, they
offer'd to force one <hi>Volero,</hi> a turbulent Fellow, and
formerly an Officer, to List himself for a Common
Soldier, and upon his refusing, they order'd him to
be stripp'd and scourg'd. But <hi>Volero</hi> fled to the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi>
who protected him, and violently exclaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Tyranny of the Consuls. This diverted
the People from the thoughts of Lands, and rais'd new
Quarrels concerning Priviledges and Liberty. And
the Year after, <hi>Volero</hi> getting to be one of the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
himself, the more to retrench the Consular Power,
propos'd a Law for holding the Assemblies of <hi>Tribes</hi>
instead of that of the <hi>Curiae,</hi> call'd <hi>Comitia Curiata;</hi>
which was so contriv'd as to take in greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and to give the Commons much more Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Power than formerly. This Proposal was
much urg'd by the <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

by the <hi>Patritians,</hi> that <hi>Volero</hi> cou'd not accomplish
his Designs before his Time was expir'd.</p>
                  <p>The next Year, <hi>Volero,</hi> by his mighty Promises, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
himself to be made <hi>Tribune</hi> a second time; and
the Senate to balance him, got <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> the Son
of <hi>Appius</hi> now absent, to be made Consul, tho' against
his Will, and with him <hi>Quintius Capit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>linus,</hi> who hapn'd
to be of a contrary Temper. <hi>Appius</hi> in a Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
oppos'd the Common's Designs so hotly and
violently, and so sharply reprimanded them for their
rude Actions and Seditious Practices, that the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
saucily commanded him to depart the Assembly;
and upon his Refusal, to be sent to Prison. This
Piece of Boldness was so surprizing to the Fathers,
that all were ready to rise up in Arms, and the <hi>Lictors</hi>
were beaten back that went to lay Hands on him;
he being defended by a Company of stout young
Men, an unseemly Contest ensu'd, which beginning
with Railings and Jostlings, proceeded to Blows and
throwing of Stones. But <hi>Quintius,</hi> the other Consul,
by his Intreaties, and throwing himself into the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102323:69"/>
Middle, and by the help of the Graver Senators,
prevented the Tumult from proceeding to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inconveniencies, which was ended shortly
after by the Night. But all Disturbances did not
end here, for within a few Days after, the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
and the People seiz'd on the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd
themselves against the <hi>Patritians.</hi> This might
have been of the most dangerous Consequence, had
not <hi>Quintius</hi> by his mild Intreaties and fair Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
perswaded the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to refer this Law to the
Senate's Discretion;<note place="margin">U. C. 282.</note> which after many long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
permitted it to be put to the <hi>Comitia,</hi> and so
it was pass'd.</p>
                  <p>This was call'd the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Comitia Tributa.</note> where all the
Free <hi>Romans</hi> voted according to their <hi>Tribes:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

no Respect to either of these Qualifications, but all
Free <hi>Romans</hi> in or without the City, Poor or Rich,
might have Voices. Another Difference between this
and the <hi>Curiata Comitia,</hi> was the Place of Assembly;

any Observation of Birds. But the most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Difference between these two <hi>Comitia's,</hi> was
this; in the <hi>Curiata</hi> such things were treated of, and
confirm'd by the Suffrages of the <hi>Curiae,</hi> as the <hi>Senate</hi>
had first decreed; but in the <hi>Tributa,</hi> all Things were
manag'd without any consulting of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and
were wholly determin'd by the Votes of the <hi>Tribes</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were chiefly, <hi>The chusing of Inferior Magistrates, as the</hi>

This new Law gave the Commons still more Power
and Authority, and made 'em still more Bold and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,
to the danger of many a <hi>Patritian,</hi> and to the
Ruine of <hi>Appius,</hi> whose ill Success against the <hi>Volsci</hi>

                     <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi>
and <hi>Volsci,</hi> and had generally the Advantage.
From the <hi>Volsci</hi> was taken <hi>Antium,</hi> a considerable City
on the Sea, 28 Miles <hi>South-East</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they
made a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony. For nine Years together, none
of these got any considerable Advantage over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
tho' in the midst of these Wars, there hapned
a most grievous Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> which swept away
an innumerable Company of the Slaves, a fourth
Part of the Senators, both the Consuls, and most of
the <hi>Tribunes.</hi> The <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Volsci</hi> were at last much

and <hi>Veturius,</hi> the Consuls, obtain'd one a <hi>Triumph,</hi>

oppos'd their Designs, casting the meaner Sort like
Slaves out of the <hi>Forum.</hi> Among these, <hi>Caeso
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102323:70"/>
Quintius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi> was Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
a Person of great Courage, whom the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
resolv'd to make an Example to all young Men, and
therefore set him a Day to answer for his Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the People, which caus'd new Stirs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.
<hi>Caeso</hi> being admitted to Bail, fled into <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria;</hi>
whereupon his Father sold almost all his Estate
to reimburse the Sureties, and then retreating to a
small Farm, and a little Cottage beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi>
liv'd retir'd from the World, laboriously working
for his Living.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> were much deceiv'd in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the young <hi>Patritians</hi> so hotly oppos'd 'em,
that they cou'd act nothing of Consequence this
Consulship. The next Year, the same <hi>Tribunes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen again, they caus'd various Rumors to be
spread abroad, <hi>That many of the</hi> Senators <hi>and</hi> Patriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>had form'd a Plot, and conspir'd to Murther the</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,
<hi>and Ruine all the Authority of the</hi> Plebeians. This
Contrivance was design'd to fright the Senate into a
Compliance, but had no other Effect than the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
great Tumults and Disturbances among the
Commons. These Troubles were so great as to give
Occasion to <hi>Herdonius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 293.</note> a <hi>Sabine,</hi> with 4000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men to

which put the whole City into a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation,
all being in a Confusion. <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
were then Consuls, and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> persuaded
the Multitude not to Fight, except the <hi>Patritians</hi>
wou'd engage by Oath to create Ten Men for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Laws, and suffer the Commons to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Priviledges with them. <hi>Claudius</hi> wou'd have
wholly slighted their Assistance, but <hi>Valerius</hi> finding
such pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing Necessity for 'em, promis'd upon Oath
to endeavour to satisfy the Desire of the Commons
when the War was ended. Whereupon <hi>Claudius</hi> was
appointed to look to the City, and <hi>Valerius</hi> valiantly
attack'd the <hi>Capitol</hi> on all sides, and took it by Storm,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102323:70"/>
but with the Loss of his Life; the Slaves being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
according to their Deserts, and the rest made
Prisoners of War.</p>
                  <p>This War finish'd, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> requir'd <hi>Claudius</hi> to
make good the Promise of his deceas'd Collegue; but
he alledg'd, <hi>He cou'd do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>othing himself,</hi> and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Comitia</hi> for the chusing a new Consul. The
Fathers, the better to support their Interest, resolv'd
upon <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi> Father to <hi>Caeso</hi> lately fled;
and immediately sent for him to the City. The
Messengers found him hard at Plow, only in his
Truss, and a Cap on his Head; but being told of
their coming by a <hi>Viator</hi> that ran before, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself in a better Habit. Being saluted by the
Name of <hi>Consul,</hi> invested with Purple, honour'd by
the <hi>Fasces</hi> and other <hi>Ensigns</hi> of Magistracy, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to begin his Journey; but after a little Pause he
answer'd with Tears, <hi>Then for this Year my poor little
Field must go unsown, and we shall be in danger of Want.</hi>
After this, taking his leave of his Wife, he departed
for the City. There <hi>Quintius</hi> partly by Cunning, and
partly by Threats restrain'd the <hi>Tribunes</hi> from prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Law; and carry'd himself so as to be a
Terror to the Multitude when ever they refus'd
to List themselves, and their greatest Incourager
when their Behaviour was such as deserv'd it.
He perform'd his Office with that Prudence and
Justice, and likewise with that Civility and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
that the Commons were now of Opinion,
that they stood in no need of new Laws: Then
having finish'd his Consulship, he to the Concern
of the whole Senate, betook himself to his little
Cottage, and his former laborious Course of Life.
The Year following, the <hi>Aequi</hi> surpriz'd <hi>Tusculum,</hi>
but were worsted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> together with their
Friends the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and were forc'd to beg Peace:
And in this Year, there were found 119000 Free
Citizens, according to <hi>Eutropius.</hi>

In the next Consulship, the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Volsci</hi> were
drawn to revolt by <hi>Gracchus Claelius,</hi> a ruling Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
'em, who by his Industry so hemm'd in and
block'd up the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, that it was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being lost. This put the City into a great
Consternation, so that they were glad to have recourse
to a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and <hi>Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolv'd upon.<note place="margin">Dic. iv. U. C. 295.</note> The Messengers found him sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and labouring as before; but he seeing himself
made <hi>Dictator</hi> by the 24 <hi>Axes,</hi> the Purple, the Horses,
and other Royal <hi>Ensigns,</hi> was so far from being pleas'd
with the Honour, that he said with great Concern,
<hi>This years Crop will also be lost, and my poor Family must
be Starv'd.</hi> At his entring the City, he encourag'd
the People what he cou'd, and chose <hi>Tarquinius</hi> for
his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi> then drawing out his Troops,
he fell upon <hi>Claelius</hi> and forc'd him into his Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and Besieging him a while, brought his whole
Army to his Mercy, who were forc'd to yield at Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
They were all made Prisoners of War; and
in token of Servitude, <hi>Quintius</hi> made 'em pass under
the <hi>Iugum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iugum.</note> which was two Spears set up, with a third
cross, like a Gallows; and likewise made 'em deliver
up <hi>Corbio.</hi> He order'd the choicest Plunder for <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the rest to be given to his Soldiers; then return'd
to the City with a more Magnificent Triumph than
any before him, having defeated a powerful Army,
and plunder'd and fortify'd a City of the Enemy
within Fourteen Days after his Creation. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
resign'd his Office, and when the Senate
and his private Friends wou'd have inrich'd him with
publick Lands, Plunder, and Contributions, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refus'd all, betaking himself again to his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and his old Course of Life; which is one great
Instance of the Abstinence of the <hi>Romans</hi> at that
time. The Year following the <hi>Sabines</hi> with the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi>
retook <hi>Corbio,</hi> against whom when Levies were
to be made, the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who were all created a

Fourth time, withstood them again. Whereupon
the Fathers with weeping Eyes, made use of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
offering to go in their own Persons if they
refus'd; which so sensibly mov'd the People, <hi>That
they promis'd all manner of Obedience, if they wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

                  <p>VII. The Domestick Troubles seem'd for a while
to be allay'd,<note place="margin">U. C. 297.</note> but in a Years time, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all together, made farther Incroachments than
ever, and ventur'd so far as to Assemble the Senate
by their own proper Authority; moreover requiring
Mount <hi>Aventine</hi> for the People to build on, which
being a Mile and an half in compass, was not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inhabited, but Common, and full of Wood. The
Senate, after most violent Quarrels on both sides, out
of hopes it might be a Means to suppress the <hi>Agrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Seditions, granted those Parts that were Common,
to the People, who spent the remaining part of the
Year in Building, to the considerable Encrease of the
City. This Grant satisfy'd the Commons but for a
short time; for the next Year their former Complaints
were renew'd, and carry'd on with all the violent
Heats und Animosities that cou'd be imagin'd, often
proceeding to Blows; till at last the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> having
thrown off all Respect and Reverence, insolently set
a Day to the Consuls themselves to answer before the
People. But this appear'd so odious to many, that
they were prevail'd upon to let such a Matter fall,
as being most dangerous both to themselves, and the
whole State of <hi>Rome.</hi> But at the same time they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102323:72"/>
made a firm Resolution to prefer the <hi>Agrarian Law,</hi>
which they agreed to do in the next Assembly, and
for that Reason they appointed a day apart for the
<hi>Comitia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this Assembly were gather'd together great
Numbers of all Ranks and Qualities; where the
<hi>Tribunes</hi> having spoken very largely on that Subject,
several of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> related what good Services
they had done the Commonwealth, and how little
Reward they had for their Pains; Among which
was <hi>Siccius Dentatus,</hi> a Man of admirable Shape and
Courage, 58 Years of Age, and well furnish'd with
Military Eloquence for a Seditious Attempt, who
told 'em, <hi>He had serv'd his Country in the Wars forty Years,
had been an Officer thirty, first a Centurion, then a</hi> Tribune;
<hi>had fought one hundred and twenty Battels, in which, by
the Force of his single Arm, he had sav'd many</hi> Patriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>Lives, recover'd several Standards, perform'd many
great and dangeros Exploits, gain'd 14 Civick Crowns,
3 Mural Crowns, and 8 Golden Crowns; besides 83 Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Chains, 60 Golden Bracelets, 18 pure Spears, and
23 Horse-Trappings, whereof 9 were for killing Enemies
challeng'd to single Combats; moreover he had receiv'd 45
Wounds, all before and none behind, particularly twelve
in that Day the</hi> Capitol <hi>was recover'd: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he had fought so many Years, serv'd in so many
Expeditions, receiv'd so many Wounds, help'd to gain so
many large Territories for his Country, and had spar'd no
Cost or Labour, nor refus'd any Danger or Difficulty; yet
neither he, nor any of his Fellow-sharers in his Dangers, had
receiv'd the least Portion of those Lands they had gain'd by
their Swords, but that they were possess'd by others who had
not the least Title or Merit to shew for 'em; and to such too,
whose private Attempts, and sinister Designs, better entitl'd
'em to a disgraceful Punishment, than to any Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
These Particulars he urg'd at large, withal
accusing the <hi>Patritians</hi> of many Designs against the
Privileges of the People, and the Publick Peace of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102323:72"/>
the City; which he did with such Rhetorick and
Cunning, that the Commons were almost transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Man. Yet still the <hi>Patritians</hi> by their
wonderful Prudence and cautious Management, tho'
with extream Hazard to themselves, so far defeated
their Designs, that the Law cou'd not be pass'd.</p>
                  <p>These Disturbances were a little diverted by the
Enemies March as far as <hi>Tusculum,</hi> against whom <hi>Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
went as Volunteer, where the Consuls put him
upon a most desperate Attempt, which gain'd him the
highest Honour, instead of procuring his Ruin, as they
imagin'd it wou'd have done. A notable Victory was
gain'd over the <hi>Aequi</hi> by his Means, and he reveng'd
himself upon the Consuls, by preventing their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
this Year, and by getting 'em fin'd the next,
when he himself was made one of the <hi>Tribunes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 299.</note> Upon
which a Law pass'd in the <hi>Centuriata Comitia,</hi> That <hi>all
Magistrates shou'd have Power to punish such as violated
their Authority</hi> (which before was only the Priviledge
of the Consuls) <hi>But not by any Fine exceeding two Oxen
or thirty Sheep;</hi> which Law was long observ'd by the
<hi>Romans.</hi> This new Law pleas'd the People, and all
now being a little more moderate, the whole Body of
<hi>Rome</hi> began to consider of Ways and Methods to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
the Government more firmly, and to prevent all
dangerous Feuds for the Future; thereupon it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
That Ambassadors shou'd be sent to the <hi>Greek</hi>
Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to <hi>Athens,</hi> to bring such Laws
from thence as were most excellent, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the good of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>For this great Design, <hi>Posthumius, Sulpicius,</hi> and
<hi>Manlius</hi> were fix'd upon, and Gallies assign'd for their
use, suitable to the Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. The
Year following, there hapned a great Famine, and a
most grievous Plague, to the great Damage of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And the Year after, the Ambassadors return'd out
of <hi>Greece</hi> with their Laws, presently after which
the <hi>Tribunes</hi> requir'd, that Law-makers might be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102323:73"/>
appointed; and after many grave and prudent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
and some Opposition, it was Granted. The
Method that they all agreed upon was, <hi>That Ten Men
out of the Chief of the Senate shou'd be elected, whose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
continuing for a Year, shou'd be the same with that of
Kings and Consuls, and that without any Appeal; that all
other Magistracies shou'd lay down their Authorities till
they might be renew'd according to the Laws.</hi> This was
agreed on by the Senate, and confirm'd by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the Consuls elect, immediately resigning
their Office, were made part of the <hi>Decemvirate;</hi>
and also the <hi>Tribunes, Aediles, Quaestors,</hi> &amp;c. were
divested of all Power and Authority. This was a
most remarkable Change of Government, as great as
that from Kings to Consuls, and was the second
sort of Intermission of the <hi>Consular Power,</hi> which
hapned in the second Year of the <hi>82d, Olympiad,</hi> 302
Years after the Building of the City, 57 after the
Banishment of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> 30 after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition
into <hi>Greece,</hi> and 450 before our Saviour's Nativity.</p>

former Consuls; with <hi>Iulius, Veturius,</hi> and <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
all Senators. These being invested with almost
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102323:73"/>
absolute Power, agreed that only one of 'em at one
time, shou'd have the <hi>Fasces</hi> and other Consular <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi>
to which they were to succeed by Turns, for a
certain limitted Time, till the Year came about. And
he whose Turn it was for the time being, assembled
the Senate, confirm'd the Decrees, and did all other
Things that belong'd to a chief Magistrate to do; the
rest, to avoid Envy and Suspicion, differ'd little in
Habit from private Persons, having only an <hi>Accensus,</hi>
or a sort of a Beadle going before 'em. These great
Men for a time manag'd all things with such Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Moderation, that the Commonwealth
seem'd most Hapy under them; and <hi>Appius</hi> above
the rest grew exceeding Popular, carrying away the
chief Praise from the whole Colledge, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
greater, and more secret Designs than the rest.
At length, having made a Model out of such Laws
as were brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> and their own Countries
Customs, they expos'd 'em to the View of all Men
in Ten Tables, that any one might make Exceptions.
When all were approv'd of, a <hi>Senatus Consultum</hi> pass'd
<hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> for the ratifying of these Laws;
and the Question being put to the People in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiata

confirm'd in the Presence of the <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Augurs,</hi> and <hi>Priests;</hi> then they were ingraven in

                  <p>The Year being almost expir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, the <hi>Decemviri</hi>
mov'd the Senate for a Continuance of this Office;
and after a great Debate, it was resolv'd by them, to
have the same kind of Magistracy for the following
Year, because something seem'd yet Wanting to the
new Model; but especially because this Office Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the <hi>Tribune</hi>-ship, which had been an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Burden to the State. A <hi>Comitia</hi> was appointed
on purpose, where the most Ancient and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Fathers stood for this Office, fearing if it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102323:74"/>
fell into the Hands of turbulent Persons, it might
prove very dangerous to the Peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<hi>Appius</hi> had now gain'd the Hearts of the
People, and his Behaviour and Actions were extoll'd
to the Skies, therefore they labour'd earnestly to retain
him in his Place; but he cunningly desir'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
the Undertaking such a troublesome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Work. But at last, overcome as it were by the
Intreaties of the People, he plac'd himself among the
<hi>Candidates;</hi> where by a crafty Insinuation of his
own Services, and a malicious Accusation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Patritians,</hi> as owing him a Spight for his publick
Spirit, he not only made way for himself, but for
his Friends too. He procur'd to be chosen with
himself, <hi>Fabius,</hi> a former Consul; <hi>Cornelius, Servili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Minucius, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Rabulius,</hi> all <hi>Patritians;</hi>
and <hi>Petilius, Duellius,</hi> and <hi>Oppius,</hi> all <hi>Plebeians;</hi> whom
he took in, the more to Ingratiate himself with the
Rabble; saying, <hi>It was very just that the Commons shou'd
have a Share in that Magistracy, which was to Govern
and Command all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the first Day after their Creation, they all made
their Appearance with Regal Ensigns, which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
terrify'd the People, especially the <hi>Axes</hi> now
added again to the <hi>Rods,</hi> which <hi>Poplicola</hi> had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to prevent the Dissatisfaction of the Common
Sort. The first thing the <hi>Decemviri</hi> did, was their
promising each other by Oath, <hi>To be of one Mind;
to retain the Power in their own Hands; to be of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
among themselves, and to admit none into
their Number; never to make use of</hi> Senatus Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum'<hi>s
and</hi> Plebiscitum'<hi>s but in Case of Necessity, Acting
most Things by Vertue of their own Power.</hi> These things
they observ'd with great Exactness; nothing valuing
the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and People; and exercising their
Authority with all Licentiousness: By which Means
it came to pass, that they being both Legislators and
Judges, many Citizens were unjustly put to Death,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102323:74"/>
and others illegally depriv'd of their Estates; whose
Causes they all formally judg'd, that they might
make the greater Shew and Pretence of Justice. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers
were subborn'd out of their Dependents, each
one affording all Assistance herein to his Collegue;
and such private Persons as had Suits depending, had
no other way to secure their Causes, but by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with the Judges Party, so that in a
short time most of the Citizens were also Corrupted.
And such as were most offended at the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the <hi>Decemvires</hi> Actions, withdrew themselves,
waiting for a new Creation of Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>One very memorable Thing was done by 'em this
Year,<note place="margin">U. C. 303.</note> which was their adding two Tables of Law to
the ten that were made the Year before; whereof
one forbad all Marriages between the <hi>Patritians</hi> and
<hi>Plebeians.</hi> These two together with the other ten, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
went by the name of the <hi>Laws of the Twelve
Tables,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Twelve Tables.</note> being much talk'd of by many Authors, and
extreamly commended by <hi>Cicero,</hi> as containing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the greatest Policy, and excelling the Libraries
of all the Philosophers. They were divided into three
Parts, whereof the first contain'd what belong'd to the
Religion of the <hi>Romans;</hi> the second, what concern'd
the Publick; and the third, the Rights of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
These Laws being establish'd, it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
that Disputations and Controversies wou'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
which requir'd the Interpretation, and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Learned: Now this Interpretation, or
this unwritten Law fram'd by the Learned, was call'd
by the common Name of <hi>Ius Civile,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

certain Cases were compos'd out of these Laws
almost at the same time; which Cases, least the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
shou'd make 'em at their Pleasure, were to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and solemn; and this part of Law was call'd

                     <note place="margin">Actiones Iuris.</note> or <hi>Cases at Law:</hi> So that almost at the

the <hi>Laws of the Twelve Tables,</hi> call'd barely <hi>Leges,</hi> the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102323:75"/>
                     <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and the <hi>Cases at Law.</hi> The rest of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Laws, that were either before or after these,
according to <hi>Pomponius,</hi> were of these sorts; namely,
a <hi>Plebiscitum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plebisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> made by the Commons without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Fathers; or an <hi>Edict</hi> of a Magistrate
call'd <hi>Ius Honorarium;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ius Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarium. Senatus Consultum. Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio.</note> or an Ordinance of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
by their sole Authority, call'd <hi>Senatus Consultum;</hi>
or Lastly, that call'd <hi>Principalis Constitutio,</hi> which was
Enacted by the Prince or the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> who now neither
regarded the Approbation of Senate nor People;
but in a meer Arbitrary Way, continu'd themselves
in Power for the Year following, which was the third
of the <hi>Decemvirate.</hi> They so manag'd the Affairs,
that in a short time even the most considerable of the
Citizens, <hi>Patritians</hi> and others, were either Murder'd or
forc'd to quit the City. At the same time the <hi>Sabines</hi>
and <hi>Aequi</hi> began to invade the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
which did not a little startle the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they found no means of Resistance without first
assembling the Senate, which had been laid aside for
some considerable time. At this pressing Juncture a
Senate was at last call'd, where <hi>Appius</hi> in a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
Oration propounded the Business of the War:
Upon which, <hi>Valerius</hi> the Grand-Son of <hi>Poplicola,</hi> first
stood up, and, tho' <hi>Appius</hi> commanded him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
violently exclaim'd against the Tyranny of the
present Usurpers. He being forc'd to Silence, was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by <hi>Marcus Horatius,</hi> Grand-son to <hi>Poplicola</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
who having express'd great Indignation against
the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> threatned to have him cast Headlong
down the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock. All the Senators exclaim'd
against this, as the highest Breach of their Priviledges,
and an intollerable piece of Injustice: Whereat the
Ten, a little repenting this Rashness, began to excuse
themselves, saying, <hi>They hinder'd none of the Liberty of
speaking to the Matter propounded, but interrupted all Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Orations, which they might do by their Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102323:75"/>
and</hi> Tribunes <hi>receiv'd from the People, not for a Year,
or any limitted Time, but till the great Work of the Laws
shou'd be finish'd; until which they were resolv'd to Act, and
wou'd then give an Account of their Administration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Design of Tyranny and Slavery, too openly
appear'd under this Veil; whereupon <hi>Claudius, Appius</hi>'s
Uncle, stood up, and very handsomely expos'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
and Tyrannical Carriage of his Nephew and
nine Companions; plainly demonstrating, that this
War was solely occasion'd by the present Distempers
of the State; withal advising the Senators to resolve
nothing till the accustom'd Magistrates were first
Created. Many of the younger Sort were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the present Urgency requir'd the War to
be committed to the Management of the <hi>Decemviri;</hi>
and others were for creating a <hi>Dictator,</hi> which Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
had the most plausible Appearance of any: So
that the House was very much divided; many, out of
Fear either of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> or the Enemies, having
alter'd their first Intentions. <hi>Appius</hi> took Advantage
of these Divisions, and look'd upon his own Parties
Votes as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ufficient Determination; whereupon he
immediately commanded the Clerk to draw up a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
Consultum,</hi> whereby <hi>full Power of Levying Forces, and
Commanding them, was given to the</hi> Decemviri; and
straight the <hi>Senate</hi> was dismiss'd, to the great Dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of many. This new way of Proceeding made
<hi>Horatius</hi> and <hi>Valerius</hi> stand upon their own Defence,
gathering together their Clients and Dependents;
and caus'd <hi>Claudius</hi> to go over to the <hi>Sabines,</hi> where he
liv'd. And notwithstanding all the Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> great Multitudes follow'd his
Example, leaving their Native Seats, with their Wives
and Children, and went into a voluntary Exile.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>Decemviri</hi> divided their Army into three
Parts, whereof on continu'd with <hi>Appius</hi> and <hi>Oppius</hi>
in the City; and the other two were commanded
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102323:76"/>
by their Collegues, one against the <hi>Aequi,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against the <hi>Sabines.</hi> The <hi>Aequi</hi> forc'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to abandon their Camp, and fly shamefully;
which caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d great Joy in <hi>Rome</hi> among the Enemies
of the <hi>Decemviri:</hi> So thar <hi>Appius</hi> fearing some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
wrote to his Collegues in the Army, to destroy
their known Adversaries by any Means, which was
Effected upon several. But at <hi>Rome,</hi> among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Siccius Dentatus,</hi> the <hi>Roman Achilles,</hi> as he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
blam'd the Commanders as Cowards and Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
whereupon <hi>Appius,</hi> to secure him, with good
Words perswaded him to go as Lieutenant, or <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

was most Sacred and Honourable among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
having the Power and Authority of a General, and
the Inviolableness, and Veneration of a Priest. Upon
his Arrival at the Camp, he was sent out with a Party
of 100 Men, who had strict Orders to Murder him;
where he shew'd such incredible Strength and Valour,
that he kill'd fifteen of 'em himself, and wounded
twice as many, as <hi>Dionysius</hi> relates it; so that at length
they were forc'd to throw Darts and Stones at him,
keeping some distance, and by that Means effected
their Design. The Assassinates gave out that he fell
into the Enemies hands; but the Soldiers easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Villany, began to grow very Mutinous;
and the <hi>Decemviri</hi> to appease 'em, gave <hi>Siccius</hi> a very
Honourable Burial, which was perform'd with much
Ceremony, and an universal Sorrow among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who from that time thought upon nothing but
a Revolt; which the other Army lying at <hi>Algedum</hi>
against the <hi>Aequi,</hi> soon after found a fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to effect.</p>
                  <p>It was occasion'd dy one <hi>Virginius</hi> a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> who
had a Daughter of most admirable Beauty, and of as
eminent Chastity, whom <hi>Appius</hi> saw by chance, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102323:76"/>
was so extreamly smitten with her, that nothing
cou'd allay his violent Passion. His own Laws had
forbidden him Marrying her, as being a <hi>Plebeian;</hi>
nor cou'd he hope to enjoy her any other Way, but
by procuring <hi>Claudius,</hi> one of his <hi>Clients,</hi> to challenge
her for his Slave; so that the Matter being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, he might judge her to be so. <hi>Claudius,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Instructions, laid Claim to her; and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Matter to a Tryal before <hi>Appius,</hi> he affirm'd,
<hi>That she was natural Daughter to his Slave, procur'd by</hi>

the Assertion. But <hi>Appius,</hi> resolutely bent upon his
lustful and base Design, wou'd hear no Reason, nor
mind any Proof; till at last the loud Cries and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs
of the Multitude, prevail'd with him to deferr
the Matter till her Father cou'd be sent for from the
Camp to defend her Cause, for which he wou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
but one Day. He immediately wrote to <hi>Algedum</hi>
at the Camp to confine <hi>Virginius;</hi> but <hi>Numitor</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>'s
Brother intercepted the Letters, and <hi>Virginius</hi>
pretending the Death of a near Relation, got Leave
to leave the Camp, and come posting to the City.</p>
                  <p>The next Day, <hi>Virginius</hi> appear'd at the Place, to
the great Surprize of <hi>Appius,</hi> he and his Daughter both
in Mourning, accompany'd with several weeping
Matrons, and a numerous Train of Advocates, the
whole City crowding into the <hi>Forum. Virginius</hi> prov'd
the Maid to be his own Daughter; but <hi>Appius,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Greatness of his Power, and inflam'd
with the Heat of his Lust, neither consider'd the just
Defence of the Father, nor the bitter Tears of the
poor Virgin; but was inrag'd at the Pity of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102323:77"/>
by, thinking himself a greater Object of Pity,
who endur'd more for her Beauty's sake than she her
self did. He interrupted all that pleaded in her behalf,
Commanding their Silence, and strait judg'd <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to be right Lord and Owner of her. Great Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
and Lamentations being made, as well by others,
as the Virgin and her Relations, all knowing she was
doom'd to the Tyrant's Lusts, <hi>Appius</hi> commanded all
to depart, and order'd <hi>Claudius</hi> to take Possession of
his Slave. <hi>Virginius</hi> finding no relief, desir'd he might
speak a Word with his Daughter before he parted
from her; which being Granted, he dragg'd her

will send thee to our Ancestors both Free and Unspotted, for
the Merciless Tyrant will suffer thee to be neither here;</hi>
and thereupon stabb'd her to the Heart: Then cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his angry Eyes up to the Tribunal, he cry'd out,
<hi>Appius, thou Tyrant, with this Blood I doom thee to certain
Death!</hi> With the bloody Knife in his Hand, in a
great Rage and Fury, he ran through the City,
wildly calling upon the People in all Places to regain
their Liberty; and coming to the Gate, rod Post to
the Army, a Company of 400 <hi>Plebeians</hi> following
him.</p>
                  <p>In this Posture <hi>Virginius</hi> arriv'd at the Camp, with
the Knife and his Clothes all Bloody; where with all
his Rhetorick and Pathetick Reasons he persuaded 'em
<hi>to revolt from the Ten, and redeem their sinking Country;</hi>
shewing 'em likewise, <hi>That their</hi> Sacramentum <hi>or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Oath, was no ways binding in this Case, because the Oath
suppos'd the Commanders to be made according to Law,
which the Ten were not, having Usurp'd all the Power and
Authority they cou'd pretend to.</hi> The Army, ready enough
for such a Design, immediately decamp'd, some few
<hi>Centurions</hi> only remaining, and took their Station on
Mount <hi>Aventine;</hi> and the next day, fortifying their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102323:77"/>
Camp, chose Ten Captains, whereof one <hi>Oppius</hi> was
Chief: And soon after came great Parties from the
other Army, who were much Offended at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Siccius,</hi> and join'd them; and this was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Separation of the Commons. <hi>Appius</hi> in the mean
time having endeavour'd by Force to suppress the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
he had rais'd in the City, was so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
by the Parties of <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Horatius</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mention'd, that he was forc'd to keep himself
to his House. <hi>Oppius,</hi> one of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> assembled
the Fathers, and urg'd the Punishment of all Desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
but the Senate was so sensible of the threatning
Dangers and Miseries of the State, that they were
glad to come to any Agreement with the Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Therefore, to compose all Differences, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
dispatch'd Messengers to the Army, which
had lately remov'd to the <hi>Holy Mount,</hi> as they had

the Consuls took the Field against the <hi>Aequi, Volsci,</hi>

but the Senate gave 'em a Repulse for making
Laws so much in favour of the Commons, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous

put the People upon considering the Common
Safety of the State, and under the command of
<hi>Quintius</hi> and <hi>Furius</hi> the Consuls for this Year, they
obtain'd a notable Victory over them. This Victory
was attended with a remarkable Determination of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> between the Inhabitants of <hi>Ardea</hi> and
<hi>Aricia,</hi> who had frequent Contests about certain
Lands, and had left it to <hi>Rome</hi> to be Judge. One

and nothing wou'd satisfie the Commons but a
Share in the highest Offices, and Places of greatest
Trust; and for that Reason they propos'd two Laws,
one to permit the Marriages of <hi>Patritians</hi> with <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and the other to make the <hi>Plebeians</hi> capable of
the Consulship, which they never were before. The
Senators took these Proposals most hainously, seeing
their Priviledges in danger to be ruin'd, and were
resolv'd to endure the utmost Extremities rather
than pass these Laws; but finding such violent
Commotions in the State, they pass'd the Law about
Marriages, in hopes that wou'd satisfie the People,
and make them not insist upon the other. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd
the Commons for a short space; but soon after,
when the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Sabines</hi> made great Ravages in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, they took the Advantage of
these Troubles, and utterly refus'd to List them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
till they were made likewise Partakers of the
Consulship, nor cou'd they be prevail'd upon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Matter till the War was over. Upon this,
the Consuls were forc'd to hold a private Conference
of the Chief of the Senators, where after some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
<hi>Claudius</hi> propos'd an Expedient as the most
seasonable in this pressing Conjuncture. He advis'd
'em <hi>by no means to suffer the Consulship to come into the
Hands of the</hi> Plebeians, <hi>but to create certain Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
in the room of Consuls, Six or Eight, whereof one
half at least shou'd be</hi> Patritians: <hi>For by this means they
shou'd seem not to take too much Power to themselves, and
yet retain all their Prerogative.</hi> This Project extreamly
pleas'd the whole Meeting; and that nothing might
seem to be design'd before-hand, they agreed, That
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102323:79"/>
at the next Meeting of the Senate, the Consuls shou'd
not ask the Senior's Opinions first, as the Custom
was, but the Younger's, and such as were most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.
And <hi>Genutius,</hi> the Consul's Brother, was
fix'd upon to propound this way of Reconciliation,
purely as his own private Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Assembling the Senate, <hi>Canuleius,</hi> the
<hi>Tribune,</hi> upbraided the Consuls with holding of secret
Meetings, and of managing dangerous Designs against
the State. The Consuls on the other side protested
their Innocency, and to demonstrate this more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
gave leave to any of the younger sort to speak
first, who cou'd not be suppos'd to be acquainted
with any private Contrivances, and to <hi>Valerius</hi> in
particular. <hi>Valerius</hi> advis'd the Fathers to favour the
Commons, <hi>who had so well deserv'd both in gaining of
Dominions, and getting and preserving the Liberty of the
City;</hi> and urg'd further, <hi>That the City cou'd not be Free
till there was an Equality of Right. Horatius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
being next ask'd, seconded him; and after
that, <hi>Claudius</hi> being desir'd to speak, the better to
conceal his Design, according to his old way, broke
out into bitter Invectives against the Commons, and
advis'd, <hi>That the Law might not pass, neither then nor
ever after.</hi> This caus'd some Disturbance, but at last
<hi>Genutius</hi> was ask'd his Opinion, who as it was before
design'd, propounded this Expedient to the Senate
and People, <hi>That Six Governors shou'd be chosen with
Consular Authority, three</hi> Patritians, <hi>and three</hi> Plebeians;
<hi>and when the time of their Magistracy shou'd be expir'd,
then the Senate and People might resolve whether they
wou'd have the same Office, or that of Consuls for the Year
following.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Project was gladly embrac'd both by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Commons; and leave was given to any <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian</hi>
to stand for this new Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet so fickle were
the Minds of the Multitude, and so pleas'd with the
bare Novelty of the thing, that tho' many <hi>Plebeians</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102323:79"/>
stood for this Office, they thought none of 'em wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that Honour, but bestow'd it upon Eminent
<hi>Patritians</hi> only, who appear'd as <hi>Candidates.</hi> This
was the third Intermission of the <hi>Consular Power,</hi> tho'
the Authority was equivalent; and likewise the third
great Change in <hi>Rome,</hi> which hapned scarce eight
Years after the second, in the 310th of the City, 65
Years after the Expulsion of the Kings, and 442 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

being call'd by the Name of <hi>Tribuni Militum,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Tribunes,</hi> three <hi>Patritians</hi> only being chosen,
namely <hi>Sempronius Atratinus, Claelius Siculus,</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius
Longus.</hi> Thus at first they were but three in
Number, afterwards they were increas'd to four, and
at length to Six. And tho' these had the Power and
Ensigns of <hi>Consuls,</hi> yet their Number, together with
the Mixture of <hi>Plebeians</hi> which afterwards press'd in,
made their Priviledge and Dignity seem something
Different and Inferior: Whence a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the
People afterwards in way of Contempt, call'd them
a <hi>Proconsular Image;</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a <hi>Master of the Horse</hi> was inferior to a <hi>Consul,</hi>
compar'd his Power to that of these Magistrates.
These <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> having held their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102323:80"/>
almost eight Weeks, were constrain'd to lay it
down, for that the <hi>Augurs</hi> found some Flaw in their
Election, and <hi>Consuls</hi> were created afresh, <hi>Sempronius</hi>
being one: So that in Seventy three Days here was
another Change of Government, the Old one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
over the New.</p>
                  <p>The following Year they procur'd <hi>Consuls</hi> again to
be elected, and not <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> who were
<hi>Geganius</hi> and <hi>Quintius,</hi> who had both been <hi>Consuls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
In this Year the Consuls finding the Publick
Business to increase,<note place="margin">U. C. 311. Censors.</note> to ease themselves, procur'd two
new Magistrates to be created, call'd <hi>Censors,</hi> so nam'd
because the Business of the <hi>Census,</hi> which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
one great part of their Office. These Magistrates at
first made no great Appearance, but in a short time
they became Persons of extraordinary Dignity and
Power, having all the Ornaments and Ensigns of
Consuls, except <hi>Lictors.</hi> At the beginning, they
were created for five Years, which space was call'd
<hi>Lustrum,</hi> as was formerly observ'd; but soon after,
their time was shortned to a Year and half, but still
they were chosen but once in five Years, the <hi>Census</hi>
being no oftner perform'd. Their Power was very
large, and their Office very extensive; for tho' at first
they only perform'd the <hi>Census,</hi> making an Estimate
of Men's Estates, distributing them into their several
<hi>Classes</hi> and <hi>Centuries,</hi> taking the Numbers of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in a short time they became Publick
Inspectors of Men's Lives and Manners, and were
therefore frequently call'd <hi>Magistri Morum;</hi> and took
upon 'em to degrade <hi>Senators</hi> upon Misdemeanors,
to take away Horse and Ring from <hi>Equites</hi> or <hi>Knights,</hi>
and to turn <hi>Plebeians</hi> out of their <hi>Tribes,</hi> and put 'em
into a Lower, and many other things of the like
Nature. The two first <hi>Censors</hi> were <hi>Papirius</hi> and <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi>
both <hi>Patritians,</hi> and the two last Years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls;
and these high Officers were for nigh 100
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102323:80"/>
Years chosen out of the <hi>Patritians,</hi> and only such as
were Eminent and Famous, and had formerly been
<hi>Consuls,</hi> till the <hi>Plebeians</hi> found the way to this, as
they did to all other Offices. Afterwards the <hi>Roman</hi>
Colonies had their Magistrates, call'd <hi>Sub-Censors,</hi>
who gave an Account to these, of the Number of
Inhabitants, and their Wealth, which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
register'd in the <hi>Censor</hi>'s Books.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers were extreamly satisfy'd that they had
got these Magistrates created out of their own Body,
and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> esteeming their Power to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
were willing enough to agree to it. In this
same Year, the <hi>Ardeans,</hi> as being Allies, sent to the
<hi>Romans</hi> for Succour against the <hi>Volsci,</hi> who were call'd
in by some dangerous Factions among themselves,
and had reduc'd them to great Extremities. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
were ready to serve the Persons they had so
lately injur'd about their Lands, and immediately
<hi>Geganius,</hi> the Consul, was sent with a considerable
Army against the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and he soon reliev'd the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi>
and clear'd the Country of the Enemy. This
Victory was very memorable, and the Consul had a
noble Triumph, <hi>Clulius,</hi> the <hi>Volscian</hi> General, being
led before the Chariot. <hi>Ardea</hi> had now been so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
with the Factions, and the late Wars, that
they were willing to accept of a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony,
which the Senate sent soon after; and to shew a
further Piece of Generosity, restor'd all the Lands
they had before adjudg'd to the Publick Use, tho'
with the great Complaints of many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>II. The Heats of the Commons were still kept
alive but for some time were of no dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
till three Years after, <hi>Sp. Maelius,</hi> a rich
Knight, incourag'd upon these Contentions, by his
large Bounty to the Poorer Sort in time of a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
began to affect Popularity, and by that means
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102323:81"/>
to aspire to the Sovereignty. His Designs were soon
guess'd at, and he was accus'd of this by <hi>Minucius,</hi>
who had the care of the Provisions; which thing in
these unsettled times so startled the Senate, that by
advice of <hi>Quintius,</hi> the Consul, they order'd a <hi>Dictator</hi>
to be immediately created, the Tumult hourly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
<hi>Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>v.</hi> U. C. 314.</note> now 80 Years old, was
the Person, who chose <hi>Servilius Ahala</hi> for his <hi>Master
of the Horse.</hi> The <hi>Dictator</hi> presently summon'd <hi>Maelius</hi>
to appear, who being well back'd and supported by
the Mob, refus'd to obey, now breaking out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Rebellion; whereupon <hi>Ahala</hi> set upon him in
the <hi>Forum,</hi> and kill'd him, and was justifi'd by <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
who commanded his Goods to be sold, and his
House to be demolish'd. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> inrag'd at the

hoping that some <hi>Plebeian</hi> might get into
the number of Six, which might give 'em an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of revenging his Death: But Three only

                  <p>The following Year, Consuls were created again,

an Eminent Youth of the City, for his

with his own Hands, and by that means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Honour of the <hi>Opima Spolia,</hi> or <hi>Royal Spoils,</hi>
which were the only Spoils of that Nature since the
Reign of <hi>Romulus.</hi> These Spoils were a great Grace
to <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s Triumph, and a great Honour to <hi>Cossus,</hi>
they being with extraordinary Pomp and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
consecrated to <hi>Iupiter Feretrius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two Years after this, there hapned a great Plague
in the City, and the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Veientes</hi> press'd so
hard upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were forc'd to have
recourse to another <hi>Dictator;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>vii.</hi> U. C. 318.</note> and <hi>Servilius Priscus</hi>
was created, who chose <hi>Aebutius Elva</hi> for his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Horse. Servilius</hi> was so successful, as not
only to drive the Enemy back, but to take the
Town of <hi>Fidenae,</hi> which he did by a Mine. The
taking of <hi>Fidenae</hi> was so disadvantageous to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
that the <hi>Veientes</hi> sent to all their Neighbours
about for Succour, threatning no less than entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to <hi>Rome.</hi> These formidable Preparations
put the <hi>Romans</hi> upon creating another <hi>Dictator,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
above a Year after the last,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>viii.</hi> U. C. 319.</note> which was <hi>Aemilius,</hi>
who had been <hi>Dictator</hi> three Years before, and he
chose <hi>Posthumius Tubertus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse.</hi>
In a short time, the <hi>Romans</hi> found that the <hi>Veientes</hi>
cou'd procure no Aid, so the <hi>Dictator</hi> had little Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
abroad; but resolving to do something at
home, he caus'd the <hi>Censorship</hi> to be reduc'd to a Year
and a half, which was eight Years after its first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and then laid down his Office. The <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
from this took an Occasion to remove him out
of his <hi>Tribe,</hi> which so inrag'd the People, that the
next time they procur'd <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> to be brought
in again, after there had been Consuls four Years:
And in this Election, notwithstanding the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People, they cou'd not
get in one of the Commons, which was a great
Mortification to the Multitude.</p>

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102323:82"/>
At two years end, the Senate took occasion from
the Wars of the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Volsci</hi> to bring in Consuls
again; and partly for the Enemies great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and partly for the violent Humour of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
of the People, a <hi>Dictator</hi> was likewise created,
tho' against the <hi>Consuls</hi> Consent.<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>ix.</hi> U. C. 322.</note> This was <hi>Posthumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Tubero,</hi> who had <hi>Iulius Vopiscus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the
Horse,</hi> who having finish'd this War successfully, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
and laid down his Office. For four Years
after this, they had <hi>Consuls,</hi> in which space little was
acted abroad or at home; then the Commons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
to have <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> again created,<note place="margin">Mil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd. U. C.</hi> 326.</note> which
was now the fifth time, and they had four in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but still they cou'd not bring about their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
In this Year <hi>Fidenae</hi> revolted again, and joyn'd
with the <hi>Veientes;</hi> whereupon three of the <hi>Consular
Tribunes</hi> were sent against the Enemy, and the fourth
left to govern the City. When they proceeded to an
Engagement, one of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> cry'd <hi>Charge,</hi> another
cry'd <hi>Halt,</hi> all three being of a several Mind, till there
was such Confusion, that the <hi>Romans</hi> betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their Heels and fled; which sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
'em of the Folly of having several Generals in
one Army. The City upon this was put into such a
Consternation, that immediately a <hi>Dictator</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which was <hi>Aemilius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>x.</hi> U. C. 327.</note> a third time, who chose
<hi>Cossus,</hi> who had obtain'd the last <hi>Opima Spolia,</hi> for his
<hi>Master of the Horse.</hi> By the Prudence and Valour of
these two, the <hi>Veientes</hi> were overthrown, and <hi>Fidenae</hi>
once more taken and plunder'd: Then <hi>Aemilius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, laid down his Office,
after he had held it but 17 Days.</p>
                  <p>For two Years after this, <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd;
at the end of which, the Senate took Occasion
from the War with the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and the Absence of
those Magistrates, to bring in <hi>Consuls</hi> again, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People oppos'd it as much
as possible. But <hi>Sempronius,</hi> one of the Consuls,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102323:82"/>
managing this War very carelesly, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> from
thence took advantage, and <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> were
created again the next Year. This was for one
Year, at the end of which, the Senate procur'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls</hi>
to be made again; and <hi>Capitolinus,</hi> one of 'em,
gain'd advantage enough over the <hi>Aequi,</hi> to procure
him an <hi>Ovation.</hi> When this Year was expir'd, there
hapned so great a Contention about two <hi>Quaestors</hi> or
Treasurers, whom the Commons wou'd have created
out of their Body, that the State fell into an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum.
Papirius</hi> being <hi>Interrex,</hi> for a Composure,
procur'd <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> to be again admitted, and
four <hi>Quaestors</hi> (which was two more than formerly)
to be created either out of the <hi>Patritians</hi> or <hi>Plebeians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaestors <hi>encreas'd.</hi> U. C. 333.</note>
as the People shou'd think most proper in their <hi>Comitia.</hi>
Notwithstanding this, tho' many of the Commons
striv'd for it, not one of 'em cou'd get to be either
<hi>Military Tribune,</hi> or so much as <hi>Quaestor,</hi> which much
incens'd the People. In the second Year after this,
<hi>Military Tribunes</hi> still continuing, the Slaves conspir'd
to Fire the City, and seize on the <hi>Capitol;</hi> but the
Plot was timely found out, and the Discoverers great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rewarded. The following Year, the <hi>Aequi</hi> joyn'd
with the People of <hi>Lavicum,</hi> press'd hard upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Territories, and the <hi>Consular Tribunes</hi> quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
among themselves for the Superiority, they got
great Advantages;<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xi.</hi> U. C. 335.</note> insomuch, that a <hi>Dictator</hi> was
created, which was <hi>Servilius Priscus,</hi> a second time,
who chose his Son <hi>Axilla</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse.
Servilius</hi> soon dispatch'd his Business, and laid
down his Office, after he had kept it but eight
Days.</p>
                  <p>After this, for four Years successively, were <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Tribunes</hi> instead of <hi>Consuls,</hi> till new Contentions ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
between the <hi>Patritians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> tho' partly
from old Heart-burnings, and especially upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, the State fell again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an <hi>Interregnum. Fabius</hi> being <hi>Interrex,</hi> brought in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102323:83"/>
                     <hi>Consuls</hi> again, which Government continu'd for five
Years longer, in which space of time not very much
was transacted either abroad or at home. In the
fifth Year, the Commons being cross'd in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of bringing in <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> bestirr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so much, as to procure three of the <hi>Quaestors</hi> to
be created out of their own Rank, who were the
first <hi>Plebeian Quaestors</hi> that ever were in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quaest. Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian. U. C. 344.</note> The
<hi>Aequi</hi> and the <hi>Volsci,</hi> strengthn'd by Confederacies,
made great Ravages in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions; and
the Commons refusing to List themselves according
to their usual Custom, procur'd <hi>Military Tribunes</hi>
again, who march'd against the Enemy, but with so
little Success,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xii.</hi> U. C. 345.</note> that a <hi>Dictator</hi> was thought necessary
to be created. This was <hi>Cornelius Cossus,</hi> formerly
mention'd, who appointed <hi>Servilius Ahala</hi> for his
<hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and march'd against the Enemy,
overthrew 'em in one Battel, wasted their Country,
and then return'd. Two Years after, the <hi>Patritians</hi>
and <hi>Plebeians</hi> were in some measure reconcil'd by
means of the great Plunder of <hi>Anxur</hi> or <hi>Terracina,</hi>
taken from the <hi>Volsci;</hi> but especially by a Decree of
the Senate for the Publick Pay of the Army with
Brass Money, before which time every Soldier bore
his own Charges in the War, as was hinted formerly;
and this was the first time of the paying of Soldiers in
<hi>Rome,</hi> which hapned in the <hi>347th</hi> Year of the City.
The taking of <hi>Anxur,</hi> and some other Places from
the <hi>Volsci,</hi> in a short time brought 'em to a Peace;

against the <hi>Veientes</hi> with that Resolution, and carry'd
on with that Vigour, that it was evident that one of
the two Cities must fall. <hi>Veii</hi> was an exceeding large
strong and wealthy City, and had not only been a
Rival to <hi>Rome</hi> for many Years, but had always been
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102323:83"/>
so perfidious, that a full Revenge was necessary.
The <hi>Romans</hi> invested the City, but it being seated
upon a craggy Rock, they soon found it wou'd cost
'em several Years Siege; so that they were constrain'd
to carry it on both Winter and Summer, the Soldiers
lying under Beast-skins. At this the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the
People began to repine, as a thing wholly new and
dangerous; complaining likewise of the Payment of
Soldiers as an Innovation, and an unjust Artifice to
ruine the Commons. And the next Year, they got
the Number of the <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> to be increased
from four to six,<note place="margin">Mil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd. U. C.</hi> 348.</note> as it was at first design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, but still
cou'd not procure one <hi>Plebeian</hi> to be elected; and this
Number continu'd always for the future. New Stirs
daily arose, notwithstanding the great Diversion by
War; sometimes upon the account of the little Succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
against <hi>Veii,</hi> the <hi>Tribunes</hi> blaming the Commanders,
and prohibiting the Taxes which had been laid upon
the City ever since the Soldiers had receiv'd Pay.
About six Years after, they renew'd their ancient
Contest about the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law, and carry'd it on
so far as to get it promulg'd among themselves, tho'
not in the Senate: And in the same Year, after
much Trouble and Pains,<note place="margin">Mil. Trib. Pleb. U. C. 353.</note> they procur'd one <hi>Plebeian</hi>
to be elected into the <hi>Consular Tribunes, Licinius Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
being the Person. They extreamly applauded
themselves for this, it being the first time that the
Commons cou'd make themselves sharers in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Offices; and now they most readily permitted
the Pay of the Army to be gather'd, all Stirs being
for a while laid aside.</p>
                  <p>The Siege of <hi>Veii</hi> was still carry'd on from Year
to Year, but with various Success, and under divers
Commanders; sometimes all the Besieger's Works
were destroy'd, and the Men driven back with great
Loss by Sallies from the Town: Then the <hi>Falisci,</hi> one
of the twelve Nations of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> join'd with the

to the great hazard of their whole Army. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces were much diverted by the
<hi>Volsci,</hi> who suddenly took <hi>Anxur;</hi> and tho' in no
long time it was retaken, yet still it was great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the Siege of <hi>Veii.</hi> In the third Year of
this Siege, <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi> a Person extraordinary
for Courage and Valour, as well as other Excellencies,
was made one of the <hi>Censors.</hi> He finding the Wars
lay heavy, caus'd the Batchelors to marry the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of such as had lost their Lives for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and likewise was the first, who oblig'd <hi>Orphans</hi>
to pay Taxes. Two Years after, he was made one
of the <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> but little fell to his Share
then. Three Years after that, which was the
eighth Year of the Siege, he was a second time
made <hi>Military Tribune,</hi> in which time he march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Falisci</hi> and <hi>Capenates,</hi> both Confederates
of the <hi>Veientes,</hi> and great Disturbers of the <hi>Romans</hi>
in the Siege, and forc'd them all into their Towns of
Defence.</p>
                  <p>The tediousness of the Siege, made the <hi>Romans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to carry it on with the utmost Vigour; and
for that reason they created <hi>Camillus Dictator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Camillus</hi> drew out all the Forces he cou'd raise, and
made a solemn Vow, that if he took <hi>Veii,</hi> he wou'd
dedicate the tenth Part of the Plunder to <hi>Apollo;</hi>
Then marching into the Country of the <hi>Falisci,</hi> he
overthrew 'em in a great Battel, together with the
<hi>Capenates</hi> their Confederates; and after that, he
turn'd all his Forces against <hi>Veii,</hi> all People greatly
expecting the Avent of this important Siege. <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
finding it very hazardous to attempt the storming
a Place of that Strength both by Art and Nature,
secretly wrought a Mine into it with vast La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and finding the City incapable of Relief, sent
to the Senate, who order'd all who had a desire to
share in the rich Spoils, immediately to repair to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102323:85"/>
Army, which caus'd great Multitudes of all Ranks
to go thither. <hi>Camillus</hi> at an appointed time order'd
a Party of Men to enter the Mine, who with ease
became Masters of the City, to the great Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Besieged. Thus was the rich and strong
City of <hi>Veii</hi> taken, like a second <hi>Troy,</hi> after Ten
Years Siege, which enrich'd the <hi>Romans</hi> with vast
Plunder. As for <hi>Camillus</hi> himself, he transported
with the Honour of subduing the great Rival of
<hi>Rome,</hi> triumph'd after a more magnificent Manner
than ordinary, having his Chariot drawn by four
Milk-white Steeds; a thing which the <hi>Romans</hi> look'd
upon as Sacred and peculiar to the King and Father of
the Gods, and therefore they were much offended at
his Carriage: And indeed no Man either before or
since him ever assum'd so much Honour to himself.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the taking of <hi>Veii,</hi> the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the
People, who were ever restless, propos'd a Law to
divide the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> into two Parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one should stay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other remove
to <hi>Veii,</hi> and there settle; this Separation, as they
imagin'd, being a ready means for the enriching of
both by the Possession of two such considerable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The <hi>Plebeians,</hi> now Rich as well as Numerous,
press'd hard for this Division; but the <hi>Patritians</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it wou'd prove the Ruine of the State, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
oppos'd it, betaking themselves to <hi>Camillus,</hi>
who by prudently employing, and variously divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Multitude, with much difficulty put it off,
but with the Hatred of many of the Commons.
But not long after, there hapned a greater and
more apparent Cause of their Hatred to him, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by his neglecting, either through Business or
Forgetfulness, while he continu'd <hi>Dictator,</hi> to offer
those Tenths of the Spoils of <hi>Veii,</hi> which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Expedition he had vow'd to <hi>Apollo.</hi>
When therefore he had laid down his Office, he mov'd
the People to restore the Tenths of what they had
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102323:86"/>
receiv'd; and the Priests also reported that all the
Sacrifices portended the Anger of the Gods, which
must be appeas'd by Gifts. So that the Soldiers, who
had already spent what they had gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

necessary Occasions, were forc'd upon Oath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the tenth Part to <hi>Apollo,</hi> which was look'd upon
as a very hard Injunction, and caus'd great Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
among the People. Now, because there was
little Gold in the City, the Ladies freely contributed
their Dresses and Ornaments, which amounted to
eight Talents in Gold. And the Senate in requital

                  <p>The Commons still grew more turbulent and

offer'd him to betray the Town, by delivering up

Baseness, but out of an extraordinary Greatness of
Mind, he immediately order'd the School-Master to

with the great Generosity of the <hi>Roman,</hi> that they
immediately yielded; and the Senate leaving the
Conditions to <hi>Camillus,</hi> he only fin'd them a Summ
of Money, and receiv'd 'em with all the <hi>Falisci</hi> into
Friendship. But the Soldiers, who expected great
Plunder, were extreamly disgusted, and from that
Instant sought his Ruine. This same Year, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102323:86"/>
with much difficulty procur'd Consuls to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
instead of <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> after an Intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of 15 Years. And the Year following, <hi>Consuls</hi>
also were chosen again; but in the third Year, <hi>Military
Tribunes,</hi> in which time the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People
mov'd again for a Separation, but were so sharply
oppos'd by <hi>Camillus,</hi> that in Revenge they accus'd
him of fraudulent Practices in the Plunder of the late
Wars. <hi>Camillus</hi> finding the Multitude exasperated
against him for several Reasons, and that they were
now ready to condemn him, left the City; but first
lifting up his Hands towards the <hi>Capitol,</hi> he pray'd,
<hi>That if his Banishment were unjust, and meerly the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Rage and Malice of the Multitude, they
might suddenly repent it; and that it might visibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the World, how much the</hi> Romans <hi>were oblig'd
by his Actions, and stood in need of his Presence.</hi> Thus,
like <hi>Achilles,</hi> leaving his Imprecations on the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
he went into Banishment, being fin'd 15000
<hi>Asses.</hi>

                  <p>IV. About this same time,<note place="margin">U. C. 363.</note> many thousands of the
<hi>Gauls</hi> finding their own Country too narrow for
them, and desirous of removing, under the Conduct
of <hi>Brennus</hi> their King, broke into <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
<hi>Clusium,</hi> a City in Alliance with <hi>Rome.</hi> These

People inhabiting most of that Part of <hi>Italy,</hi>
which now goes by the Name of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and
which the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> had been Masters of before
them; a People vast in Body, rude by Nature, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

much affrighted at their great Numbers, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

to a Conference with 'em, the Ambassadors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Reason of this their present Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and what Injury the <hi>Clusians</hi> had done them:
<hi>Brennus</hi> made answer somewhat sharply, <hi>That they
had much injur'd 'em by refusing to part with some of
their Lands, when they had more than they themselves
cou'd easily manage; and this was nothing more than
what the</hi> Romans <hi>themselves had done to the</hi> Albans,
<hi>the</hi> Fidenates, <hi>the</hi> Ardeates, <hi>the</hi> Veientes, <hi>and many

meanly or unjustly, sent first to <hi>Rome,</hi> demanding
the Ambassadors to be deliver'd up, as having broken
the Law of Nations. But Favour so far prevail'd
above Equity, that the Matter being referr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d from
the Senate to the People, no Satisfaction cou'd be
had from either: Nay, further, the Ambassadors
themselves, were with three others created <hi>Military
Tribunes</hi> for carrying on the War. The <hi>Gauls</hi> hearing
this, in a great Rage hastned their March, breathing
out nothing Revenge and Destruction to <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Places through which they march'd, were so
terrify'd with their Numbers, the Fierceness of their
Natures, and their dreadful Preparations of War,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102323:87"/>
that they gave their Countries for lost. But contrary
to their Expectations, they did no Injury as they
march'd, crying, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>only were their
Enemies, and that they took all others for their Friends.</hi>
The <hi>Romans</hi> met 'em at the River <hi>Allia,</hi> 11 Miles
from the City, with an Army of 40000 Foot, but
most of 'em raw and unskilful Men,<note place="margin">U. C. 364.</note> and what was
more dangerous, under the Conduct of several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.
In this Condition they engag'd the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
without either Order or Discipline, or scarce any
Courage, and were miserably defeated. The Left
Wing was immediately driven into the River, and
there intirely cut off: The Right escap'd better, tho'
with great Loss, some dropping into <hi>Rome;</hi> the rest,
as many as escap'd, stole by Night to <hi>Veii,</hi> giving
<hi>Rome</hi> for lost, and all that was in it for ruin'd. This
Day was ever after branded for an unlucky Day by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein no Work of Note was to be
done, and was call'd <hi>Alliensis</hi> in their <hi>Kalendar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was <hi>Rome</hi> in the like Consternation, as at
the News of the loss of this Battel, and the sudden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Enemy: Nothing but miserable Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Lamentations were heard on all Parts, some
leaving the City, others creeping into Holes, Priests
hiding their Relicks, Women running like distracted
Persons with their Children in their Arms, and every
one shifting for himself; so that <hi>Rome</hi> became aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
and was left open to the Rage and Fury of
the Enemy. For they who resolv'd to stay at <hi>Rome,</hi>
quitting the rest of the City, betook themselves to
the <hi>Capitol,</hi> which they fortify'd, in order to hold out
a Siege. Only some of the <hi>Pontifices</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> and
the most ancient of the <hi>Senators,</hi> such as had been
honour'd with several Consulships and Triumphs,
who cou'd not endure to think of leaving the City,
put on all their Robes of State, plac'd themselves in
the <hi>Forum</hi> on their Ivory Chairs, resolving since they
had liv'd in Honour, to die in State, and in that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Posture expected the utmost of what wou'd
follow.</p>
                  <p>On the third Day after the Victory, the Easiness
of which much amaz'd the <hi>Gauls, Brennus</hi> appear'd
with all his Forces before the City, and finding the
Gates wide open, the Walls unguarded, and all things
defenceless, began to suspect at first some Stratagem
of the <hi>Romans;</hi> but after a little Consideration, he
enter'd the City, and marching into the <hi>Forum,</hi> he
was more surpriz'd than ever, to find so many
Men sitting all in that remarkable Order, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Silence, like so many Statues. Their splendid
Habits and Ornaments, their steddy Unconcern'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
their Majestick Gravity, their venerable Looks,
together with that Air of Greatness which appear'd in
'em, made the <hi>Gauls</hi> imagine 'em to be an Assembly
of the Gods, or at least somewhat more than Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
till one Bolder than the rest stroaking <hi>Papiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s
Beard, was struck by him with his Ivory Staff,
whereupon he immediately kill'd the old Man. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which began the Slaughter, the rest of the <hi>Gauls</hi>
following his Example, set upon the rest, and kill'd
'em all without Mercy or Distinction; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Rage and Fury, dispatch'd all that came in
their Way. In this Manner they proceeded, Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Plundering the Houses for many days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
then setting the whole City in Flames, burnt
down every House to the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the famous City of <hi>Rome</hi> laid all in
Ashes, except the <hi>Capitol;</hi> occasion'd by the <hi>Romans</hi>
manifest Breach of Justice, and the Laws of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

of Fire and Sword,<note place="margin">U. C. 364.</note> and was the true
Scene of all kind of Misery and Desolation; the
Town deserted by its Inhabitants, and all its stately
Buildings a heap of Rubbish; no hopes being left
but in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> which was now closely besieg'd
by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and in the Banish'd <hi>Camillus,</hi> whose
Presence was now heartily wish'd for. While
the <hi>Gauls</hi> lay before the <hi>Capitol,</hi> they sent out many
Parties to Forage in all the Country about, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vag'd
and destroy'd all the Towns and Villages they
arriv'd at; and that with the greatest Carelesness
and Security imaginable, conceiving no sort of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

and best order'd Body of their Forces approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ardea, Camillus,</hi> who had liv'd there a retir'd
Life, began to rouse himself from the sullen Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Wrongs, to the moving Considerations
of the Miseries of his Country; and by a brave and
incouraging Speech perswaded all the <hi>Ardeans,</hi> that
were able to bear Arms, to fall upon the Enemy in
the Night time; which was done so effectually, that
scarce any were left to carry the News of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat.
The Fame of this Victory began to revive the
fainting Spirits of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who now found that
these dreadful People were not invulnerable; and the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102323:90"/>
                     <hi>Romans</hi> who lay at <hi>Veii,</hi> now finding <hi>Camillus</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
immediately sent to him to be their General;
begging of him <hi>to forget all former Injuries, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
his distressed Country.</hi> He objected his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
Condition, and refus'd to Act, unless by
Commission from those in the <hi>Capitol;</hi> whom he
consider'd as the true Body of the surviving <hi>Roman</hi>
State. This modest Answer was extreamly well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but they cou'd not imagine by what means to
send to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> while the Enemy was in full
Possession of the City.</p>
                  <p>But for the Undertaking this desperate Attempt,
one <hi>Pontius Cominius</hi> offer'd his Service, which being
kindly accepted of, he thus perform'd: Putting on
a poor Garment, carrying Corks underneath, he
went for <hi>Rome,</hi> and arriv'd at the City when it
was dark: The Bridge he cou'd not pass by reason
of the Guards, but taking his Cloaths and binding
'em about his Head, he swam down the <hi>Tiber</hi> upon
his Corks; and avoiding those Quarters, where he
perceiv'd the Enemy to be awake, which he guess'd at
by the Lights and Noise, he got into the City, and
from thence to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> climbing up in the steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Place with extream Danger and Difficulty. The
Besieged were much surpriz'd at the Greatness of the
Attempt, and presently giving him his Instructions,
sent him back the same Way he came; and this part
of his Expedition he perform'd with the same good
Success that he had done the other, and upon his
Return delivered to <hi>Camillus</hi> an Order of the Senate
to make him <hi>Dictator.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>XIV.</hi> U. C. 364.</note> 
                     <hi>Camillus</hi> chose <hi>Valerius Potitus</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and getting together an
Army of above 40000 Men, he prepar'd to march
against the Enemy. In the mean while, at <hi>Rome</hi>
some of the <hi>Gauls</hi> hapned to discover some Foot-steps
and Prints made by <hi>Pontius</hi> at his climbing the Hill,
which being privately told to <hi>Brennus</hi> their King, he
order'd a select Party of Men in the dead of Night
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102323:90"/>
to climb up the same Way, and take the <hi>Capitol</hi> by
Surprize. These Men perform'd their Office with

Dogs appointed for the Watch perceiving it; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
it so hapned that some Sacred Geese which
were kept by the Temple of <hi>Iun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and clapping their Wings, discover'd them. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
every one snatching what Weapon he cou'd, did
their utmost on this sudden Occasion; and <hi>Manlius,</hi> a
<hi>Patritian</hi> of great Courage, was the first that made
Head against 'em, boldly mounting the Rampier,
and presently tumbling down two of the Enemy at
once. Others soon came in to his Assistance, and
drove down all the rest, not a Man escaping; and
the next Morning the Captain of the Watch was
thrown Headlong down the Rock, and <hi>Manlius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
as well as Circumstances wou'd permit.</p>
                  <p>Henceforwards the Affairs of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were in a
worse Condition, first wanting Provisions, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Plague, which rag'd much among 'em;
but still the Besieged cou'd have no Relief, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to a languishing and desponding Condition for
want of Provisions and Necessaries. So that after a
seven Months Siege, they were forc'd to Capitulate,
and it was agreed, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>paying down 1000
Pound weight of Gold, the</hi> Gauls <hi>should immediately quit
the City and Territories.</hi> This Agreement being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Oath, and the Gold brought forth, the <hi>Cauls</hi>
out of Covetousness us'd false Dealings in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
pulling back the Balance as they thought fit; at
which the <hi>Romans</hi> complaining, <hi>Brennus</hi> cast in his
Sword and Belt into the Scales, scoffingly crying, <hi>Vae
Victis, Woe to the Vanquish'd,</hi> which afterwards became
a Proverb. Whilst this Difference lasted, <hi>Camillus</hi> was
arriv'd with his Army, and hastning with a choice
Party of Men to the Place where the Gold was a
weighing, he came boldly and took it out of the
Scales, telling the <hi>Gauls, that it was the Custom of the</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102323:91"/>
Romans <hi>to deliver their Country with Iron, not with Gold:</hi>
Therefore he null'd the Compact, <hi>because made without
his Consent, who alone, as being then their</hi> Dictator, <hi>had
the sole Power of making Peace.</hi> Upon this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Fight immediately ensu'd, where, after a most
bloody Contest, the <hi>Gauls</hi> were intirely routed, and
such great Execution done upon 'em in the pursuit,
that all the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories were in a short time
clear'd of 'em. Thus was <hi>Rome</hi> unexpectedly taken,
and in seven Months, as unexpectedly recover'd;
<hi>Camillus</hi> for his excellent Services having a noble
Triumph, being now deservedly look'd upon as
their second <hi>Romulus.</hi>

People began to urge once more for the removing to
<hi>Veii,</hi> which caus'd the Senate to procure <hi>Camillus</hi> to
hold his Office of <hi>Dictator</hi> for a whole Year, which was
six Months longer than the usual time. <hi>Camillus</hi> with
kind Words and gentle Language appeas'd the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
shewing 'em, <hi>How unworthy and dishonourable a
Thing it wou'd be for 'em to forsake the venerable Seat of
their Ancestors, and all their Sacred Rites, which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to this Place, to inhabit a conquer'd and inslav'd
City.</hi> Upon this therefore <hi>Rome</hi> was order'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
with all Diligence, and all Persons were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about it; but it was carry'd on with that Haste
and Hurry, that the City wanted much of its former
Beauty and Regularity; and the Water-courses for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
laid in the Streets, now ran for the most part
under private Houses.<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xV.</hi> U. <hi>C.</hi> 366.</note> When <hi>Camillus</hi>'s second six
Months were out, <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> were chosen; and
in the same Year the <hi>Aequi, Volsci</hi> and <hi>Hetrurians</hi> all
took up Arms and invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories.
The <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> were soon block'd up by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and were brought to such Straits, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
made <hi>Camillus Dictator</hi> a third time, and he chose

<hi>Tribes</hi> were added; namely, the <hi>Stellatine,</hi> the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentine,</hi>
the <hi>Sabbatine,</hi> and the <hi>Arnian;</hi> which now
made the whole Number twenty five.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Manlius,</hi> who for his great Services
in saving the <hi>Capitol</hi> had now got the Sirname of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus,</hi>
began to grow very haughty and ambitious;
and by his ingratiating himself with the common
Sort, his paying their Debts, and his railing at the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
it was apparent that Sovereignty was his Aim.
The Numbers that he got over to his Party, together
with the War renew'd with the <hi>Volsci,</hi> made the
Senate procure a <hi>Dictator</hi> to be created;<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xvi.</hi> U. <hi>C.</hi> 369.</note> who was <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
Cossus,</hi> who made choice of <hi>Quintius Capitolinus</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse. Cossus</hi> soon overthrew the
Enemies, and returning home in Triumph, call'd
<hi>Manlius</hi> to an Account, and put him in Prison. But the
Multitude, extreamly afflicted at this, put on Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Garments, and made such dangerous Disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that after some time he was set at Liberty, and
soon after <hi>Cossus</hi> laid down his Office. But <hi>Manlius</hi> still
growing more insolent, holding private Cabals, and
filling the whole City with Faction and Sedition, the
Senate remitted his Business to the Care of the <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

was right over-against the <hi>Capitol,</hi> where when he
was accus'd, he often pointed to it, and with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eyes and moving Voice let the People know, <hi>what
a Noble piece of Service he had done there.</hi> This mov'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102323:92"/>
the Multitude to such Pity and Compassion, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi>
caus'd the Judges to remove him without the
Gate to the <hi>Peteline</hi> Grove; where having no View
of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> he was condemn'd to be thrown down
the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, the Place both of his highest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and greatest Infamy: Ant it was decreed that
none of the <hi>Manlii</hi> afterwards shou'd be call'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
Thus jealous was <hi>Rome</hi> of her Liberty, that no

                  <p>About three Years after,<note place="margin">U. <hi>C.</hi> 372.</note> 
                     <hi>Camillus</hi> was chosen <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

and march'd against the <hi>Volsci;</hi> where <hi>Lucius</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue,
eager to engage the Enemy when <hi>Camillus</hi> judg'd
it dangerous, was permitted to Fight alone, <hi>Camillus</hi>
being left weak in his Bed. <hi>Lucius</hi> was soon worsted,
and his Army almost routed, when <hi>Camillus</hi> rousing
himself, was presently help'd up on Horseback; where
making his Way through them that fled, he drove fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to oppose the Pursuers; which Boldness so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the Soldiers, that they all rally'd again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
never to forsake a General so famous for his
Actions, and so venerable for Age: By this the Enemy
were soon stopp'd, and the next day intirely routed,
losing Bag and Baggage, and the greatest part of their
Men. The Year following, great Stirs were rais'd in
the City about the Creditors and Debtors, which gave
an Opportunity to the Inhabitants of <hi>Praeneste,</hi> a
Town of <hi>Latium,</hi> with its Dependents, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
and Devastations to the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
the great danger and damage of the City. This and
the Troubles at home, caus'd the Senate to create a
<hi>Dictator,</hi>

he was so Successful against them, that he overthrew
'em, took the eight Towns that were their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

Two Years after this,<note place="margin">U. <hi>C.</hi> 275.</note> a dangerous Contest hapned
between the <hi>Patritians</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by <hi>Fabius Ambustus</hi> a <hi>Tribune,</hi> who had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd

<hi>That he would so manage Affairs, that her House shou'd

time therefore he consulted with <hi>Licinius Stolo</hi> her
Husband, and <hi>L. Sestius,</hi> about preferring a Law for
making one <hi>Consul</hi> out of the Commons. These two
being made <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People, labour'd so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about this Law, and the Contests were carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no Supream Magistrates were chosen at all, nor any
other but <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Aediles,</hi> who kept their Places
all that time. And in all this unhappy Space there was
little better than <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confusion in <hi>Rome,</hi> till
the Year 282, they procur'd Military <hi>Tribunes</hi> to be
chosen; but still the Contests were kept up on both
sides;<note place="margin">Dic. xviii U. <hi>C.</hi> 284.</note> when two Years after, <hi>Camillus</hi> was made <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
a fourth time, but much against the Consent of
the People. He chose <hi>Aemilius Mamercinus</hi> for his
<hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and with much Difficulty brought
both Parties to a better and more moderate Temper;
but finding the Multitude so very stubborn and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in their Designs, withal threatning to Fine him
if he compli'd not, he soon laid down his Office.
Upon this another <hi>Dictator</hi> was immediately created,
which was one <hi>Manlius Capitolinus,</hi> who chose <hi>Licini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Stolo</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xix.</hi> U. <hi>C.</hi> 285.</note> and he was the
first <hi>Plebeian</hi> that ever obtain'd this Honour. <hi>Stolo,</hi> who
had been the great Occasion of these Disturbances,
now took an Occasion to prefer a Law that no Man
shou'd possess above 500 Acres of Land, which was
very disadvantageous to the <hi>Patritians,</hi> and more to
himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for soon after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was found to have above
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102323:93"/>
that Proportion, and so was punish'd by Vertue of
his own Constitution.</p>
                  <p>III. In the midst of these violent Contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Consul</hi>-ship, News was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> that
many thousands of the <hi>Gauls</hi> were marching from the
<hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea towards <hi>Rome.</hi> This put the City into
a great Fright, and all began to lay aside their private
Differences, and to think of nothing but of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Safety; for they had fear'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> so much,
that a Law was made, <hi>That Priests shou'd be excus'd from
all Wars, unless in an Invasion from the</hi> Gauls:<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xx.</hi> U. C. 387.</note> All Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
agreed to make <hi>Camillus Dictator</hi> a fifth time,
now near 80 Years old, who refus'd not the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this dangerous Juncture, but presently chose
<hi>Quinctius Cincinnatus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse. Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
consider'd that the Force of the <hi>Gauls</hi> lay chiefly
in their Swords, with which they laid about 'em in a
rude and unskilful Manner: Therefore he furnish'd
his Men with light Iron Helmets, and bound their
wooden Targets about with Brass, teaching them
how to fence and receive the Enemies Blows without
Hurt. By this means he render'd the Swords of the
<hi>Gauls</hi> so unserviceable, that giving 'em Battel at the
<hi>River Anio,</hi> he easily overthrew 'em, which hapned
23 Years after they had destroy'd the City; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Defeat the <hi>Romans</hi> began now to despise the
<hi>Gauls</hi> as much as they had fear'd 'em before. Soon
after this <hi>Camillus</hi> in his Return homewards had <hi>Veli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae</hi>
surrender'd to him without any Resistance.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Camillus</hi>'s greatest Contention, and which was
hardest to be manag'd, was with the People, who now
returning home full of Victory and Success, violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insisted again to have one of the <hi>Consuls</hi> chosen out
of their own Body. The Senate strongly oppos'd it,
and wou'd not suffer <hi>Camillus</hi> to lay down his <hi>Dictator</hi>-ship,
thinking that under the Shelter of his great Name
and greater Authority, they shou'd be the better able
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102323:93"/>
to contend for the Power of the Nobility. But when
<hi>Camillus</hi> was sitting upon the Tribunal, dispatching
publick Affairs, an Officer sent by the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the
People commanded him to rise and follow him, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Hand upon him as ready to seize him: Upon
which such a Noise and Tumult follow'd in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
as was never before known in <hi>Rome:</hi> Some

down his Office, but taking the Senators along with
him, he went to the Senate-House; where great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
arose, by reason of contrary Opinions; but at last
the most Popular Party prevail'd, and a Law was made,
<hi>That one of the Consuls for the future might be chosen out
of the</hi> Plebeians;<note place="margin">U. C. 388. Consul Pleb. Military Tribunes <hi>put down.</hi>
                     </note> and this hapned 143 Years after

the <hi>Patritians</hi> desiring a <hi>Praetor</hi> to be created out of

                  <p>This <hi>Praetor</hi> was a Magistrate of extraordinary Note,<note place="margin">Praetor.</note>

in Civil Causes they were cloth'd in Purple;
but when they pass'd Sentence in Criminal Causes,
they were in Mourning. Upon the account of their
Power and Honour, and likewise because they were
created by the same <hi>Auspicia</hi> with the <hi>Consuls, Livy</hi>
calls them <hi>Collegues of the Consuls.</hi> Their Ornaments
and <hi>Ensigns</hi> were six <hi>Lictors</hi> with their <hi>Fasces,</hi> the <hi>Toga
Praetexta,</hi> and <hi>Cella Curulis;</hi> and besides those Marks
of <hi>Consular</hi> Dignity, the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Spear,</hi> plac'd by
them in the Court. Their Officers in Court, besides
the <hi>Lictors,</hi> were the <hi>Scribes</hi> or <hi>Notaries,</hi> to enter
things in Writing, and the <hi>Accensi</hi> or <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> who Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
the People together. At first there was but
one <hi>Praetor,</hi> and that for above 100 Years; then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Created, who administred Justice to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
whereupon for Distinction sake the first was

or <hi>Minor.</hi> But as the Business and Dominions of

Magistrates, their Chair being so call'd either

with <hi>Crooked</hi> Feet. They had all the same Offices and
Business as the <hi>Aediles</hi> of the Commons, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater Authority; but more especially they took
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102323:95"/>
Care of the great and publick Games, such as the <hi>Ludi
Florales, Circenses, Megalenses, Romani,</hi> &amp;c. as also of
<hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Comedies.</hi> Sometimes at their own Charge
they made these Shews, and ever examin'd the Plays
written before they were Acted; and (whether from
this Inspection of all Plays and the like, it is uncertain)
they seem to have been the <hi>Licensers</hi> and Judges of
other Writings. It is further observ'd, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of Armies when return'd home from Victory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
up the Corn and Provisions which were Prize,
to these <hi>Aediles Curules,</hi> as they did the Prisoners to
the <hi>Praetor,</hi> and the Money to the <hi>Quaestor.</hi> Thus
were the Disturbances of <hi>Rome</hi> allay'd, and all things
for a short space continu'd in Peace and Quiet.</p>
                  <p>IV. Soon after these Affairs were setled, News came
of the <hi>Gauls</hi> meeting together,<note place="margin">U. C. 389.</note> who had before been
dispers'd through <hi>Apulia,</hi> and of the intended Revolt
of the <hi>Hernici:</hi> But all Preparations were deferred by
the Senate, because they were unwilling to have any
thing done by a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Consul. On the other side
the <hi>Tribunes</hi> began to complain, that for one <hi>Plebeian</hi>
Consul, the Nobility had got three <hi>Patritian</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
who sate as Consuls in their <hi>Curule</hi> Chairs,
and their <hi>Praetexta.</hi> Modesty therefore suffer'd not
the Fathers to Create both the <hi>Curule Aediles</hi> out of
their own Body; so that it was agreed first that every
other Year they shou'd be chosen out of the Commons;
but afterwards they were Elected promiscuously. The
Year following there hapned a grievous Plague in the
City, which swept away vast Numbers, among the

Services for the City, that he was deservedly called

                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxiii</hi> U. C. 393.</note> and this was <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Pennus,</hi> who had <hi>Cornelius Maluginensis</hi> for his
<hi>Master of the Horse.</hi> The Armies being drawn up on
both sides, a <hi>Gaul</hi> of vast Bulk and Stature challeng'd
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102323:96"/>
any of the <hi>Romans</hi> to meet him in a single Combat;
which Challenge was accepted of by <hi>T. Manlius</hi> a
Courageous young Man, who with great Bravery and
Agility overthrew his mighty Foe, and slew him:
Then taking a <hi>Torques</hi> or Golden Chain from his
Neck, return'd, and was Honourably receiv'd by the
<hi>Dictator;</hi> and from thence he and his Posterity had the
Sirname of <hi>Torquatus.</hi> The <hi>Gauls</hi> were so discourag'd
at this Action, that they fled by Night, and retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Tiburtines</hi> Country, a People of <hi>Latium;</hi> and
the <hi>Dictator</hi> return'd in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The War with the <hi>Tiburtines</hi> and <hi>Hernici</hi> gave the
<hi>Gauls</hi> Opportunity to do much Injury to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Territories, which occasion'd the Creation of another
<hi>Dictator,</hi> which was <hi>Servilius Ahala,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxiv.</hi> U. C. 394.</note> who chose <hi>Quintius
Capitolinus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and soon quell'd
the <hi>Gauls;</hi> but <hi>Paetileus</hi> the Consul, who had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
against the <hi>Hernici,</hi> hapned to come off with the
greatest Honour. In a Year after Peace was made with
the <hi>Latines,</hi> which was advantageous enough to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> by reason of their frequent Auxiliaries from
them: But the Year following, the great Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> caus'd the Senate to create another
<hi>Dictator,</hi> which was <hi>Sulpitius Peticus,</hi> who appointed
<hi>Valerius Poplicola</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxv.</hi> U. C. 396. Tribes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd a fourth time.</hi>
                     </note> and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the Enemy obtain'd a Signal Victory over
'em. In this Year were two new <hi>Tribes</hi> added to the
former five and twenty, Namely, the <hi>Pomptine</hi> and the
<hi>Publican.</hi> About two Years after this, the whole Body
of the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> took up Arms against <hi>Rome,</hi> led on by
the <hi>Tarquinii</hi> and <hi>Falisci;</hi> in which great time of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>Marcius, Rutilus</hi> a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> was made <hi>Dictator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. Pleb. <hi>xxvi.</hi> U. C. 398.</note> which
was the first Commoner that ever obtain'd this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
it being now 143 Years since their first Creation.
He appointed <hi>Plantius Proculus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the
Horse,</hi> a <hi>Plebeian</hi> likewise; and tho' he was oppos'd by
the <hi>Patritians,</hi> as much as they cou'd, yet he did great
Service against the Enemy, and Triumph'd, but still
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102323:97"/>
against the Senate's Consent. The <hi>Patritians</hi> were so
enrag'd at this, that at the next Election they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the <hi>Consul-ship</hi> from the Commons, after they had
enjoy'd it ten Years; and this hapned in the 399th
Year of the City.</p>
                  <p>This occasion'd many violent Heats and vast Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
between both Parties, for three Years successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when some of the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> press'd so hard upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Territories, that another <hi>Dictator</hi> was created,
namely,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxvii.</hi> U. C. 401.</note> 
                     <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who made <hi>Cornelius Cossus</hi>
his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi> but the Enemy out of Fear was
soon brought to a Peace, and so little was perform'd by
him. Now the Contests and Quarrels at home were
grown to that height, that the Senate was forc'd to give
the Commons once more the Privilege of the <hi>Consul-ship,</hi>
four Years after they had taken it from 'em; and
because Usury again was grown exceeding Burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to the poorer Sort, they appointed five Men to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Payment of Debts out of the Treasury: So now
all Differences were again reconcil'd. Soon after this,
a groundless Apprehension of the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> who were
reported to be all united against <hi>Rome,</hi> occasion'd the
Creation of another <hi>Dictator,</hi> which was <hi>C. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fulius,</hi> who
made <hi>L. Aemilius</hi> his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxviii.</hi> U. C. 402.</note> but he had so
little Employment that he left all to the next Consuls,
who were both <hi>Patritians.</hi> And they went against the
<hi>Tarquinii</hi> and <hi>Falisci,</hi> who were not yet quieted, and
brought 'em to a Peace for the Term of 40 Years.</p>
                  <p>V. Now <hi>Rome</hi> was for a while at Peace abroad, and
might have been longer so at home, had not <hi>Marcius
Rutilus,</hi> the <hi>Plebeian Dictator,</hi> stood for the Office of
<hi>Censor,</hi> and rais'd new Disturbances. The <hi>Plebeians</hi>
urg'd it hotly, but the <hi>Patritians</hi> the better to oppose
'em, procur'd a <hi>Dictator</hi> to be created, which was <hi>M.
Fabius, Q. Servilius</hi> being his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxix.</hi> U. C. 403.</note> but
still without Success; for after many Contests, the
<hi>Plebeian</hi> Faction prevail'd, and <hi>Marci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi> was made one
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102323:97"/>
of the <hi>Censors,</hi> which was the first <hi>Plebeian Censor</hi> in
this City,<note place="margin">Censor Pleb.</note> it being 92 Years after their first Creation.
The next Year, a considerable Victory was obtain'd
over the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who now grew troublesome again,
and one of the Consuls being wounded, and the other
sick, the Senate was forc'd to create a <hi>Dictator</hi> for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the <hi>Comitia</hi> for a new Election of Consuls,
which was <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxx.</hi> U. C. 404.</note> who made <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi>
his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi> and this was the <hi>Dictator</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon this account. <hi>Camillus</hi> himself was chosen
for one Consul, and the Death of his Collegue soon
after, and the pressing Wars with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> caus'd
the Senate to give him the sole Authority, so that he
was almost the same with a <hi>Dictator. Camillus</hi> led a
noble Army against the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and when they were
in sight of each other, a <hi>Gaul,</hi> remarkable both for
his Stature, and the Richness of his Arms, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any of the <hi>Romans</hi> to a single Combate. <hi>M. Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
a brave young Colonel of the Foot met him,
and in a little time slew him; but in the midst of
the Combat a Crow came, and sitting upon <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s
Head, with Beak and Wings assisted him in his
Fight, whence he had the Sirname of <hi>Corvus,</hi> and
his Posterity all call'd <hi>Corvini.</hi> This Combate brought
both Armies to a Battel, and the <hi>Gauls</hi> were intirely
routed.<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxi</hi> U. C. 405.</note> 
                     <hi>Camillus</hi> returning home, procur'd a <hi>Dictator</hi>
to be created for the holding of the <hi>Comitia</hi> for a new
Election of Consuls. This was <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> his
<hi>Master of the Horse</hi> being <hi>Cornelius Cossus;</hi> and in this
<hi>Comitia, Valerius Corvus,</hi> for his great Deserts, was
made <hi>Consul</hi> at 23 Years Age, a thing indeed very
extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>Now the Armies were disbanded, and for a short
Space there was both Peace abroad, and Concord at
home. This Year a Colony was drawn out from the
City <hi>Antia</hi> to People <hi>Satricum,</hi> which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
by the <hi>Latins;</hi> and also at <hi>Rome,</hi> a League
was concluded with the Ambassadors of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102323:98"/>
came on purpose to desire Amity between both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as <hi>Livy</hi> relates it. Above three Years after, the
<hi>Arunci,</hi> a People beyond the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and one of the six
Nations of <hi>Latium</hi> in the largest extent, made a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
invasion upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories; and upon
Suspition that it was by the Instigation of the whole
<hi>Latin</hi> Nation,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxii.</hi> U. C. 408.</note> 
                     <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> was created <hi>Dictator,</hi> as
if all <hi>Latium</hi> had been up in Arms. He chose <hi>Manlius
Capitelinus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and March'd
against the Enemy, whom he found more like Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
than Soldiers, so that in the very first Battel they
were dispers'd, and that War dispatch'd. A Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a Temple was dedicated to <hi>Iuno Moneta,</hi> on the
<hi>Capitol</hi> Hill, as the last <hi>Dictator</hi> had vow'd; and soon
after, some Prodigies were observ'd, of which the
<hi>Romans</hi> were so superstitiously fearful, that they crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a <hi>Dictator,</hi> to constitute certain Feasts and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
for the appeasing of the Gods, and diverting the
Judgments threatned: <hi>Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rius Poplicola</hi> was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and <hi>Fabius Ambustus</hi> his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Die. <hi>xxxiii.</hi> U. C. 409.</note> and
this was the first created upon this Account. Orders
were given, that not only all the <hi>Tribes</hi> shou'd go in
Procession with their solemn Prayers, but also the
bordering Nations; with precise Directions, upon
what Days each of 'em shou'd make their Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This Year likewise, the Usurers were prosecuted
by the <hi>Aediles,</hi> and severe Sentences given against
them by the People.</p>
                  <p>These were the principal Wars and Actions of the
<hi>Romans</hi> with their nearest Neighbours, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by their own Historians to have been all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,
or at least, not begun without just Grounds
and Provocations; yet these, which may well enough
bear the name of Defensive Wars, still increas'd the
<hi>Roman</hi> Dominions, which now contain'd in effect all
Old <hi>Latium,</hi> and the greatest Part of the other five
Nations afterwards comprehended under that Name,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Volsci, Aequi, Rutili, Hernici,</hi> and <hi>Arunci,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102323:98"/>
with most of <hi>Sabina,</hi> and a great Part of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria:</hi>
So that now their Dominions contain'd more
than double the Extent of what they were at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
of the Kings. The last <hi>Dictator</hi> beforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
was created a year before the Wars with the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
which Wars began <hi>A. M.</hi> 3661. in the first Year
of the 109th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> 410 Years after the Building
of the City, 165 after the beginning of the <hi>Consular</hi>
State, 46 since the Restoration of the City, 14 before
the Ruin of the <hi>Persian,</hi> and the setting up the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Empire by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and 342 before
our Saviour <hi>Christ's</hi> Nativity.</p>

home,<note place="margin">U. C. 410.</note> and as it were at their own Gates; but
now daily gathering strength, and encreasing in Power,
they ventur'd against the warlike <hi>Samnites,</hi> a People
above 100 Miles <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> These <hi>Samnites</hi> were
a hardy Nation, descended from the <hi>Sabines,</hi> from
whom they probably had their Name, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
a considerable Part of that Side of <hi>Italy,</hi> which
now goes by the Name of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
having likewise seven other People as Dependents,
namely, the <hi>Picentes, Vestini, Marrucini, Frentini, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni,
Marsi,</hi> and <hi>Hirpini.</hi> The Occasion of this War
was the <hi>Samnites</hi> Contesting with their Neighbours
the <hi>Sidicini,</hi> who immediately betook themselves to
the <hi>Campanians</hi> for Succour. These <hi>Campanians</hi> were
a luxurious and effeminate People, inhabiting a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Country bordering on <hi>Samnium,</hi> and were so
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102323:99"/>
weakned, that they sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for Aid, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
imploring it with Tears, and giving up
both themselves and Country into the Hands of the
<hi>Romans.</hi> The Senate at first was very unwilling to
begin a War with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> as being their Friends
and Allies; but the importunate Cries and Prayers
of the Ambassadors, and more especially the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Refusal of the <hi>Samnites</hi> to desist from ravaging
the Territories of <hi>Capua</hi> and <hi>Campania,</hi> so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd,
as at last to make them undertake the War.</p>
                  <p>The Consuls, <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> began their
Marches with two distinct Armies; one to <hi>Capua,</hi>
and the other into <hi>Samnium. Valerius</hi> after a most
bloody and obstinate Fight overthrew the Enemy in
<hi>Campania,</hi> and became Master of their Camp. The
<hi>Romans</hi> confess'd they never met with more resolute
Enemies; and demanding of 'em, <hi>What made 'em fly
after so brave a resistance?</hi> They answer'd, <hi>That the
Eyes of the</hi> Romans <hi>appear'd to 'em like Flames of Fire,
and their Looks so fierce and dreadful, as not to be born with.</hi>
In <hi>Samnium, Cornelius,</hi> the other Consul, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
led his Army too forward into a dangerous
Place, <hi>P. Decius,</hi> a Tribune in the Army, boldly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
himself of a Hill above the Enemy, who much
surpriz'd at the Attempt, turn'd their principal Force
thither, which gave Opportunity to the Consul to
draw off his Men to a more convenient Place. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Decius</hi> with an undaunted Bravery, though sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
brake through the Enemy, which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
'em than ever; and the Consul at the same
time Charging with great Resolution, so great a
Victory was obtain'd, that 30000 of the <hi>Samnites</hi>
were slain. Both the Consuls triumph'd over the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
and <hi>Decius</hi> was highly honour'd by the Senate
and People for his great Services.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, Ambassadors from <hi>Campania</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
to have Garisons from the <hi>Romans</hi> that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in <hi>Capua,</hi> and other Places, to secure 'em from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102323:99"/>
the Insults of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> which were accordingly sent.
But many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were of corrupted
with the Delights and Pleasures of <hi>Capua,</hi> that they
began to form a Design of destroying the Inhabitants,
and taking the Town to themselves. This Design
was communicated to many of their Companions in
other Places, and well approv'd of, but it was soon
discover'd to some of their Officers, who made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Removeals to disperse 'em. But the Soldiers
finding themselves liable to be call'd to an Account,
and perhaps severely punish'd; as soon as they found
Opportunity, gather'd themselves together, and daily
encreas'd their Numbers, march'd directly for <hi>Rome</hi>
in a Rebellious and hostile Manner. This piece of
Boldness so surpriz'd the Senate, that they presently
created a <hi>Dictator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxiv.</hi> U. C. 411.</note> which was <hi>Valerius Corvus,</hi> one of
the last Years Consuls, who appointed <hi>Aemilius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercinus</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and march'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rebels, who had now forc'd <hi>T. Quintius</hi> an
eminent Soldier, to be their General. Upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of both Armies, the Rebels out of Fear yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, and were receiv'd into Favour, the
<hi>Dictator</hi> having no more Imployment abroad. In the
same year, the frequent Inroads made by the <hi>Romans</hi>
into the <hi>Samnites</hi> Country, drew 'em to a Peace, the
<hi>Sidicini</hi> being left to their Mercy.</p>
                  <p>II. Soon after this Peace, the <hi>Samnites</hi> desir'd of
the <hi>Romans</hi> that the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Campanians</hi> might be
commanded not to assist the <hi>Sidicini;</hi> but because the
Senate wou'd not deny that these Nations were under
their Command, and were likewise unwilling to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
'em, such an ambiguous Answer was return'd,
that the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Campanians</hi> thought themselves so
far disoblig'd as to revolt. <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
the third time, and his Collegue, <hi>Decius Mus,</hi> were
sent by the Senate to chastise the <hi>Latins,</hi> who now
wou'd be satisfi'd with no less than having one of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102323:100"/>
the Consuls; and half the Senators chosen out of their
Nation. Upon certain Dreams and Prognostications,
that the General on one side, and the Army on the
other was certainly to be destroy'd; the Consuls So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
agreed, <hi>That in what Part the</hi> Roman <hi>Army
shou'd be distress'd, the Commander of that Part shou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
himself to the Gods, and die for his Country;</hi> which
generous Resolution was confirm'd by Oath: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were all acquainted with each others Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and way of Fighting, strict Commands were
given that no Man upon pain of Death shou'd Fight
without Orders.</p>
                  <p>Both Armies were drawn up in Battalia, and a
bloody and obstinate Ingagement immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd;
the <hi>Latins</hi> pressing very hard upon <hi>Decius</hi>'s Part,
he according to his Promise devoted himself to the
Gods, and rushing violently into the midst of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
after a great Slaughter lost his Life, the <hi>Latins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
soon after entirely defeated. Nor was the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of <hi>Manlius</hi> less remarkable than the Courage of
<hi>Decius,</hi> in relation to his own Son: For he, passing
with his Troops, before the Battel nigh the Enemy,
was challeng'd by <hi>Metius,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Tusculans,</hi>
whom when he had slain and stripp'd, his Father
with Tears commended him for his Valour, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him for his Disobedience; which though a sad,
was a profitable Example to the rest of his Men: And
after that, cruel Commands were usually call'd <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana
Dicta.</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi> now defeated, begg'd Peace;
which being given 'em, tho not with the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to all, <hi>Manlius</hi> return'd in Triumph, but was
met only by the Old Men, the Young Ones refusing to
do him that Honour, and ever after hating him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of his Son. Soon after, the People of
<hi>Antium</hi> and <hi>Ardea</hi> made incursions into the <hi>Roman</hi>
Territories:<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxv.</hi> U. C. 413.</note> But <hi>Manlius</hi> being Sick, he nam'd <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Crassus</hi> for <hi>Dictator,</hi> who appointed <hi>Papyrius Cursor</hi>
his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and kept the Field some Months
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102323:100"/>
in the <hi>Antiates</hi> Country, but no remarkable Action
hapned.</p>
                  <p>The Consuls for the following Year, <hi>Aemilius</hi> and
<hi>Publius,</hi> overthrew the <hi>Latins,</hi> who had again revolted
upon the Account of some Lands taken from 'em.
<hi>Publius,</hi> by whose Conduct the Victory was obtain'd,
receiv'd into Alliance such Cities as had been worsted;
and <hi>Aemilius</hi> march'd his Army and sat down before
<hi>Pedum,</hi> which receiv'd Supplies from several Places.
Tho he had the Advantage in all Skirmishes, yet still
the Town held out, and he understanding that his
Collegue was return'd to his Triumph, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left the Siege, and went for <hi>Rome</hi> to demand that
Honour likewise. The Senate was much offended at
this Presumption, denying him that Honour, except
<hi>Pedum</hi> was either taken or surrender'd; which caus'd
him out of Revenge to joyn with the <hi>Tribunes</hi> against
the <hi>Patritians</hi> the rest of his Time, his Collegue not
opposing it, being himself a <hi>Plebeian.</hi> The Senate, out
of a Desire to get free of 'em both, order'd a <hi>Dictator</hi>
to be created, whom it fell to <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s share to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
as having the <hi>Fasces</hi> that Month. <hi>Aemilius</hi> nam'd
his Collegue <hi>Publius Philo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxvi.</hi> U. C. 414.</note> who appointed <hi>Iunius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and was the second. <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
Dictator</hi> in <hi>Rome. Publius</hi> was a great Vexation
to the Nobility, and was full of Invectives against
'em, procuring three Remarkable Laws, whereof the
first alter'd the very Constitution of the State, which
was, <hi>That the</hi> Plebiscita <hi>shou'd bind the</hi> Quirites <hi>or Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of</hi> Rome, <hi>of all Ranks and Degrees whatsoever.</hi> The
second was, <hi>That such Laws as were enacted in the</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiate
Comitia, <hi>shou'd be propos'd or pass'd by the Senate
before they were voted by the People.</hi> The third, <hi>That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they had obtain'd before, that both the</hi> Censors <hi>might be</hi>
Plebeians; <hi>now one at least must of necessity be so.</hi> So
now the Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> State was more impair'd
by the Authority of these two at home, than it was
augmented by their Valour abroad.</p>

In the following Year, wherein <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> and
C. <hi>Maenius,</hi> were Consuls, <hi>Pedum</hi> was taken by Storm,
and the Consuls in pursuit of the Victory Conquer'd
all <hi>Latium,</hi> bringing it and some neighbouring Parts
to an intire Submission; for which they triumph'd,
and had Statues on Horseback erected for 'em in the
<hi>Forum,</hi> an Honour very rare in those Days. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
People of <hi>Latium,</hi> had several Conditions of Peace
appointed 'em, some being rewarded and honour'd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
punish'd and disgrac'd, according as their former
Behaviour had been. To <hi>Antium</hi> was sent a new Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the old Inhabitants being forbidden the Sea, and
had all their long Ships taken from 'em, but had leave
to enter themselves in the Colony, and were made
free of that City. The Ships were some of 'em
brought into the <hi>Roman</hi> Arsenal, others burnt, and with
their <hi>Rostra</hi> or Beaks, was the Gallery or Pulpit, for
Orations in the <hi>Forum</hi> adorn'd; whence that had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the name of <hi>Rostra.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rostra.</note> The Year following,
<hi>Minutia,</hi> a Vestal Virgin, was bury'd alive in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Sceleratus,</hi> which, as <hi>Livy</hi> believes, had its Name
from <hi>Incest;</hi> for so Incontinency in those Women
was call'd. And in this same Year, <hi>Publius Philo</hi> was
made <hi>Praetor,</hi> who was the first <hi>Plebeian</hi> that obtain'd
this Honour,<note place="margin">Praetor Pleb. U. C. 416.</note> the Senate little regarding it, having
been so often overpower'd in Matters of the greatest
Consequence: And this hapned in the 416th Year of
the City, and 28 Years after the first Creation of this
Office.</p>
                  <p>III. Not long after the Agreement between the
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> a War broke out between the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runci</hi>
and the <hi>Sidicini</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> in which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
constrain'd the former to abandon their ancient
Seats, and settle in <hi>Suessa,</hi> which was afterwards call'd
<hi>Arunca.</hi> The <hi>Arunci</hi> had given up themselves to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who thereupon order'd 'em Relief; but the
Consuls deferring it, lost the Opportunity of assisting
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102323:101"/>
'em. But in the next Year, the <hi>Sidicini</hi> with their
Confederates and Neighbours, the Inhabitants of
<hi>Cales</hi> were overthrown; and <hi>Valerius Corvus,</hi> now
the fourth time Consul for the following Year, and
one of the greatest <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders of his time,
took <hi>Cales</hi> also, in which he plac'd a Colony of 2500
Persons, <hi>Corvus</hi> return'd in Triumph; but he and
his Collegue being imploy'd in some small Actions
abroad, a <hi>Dictator</hi> was created for the holding the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia</hi>
for the Election of new Consuls, which was
<hi>Aemilius Mamercinus,</hi> who appointed <hi>Publius Philo</hi> for
his <hi>Master of the Horse.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxvii.</hi> U. C. 418.</note> Two Years before this, a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi>
was created, and another a Year after this; but
by reason of their undue Election, and their not acting,
I shall not reckon 'em among the Number of <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
Affairs abroad were in a peaceable Posture for
some time, but in two or three Years, the mere Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of an Invasion by the <hi>Gauls</hi> occasion'd the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>Dictator,</hi> which was <hi>Papirius Crassus,</hi> his
<hi>Master of the Horse</hi> being <hi>V. Poplicola;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxviii.</hi> U. C. 421.</note> but neither of
'em had any extraordinary Employment. In this
same Year, two new <hi>Tribes</hi> were added, namely,
the <hi>Metian</hi> and the <hi>Scaptian,</hi> for the late admitted Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
which now made the Number twenty nine:
The <hi>Arunci</hi> were also made free of the City,<note place="margin">Tribe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

the Privilege of Voting, by a Law prefer'd by
<hi>Papirius</hi> the <hi>Praetor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About a Year after the Settlement of these Matters,
above 170 Women were put to Death for the Art of
Poysoning, being discover'd by a She-slave. This was
look'd upon, as such a Prodigy by the Superstitious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that a <hi>Dictator</hi> was created to drive a Nail into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s
Temple,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xxxix.</hi> U. C. 422.</note> as the best Remedy for the Distempers
of the State. <hi>Quintius Varus</hi> was the Man, and <hi>Valerius
Potius</hi> his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi> and this was the second
<hi>Dictator</hi> created upon that account. For the two suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Years, a War was carri'd on against the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Privernum</hi> in the <hi>Volscian</hi> State, who were
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102323:102"/>
drawn into it by <hi>Vitrurius Vaccus,</hi> a Man of principal
Note among the <hi>Arunci.</hi> The first Year they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown,
the next <hi>Vitrurius</hi> was taken Prisoner, and
<hi>Privernum</hi> surrender'd; the principal Actors with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurius</hi>
being put to Death, and the rest of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
made free of the City:<note place="margin">U. C. 424.</note> This hapned in the same
Year with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s destroying the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire,
and his setting up the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and 60 after the
burning of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gauls.</hi> In a Year or two after,
the Inhabitants of <hi>Palaepolis</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> trusting to
the Treachery of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and taking advantage
from a Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> committed great Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
against the <hi>Romans,</hi> who dwelt about <hi>Cumae</hi>
and <hi>Falernus.</hi> War was presently declar'd against 'em
and tho they we assisted by the <hi>Samnites</hi> and <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
a People beyond 'em, yet they were forc'd to
yield up their City, which stood in some Place, where
<hi>Naples</hi> did afterwards, and the <hi>Samnites</hi> lost three of
their own Towns. The <hi>Tarentines</hi> nevertheless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
and drew the <hi>Samnites</hi> with the Residue of the
<hi>Palaepoltians</hi> again into the War, wherein the <hi>Vestini,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Allies, were also ingaged.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this War, great Commotions
happen'd in the City, occasion'd by one <hi>Papirius,</hi> who
had given up himself as Slave to <hi>Publius,</hi> a severe Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
to work out his Father's Debt. <hi>Papirius</hi> being
both Young and Beautiful, <hi>Publius</hi> attempted to abuse
him after a filthy Manner, and upon his Refusal, most
cruelly scourg'd him. In this Condition <hi>Papirius</hi> fled
to the People, who were so affected with his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Usage, that they procur'd these two Laws Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after: First, <hi>That no Man shou'd be detain'd in Bounds,
except for heinous Misdemeanors, and then not after Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The second, <hi>That the Money and Goods, not the
Body of the Debtor shou'd be responsible:</hi> Whereupon all
Prisoners for Debt were immediately set at Liberty.
The following Year, the <hi>Vestini</hi> were overthrown by
<hi>Brutus Scaeva,</hi> the Consul, and two Towns taken
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102323:102"/>
from 'em. His Collegue, <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi> being Sick at
<hi>Samnium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>xl.</hi> U. C. 428.</note> nam'd <hi>Papirius Cursor</hi> for <hi>Dictator,</hi> the most
famous Commander in those times, who appointed
<hi>Fabius Rullianus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse. Papirius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
encamp'd nigh the <hi>Samnites,</hi> was forc'd to return
to <hi>Rome</hi> to renew his <hi>Auspicia,</hi> leaving a most strict
Command to <hi>Fabius</hi> not to stir out of his Trenches in
his absence: But <hi>Fabius</hi> finding a great Advantage,
engag'd the Enemy, and made a great Slaughter of 'em.
The <hi>Dictator</hi> in a great Rage return'd to the Camp,
and wou'd have put him to Death, but the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scu'd
him; which caus'd <hi>Papirius</hi> to make great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to the Senate, witha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> urging the absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a strict Discipline and Authority. But at last
the Intreaties of the Fathers, with the Commotions of
the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and People, prevail'd with him to spare
his Life. This Severity of <hi>Papirius</hi> so alienated the
Hearts of the Soldiers, that it almost cost him the loss
of a Battel soon after, which constrain'd him to be
more Popular for the future; after which he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and so much wasted their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as forc'd them to desire a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Samnites</hi> soon return'd to their former Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in two Years time they grew so strong, that the

Enemy a great Overthrow; by which the <hi>Samnites</hi>
were so weaken'd, that they sent all their Prisoners
and Plunder to <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the dead Body of
the Author of the Revolt, who had kil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Senate only receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d the Men, with such Goods
as were particularly challeng'd, and dem'd 'em Peace.
Inrag'd at this, <hi>Pontius,</hi> the chief Man among em,
drew out the <hi>Samnites</hi> to a Place, call'd <hi>Caudium,</hi> and
putting ten Soldiers in the Habit of Shepherds, he sent
'em to <hi>Calatia</hi> where the <hi>Consuls</hi> lay, with Instructions
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102323:103"/>
to report that the <hi>Samnites</hi> were now in <hi>Apulia</hi> before
<hi>Luceria,</hi> and had almost taken it. The Consuls belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Report, made all speed to relieve the Town,
lest their Allies, the <hi>Apulians</hi> might be oblig'd to join
with the <hi>Samnites.</hi> Now the <hi>Romans</hi> had but two Ways
to March to <hi>Luceria;</hi> one large enough, but far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
the other a narrow Passage through the Straits
of <hi>Caudium,</hi> a Place incompass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and extream difficult and dangerous to pass, if an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

through this, were immediately block'd up on all sides
by <hi>Pontius,</hi> who had possess'd himself of all the Defiles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Samnites</hi> having got the <hi>Romans</hi> at this great
Advantage, immediately sent to <hi>Herennius, Pontius</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to know how to proceed. <hi>Herennius</hi> sent two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Messages, the first to dismiss the <hi>Romans</hi> without
any Injury at all, the second to put 'em all to the
Sword; urging, <hi>That one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

necessary; for the first would lay a perpetual Obligation on
a most powerful People, and the second would be a great
weakning of a most formidable Enemy; and that no third
Way cou'd either gain their Friendship, or diminish their
Strength.</hi> But this prudent Counsel wou'd not be heard;
so the <hi>Romans</hi> had these Articles allow'd 'em: First,
<hi>That their Army shou'd march away only with their under

no other Pretence than Necessity and Self-Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
About the time of his Return, there happened
such a dreadful Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius Rufinus,</hi>

which they, by Tradition, believ'd wou'd asswage
the Distemper: and this was the third <hi>Dictator</hi> created
upon this Account. The <hi>Consuls</hi> for the following year
were <hi>Curius Dentatus,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Lentulus;</hi> the former
of which raising new Levies, was oppos'd by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who refus'd to list themselves. <hi>Curius,</hi> resolving
to go through with his Designs, commanded the
Names of every <hi>Tribe</hi> to be put into a Box; and the
Lot falling upon the <hi>Pollian Tribe,</hi> the first that was
drawn of that <hi>Tribe</hi> was cited: and not answering, he
sold his Goods; and, upon his appealing to the <hi>Tribunes,</hi>
he sold the Man too, saying, <hi>The Commonwealth</hi> stood

The. <hi>Tribunes</hi> at that time, did not assist the Fellow;
and ever after hatt if any refus'd to stil himself in a

in the time towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, hoping to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize

and at the break of day his Approach was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd

Hills, which put their whole Camp into much Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

out his Troops in haste, and falling in with the Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> put him to flight, killing many
Men, and taking some Elephants. This Success very
much discourag'd the rest of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Troops, and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
descending into the Plain, join'd Battel with the
whole Army. In one Wing he repuls'd the Enemy,
in the other, by the Violence of the Elephants, he
was born back to his Trenches; where calling forth
those who guarded 'em, they from the high Places so
ply'd the Beasts with Darts and fired Pitch and Hemp,
that they ran back upon their Friends, bearing down,
and breaking all their Ranks, so that the Victory fell

with an undaunted Mind, and receiving Letters from
<hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> he call'd the <hi>Epirots</hi> and <hi>Tarentines</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
telling them that Assistance wou'd soon come;

Commander of all the Kings in that time, both for
Military Experience and Personal Valour: but he
knew better how to Conquer than how to Keep; and

was now become formidable, after the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of so great a Man as <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> which made way
for farther Conquests, and the Establishment of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire. In the second year after <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s
Retreat, <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to congratulate the <hi>Roman</hi> Success,<note place="margin">U. C. 480.</note> and to
enter into an Alliance with 'em. The <hi>Romans,</hi> to
shew him the greater Respect, likewise sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were most courteously
receiv'd, and sent home laden with Gifts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents.

sensible how unable he was to resist, by leave from
the Consul <hi>Papirius,</hi> departed with his Men, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Castle, which the <hi>Romans</hi> possessing, easily
became Masters of the City, the Walls whereof they
demolish'd. Peace and Liberty were granted to all
the Citizens; and this year the two Consuls triumph'd,
having finish'd both the <hi>Tarentine</hi> and <hi>Samnite</hi> Wars in
the year 481. The latter of these had, with some
Intermissions, continu'd seventy one years; and over
these the <hi>Romans</hi> triumph'd thirty times, namely, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls</hi>
twenty six, <hi>Dictator</hi> twice, and <hi>Pro-Consuls</hi> as many.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Romans</hi> grew much too powerful for their
Neighbours, for the greatest Part of <hi>Italy</hi> was now
conquer'd, an Accession being made not only of the
<hi>Tarentines</hi> and <hi>Samnites,</hi> but of the <hi>Lucanians</hi> also, and
not long before, of the <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Campanian</hi> Legion, who had treacherously seiz'd upon
<hi>Rhegium,</hi> and kept it to themselves, were besieg'd,
and upon Surrender, put to death by fifty at a time.
Soon after, the Inhabitants of <hi>Apollonia</hi> in <hi>Illyricum</hi>
sending Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> some extravagant and
unruly Noblemen fell upon 'em and beat 'em but the
<hi>Romans</hi> were so just as to deliver 'em up to the <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates.</hi>
In the same year, the <hi>Picentes</hi> were subdu'd, and
Colonies were sent to <hi>Ariminum</hi> in the Country of
the <hi>Piceni,</hi> and to <hi>Beneventum</hi> in that of the <hi>Samnites.</hi>
About the same time was Silver first coin'd in <hi>Rome,</hi>

Riches being encreas'd by their Conquests,<note place="margin">U. C. 484.</note> and large

time, <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> being <hi>Censor,</hi> first made the equal
Division of the Day into Hours, by Water dropping

                  <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> by the Alliance with <hi>Hiero,</hi> found

the following Year they sent but two Legions to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi>

without Controversie being entire Masters at
Sea, by that means procur'd the Maritime Towns to
revolt to them: so that the War was not only bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd
between the two Interests, but <hi>Italy</hi> was also
grievously infested with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet, while
<hi>Africk</hi> was out of all Danger. The Considerations
caus'd 'em diligently to apply themselves to Sea Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
of which they were wholly ignorant before;
therefore they found it a Matter of extraordinary Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
as well to build Vessels as to make use of 'em;
for <hi>Italy</hi> had been as free from Shipwrights as from
Sea-men. Having throughly observ'd a <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
Vessel or two driven a Shore, they set about 100 Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of five Oars of a side, and 20 of three, which
they fitted out as well as they cou'd, after an odd
way teaching their Men to Row upon Dry Land;
well knowing that their Courages must supply all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Defects.</p>
                  <p>Thus meanly rigg'd out, in the fourth Year of this

themselves aboard, and more boldly ventur'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
an Enemy, who for many Ages had been the
Inheritors of the Dominion of the Sea both by their
Power and their Skill; a thing much admir'd by all
Historians. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Admiral parting from the
rest of his Company with 17 Gallies to reduce <hi>Lipara,</hi>
was surpriz'd by at greater number of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
and taken with the rest of his Fleet. But his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue
<hi>Duilius</hi> was much more successful, first defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
50 Sail of the Enemy, then falling upon the Rest
of their Fleet, by the Help of a new invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Engine to grapple with their Vessels, by
which they cou'd board 'em and fight as on
Land, he obtain'd a Signal Victory over 'em, taking
50 of their Vessels; then pursuing it, rais'd the Siege
of <hi>Aegesta,</hi> and took <hi>Macella</hi> by Storm. These Successes
were so unexpected by the Senate, that they decreed
<hi>Duilius</hi> unusual Honours; for besides his obtaining the
Glory of the first Naval Triumph, he was ever after
attended from Supper with Musick and Flambeaus.
<hi>Annibal</hi> on the other side, to secure himself from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
with all speed sent one of his Friends to
<hi>Carthage</hi> before the Battel was known here, who gave
an Account to the Senate, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sail with a great Fleet, and he wanted Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about engaging 'em. The Senate, upon this gave
Orders to Fight without Delay, to whom the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
reply'd, <hi>That he had already fought, and was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown:</hi>
By which means he prevented their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
an Action they had but just before approv'd of.</p>
                  <p>This Year the <hi>Romans</hi> had but small Success by
Land; for, a Breach between the Legions and the
Auxiliaries occasion'd a Separation; which Advantage
<hi>Amilcar</hi> the General of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Forces so far
improv'd, as to cut off 4000 of 'em. But the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

                     <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General there, was slain, and his Army
cut off by <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> the Consul. This Victory
was follow'd by another over <hi>Annibal,</hi> whom they
surpriz'd at Sea, newly recruited from <hi>Carthage;</hi> for
which the unfortunate Admiral was crucify'd by his

Enemies perceiving the small probability of reducing
'em, broke up the Siege, and made all Preparations

These Consuls putting to Sea with 350 Sail,
were met with by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> night hir own

and sinking 104, with the loss only of Nine of their

to have several Towns there surrender'd to 'em

make the Shore, there arose such a dreadful Storm,
that most of their Ships were swallow'd up, or split
upon Rocks; so that the Shore was fill'd with dead
Bodies and broken Pieces of Ships. Both the Consuls

of this great Misfortune, besieg'd <hi>Agrigentum,</hi>
and soon after took it, and demolish'd the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it. The <hi>Romans</hi> nothing discourag'd at the
great Losses sustained by the Tempest, immediately
set about Building 220 Vessels, which they prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that extraordinary Diligence and Expedition,
that in three Months time they were both Built and
Launch'd. On the other side, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
with his Veterane Troops and Levies arriv'd at
<hi>Sicily,</hi> with a Fleet of 200 Sail Old and New. The
Consuls, <hi>Attilius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> being order'd for <hi>Sicily</hi>
this Year, manag'd the War so prosperously, as to
take several Towns; after which they return'd. Their
Successors <hi>Servilius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> in the following
Spring, pass'd into <hi>Sicily</hi> with the whole Fleet, and
from thence to <hi>Africk,</hi> where, Coasting about, they
Landed in many Places, but perform'd nothing very
Memorable. At last they touch'd upon the Island of
the <hi>Lotophagi,</hi> call'd <hi>Meninx,</hi> nigh the lesser <hi>Syrtis;</hi>
where being ignorant of these Coasts, they fell upon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102323:116"/>
certain Quick-sands; but getting off with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
they return'd to <hi>Panormus</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> in a flying
Posture. Then sailing for <hi>Rome,</hi> through the Straights,
very unadvisedly, they were taken in a Storm, and
150 of the Ships lost. This same Year the <hi>Censors</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

an extraordinary Desire of Glory; yet the Losses at
Sea had now been so great and numerous, that they
were constrain'd to omit Naval Preparations, and
place all their Hopes in their Land-Forces. <hi>Caecilius</hi>
and <hi>Metellus</hi> were sent into <hi>Sicily</hi> with the Legions,

                     </gap>em, <hi>That he knew that

upon that account not capable of living as became a Citizen
of</hi> Rome: <hi>yet however he had so much of the True Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a</hi> Roman, <hi>that he cou'd do nothing that was base or
dishonourable; and that he less fear'd the Tortures of a
cruel Rack, than the Shame of an infamous Action, for
the former only touch'd the Body, whereas the latter pierc'd
the Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Means were us'd to perswade <hi>Regulus</hi> to stay,
both by his Friends and others, which he avoided as
much as possible, refusing to speak with his Wife, and
shunning the Embraces and Kisses of his little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
And when the Negotiation was at an end,
he return'd to <hi>Carthage,</hi> there ending his Days in
great Torments. For, first they cut off his Eye-lids,
keeping him in a dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Dungeon for a while, then
brought him out in the midst of the Day, with his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102323:117"/>
Face turn'd full against the Sun: At last he was put
into a Chest or Barrel, stuck with Nails with the Points
inward, and so narrow, that he cou'd have no Ease,
where he died with the Extremity of the Pain. When
the Senate heard of the Barbarous Usage of <hi>Regulus,</hi> in
great Rage they deliver'd up some Prisoners of the
Highest Note and Quality to <hi>Marcia</hi> his Wife, who
shut 'em up in an Armory stuck round with Iron
Spikes, designing to torment them after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that her Husband had been, and keeping 'em five
days together without Meat: in which time, <hi>Bostar</hi>
the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> with Pain and Hunger, died, but
<hi>Hamilcar,</hi> being a stronger Man, was kept in, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the dead Body of <hi>Bostar,</hi> five days longer,
having only so much Sustenance allow'd him as might
serve to prolong his Life in Misery. At last, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
being inform'd of this, began to relent, and
strictly forbid any more of such Usuage, commanding
that <hi>Bostar</hi>'s Ashes should be sent home, and the rest
of the Prisoners shou'd be us'd more moderately:
Which was done, to let the Enemy know, <hi>that the</hi>
Romans <hi>were too generous to insult over the Miseries of
unhappy Men, or to countenance any cruel Actions, tho' they
had been incited by the highest Provocations, and all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of a most just Retaliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following Year, because the Land-Forces were
very fearful of the Enemies Elephants, and pursu'd
their Affairs with small Vigour, the <hi>Romans</hi> provided
another Fleet, and Besieg'd <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> by Sea and Land,
a Town standing upon the Southern Promontory of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> over against <hi>Africk.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were very
unsuccessful in this Expedition, losing most of their
Ships in a short time, partly by the Mismanagement
of the Consul <hi>Claudius Pulcher,</hi> and partly by other
Misfortunes; so that the whole Fleet was soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to an inconsiderable number. <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> was
still closely invested by Land; but the small Successes
of the present Consuls, and other Losses, occasion'd
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102323:117"/>
the creating of a <hi>Dictator</hi> to Command the Forces in
<hi>Sicily:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dic. <hi>lvi.</hi> U. C. 504.</note> This was <hi>Attilius Calatinus,</hi> who appointed <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius
Metellus,</hi> who had Triumph'd over the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi> and was the first <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
that ever led an Army out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but nothing
memorable was acted by him in <hi>Sicily</hi> before the time
of his Office expir'd. The <hi>Romans</hi> now began to feel
the Weight and Charge of the War more than ever;
and they found that the City was not only drein'd of
Money, but of Men too; for in the next <hi>Lustrum</hi>
there were but 251222 Free Citizens Poll'd.</p>
                  <p>For Seven Years did the <hi>Romans</hi> abstain from any
Sea-Preparations, in which time another <hi>Dictator</hi> was
created in the Consuls Absence for holding the <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
for a New Election,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>lvii.</hi> U. C. 50.</note> which was <hi>Coruncanius Nepos,</hi>
and his <hi>Master of the Horse</hi> was <hi>Fulvius Flaccus.</hi> At
this time <hi>Amilcar,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Admiral, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infested the Coasts of <hi>Italy;</hi> which made the <hi>Romans</hi>
resolve once more to try their Fortune at Sea: and
accordingly they fitted out a considerable Navy out of
their private Purses, the Treasury being now exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
With this they gave the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> a notable
Overthrow nigh the <hi>Aegatian</hi> Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, taking and sinking
120 of their Ships, according to the most modest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
This great Loss brought 'em to a Peace,
which, after two Consultations, was concluded upon
these Articles; First, <hi>That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>shou'd
lay down 1000 Talents of Silver, and 2200 more within
10 Years time:</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they shou'd quit</hi> Sicily,
<hi>with all the Isles thereabouts:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That they shou'd
never make War upon the</hi> Syracusians, <hi>or their Allies, nor
come with any Vessels of War within the</hi> Roman <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:</hi>
and Fourthly, <hi>That they shou'd deliver up all their
Prisoners without Ransom, as also the Deserters.</hi> Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the first <hi>Punick,</hi> or <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, by the <hi>Greek</hi>

with the <hi>Romans,</hi>

                     </note> and in the same Year that this

to the rest, namely, the <hi>Veline</hi> and <hi>Quirine,</hi> which now
made up the Number 35, which Number was never

grow more polite, a little applying their Minds to
something of Study and Learning, particularly <hi>Poetry;</hi>
and the Year after this War,<note place="margin">U. C. 514. <hi>First</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jedies <hi>and</hi> Comedies <hi>in</hi> Rome.</note> the first <hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi>

160 after the Deaths of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> and 62
after that of <hi>Menander.</hi> He drew the Minds of the
People from the Use of the <hi>Satyr,</hi> which had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
succeeded the old <hi>Stage-Plays,</hi> call'd <hi>Ludi Fescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini,</hi>
spoken of in the Sixth Chapter of this Book;
which <hi>Satyr</hi> was a sort of a <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poem, full of
Jests and Raillery, wholly different from the <hi>Satyrs</hi>
of <hi>Lucilius</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> afterwards. <hi>Naevius</hi> was the
first Poet that follow'd his example, five Years after,
the Year before which were celebrated the great <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Games</hi> the third time,<note place="margin">Ludi Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares.</note> which were also call'd <hi>Ludi
magni,</hi> and <hi>Ludi Terentini,</hi> and were of two sorts: the
Greater, celebrated every 120 Years, and first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the 298th Year of the City; and the Lesser, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
every 100 Year, and first instituted about the
305th Year of the City, after the Banishment of the
<hi>Decemviri:</hi> But these now celebrated were of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sort. There were also other Games call'd <hi>Ludi
Tarentini,</hi> which were very different from the <hi>Ludi
Seculares,</hi> which I mention that Learners may avoid
Confusion.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs; the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
soon after their Peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> fell into
a Bloody War between themselves and their Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102323:118"/>
Soldiers, which proceeded both from their Want
of Pay, and their Want of Employment; and this,
with much Difficulty and Loss, was ended by <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
after more than Three Years. During which
time, several of the <hi>Romans</hi> who traded into <hi>Africk,</hi>
were secur'd by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> lest they shou'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
their Enemies with Provisions. But when Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
were sent to <hi>Carthage</hi> to complain of this
Usage, they kindly dismiss'd all that were in Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which so affected the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
sent 'em all their Prisoners without Ransom,
and for a short Space there seem'd to be an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Friendship between these two Nations. But
soon after their Troubles were ended, the <hi>Sardinians</hi>
inviting over the <hi>Romans</hi> to that Island, they sail'd
thither, which much offended the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who
thought themselves to have the greatest Right to it;
so they prepar'd to send Forces thither. The <hi>Romans</hi>
took an Occasion from thence to proclaim War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
'em, complaining, <hi>That these Preparations were
design'd more against them, than the</hi> Sardinians. This
so terrify'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who found themselves
in no Condition to begin a new War, that they were
forc'd to yield to Necessity, and not only quit all <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi>
but further, to pay the <hi>Romans</hi> 1200 Talents.
This, tho' submitted to at present, prov'd afterwards
the Occasion of a more bloody and dangerous War
than the former. In the sixth Year after the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
War, the <hi>Romans</hi> being in perfect Peace with
all their Neighbours, the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> was shut
the second time,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>lviii.</hi> U. C. 522.</note> it being open 437 Years. In the
following Year was the first Divorce in <hi>Rome;</hi> and
two Years after a <hi>Dictator</hi> was created for holding the
<hi>Comitia,</hi> and this was <hi>C. Duilius,</hi> his <hi>Master of the Horse</hi>
being <hi>Aurelius Cotta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For five Years successively the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi>
continued shut, and in the sixth was open'd by a War
with the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> a People nigh <hi>Greece,</hi> who inhabited
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102323:119"/>
that Country which is now call'd <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> for <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
Queen of that Nation, elevated by her Prosperity
in Peace, gave her Subjects Commission to rob all
they met with at Sea; some of which happen'd to be
Merchants of <hi>Italy,</hi> whom they used very Barbarously.
Upon Intelligence of this, the <hi>Romans</hi> dispatch'd two
Ambassadors, <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius Coruncanus,</hi> to <hi>Illyricum,</hi>
to demand Satisfaction. <hi>Teuta</hi> told 'em, <hi>That she
would take care that no publick Injury shou'd be offer'd to
the</hi> Romans; <hi>but she thought it was never the Custom of
Princes to hinder their Subjects from making what private
Advantage they cou'd from the Sea.</hi> But <hi>Lucius</hi> smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

which was, to punish Private Injuries with a Publick
Revenge, and to relieve the Distressed; and they, by the help
of the God's, would take care to reform her Princely Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.</hi>
The Queen took this Freedom so heinously,
that, contrary to the Law of Nations, she sent after
the Ambassadors, and slew <hi>Lucius.</hi> This so enrag'd
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that War was immediately Proclaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, and the two Consuls sent to <hi>Illyricum, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>

<hi>Fulvius</hi> had <hi>Corcyra</hi> surrender'd to him at his first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

the Armies joyning, the Consuls reliev'd <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi>
which was Invested by the <hi>Illyrians.</hi> Soon after most
of the <hi>Illyrick</hi> Towns were surrendred to the Consuls;
whereupon the Queen retir'd with a few Followers
to <hi>Rhizon,</hi> a strong Town, and the Spring after, sent
to <hi>Rome</hi> to beg Peace; which was granted upon these
Terms: First, <hi>To pay a yearly Tribute:</hi> Secondly,
<hi>To quit all</hi> Illyricum, <hi>except a very few Places:</hi> And
Thirdly, <hi>Not to Sail beyond the River</hi> Lissus <hi>with more

that they were forc'd to form Two Fronts, and
Fight very disadvantageously, both by reason of their
Nakedness and the Unfitness of their Arms. But the
Vanity of the <hi>Gessatae</hi> prov'd the most injurious to 'em,
for they throwing off all their Cloaths, would needs
fight naked, and begin the first Charge; and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The <hi>Gauls</hi> were miserably slaughter'd, 40000 of 'em

obtain'd a most Splendid Triumph for this Victory,
scarce any being more remarkable for the Number of
the Prisoners, or the Variety and Value of the Spoils.
The next Year great Inroads were made into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> they being several times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown:
At which time the <hi>Consuls</hi> being abroad, a

About this time, a Multitude of <hi>Libertini</hi> or Freed

great Disturbances to the City, which occasion'd the

Conduct and Valour, of a hardy, laborious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Body, as well as a fierce, daring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted

any Danger, or Hazard, so he might procure the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

sufficient Force to guard that Country, he cross'd the
<hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains into <hi>Gaul,</hi> with an Army of
50000 Foot, and 9000 Horse, of different Nations
and Languages. From whence he shortly pass'd the

there being swift and spacious, and its Banks cover'd
with many and dangerous Enemies. In Ten days

long shagg'd Hair like Savages, and nothing to be

The Soldiers in this March, besides their Fears, were
extreamly afflicted with the Greatness of the Colds,
and grievously harass'd by the narrow Defiles, the
slippery Passages, and the craggy Rocks, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially

Places fell often upon 'em with great Slaughter; and
sometimes by their unusual Shouts and Outcries,
which were redoubled by the Echo's between the
Rocks and Valleys, their Horses were so affrighted,
as they frequently overthrew themselves, Men and
Carriages, down these narrow Precipices, who falling

the Rock. In order to that, great Numbers of huge
Trees were fell'd, and a mighty Pile made against it
and set on fire; when the Rock was red-hot, they sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd,

they were scarcely sensible of their Victory; for Rain

Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> was now as successful in his
Battels, as before he had been daring in his Marches,
the <hi>Romans</hi> never having met with a more formidable
Enemy, or a more expert General.</p>
                  <p>II. The Loss of these two Battels caus'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
to be more diligent in the Preparations for the<note place="margin">U. C. 537.</note>
next Campaign; for the Managing of which, <hi>C. Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
and <hi>Servilius Geminus</hi> were chosen Consuls:
The former of these had a good Faculty of Speaking,
but no great Skill in War. <hi>Hannibal</hi> having all this
while kept in the Country of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> where he had
recruited and strengthen'd his Army now resolved to
change the Seat of the War, and march into <hi>Hetruria;</hi>
and after some Consultation about the Way thither,
he fixt upon that of the Fens, as short and unexpected to
the Enemy, tho' far more difficult to pass. Here they
found a miserable Passage, being forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to march three
or four Days and Nights through nothing but Water,
without any Sleep or Rest, which sorely distress'd his
Men; many of the Beasts were left dead in the Mud,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102323:123"/>
and the Hoofs came off the Horses Feet. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
himself riding upon an Elephant, which was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one left alive, escap'd with his Life, but got intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pains in his Eyes, and lost one of them entirely.
Being at last arriv'd upon dry ground, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Flaminius</hi>'s fiery Temper, the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
him, he pass'd by his Camp, and march'd farther
into the Country, wasting it with Fire and Sword.
This enrag'd <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who thought himself slighted
and despis'd by the Enemy; and when he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by some <hi>To use great Caution, and not rashly pursue,
especially by reason of the Enemies Cavalry, but above all
things to stay for the Conjunction of his Collegue's Forces,</hi>
he cou'd by no means bear their Words; but rising
with all his Troops, he began his March, as if nothing
had been more certain than the Victory, his Army
being follow'd with a greater number of Rabble laden
with Chains, Bonds, and the like, for the Prisoners
and Booty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> was now at a Lake call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which were certain Mountains, and between them
and the Lake was a narrow Passage leading to a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

was done almost before they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Prisoners together, to the number of 15000, kept

the rest to a Hill, where they yielded themselves
Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were now in a great Consternation at
these vast Losses, and upon mature Deliberation,
they found it necessary to have a General with abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority; whereupon they resolv'd upon a
<hi>Dictator,</hi> which was <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> a Person of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Wisdom and Experience,<note place="margin">Dic. lx. U. C. 537.</note> in whom was
a happy Mixture of Caution and Boldness. He made
choice of <hi>Minutius Rufus</hi> for his <hi>Master of the Horse,</hi>
who was of a Temper more hot and violent than
himself. Having made what Preparations he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he set forward to meet <hi>Hannibal,</hi> with little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to fight him, but rather to wait his Motions,
straiten his Quarters, and cut off his Provisions, which
he knew wou'd be the most effectual way to ruin
him, in a Country so far from his own. He always
encamp'd on the highest Grounds, free from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
of the Enemies Cavalry, still keeping pace with
'em; when they march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as not to be forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to engage; by which means he
gave them no Rest, but kept 'em in a continual
Alarum. This cautious way of proceeding, which
got him the Name of <hi>Cunctator,</hi> made Most Men sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
his Courage, except <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself, who was
extreamly troubled and inrag'd at it, using all possible
Artifices to make <hi>Fabius</hi> and his Actions become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable;
sometimes by braving him in his Camp,
and other times by wasting the Country round him.
Soon after, <hi>Hannibal</hi> designing for <hi>Casinum,</hi> was by

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:102323:124"/>

of the Entrance, and with another Party cut
off 800 of his Rear, putting his whole Army into
some disorder. <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding himself block'd up,
and in a dangerous Condition, one Night he ordered
small Fagots and lighted Torches to be ty'd to the
Horns of 2000 Oxen, which by their tossing their
Horns and scattering the Fires, so frighted the Party
that guarded the Entrance, that they quitted their
Posts; and by this Stratagem, <hi>Hannibal</hi> drew off his
Army, and escap'd, tho' with considerable Damage
to his Rear.</p>
                  <p>This Action, tho' excellently well manag'd by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biu's</hi>

Horse,</hi> having skirmish'd with some Success, procur'd
so much Favour from the Multitude, that his Power
was made equal with the <hi>Dictator</hi>'s; which was a
thing beyond all Example. <hi>Minutius</hi> was so exalted
with his late Successes and this new Honour, that
he resolv'd, contrary to all the Perswasions of <hi>Fabius,</hi>
to engage <hi>Hannibal</hi> with his Part of his Army, which
he did; where he was cunningly drawn in by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
to a disadvantageous Place, and was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

had been a careful Observer of this Action from an
Eminence in his Camp, came in, and falling upon the
Enemy with extraordinary Skill and Courage, soon
forc'd 'em to retreat, and sav'd <hi>Minutius. Hannibal,</hi>
after this Battel, told his Friends, <hi>That he thought the

with all the powerful Arguments imaginable advis'd
<hi>Aemilius, To beware of the Policy of</hi> Hannibal, <hi>and the

contrary to <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s Advice, the Enemy being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
40000 Foot and 20000 Horse. This Battel was
fought with dreadful Fury on both sides, and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
had plac'd his Men with all possible Skill and
Art, so that the <hi>Romans</hi> were not only forc'd to fight
with Wind, Dust, and Sun, but pressing forwards,
were in a little time almost surrounded. In short,
the Abilities of the <hi>Punick</hi> General at this time were
more apparent than ever, who more over-match'd
them in Skill than they exceeded him in Numbers,
making a most miserable Slaughter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> till

over. <hi>Aemilius</hi> was found desperately wounded by

'tis said that three Bushels of their Rings were sent to

                  <p>Never was any thing so terrible and dreadful to

City so sadly fill'd with Terrour and Tumult; and
never was a more universal Mourning and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

The Citizens were all in an Uproar and Consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Confusion, being extreamly disturb'd in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates

and had he made the best use of this his last Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by marching directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> he might in all
Probability have put an end to the War and <hi>Roman</hi>
State at once; but this great Soldier, as Maharbal
Captain of his Horse told him, <hi>knew perfectly how to
gain a Victory, but not how to use and improve it.</hi> For
his careless manner of proceeding that Summer, gave
the <hi>Romans</hi> an Opportunity of Recovering themselves
when they were almost reduc'd to a despairing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
And now they were inspir'd with new Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and new Resolutions of prosecuting the War
without Fainting; making all possible Preparations
for another Campaign, arming of several thousands
of Slaves, and filling up the Senate, which wanted

fought, and 12000 <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> kill'd, and many

and <hi>Mago,</hi> all Persons of the highest Quality. <hi>Rome</hi>

and Supplies into <hi>Spain, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
those distant Countries, with the same Care as against
<hi>Hannibal</hi> himself. But what is a greater Instance of

War with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi>

Engines. He also set the <hi>Roman</hi> Ships up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one end, or overturn'd them, or hois'd 'em up into
the Air, and after all the Men were fallen out, let 'em
fall upon the Walls; by which means he became so
formidable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Marcellus</hi> was forc'd to
remove to a farther Distance, Jeering his own Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
and calling <hi>Archimedes, Briareus.</hi> After some
considerable Actions in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and after Three Years
Siege, <hi>Marcellus</hi> found means to surprize the City on
a great Festival of theirs, by reason of an Ill-guarded
Tower, and so became Master of it. <hi>Marcellus</hi> cou'd
not forbear his Tears at the Destruction of such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

but could not prevent; but above all, the Death of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
was the greatest Trouble to him; for he had
given strict Command to his Men to preserve him.
But this great Artist was at that time so extreamly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
about his Mathematical Speculations, that he took
no Notice of the Noise and Uproar in the City, and
so was kill'd by a Common Soldier before he suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any Danger. His Body was honourably bury'd by
<hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Order, and vast Plunder was obtain'd by
the Soldiers, besides many rich Works and great Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

a Disgrace the loss of such a Place as <hi>Capua</hi> wou'd

his March thither. <hi>Hannibal</hi> attack'd the <hi>Romans</hi> in
their Trenches; and tho' he was assisted both by the
Inhabitants and his own Garrison, he was repell'd
with considerable Loss. Finding the Relief of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102323:127"/>
Place extream hazardous, he resolv'd to fall upon
<hi>Rome</hi> it self, expecting that the very Name of such an
Enterprize wou'd oblige 'em to raise the Siege; for
which Reason he March'd directly that way. His
Designs being heard of at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Citizens were
variously inclin'd as to their Way of Security, some
thinking all the Forces in <hi>Italy</hi> were to be sent for;
but <hi>Fabius</hi> wou'd by no means hear of rising from
before <hi>Capua:</hi> therefore a middle Way was taken,
which was, to send for <hi>Fulvius</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi> from the
Siege with 15000 Foot and 1000 Horse for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Rome;</hi> which was speedily effected, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
being now encamp'd about eight Miles from the
City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a short time decamp'd, and advanc'd
to the River <hi>Arno,</hi> three Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence
with a Party of 2000 Horse he went to take a View
of the City. <hi>Flaccus,</hi> much offended that he shou'd
take such Liberty without Opposition, sent out a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Body of Horse, which falling upon him,
forc'd him to retreat. The next Day, and the Day
following, <hi>Hannibal</hi> on one side, and <hi>Flaccus</hi> with
the Consuls on the other, drew out all their Forces
for a General Battel; but on both those Days there
fell such great Storms of Hail and Rain, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

through the Countries of the <hi>Lucani</hi> and <hi>Brutii;</hi> which
Cruelty lost him much Credit, and did him as much
Injury. <hi>Flaccus</hi> return'd to the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> which
soon after was surrender'd, the Heads of the Revolt

City, being situated in so good a Soil, was reserv'd for

<hi>Romans</hi> after suitable Preparations, proclaim'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

<hi>Magnus,</hi> being a very potent Prince, and Master of

the <hi>Aetolians</hi> being left to the Mercy of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
While <hi>Acilius</hi> perform'd these Acts in <hi>Greece,</hi>
his Collegue <hi>Nasica</hi> got a notable Victory over the
<hi>Boian Gauls</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which entirely broke all their
Power, <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius Nepos,</hi> being Consuls
for the following Year, came according to Custom
to divide the Provinces by Lot. Both were extreamly
desirous to have <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> being in great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
offer'd to leave it to the Determination of the
Senate, which <hi>Scipio</hi> was perswaded to assent to by his
Brother <hi>Africanus.</hi> The Matter was wholly new, and
the Senate expected many Speeches and Arguments
on both sides, when <hi>Africanus</hi> standing up, told the
Fathers, <hi>That if they wou'd decree</hi> Greece <hi>for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Province, he himself wou'd be his</hi> Legatus <hi>or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,</hi>
at which there needed no other Argument;
for it was immediately voted with Universal Consent
and Applause, and Power given to <hi>Scipio</hi> to pass into
<hi>Asia,</hi> if he saw it convenient.</p>

                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:102323:133"/>
In the mean time <hi>Antiochus</hi> lay at <hi>Ephesus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi>
secure, as he imagin'd, of the <hi>Romans;</hi> but <hi>Hannibal</hi>
who had advis'd him to invade <hi>Italy,</hi> told him, <hi>He ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Chief City of <hi>Eumenes</hi> the Friend of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
was likewise invested, but the Siege was soon
and <hi>Antiochus</hi> sent to <hi>Aemilius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Admiral,
now on those Coasts, about a Peace, but he disown'd
all Power of concluding it without the Consul. Soon
after, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> defeated his Admiral at Sea, which

and after that in a Fight with <hi>Aemilius, Eumenes</hi> and
the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> he intirely lost the Command at
Sea. <hi>Antiochus</hi> affrighted at this ill Fortune impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
abandon'd <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> which might have kept
the Consul in Action a Year longer; and, adding
one piece of Indiscretion to another, suffer'd the
<hi>Scipio's</hi> to pass the <hi>Hellespont</hi> into <hi>Asia</hi> without Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
This was the first time that the <hi>Romans</hi> got Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to quit all Places in <hi>Europe</hi> and such <hi>Asia</hi> as were
Friends of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pay half the Charges the <hi>Romans</hi>

to part with a Portion of his own Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassadors who carry'd these Proposals, us'd
their utmost Endeavours to procure the Favour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi>
offering him the Restitution of his Son who

Offices of Kindness, modestly letting 'em to
know, <hi>That since</hi> Antiochus <hi>was now in such a declining
state, Peace was not probably to be purchas'd at so easie a
Rate as formerly,</hi> Whereupon <hi>Antiochus</hi> made what
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102323:134"/>
Provision he cou'd for a Battel; and <hi>Africanus</hi> falling
sick soon after, to comfort him, and to gain his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
he sent him his Son without Ransom, upon
which the other, in way of Requital, advis'd him
not to engage with his Brother till he cou'd return to
the Camp. <hi>Antiochus</hi> therefore; having received this
Message, declin'd fighting what he cou'd, till <hi>Scipio</hi>
the Consul press'd so hard upon him nigh <hi>Magnesia,</hi>
that he was forc'd to draw out his Men to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 70000 Foot and 12000 Horse. <hi>Scipio</hi> oppos'd
him with a much less Army, but in a few Hours
time entirely defeated him, where his own Chariots
arm'd with Sithes, being driven back upon his own
Men, contributed much to his Overthrow. <hi>Antioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

now was glad to procure Peace of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon
their own Terms, and Ambassadors were dispatch'd
accordingly, where <hi>Africanus</hi> told 'em, <hi>That the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
were never wont <hi>to insult over their conquer'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and therefore nothing should be requir'd of him more
than formerly.</hi> The Terms were, <hi>To pay 15000 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
of Eubaea for the Expences of the War; to quit all
their Possessions in</hi> Europe, <hi>and likewise all</hi> Asia <hi>on this
side Mount</hi> Taurus; <hi>to deliver up</hi> Hannibal <hi>and other
Incendiaries; and to give 20 Hostages for securing the Peace.</hi>
Thus ended the War with <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, much
to the Advantage of <hi>Rome,</hi> within two Years time or
less, twelve Years after the second <hi>Punick</hi> War, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

which was soon effected by <hi>Manlius Scipio's</hi> Collegue;
and by the same Consul an Expedition was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against the <hi>Gallo Graecians</hi> or <hi>Galatians</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> with

maliciously accus'd of defrauding the Treasury of the
Booty taken in the War and of too nigh a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and of Matters of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Some write that his Accusers were incited to

                  <p>Little was perform'd by the Consuls in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Besieg'd, with Miraculous and Incredible Industry,
cut out a New Passage into the Sea, whereby, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <p>In the Beginning of the next Spring, he took the

and trampled on, and others torn Limb from Limb,
lay mangled in vast Heaps after a sad and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Desperate, set Fire to the Temple, and burnt
themselves with it; whose Example was follow'd by
<hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s Wife, who, in a desperate Fury threw her
self and her two Children into the midst of the Flames.
Then was this Magnificent City laid in Ashes, being
24 Miles in compass, and so large, that the Burning
of it continu'd 17 Days together. The Senate at
<hi>Rome</hi> receiv'd this long expected News with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Joy and Satisfaction, and dispatch'd Men of their
own Order, whom they joyn'd with <hi>Scipio</hi> for the
disposing of the Country. These order'd, that none
of <hi>Carthage</hi> shou'd be left; and that it might never
be Re-built, they denounc'd heavy Curses on any

                  <p>It was now 74 Years since the <hi>Romans</hi> enter'd <hi>Spain</hi>
in a Hostile manner,<note place="margin">U. C. 609.</note> and many and frequent Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
had been made by that People, especially since
the Departure of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> the Elder: At this
time was <hi>Viriatus</hi> up in Arms, who from a Shepherd
became a Robber, and from a Robber a General over
a Numerous Party of such as himself, which created
the <hi>Romans</hi> much Trouble for some time. And <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Scipio</hi> the Younger, after some Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
against him, was, at last, reduc'd to such Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that he was oblig'd to accept of Peace upon
equal Terms, which <hi>Coepio</hi> the following Years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
refus'd to stand to, receiving new Orders from
the Senate to prosecute the War. <hi>Coepio</hi> attempted
to destroy <hi>Viriatus</hi> by Surprize, but he escap'd, and soon
after sending his Ambassadours to Treat of a Peace,
<hi>Coepio</hi> so wrought upon 'em, that they Murder'd him
in his Bed at their Return, to their own Shame, and
the Consul's great Dishonour. But the most difficult
and dangerous part of this War was at <hi>Numantia,</hi> a
Town of no great Bigness, but Peopled with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of extraordinary Valour. Before <hi>Viriatus</hi>'s
Death they had foil'd <hi>Q. Pompeius</hi> the Consul several
times, and likewise his Successor <hi>Mancianus,</hi> who were
constrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but afterwards sufficient Pretences were found to
break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>em, <hi>Mancianus</hi> being deliver'd up bound to
the Enemy. After this <hi>Brutus</hi> defeated many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of the <hi>Lusitanians,</hi> and overthrew the <hi>Gallaecians;</hi>
but <hi>Lepidus</hi> the Pro-Consul was far less successful, for
setting upon the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> a harmless and quiet Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

by 'em.</p>

These Misfortunes so terrify'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers,
that they were ready to tremble at the sight of a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi>
and this oblig'd the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> to chuse
<hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> Consul a second time, as the chief
Hope and Bulwark of their Country. <hi>Scipio</hi> at first
restor'd Discipline, the want of which had been the
Cause of all their former ill Success; but coming to
engage, he found the Courage of the Enemy so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
that he resolv'd to fight no more, but
lay a close Siege to <hi>Numantia,</hi> which he did with all
possible Care and Diligence. At last the Besieged
were so straitned, that they offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Terms, or to Fight if they might have Battel
given 'em, notwithstanding the great Inequality of
their Numbers: But neither of these being allow'd
'em, they all drank strong Liquors purposely to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
themselves, and then fell upon the Besiegers,
with such a desperate Fury, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had all
fled, had any other General but <hi>Scipio</hi> Commanded
'em. The Besieged finding there was no avoiding
being made Prisoners, Fir'd the City over their own
Heads, scarce a Man being left to be led in Triumph.
This Famous City, seated in <hi>Gallaecia,</hi> had for 14
Years together withstood 40000 <hi>Romans</hi> with only
4000 Men, often putting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And that it might be no longer a Trouble to 'em, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>

from their ancient Modesty,<note place="margin">U. C. 621.</note> Plainness, and Severity of
Life; addicting themselves more and more to Pleasure
and Luxury: For the <hi>Asian</hi> Expeditions and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
having brought in Excess and Riot, and the
Ruin of <hi>Carthage</hi> taken away all Fear; Idleness and
Security, as well as Avarice and Ambition, by degrees
stole in upon 'em, and almost a General Corruption
began to mix with the State. For tho' after this time
many a Powerful People were subdu'd, Arts and
Learning daily encreas'd and flourish'd, and Great
Glory was obtain'd abroad, yet it was often stain'd
and fully'd with inglorious Factions, Seditious Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and Contentions at Home, sometimes to the
shedding of one anothers Blood; of which, that of
<hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> was the first Remarkable Instance.
This Person, being the Elder <hi>Africanus</hi>'s Grandson,
and of a stirring and active Spirit, had a share in

                     </gap>ust Oppressions of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
which were now far more notorious than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
And therefore procuring himself to be chosen

                     </gap>00 Acres of the Publick Lands, and
ordering the Overplus to be divided among the Poor.
For it was customary for the <hi>Romans</hi> to divide those
Lands which were taken from their Enemies among
their own Citizens, if Arable; if not, they Farm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'em; they shou'd Pay the Tenth part of the Corn,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102323:141"/>
and the Fifth of other Fruits; but if they did not
Plow them, they paid a certain Rent. But Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
daily increasing in the State, the poor Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were, by degrees, thrust out of their Ancient
Possessions by the great Oppressions and Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Rich, who, by Purchasing, and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
got these Lands all into their own Hands; so
that the Publick, by this Means, was defrauded of its
Revenues, and the Poor of their Livelyhoods.</p>
                  <p>For the Reformation of these Abuses, <hi>Gracchus</hi> took
great care; and whereas the <hi>Lex Licinia</hi> and <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
were formerly Enacted for restraining the Avarice
of the Rich, he strengthen'd the former by adding,
least the Law shou'd be wrested, <hi>That one half shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be given to the Children, and the rest divided among such
Poor as had nothing;</hi> And least any shou'd go about
to enlarge their Portions by Purchase, <hi>Triumviri,</hi> or
Three Men, were Yearly appointed to Judge what
Lands were Publick, and what were Private. These
Matters, tho' at first carry'd on with sufficient Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
extreamly disgusted the Nobility and Richer
sort, who, by Vertue of this Law, were to part with
much of their Estates; and for that Reason they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
insinuated to the People, <hi>That</hi> Gracchus <hi>had
introduc'd this Law with a Design only to disturb the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to put all things into Confusion.</hi> But <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
being a Person of great Abilities and Eloquence,
easily wip'd off those Aspersions, and in a Publick
Speech told the People, <hi>That while the Savage Beasts
and Destroyers of Mankind wanted not their Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and Refuge, those Men who expos'd their Lives for
their Countries were forbidden all Enjoyments but the open
Air and Sun-shine. That their Commanders before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
ridiculously Exhorted 'em</hi> to Fight for their Temples
and Altars, and their Ancestors Seats! <hi>when they had
none of these to defend o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> care for. They had the Honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of gaining large and rich Dominions, but had not the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102323:141"/>
Profit of enjoying the smallest and meanest Possessions: and
likewise had the Honour of being styl'd</hi> Lords of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,
<hi>but had not the Command of one Foot of Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Speech, and some others of his, had great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
upon the common People, who, before, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enough in promoting a Law so very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to themselves; but <hi>Gracchus</hi> meeting with much
Opposition on one side, as well as Encouragement on
the other, began now to proceed with greater Heat
and Violence; and being oppos'd by <hi>Octavius,</hi> one of
his Collegues, he so manag'd him both by Cunning
and Violence, as he was forc'd to quit his Office; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose Place he chose <hi>Mummius,</hi> one of his own
Faction. This Action of his being without all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
much alienated the Minds of many of the
Multitude; and his own Party, who judg'd he us'd
too Great a Freedom with the <hi>Sacrosanct</hi> Office of the
<hi>Tribuneship. Gracchus</hi> perceiving this, first made a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plausible Defence; and the more to ingratiate
himself with the People, he offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

held up his Right-hand in great Passion, crying, <hi>Since

up to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> being accompanied with most of the
Senate, many <hi>Equites,</hi> and some Commoners, arm'd
with Clubs, Staves, and such like Weapons; who
knocking down all that resisted, open'd their Way
into the <hi>Capitol,</hi> where <hi>Gracchus</hi> was speaking to the
People, and endeavouring to be chosen <hi>Tribune</hi> for the
following Year. In which Place they fell upon both
him and his Hearers, of whom they kill'd 300, and
with them, himself with a piece of a Seat, as he was
endeavouring to save himself by Flight. This was the
first Insurrection among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that ended with
Effusion of Blood, since the Abrogation of Kingly
Government; for all former Seditions tho' many of
'em were very great and lasting, were constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

submitting all to the Good of the Publick; for then

                  <p>At this time there were some Risings at <hi>Athens</hi> and
at <hi>Delos,</hi> being as Sparks of that Fire kindled by the

call'd <hi>Caius,</hi> who with <hi>Flaccus,</hi> and <hi>Papirius,</hi> had
been made <hi>Triumvirs</hi> for dividing the Grounds. He
with his Collegues undertook the Patronage of this

Wife and Mother-in-Law, the latter of which was
Mother to the <hi>Gracchi.</hi> Nevertheless, being then in
no favour with the People, little enquiry was made
after his Death, though he was a Person of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Merits, and had been justly esteem'd the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
of the State.</p>
                  <p>The Owners of the Land still made Delays in the
Division, and some believ'd that the Partakers of the
Dividends should likewise have the Freedom of the
City; which, however lik'd of by others, was highly
displeasing to the Senate. While the People were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
discoursing of these Matters, <hi>Caius</hi> obtain'd the
<hi>Tribune-ship,</hi> and bearing a great Enmity to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
he found a fair Opportunity to shew it. He
preferr'd several Laws, among the rest, one for divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the publick Corn to every Man Monthly; in
which Laws he shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d himself rather more stirring
and active, and more dextrous than his Brother. Then
procuring his Office to be continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to him another
Year, he began more strictly to inspect into the late
Corruptions of the Senate; such as their taking Bribes;
their selling of Offices, and such like unjust Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
Whereupon he found Means to transferr the
power of judging corrupt Officers, from the Senators
to the <hi>Equites</hi> or <hi>Knights,</hi> which gave the latter an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Authority, and made a remarkable Change
and Alteration in the whole Government.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Equites</hi> were first instituted by <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Equites.</note> and
though they were originally in the Common-Wealth,
yet they had no particular Authority, Rank or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
till this Law of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> by which it was enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That these Iudgments<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> should be peculiar to them.</hi> So
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102323:143"/>
that whereas at first, there were only two Orders or
Ranks, namely, <hi>Patritian,</hi> and <hi>Plebeian,</hi> which through
the Incroachments of the People, were afterwards
distinguish'd only into <hi>Senatorian</hi> and <hi>Plebeian.</hi> By this
Law, and especially by the Procurement of <hi>Cicero,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the <hi>Equites</hi> became a distinct Order. Thus
now the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens consisted of three Ranks or
Orders, namely, the <hi>Senatorian,</hi> which included all
the <hi>Patritians,</hi> and such of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> as could rise
to be <hi>Senators;</hi> the <hi>Plebeian,</hi> which still continu'd the
same as formerly; and the <hi>Equestrian,</hi> which before
had always been included in the <hi>Plebeian,</hi> and had
been only distinguish'd by their Way of Service.
<hi>Gracchus</hi> took the fairest Opportunity that he cou'd
expect for preferring this Law; for the Senators were
become odious of late, because for Money they had
acquitted <hi>Cotta, Salinator</hi> and <hi>Aquilius;</hi> Persons capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
guilty of Corruption. But the Great Power of
these <hi>Equites</hi> became extreamly burdensome to the
State, till by Degrees, their Authority came to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd.
The <hi>Equites</hi> alone, were wont to Farm the
publick Revenues and Customs from the <hi>Censors,</hi> and
from thence had the Name of <hi>Publicans.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Publican<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the principal of the <hi>Equestrian</hi> Order, the Ornaments
of the City, and the Strength of the State, who made
up so many Companys, as there were Provinces subject

                  <p>
                     <hi>Caius</hi> grew more and more in favour with the
Commons, and was invested with a larger Authority
than ordinary, which he manag'd with extraordinary
Prudence and Cunning, being a Master of much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and many other Accomplishments. And the
more to gratifie the Commons, he took special Care
about the High-ways, making 'em extraordinary
handsom and pleasant, as well as usefull and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
erecting likewise pillars of Stone at the end of
each Mile to signifie the Distances from Place to Place:

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102323:144"/>
endeavoured still more to ingratiate himself with the
People by other new Laws. Particularly, he propos'd
that a Colony of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens might be sent to the
People of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and that all the <hi>Latines</hi> should
enjoy the same Privileges with the Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But the Senate dreading the Effects of <hi>Caius</hi>'s Power,
forbid the <hi>Latines</hi> to come near the City, at such time
as they knew his Laws would be propos'd; and the
better to satisfie and please the People, they gave
Leave to the sending of 12 Colonies. <hi>Caius</hi> thus fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of his Designs, departed into <hi>Africk,</hi> with
<hi>Flaccus</hi> his Collegue, intending to plant a Colony
where <hi>Carthage</hi> stood, calling it <hi>Iunonia;</hi> but there
he also met with a Disappointment, the Bound Marks
of the intended City being continually remov'd in the
Night time by Wolves, as some Authors relate it;
whereupon the <hi>Augurs</hi> and <hi>South-sayers</hi> pronounc'd
the Design unlawful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caius</hi> having been twice <hi>Tribune,</hi> stood for it a

offended at his violent Carriage at this time, procur'd
<hi>Minucius Rufus</hi> to be chosen into his Place, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to abrogate many of his Laws; wherein he was
seconded by <hi>Opimius</hi> the Consul, who was a profest

Revenge. The Senate invested <hi>Opimius</hi> with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Power, and all the <hi>Equites</hi> were order'd
to be in Arms, which forc'd <hi>Caius</hi> and all his Friends to

for a long Defence, in a short time fled into a
Grove beyond <hi>Tiber,</hi> and procur'd his Servant to kill
him, who immediately after kill'd himself, and fell
down dead upon his Master. One <hi>Septimuleius,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
his Head to <hi>Opimius,</hi> and 'tis said, that to make
it weigh the heavier, he took out the Brains and fill'd
the Skull with Lead. <hi>Fulvius</hi> flying to a Friend's
House, was betray'd and slain; and by the Severity
of <hi>Opimius,</hi> no less than 3000 Persons of this Party
were put to Death. Thus fell <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> above
10 Years after his Brother <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> and fix
after he began to act much in the Common-wealth.
These <hi>Gracchi</hi> had so far chang'd the Constitutions of

so broken, particularly by the Disunion of <hi>Patrons</hi>

Notwithstanding, the People were so grateful to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi>
that at his return, being satisfy'd as to his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
they both granted him a Triumph, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd

Honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marius</hi> shew'd himself a very expert Warrior, and
in a short time took the City <hi>Capsa,</hi> a place very rich
and strong; and after this, another call'd <hi>Mulucha.
`fugurth</hi> now finding himself too weak to oppose him
any longer, procur'd <hi>Bocchus,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and
his Father-in-Law, to joyn with him, who, by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance

In another Battel, <hi>Marius,</hi> 'tis said, kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after which <hi>Bocchus</hi> began to repent of his Enterprise,
and sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to enter into a League, which he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102323:148"/>
could not procure; nevertheless he obtain'd Pardon
for his Crime. Not long after <hi>Marius</hi> took <hi>Iugurth</hi>
in an Ambuscade, whither he had drawn him by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pretences, and deliver'd him up to <hi>Sylla</hi> his <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi>
who had brought over some Forces from <hi>Italy;</hi>
and under <hi>Marius</hi> he learnt that Skill in War, which
he afterwards employ'd against him. <hi>Iugurth,</hi> with
his Two Sons, were led in Triumph by <hi>Marius;</hi> and
shortly after, by Order of Senate, he was put to
Death, and so the <hi>Iugurthine</hi> War ended, after it had
continu'd about Seven Years.</p>
                  <p>III. At the same time a War was carry'd on against
the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> a Vagabond People of <hi>Cimbrica Chersonesus,</hi>
now call'd <hi>Denmark,</hi> who, joyning with the <hi>Teutones,</hi>
a Nation of the <hi>Germans,</hi> made dreadful Irruptions

<hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where they had overthrown se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Consuls,</hi> in the last Battel killing 80000 <hi>Romans,</hi>
after which they resolv'd to pass the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy.
Rome</hi> began now to be in a great Consternation, and
<hi>Marius</hi> having just vanquish'd <hi>Iugurtha,</hi>

Manage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so Threatning a War, and to preserve the
State. While they continu'd in <hi>Spain, Marius</hi> March'd
against their Friends the <hi>Tolosans</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> where King
<hi>Copilus</hi> was taken by <hi>Sylla</hi> his Lieutenant. Being made
Consul again the following Year, he declin'd Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till the Enemies Force was weakned by Delays.
The next Year, in his Fourth Consulship, the Enemy,
in Three several Parties were just upon passing the
<hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and as he attended their Motions, it
happened that his Army was extreamly afflicted with
Thirst, the <hi>Teutones</hi> and <hi>Ambrones</hi> lying between them
and the Water, which Necessity brought him to an
Ingagement with 'em; and, in Two Days time, he,
by his excellent Conduct, utterly destroy'd 'em, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

escap'd him, and fled over into <hi>Italy,</hi> notwithstanding
the Winter-Season, and the <hi>Alps</hi> cover'd with Snow,
being in vain oppos'd by <hi>Catulus,</hi> both at the <hi>Alps,</hi> and
at the River <hi>Athesis,</hi> nigh <hi>Verona.</hi> The Year following
<hi>Marius</hi> was again made Consul, and joyning with

Whereupon he fell upon their numerous Army, and
gave 'em a most dreadful Overthrow; their Wives all
the while making a wonderful Resistance from the
Chariots, and when they saw all things in a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Condition, they, in a great Fury, first kill'd all
their Children, and after that themselves. About
140000 were slain in this Battel, and 60000 taken
Prisoners, which ended this War, after it had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
12 Years, <hi>Marius</hi> the Fifth time, and <hi>Aquilius
Nepos</hi> being Consuls: The former was then esteem'd
the Preserver of his Country, and contented himself
with one Triumph, when he might have had more;
and his Collegue had now also finish'd the Second
<hi>Servile</hi> War in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which had lasted almost Four
Years.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these Dangers abroad, the City
was not without Domestick Troubles, which were
occasion'd by <hi>Saturninus,</hi> one of <hi>Marius</hi>'s Friends, who

<hi>Senate</hi> made a Decree, that henceforward the Bodies
of the Slain should be Bury'd where they Dy'd, which,
as a Prudent Example, was likewise follow'd by the
Enemy: After the Death of <hi>Rutilius,</hi> his Army was
committed to <hi>Marius</hi> his Lieutenant, and <hi>Capio,</hi> who
acted in Conjunction with him. <hi>Caepio</hi> was Slain not

This War was ended with a Disturbance in the
City about Usury, and the unexpected Privileges of
the Conquer'd <hi>Italians,</hi> who had the Freedom of the
City given 'em, just as the others had a short time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and so all things were happily quieted.</p>
                  <p>V. But Quiet and Peace was too great a Happiness
for <hi>Rome</hi> at this time,<note place="margin">U. C. 666.</note> for the <hi>Social</hi> War was scarce
finish'd, when Two others broke out, one the Cause
of the other. This first was with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> King
of <hi>Pontus</hi> in <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> a Prince famous for his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Learning, mighty in Riches and Power, of
a boundless Ambition, and a Former of vast Designs.
This King, by several Actions, had gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Ronie,</hi> particularly by procuring <hi>Tigranes</hi> King
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> to Declare against the <hi>Roman State,</hi> and
by his over-running his Neighbours, the <hi>Bithynians,
Phrygians, Mysias, Lycians, Pamphylians,</hi> and other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of <hi>Rome.</hi> And which was more Provoking than
all the rest, he had taken <hi>Q. Oppius,</hi> and <hi>Aquilius,</hi> the
latter of which he kill'd, by pouring Melted Gold
down his Throat, continually upbraiding the <hi>Romans</hi>
with Avarice and Corruption. Upon all these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
the <hi>Romans</hi> Proclaim'd War against him; and
<hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius Rufus</hi> being Consuls, it fell to the
former's share to Undertake it. But <hi>Sylla</hi> having not
yet quite finish'd the <hi>Social</hi> War, <hi>Marius</hi> stirr'd by the
Desire either of Profit or of Honour, perswaded <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picius,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102323:152"/>
Tribune</hi> of the People, of prefer a Law for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Management of this War from <hi>Sylla</hi> to
him. He made what Parties he cou'd, and drew the
People of <hi>Italy</hi> to his Side, who had lately been made
free of the City, by promising em equal Privileges
with those in the 35 <hi>Tribes,</hi> which as yet they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
so that Matters were carry'd on with Violent
Heats and Contentions; and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son, and Son-in-Law
to <hi>Sylla,</hi> was kill'd in the midst of these Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and Disturbances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sylla</hi> hearing of these dangerous Commotions, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the City, easily perswading his Army to stand
by him in all Exigencies; for they were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to have any other go on that Expedition, from
which they promis'd themselves such Great Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
His Collegue <hi>Pompey</hi> joyn'd with him; and tho
<hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Sulpicius</hi> the <hi>Tribune,</hi> made all possible Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
yet, after some Difficulty and Bloodshed, they
enter d the City, and <hi>Marius</hi> with his Accomplices
were forc'd to betake themselves to flight; and thus
began the other War, which was the first Civil War
of any Note among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the Troubles of
the <hi>Gracchi</hi> were the first in which there had been any
Blood-shed of Note. <hi>Sylla</hi> did no Injury to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
in General, but Revers'd all that <hi>Sulpicius</hi> had
done, regulated the <hi>Senate,</hi> procur'd <hi>Marius, Sulpicius,</hi>
and Ten other Leading Men, to be Declar'd open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to their Country, made it Lawful for any
Person to kill them, and set their Goods to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Sale. Shortly after this, he departed upon his
Expedition against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who now had very
much extended his Conquests, even to the subduing
a Great Part of <hi>Greece</hi> it self. <hi>Sulpicius</hi> was in a short
time taken and put to Death; but <hi>Marius</hi> hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Fens of <hi>Minturnum,</hi> where, being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
a <hi>Gaul</hi> was sent to kill him, but he was so dash'd
and amaz'd at the Nobleness of his Presence, that he
cou'd not perform his Order: So that <hi>Marius</hi> being
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102323:152"/>
convey'd out of that Place, escap'd into <hi>Africk,</hi> where
he was joyn'd by <hi>cethegus</hi> and other, who had fled
into <hi>Numidia,</hi> expecting a convenient Opportunity to
Invade their own Country. <hi>Pompeius Rufus</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
to secure <hi>Italy,</hi> was at the same time appointed to
Receive and Command the Army of <hi>Pompeius Strabo,</hi>
who had done great Service in the <hi>Social</hi> War, and
had so far gain'd the Affection of his Men, that they
finding they were like to part with their Old Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
stood up and slew the Counsul himself; so that
now there were great Dangers and Disturbances in
all Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> and <hi>C. Octavius,</hi> were made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
for the following Year: <hi>Cinna,</hi> corrupted, as
some are of Opinion, immediately declar'd himself
for the New Citizens, and recall d <hi>Marius,</hi> with the
rest of the Exiles; which Actions were so violently
oppos'd by his Collegue <hi>Octavius,</hi> that <hi>Cinna</hi> was by
Force, driven from the City, and <hi>Merula</hi> put in his
Place. <hi>Cinna,</hi> upon this, going about to the <hi>Italian</hi>
People, by giving 'em fresh Hopes of equal Privileges
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and pretending, <hi>That all his Troubles
and Sufferings were purely for their Sakes,</hi> obtain'd great
Summs of Money. <hi>Marius</hi> also coming over to him
shortly, they, together, rais'd a Considerable Army,
and <hi>Cinna</hi> March'd directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> and sat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, to the Great Surprize and Terror of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
<hi>Marius</hi> at the same time March'd against
<hi>Ostia,</hi> and took it by Force; but <hi>Cinna</hi> before <hi>Rome,</hi>
finding he was not like to carry the Place, broke
up the Siege, and Invested <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which he soon

the Hill <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> joyning to <hi>Rome;</hi> which again
put the Inhabitants into a Great Consternation, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for that he was soon after joyn'd by <hi>Cinna.</hi> The
Consuls, finding they cou'd not recall <hi>Sylla</hi> from
Countries so far distant, sent to <hi>Metellus,</hi> then lying
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102323:153"/>
with an Army in <hi>Samnium;</hi> but he differing with
them about some Conditions, shortly after join'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with <hi>Marius:</hi> At which time the City was nigh
being betray'd by <hi>Ap. Claudius,</hi> a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the Army,
who was invested with the Command of the <hi>Janicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi>
but tho' He and <hi>Cinna</hi> Broke in, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by <hi>Octavius,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius Strabo</hi> the <hi>Proconsul,</hi>
who was shortly after kill'd with a Thunder-bolt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marius,</hi> after this, took in several. Towns about
<hi>Rome</hi> where Provisions lay, and <hi>Cinna,</hi> by the fair
Promises of Liberty, drew great Numbers of Slaves
out of the City; which the Senate perceiving, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
Ambassadors to <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> desiring
them <hi>to come into the City peaceably, and spare their own
Country-men. Cinna</hi> refus'd to admit of any Address
made to him as a Private Man, so that they were
forc'd to treat with him as <hi>Consul,</hi> and desir'd him
to swear <hi>that he wou'd shed no Blood. Oinna</hi> absolutely
refus'd to take such an Oath; but promis'd, <hi>that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and willingly he wou'd not be the Cause of any Man's
Death: Marius</hi> stood by him, and said nothing, but
gave sufficient Testimony by the Sourness of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and the Sternness of his Looks, that he wou'd
shortly fill the City with Massacres. But the better
to dissemble his Rage, he at last broke Silence, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Ambassadors, <hi>that he was then in Exile, and
banish'd his Country by course of Law; that if his Presence
were necessary, they must repeal the former Act of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
by a new Decree, that he might be received as a
religious Observer of the Laws, and might enter the City
free from Fear or Oppression.</hi> Upon this all Matters were
adjusted, and the Law for banishing <hi>Marius,</hi> and his
Associates, abrogated.</p>
                  <p>Upon their Entrance into the City, great Plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and miserable Slaughters began in all Places.
<hi>Octavius</hi> the Consul, tho' he had the Oath of <hi>Cinna</hi>
and <hi>Marius,</hi> yet refusing to fly from his Charge, was
kill'd, and his Head set upon the <hi>Rostra,</hi> to which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102323:153"/>
was added that of <hi>M. Antonius,</hi> Grand-Father to the
<hi>triumvir</hi> with <hi>Augustus,</hi> an excellent Orator, who
by the Charms of his Eloquence defended himself a
a considerable time against the Rage of the Soldiers,
and several others. Dreadful Tumults and Out-crys
were in all Places; and none were spared either for
the Dignity of their Worths, or their Ages. The
dead Bodies, being barbarously mangl'd, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
abus'd, were left to be torn in Pieces, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by Dogs and Fowls, none daring to bury 'em.
All <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Friends were slaughter'd without Mercy,
his House demolish'd, his Goods set to Sale, and he
himself judged and declared an Enemy to <hi>Rome. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula,</hi>
tho' he never sought the <hi>Consulship,</hi> and <hi>Catullus,</hi>
having their Days set 'em to answer for their Lives,
destroy'd themselves. <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> having thus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
themselves with the blood of others, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Consuls</hi> for the following Year; but <hi>Marius</hi> dy'd
about a Month after, in the 70th. Year of his Age,
within less than two Years after the breaking out of
this Civil War, being a noble Soldier, and a brave
ominander, but much more serviceable to his Country
in the Time of War than in Peace, and the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who had the Honour of the Consulship seven
times.</p>
                  <p>VI. In the Time of these unhappy Troubles at home,
<hi>Sylla</hi> perform'd many noble Exploits against <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
who not long before her Arrival had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one Day 80000, some say 150000 <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Italians</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> to be murder'd in cold Blood. <hi>Sylla</hi>
first over-threw <hi>Archelaus</hi> his General nigh <hi>Athens</hi> so
effectually, that of his 120000 Men scarce 10000
were left; then he gave him another great Defeat,
recover'd <hi>Greece, Maccdonia, Ionia, Asia,</hi> and other
Countries, which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had got into his hands,
and withal took his Fleet from him; insomuch that
<hi>Mithridates</hi> was very willingly to come to a Treaty,
which <hi>Sylla</hi> notwithstanding <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s high Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102323:154"/>
before, was not much averse to, being in want
of Money, and very desirous to return to <hi>Italy,</hi> and
to revenge himself of those who had declar'd him an
Enemy to <hi>Rome.</hi> The principal Articles of the Peace
were <hi>that</hi> Mithridates <hi>shou'd pay the Charges of the War,
and that for the future he shou'd be content with his Fathers
Kingdom;</hi> which were ratified in less than Three Years
after the Beginning of the War. <hi>Sylla</hi> severely fin'd
<hi>Asia</hi> for its Revolt, and fetling Affairs according to
the present Occasion, he return'd for <hi>Italy.</hi> He took
<hi>Athens</hi> in his Way, from whence he carry'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Library of <hi>Apellicon</hi> the <hi>Teian,</hi> in which were
most of the Books of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> then
not vulgarly known. He soon after wrote to the
Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> recounting all his great Services he
had done for the State, and how ungratefully he had
been us'd by <hi>Marius</hi>'s Party, telling them plainly,
<hi>that he was coming to revenge both himself and the Publick,
by punishing the Authors of those Injuries, though the rest he
wou'd spare, whether they were old or new Citizens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Senate extremely dreaded the effects of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s
Return, well knowing it would be fatal to many, and
even to some who had unwillingly join'd with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>;</hi>
therefore they sent to treat with him, offering
all their Endeavours for his Satisfaction, if he would
quickly make known his Demands. And that there
might be the less Blood-shed, they order'd <hi>Cinna</hi> to
discontinue his Levies; but he finding there was no
Way of supporting his Interest, but by Arms, only
return'd 'em a plausible Answer, and proceeded to
raise Soldiers, designing to make himself and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue
<hi>Carbo</hi> Consuls for the following Year that there
might be no Necessity of returning to <hi>Rome</hi> for a new

there to meet <hi>Syll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

back to <hi>Italy</hi> by a Storm, after which they abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refus'd to fight against their own Country-men,
so that all the rest, who as yet had not put to Sea, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102323:154"/>
to go on Board. Hereupon <hi>Cinna</hi> going to speak
with 'em; one of his Officers who made way before
him, struck one of 'em; at which the Soldier struck
him again, and being apprehended for this Crime, a
great Tumult and Mutiny arose among the rest of the
Men, wherein <hi>Cinna</hi> himself was run through; and
<hi>thus</hi> perish'd in his fourth <hi>Consulship,</hi> a Person worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to have dy'd by the Command of the Conqueror,
than by the Fury of the Soldiers. <hi>Carbo</hi> continu'd

Year.</p>
                  <p>

Good, had procur'd War to be decreed against him who had

grue 'em Indemnity, be shou'd not oppose it; yet be thought
all such as came over to him to be far more safe, since he had

declaring his Intentions; he also demanding Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <hi>Italy</hi> now began to feel all the Desolations and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of a Civil War, <hi>Sylla</hi> making great Devastations
on one side, and <hi>Carbo</hi> on the other, who getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rome,</hi> procur'd <hi>Metellus,</hi> and the rest who join'd
with <hi>Sylla,</hi> to be declar'd Enemies to the State. Both
Parties diligently sent up and down to the <hi>Italian</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
labouring by all possible Ways and Methods to
procure Forces; and thus was the rest of the Summer
spent in which time the <hi>Capitol</hi> was burnt down, none
knowing by what means it was done; this hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
430 Years after it was first built. The following
Year, <hi>Carbo</hi> a third Time, and young <hi>Marius,</hi> the Son
of the former, were made Consuls; the latter at 27
Years of Age. In the beginning of the Campaign,
<hi>Carbo</hi>'s Lieutenant <hi>Carinus</hi> was overthrown by <hi>Metellus,</hi>
and <hi>Marius</hi> himself by <hi>Sylla. Marius</hi> was driven into
<hi>Praeneste,</hi> where being closely besieg'd, and almost
despairing of Relief, he in a great Rage wrote to
<hi>Brutus,</hi> then <hi>Praetor</hi> at <hi>Rome, to use some Pretence to call
the Senate, and then to kill the principal of 'em who were
his Enemies;</hi> which Order was executed with great
Cruelty; so that whatsoever Side were Conquerors,
<hi>Rome</hi> was still a miserable Sufferer. <hi>Metellus</hi> having
by this time overthrown <hi>Carbo</hi> once more, and <hi>Pompey</hi>
defeated <hi>Marcius,</hi> another of that Party, <hi>Sylla</hi> march'd
directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> which Place he easily enter'd, great
Numbers of the opposite Faction being fled into the
Country.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> were extremely terrify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Entrance; but he only put the Goods of the
Persons that fled to Sale, wishing the People <hi>not to be
dejected, for he was oblig'd to act as he did.</hi> Then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a sufficient Garrison in the City, he departed to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102323:155"/>
                     <hi>Clusium,</hi> where he and his Officers several times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw-<hi>Carbo</hi>'s Armies. <hi>Carbo,</hi> being now upon the
defensive, sent eight Legions to <hi>Praeneste</hi> to relieve his
Collegue <hi>Marius;</hi> but they were met by <hi>Pompey</hi> in a
narrow
Passage, where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lew many of 'em, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd
the Rest. Soon after, <hi>Carbo</hi> being join'd with
<hi>Norbanus,</hi> engag'd with <hi>Metellus,</hi> and had 10000 of
his Men slain, and 6000 yielded; whereupon great
Numbers went over to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party, which presently
became Masters of all <hi>Gaul</hi> on that side the <hi>Alpes.
Norbanus</hi> fled to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where fearing to be deliver'd
up, he kill'd himself; and <hi>Carbo</hi> fled to <hi>Africk,</hi> tho
he had 30000 Men at <hi>Clusium,</hi> besides other Forces,
all which soon after were broken and dispers'd by
<hi>Pompey.</hi> But <hi>Carinus,</hi> and <hi>Marcius,</hi> with other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
by the Assistance of the <hi>Samnite</hi> Troops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to force the Trenches at <hi>Praeneste,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Marius;</hi> but finding it impracticable, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where meeting with <hi>Sylla,</hi> a most
bloody Battell was sought at the very Gates, in which
many thousands were slain on both sides. But <hi>Sylla</hi> at
last obtain'd the Victory, and <hi>Carinus</hi> and <hi>Marcius</hi>
were taken, and their Heads sent to <hi>Praeneste</hi> to be
shewn to the Inhabitants, at which sorrowful Sight,
they surrender'd to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> kill'd himself,
whose Head was set up in the Pleading-Place at <hi>Rome.</hi>
All his Faction in <hi>Praeneste,</hi> with the Natives and <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
were put to Death without Mercy; only the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
escap'd with their Lives, and this rich City was
plunder'd. <hi>Norba</hi> a little after was taken, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
setting the Town on Fire, all destroy'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
some one way, and some another: So now all
<hi>Italy</hi> came under the Power of <hi>Sylla.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sylla,</hi> having been thus successful against his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at home, sent <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Africk</hi> against <hi>Carbo,</hi>
and gave him Charge to pass from thence into <hi>Sicily</hi>
against others of that Party. <hi>Pompey</hi> in a short time
drove <hi>Carbo</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and thence into <hi>Corcyra,</hi> where

to prosecute them with all sorts of Miseries and Calamities;</hi>
which he did with more Severity than any before him,
killing and butchering many thousands after a most
barbarous and inhumane Manner. Eight Thousand
were put to Death together in the <hi>Villa Publica</hi> a large
House in the <hi>Campus Martius;</hi> Men were slain in the
Embraces of their Wives, Children in the Arms of

these being the first ever known in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein

him to ask the People, that since Affairs were yet

not for any limited Time, but till all publick Evils

to mention himself. This the People were constrain'd
to yield to, he having then all the Power in his

when <hi>Pompey</hi> would not harken to this, he upbraided
him with an unjust Ambition, <hi>Pompey</hi> retorting the
Charge of immoderate Desire of Gain upon <hi>Lucullus.
Lucullus</hi> still gave out Commands in his own Name,

Guards in several Parts of the City, and immediately

what was best to be done in this Time of Danger.
Great Rewards were promis'd to any who shou'd
make any farther Discovery of this black Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the whole City was in a great Consternation,
all in a Hurry, all in a Fear, not knowing whom to

The Senate, being now assembled, <hi>Catiline,</hi> to shew
how well he cou'd dissemble, or to justifie himself, went
boldly thither; but none of the Senators wou'd come
near him, the Place where he sat being wholly void.
Whereupon <hi>Cicero,</hi> either dreading his Presence, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd

invective Speech against him, openly manifesting his
Crimes, which were both numerous and notorious,

with many scurrilous Reflections upon <hi>Cicero;</hi>

the House in a great Rage, breathing out Ruine and

at Night with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made a second Oration to 'em, where he congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the People and Common-Wealth for being freed
from so infamous a Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and encouraged 'em, by
representing the Forces of that Rebel as both small and
inconsiderable. Upon this the Senate judged <hi>Catiline</hi>
an Enemy to the State, and likewise <hi>Manlius</hi> who had
join'd him in <hi>Hetruria, Lentulus</hi> also was depriv'd of
his Office of <hi>Praetor,</hi> by whom the Ambassadors had
been perswaded over, who confess'd that they had

Heat oppos'd him, saying, <hi>That he had never pardon'd

cou'd not easily forgive the Misdemeanors of a turbulent Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

this Affair, made several suspect he himself had some
Hand in the Conspiracy. As for</hi> Catiline <hi>himself, he
was shortly after overtaken by</hi> C. Antonius, Cicero'<hi>s
Collegue, nigh the</hi> Alpes, <hi>as he was passing into</hi> Gaul
<hi>to compleat his Levies; where engaging most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
he was slain, but his Men desperately sought it
out to the last; and scarce any of 'em remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to
be taken, or were found out of their Places when
dead. Thus was this most dangerous Conspiracy
quash'd, chiefly by the Vigilance and Diligence of</hi>
Cicero <hi>the</hi> Consul. <hi>Publick Thanks were given him
for his great Care and Pains; and, at the Instance of</hi>
Cato, <hi>he was first of all others stil'd</hi> Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<hi>and that with loud Acclamations of the People,
who said,</hi> That tho' indeed they were indebted to several
Commanders of that Age, for Riches, Spoils, and Power;
yet it was to <hi>Cicero</hi> alone that they ow'd the Safety and
Security of all these Blessings.</p>
                  <p>V. After these Disturbances were over,<note place="margin">U. C. 692.</note> the Affairs
of <hi>Rome</hi> were in a much more quiet Posture; but
neither <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Defeat nor Death was sufficient to
settle the City in a firm and lasting Peace, but still she
lay expos'd to the sinister Designs which some more
Ambitious Senators than the rest were always form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against her Liberty: Nor cou'd their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that kind meet with Greater Temptations, since
the Gaining of this only City must carry with it so
Great a Part of the World. And now it was that
<hi>Caesar</hi> began to make a Greater Appearance in <hi>Rome</hi>
than ever, being this Year made <hi>Praetor.</hi> He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gone through the two Offices of <hi>Questor</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi>
in the latter of which, by his Magnificence in
Shews and Buildings, he had acquitted himself with
much Reputation, having also the Advantage of being
descended from one of the most Illustrious Families
in <hi>Rome.</hi> He afterwards stood for the <hi>High-Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
and, by his Great Liberality, carry'd it from two
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102323:168"/>
of the most Powerful Men in <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Seniors;
and scarce any Man in the City was more Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
either for the Freeness of his Presents, or the
Largeness of his Bribes. He was now also arriv'd to
a very high degree in Learning, as well as an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Skill in Eloquence, having already disputed the
Prize with the most famous Orators, and scarce anything
appear'd impossible for his Great <hi>Genius</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
Little was perform'd by him during this
Time of his <hi>Praetorship,</hi> besides composing some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances
occasion'd by one <hi>Clodius,</hi> a young Man of
a Noble Family, but of a Scandalous Life, who being
in Love with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wife <hi>Pompeia,</hi> had, in a Woman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
Habit enter'd his House in the time of a particular Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival,
when only. Women were permitted to be
present. This brought <hi>Clodius</hi> into much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Danger, for Prophaning those Sacred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and caus'd <hi>Caesar</hi> to put away his Wife
privately; who, being Ask'd the Reason, said, <hi>He
did not believe her Guilty, but</hi> Caesar's <hi>Wife ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her self from the Suspicion, as well as the Guilt of
the Crime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Violent Heats, and the Parties, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Divisions, upon this and other Occasions,
sufficiently shew'd, that the State was ready for a
Change, and liable to become a Prey to Men of the
Greatest Power and Ambition. This <hi>Caesar</hi> well knew,
and thought of nothing so much as the Greatness of
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and of surpassing, or at least equalizing him
in the Honour of his Exploits. Therefore upon the
expiring of his <hi>Praetorship,</hi> he procur'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Spain;</hi> but having contracted extraordinary
Debts by his too Bountiful Way of Living, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded
in his Journey by the Prosecution of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.
Whereupon he was forc'd to apply himself to
<hi>Crassus,</hi> a Person of vast Riches, of Great Wit and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
and of no contemptible Valour; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102323:169"/>
wrought upon by the Importunities of his Wife
<hi>Tertulla,</hi> one who no less Lov'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> than <hi>Clodius</hi>
did <hi>Pompeia,</hi> became Security for 830 Talents. It was
in this Government that <hi>Caesar</hi> viewing the Statue of
<hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Gades,</hi> Wept, to think, <hi>That he had done
none nothing Great and Memorable, at an Age wherein
that Prince had Conquer'd the World.</hi> And he gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sufficient Marks of his Bravery and Desire of
Glory; for instead of spending his Time in bare
Administration of Justice, he pierc'd with his
Arms farther into the Country, subduing seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Nations before untouch'd, and collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so vast a Treasure to himself, in the Name of
the Common-Wealth, as enabled him afterwards
to imitate that <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he so justly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Departure for <hi>Spain, Pompey,</hi>
after a Five Years Expedition, return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Glories for his mighty Exploits, and Great
Conquests: He had, upon his Arrival in <hi>Italy,</hi> sent
back his Troops, to prevent such Suspicions as might
arise from his appearing at the Head of an Army, so
that he obtain'd the Honour of Triumph with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Applause; and with so much more Splendor and
Magnificence, in regard that he now Triumph'd over
another Third Part of the World, after his receiving
the same Honour for the Conquest of Two Part of
it before. The Triumph lasted Two Days, and yet
they were much streightned for time, and therein were
expos'd the Names of 15 Conquer'd Kingdoms, and
860 Cities, with the Re-peopling of 39, and 1000
Castles. Among the Prisoners led in Triumph, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

Triumph, and went to <hi>Rome</hi> and stood for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship,</hi>
which Honour he very eagerly pursu'd. And
well understanding <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Credit, and his Quarrel
to the Senate, this he thought a fit Conjucture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself into his Interests. <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other
side was no less pleas'd to gain a Man of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Merit, especially when <hi>Caesar</hi> promis'd
him to confirm all his Acts, if he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be elected, whereupon a close Agreement was
made between 'em. After this, <hi>Caesar</hi> made it his
Business to bring his Friend <hi>Crassus</hi> into the League,
who finding his own Interest was weak separately,
was easily perswaded to joyn with 'em, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

These three made a firm Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Conspiracy, <hi>That nothing shou'd be done in
the Common-wealth against any of their Interests, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations,</hi>
which they most solemnly confirm'd with
mutual Oaths and Promises. This was the first Great
<hi>Triumvirate,</hi> which prov'd the Overthrow of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suler</hi>
and <hi>Popular</hi> State, being a Combination of three
of the Greatest Men in <hi>Rome,</hi> either for Valour, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

                  <p>Thus <hi>Rome</hi> lost her Liberty, after she had flourish'd

the Extent and Fruitfulness of its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Strength and Power of its Arms,
the Fame and Valour of its Commanders, the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and Largeness of its Revenues, the Compass

and Magnificence of its City, and the Numbers and
Riches, as well as Learning and Politeness of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;
but still it wanted considerably of that
Glory and Grandeur, as to Dominions, and much
more of that Quiet and Sereneness as to Settlement,
it had not long after in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Reign. For now
the State was full of Factions and Divisions, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Corruptions, and likewise Feuds and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
since the joyning of three such potent Men, as
<hi>Caesar, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> which caus'd many to fear
the Downfall of their Ancient Liberties; and that
their Fears were not groundless, sufficiently appear'd
by the Event. The first Effect of this <hi>Triumvirate</hi>
was the Promoting of <hi>Caesar</hi> to the <hi>Consulship, Pompey</hi>
and <hi>Crassus</hi> employing all their Interest therein: He
had two Competitors, <hi>Lucerius</hi> and <hi>Bibulus;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

large Promises, and Brib'd to procure what Voices he

one of the Consuls, made Great Collections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, and gave as much on their side. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Cato</hi> as rigid as he was, was perswaded that the Law
which forbad all manner of Bribery on these Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ought, in such a case, to be dispenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Interest of the Common-wealth so much requir'd
it; so by that means <hi>Bibulus</hi> was at last chosen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul

all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Acts, according to Agreement, and
from that time he wholly apply'd himself to Gain the
Favour of the Commons: And the better to effect it,
he preferr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

among such of the poor Citizens as had three
Children or more. This Proposal much pleas'd the
Commons, and <hi>Caesar</hi> had taken the most proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to make it pass; for the Law was drawn up
in Terms so very just and reasonable, that no Man
cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>That he wou'd do nothing without their Authority, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any of his Friends for Commissioners, or any Man who
might be liable to Suspicion; but that they shou'd be all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of known Reputation and Abilities.</hi> This plausible and
cautious Way of proceeding hardly left any room for
Contradiction; but still the Senate, that they might
hinder the Law, and yet not seem to oppose it, adjourn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
the Affair from Day to Day: till at last <hi>Cato</hi> plainly
and publickly declar'd, <hi>That these Changes in State were
not to be permitted;</hi> after whom all the Senate likewise
declared themselves to be of the same Opinion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Caesar</hi> immediately had recourse to the People,
much complaining to them of the Injustice and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
of the Senate, taking also <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi>
along with him, whose Opinions he publickly ask'd
concerning this Law. They both approv'd of it; and
<hi>Pompey</hi> further declar'd, <hi>That if such as oppos'd it shou'd
come with their Swords in their Hands, he wou'd meet their
Swords, and bring a Buckler with him besides:</hi> Whereupon
a Day was appointed for the Publication of this Law.</p>
                  <p>At the appointed Day, the People gather'd together
in great Numbers, and in spight of all Opposition, drove
<hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Bibulus</hi> himself with Stones and Clubs from
off the Place; the <hi>Consuls</hi> Axes were broken in pieces,
and the People approving the Ordinance, declar'd they
wou'd have all the Senators swear to the Observation
of it. Almost all took this Oath, except <hi>Cato, Metellus</hi>
and <hi>Favonius,</hi> and they too, at last, after much Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
took it, to save their Fines, and likewise their
Lives: for <hi>Caesar</hi> had caus'd the People to make it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
for any one to refuse it. <hi>Caesar</hi> made little use of
the Senate after that, and from that time his Collegue
<hi>Bibulus</hi> never durst appear in Publick, but kept himself
at home for the remaining part of the Year. This force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
way of proceeding extremely alarm'd the Senate,
every Body laughing at their Idleness and Negligence;
and at the Head of those Acts, where the Names of
the Consuls us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to be inscrib'd, some unknown Person,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102323:173"/>
instead of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Bibulus,</hi> Wrote <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> to shew that <hi>Caesar</hi> Govern'd alone. <hi>Caesar</hi>
having freed himself from his Collegue, began chiefly
to apply himself to the <hi>Equites</hi> or <hi>Knights,</hi> who much
courted him; and having Farm'd the Customs, desir'd
an Abatement of the Rent. The Senate refus'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any thing, but he shortly after procur'd the People
to abate a third Part. By this and other Ways of
gratifying the Common sort, he perswaded 'em to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
the Province of <hi>Gaul</hi> to him for Five Years, with
Four Legions, for he desir'd nothing so much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Great Exploits; and the remaining part of the
Year he spent in endeavouring to establish his Interest
for the time to come. Therefore knowing how conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Person <hi>Pompey</hi> was, to bind him the more
strongly, he gave him his Daughter <hi>Iulia</hi> in Marriage, a
very vertuous and beautiful Lady. He likewise took
care that his two Friends, <hi>Gabinius</hi> and <hi>Piso,</hi> shou'd be
prick'd for the following Year's <hi>Consuls;</hi> the latter of
which had lately given him his Daughter <hi>Calpurnia.
Clodius</hi> he procur'd to be one of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his former Affront, because he knew him to
be an Enemy to <hi>Cicero,</hi> whose Oration against <hi>Caesar,</hi> in
pleading for <hi>C. Antonius,</hi> had gain'd him the Hatred of
the <hi>Triumvirate.</hi> And having setled Affairs thus, and
finish'd his <hi>Consulship,</hi> he departed for <hi>Gaul,</hi> with some
Precipitation, in regard he was threatn'd to be call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to Account for his Conduct in his <hi>Consulship;</hi> and tho'
some of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> prevented his publick Censure,
they cou'd not secure his <hi>Quaestor</hi> from Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Caesar</hi>'s absence, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> were not idle,
and the former had fill'd the City with Soldiers; and
since both the Consuls were of that Party, the Senate's
Authority was much weakn'd. But <hi>Clodius</hi> bestirr'd
himself more than any; a Man so ambitious of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bureship,</hi>
that he procur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d himself to be adopted by a
<hi>Plebeian,</hi> because he was uncapable of holding of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Cicero</hi> immediately perceiv'd that his Ruin was
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102323:173"/>
aim'd at; and his chiefest Hope was in <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had
always shown himself his Friend; but <hi>Pompey</hi> had now
sacrific'd all to the Interests of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> and
had lately been extreamly offended with <hi>Cicero</hi> for his
eternal Itch he had to be Jesting. <hi>Pompey</hi> nevertheless
assur'd him of his Protection, and <hi>Caesar</hi> had offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to
make him his Lieutenant in his <hi>Gallick</hi> Expedition, to
which Imployment he had a strong Inclination; but
<hi>Pompey</hi> advis'd him not to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Clodius</hi> found
some Artifice to delude him with false Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
that he might be confounded and born

became altogether unserviceable to him now, and he
cou'd find no Way to avoid the Blow when it came.
<hi>Clodius,</hi> by his Distributions of Com among the
Poor, daily grew higher in the Favour of the People,
and afterwards preferr'd a Law to forbid Water and
Fire to any who had put to Death any <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen
unheard, which amounted to as much as Banishment.</p>
                  <p>Now all Persons saw the Danger which threatned
<hi>Cicero;</hi> all his former Constancy forsook him, and he
went up and down the City, soliciting his Cause, in
Mourning Robes, long Beard, and unregarded Hair,
attended by 20000 <hi>Equites,</hi> supplicating in his behalf;
besides many young Noblemen, whom he had taught
the Rules of Eloquence, among which were the very
Sons of <hi>Crassus.</hi> But <hi>Clodius</hi> still follow'd with a Party
of Soldiers, insulting and jearing him with the Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

but <hi>Gabinius</hi> immediately condemn'd what <hi>Cicero</hi>
had done as to <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conspiracy. <hi>Cicero</hi>'s last Retreat
was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Favour who was able enough to have
done him Service, but he wou'd have nothing to do in
the Matter; and when <hi>Cicero</hi> came to preferr his Cause
to him, he slipt out at a Back-door to avoid seeing him.
He found himself now reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of taking up Arms for his Defence, which he might
have done successfully enough; but not being able to
bear the Bloodshed of his Country-men, he resolv'd,
upon the Advice of <hi>Cato</hi> and the rest of his Friends,
to withdraw himself: So he left <hi>Rome</hi> in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and went to <hi>Sicily.</hi> After his Retreat, <hi>Clodius</hi>
caus'd him to be banish'd by the Votes of the People
400 Miles from <hi>Italy,</hi> demolishing his Villages and his
House, on the Plot whereof he built a Temple to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
and set his Goods to Sale. <hi>Cato</hi> was shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by <hi>Clodius</hi>'s Means sent away, under Pretence of
doing him Honour, against <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus;
Lucullus</hi> had retir'd himself from the City, and <hi>Crassus</hi>
minded only his private Affairs; So that now the

was extraordinary busie and diligent in his Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which he propos'd vast Ends and Advantages
to himself, having not only <hi>Cisalpine Gaul</hi> allotted him,
but the other also, which comprehended all that Space

of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and some of <hi>Germany.</hi> His first

abandon'd their Country, burnt down their Towns and

into <hi>Gaul</hi> through his Province, to the number of above
300000 of all sorts. <hi>Caesar</hi> upon Intelligence of this, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and broke down the Bridge there; which
caus'd 'em to send to him, and desire to pass that way

all his Troops together, in which Space he threw up
a large Intrenchment from the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to
Mount <hi>Iura,</hi> 19 Miles long, which forc'd 'em to turn
aside, and enter <hi>Gaul</hi> by the Way of <hi>Sequania. Caesar</hi>
follow'd 'em with great Diligence, and defeating a
considerable Party of 'em, they sent a second time to
desire a Treaty; but that breaking off, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of great Demands on both Sides, 4000 of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Cavalry were repuls'd by pressing too forward
upon 'em. But they dearly paid for this Advantage,
for <hi>Caesar,</hi> after observing their Motions a-while, easily
drew 'em to a general Battel, wherein they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
defeated, and not above 110000 remain'd of their
whole Number, their Wives and Children desperately
fighting among the Carriages till they were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Caesar</hi> crown'd his Victory with a more glorious
Action, by gathering all who had escap'd, and sending
of 'em all in safety into their own Countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> resolving not to continue without Action
while the Season permitted, immediately turn'd his
Forces against <hi>Ariovistus,</hi> King of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who
had seiz'd on the best Part of <hi>Sequania,</hi> and used the
Inhabitants with intolerable Severities and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
The <hi>Sequanians</hi> being <hi>Roman</hi> Allies, humbly

and Valour, who first sent to <hi>Ariovistus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Success, and at last came to a personal Enterview,
where <hi>Ariovistus</hi>'s haughty Language, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of some of his Troops, brought both Armies to
a Battel shortly after. Upon the nigh Approach of
<hi>Caesar, Ariovistus,</hi> was much dishearten'd; for seeing
the <hi>Romans</hi> come fearlesly to engage the <hi>Germans,</hi> whom
he imagen'd they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unexpected a thing, that he admir'd at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and found his own Army seiz'd with a kind
of Consternation. But what added most to their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102323:175"/>
Fears, was a superstitious Fancy rais'd by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs;
which when <hi>Caesar</hi> understood, he immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
'em even in their Trenches, and upon the Hill
where they were posted, till he so provok'd 'em, that
they came down with great Fury to the Engagement.
But they were all put to the Rout, and he closely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'em for several Miles together, as far as the River
<hi>Rhine,</hi> covering all the way with Spoils and dead Bodies,
to the number of 80000, as some relate it. <hi>Ariovistus</hi>
himself escap'd in a little Boat with a small Retinue,
two of his Wives and as many Daughters being taken
Prisoners by <hi>Caesars.</hi> These two great Wars were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd

                     </gap>s Expedition, which
he manag'd with extraordinary Skill and Dexterity.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the next Spring, <hi>Caesar</hi> was alarm'd
by a great Confederacy against the <hi>Romans</hi> of all the
<hi>Belgae,</hi> who inhabited a third Part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and were
esteem'd the most powerfull People in the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
He hearing that they had rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>em with all Speed; and
bravely attacking 'em, just as they were plundering his
Allies, the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he defeated and put to slight a mighty
Number of em; insomuch that the Marshes and deep
Rivers became passable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Number of the Dead Bodies, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates
it. But among Several Reveral Revolters, all that liv'd
nigh the Ocean, yielded without Fighting; Wherefore
he led his Army against the <hi>Nervians,</hi> the most savage
and war-like People in those Parts. These inhabited a
thick woody Country, where bestowing their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and all their Goods, in some close and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Place in their Forest, they set upon <hi>Caesar</hi> with 60000
Men, before he thought of engaging, or had time to
encamp himself. They fell on with such uncommon
Fury, that they broke the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, then sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding

catch'd up a Buckler and rush'd through his Men into
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102323:175"/>
the midst of the Enemy, and his tenth Legion run in
to his Assistance and broke the Enemies Ranks, they
had all been cut off. But tho' by the Encouragement
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s extraordinary Valour, they fought beyond
their Strength, yet all they cou'd do was not sufficient
to make the <hi>Nervians,</hi> fly, who obstinately stood their
Ground till they were all cut in pieces, not in
of 'em being sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Renown of his Victories made him
formidable even in <hi>Germany,</hi> so that several Nations,
beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> sent and submitted themselves to him.</p>
                  <p>Upon the News of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s last Exploits at <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Senate decreed a solemn Festival for 15 Days,
which was a greater Honour than any had received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. Not long before which, violent Stirs and

account of <hi>Clodius,</hi> who, after he had freed himself
from his Enemies, began to prove an intolerable Plague
and Vexation to many of the Nobility; and even to
<hi>Pompey</hi> himself; so that now he found it very much
for his Interest to get <hi>Cicero</hi> reall'd from his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whereupon he employ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Milo</hi> and his Collegue <hi>Sextius Clodius,</hi> assisted by
a Party of Gladiators, suddenly set upon the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
raising the greatest Disorders imaginable: Many
of the People were kill'd, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were wounded,
and <hi>Quintus, Cicero</hi>'s Brother, was almost overwhelm'd
with Dead Bodies, and the rest all fled. After a day
or two, <hi>Milo</hi> seiz'd upon <hi>Clodius,</hi> and carry'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Praetor:</hi> Whereupon a great Contest arose, and
<hi>Clodius</hi>'s Party by the Assistance of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

Consent and Applause voted <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
The Senate likewise decreed Honours to such
Cities as had entertain'd him, and that his House and
Villages shou'd be re-built at the Publick Charge. So
<hi>Cicero,</hi> after 16 Months Banishment, return'd in great
Pomp and Glory, sufficiently revenging himself upon
<hi>Piso, Gabinius</hi> and others, by his Writings afterwards.
He return'd in the second Year of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wars in

                  <p>The following Year, <hi>Caesar</hi> designing for <hi>Italy</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

in <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 698.</note> so his Humanity, and other excellent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
absolutely gain'd him the Hearts and Affections of
his Soldiers. He had now got great store of Wealth,
by which he not only discharg'd his Debts, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
made many great Friends by his Magnificent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,

present together, and so many <hi>Praetors</hi> and <hi>Pro-consuls,</hi>
that 120 Bundles of Rods were seen there at a time.
Here the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> took new Measures, and <hi>Caesar</hi>

the Senate and the Dissentions so violent concerning
it, that they went into Mourning as in publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
saying, <hi>That the Proceedings of the Triumvirate
were dangerous to the Quiet and Liberty of Rome. Cato</hi>
with great Eagerness set up <hi>Domitius</hi> to stand against

few but <hi>Caesar</hi> wou'd have ventur'd upon it. His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was the <hi>Britains</hi> sending continual Supplies into
<hi>Gaul</hi> against the <hi>Romans;</hi> and in order to his Design,
he made strict Enquiries of the Merchants that Traded
thither, what kind of People they were, how they
made War, under what Laws they liv'd, and which
were their best Ports. After which he sent <hi>Voluseus</hi> to
view the Coasts, in the mean time sending for the
Ships he had employ'd against the <hi>Veneti,</hi> and making
all other necessary Preparations. Upon the News of
which, several of the <hi>British</hi> People sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
with Tokens of Submission, whom he sent back
with good Words, and with them <hi>Cornio,</hi> the better to
discover the Country under that Pretence. But <hi>Cornio,</hi>
not daring to trust the Inhabitants, continu'd but five
Days upon the Coast, and then return'd to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of what he had discover'd. <hi>Caesar</hi> leaving all things
in <hi>Gaul</hi> in a peaceable Posture, and <hi>Sulpicius Rufus</hi> to
guard the Ports, put to Sea with two Legions and part
of his Cavalry after Mid-night, and made the <hi>British</hi>
Coasts the next Morning, where he found the Shores
cover'd with Men to oppose his Landing; and finding
it impracticable there, he fail'd eight Miles further.

Expedition, in the 701st Year of the City.</p>
                  <p>IV.<note place="margin">U. C. 700.</note> During these great Actions in <hi>Gaul Pompey</hi> and
<hi>Crassus,</hi> upon the expiring of the Time of their <hi>Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,</hi>
began to take care about their several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that were allotted 'em. <hi>Crassus</hi> was extremely
elevated with the Thoughts of his Expedition into <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
and <hi>Parthia,</hi> promising himself greater Success and
Glory that even <hi>Pompey</hi> himself: Therefore he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
forward and diligent in his Preparations. The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
hinder'd the raising of Men as much as they cou'd,
and labour'd to repeal the Laws made for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions.
<hi>Pompey,</hi> was well enough satisfy'd sending
his Lieutenants into his Provinces, being unwilling to
leave the City, as he pretended, because of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Charge of Provisions committed to him; an
Honour which <hi>Cicero,</hi> in Recompence for his Ressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
had procur'd him from the Senate, that so he
might have Authority all over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.
But <hi>Crassus</hi> betook himself to Force; which when the
<hi>Tribunes</hi> saw themselves unable to withstand, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
but loaded him with horrible and unheard-of
Curses and Imprecations; and many exclaim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

it as an unworthy Thing to injure the <hi>Parthians</hi> who
deserv'd no Ill at the <hi>Romans</hi> Hands, but were now
in Peace with 'em. But <hi>Crassus</hi> heeding no Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in this case, after he had got all things in a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
set forward to his Province.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> the mean time kept himself wholly to the
City, still contriving how to make himself more great
and powerfull in his Country: But the Fame of <hi>Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
Conquests, which daily fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

prove very ungratefull to him, who feared nothing so
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102323:179"/>
much as a Rival in point of Glory; and therefore he
set himself to do all that was in his power to diminish
the Reputation of <hi>Caesar,</hi> obliging the Magistrates not
to publish any Letters they receiv'd, till he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd
the Credit of 'em, by spreading selfe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous
Reports. This gave great cause of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to many discreet and wise Persons, who foresaw
the Miseries that wou'd follow from a Rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two such Extraordinary Persons; and what still
augmented their Fears was the Death of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Wife
<hi>Iulia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which hapned at the same
time. <hi>Pompey</hi> most passionately lov'd her, and her Wit
and Vertue had always a great Ascendant over the
Dispositions both of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> The people of
<hi>Rome</hi> gave sufficient Testimony of the Respect they
bore her by publick Demonstrations of their Sorrow;
and when <hi>Pompey</hi> wou'd have carry'd her Body to one
of his Houses nigh <hi>Alba,</hi> the people wou'd not suffer
it, but bore it into the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> where they bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
it with the greatest Magnificence imaginable.
From this Moment <hi>Pompey</hi> resolv'd to pursue nothing
but his own particular Advancement; and, for the
restoring himself to the Favour of the People, he caus'd
a stately Theatre to be built which he dedicated by
Plays and other magnificent Shews, which were no
ways pleasing to <hi>Cicero,</hi> as appears from one of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Pompey</hi> was managing his Affairs at home,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> in the midst of <hi>Gaul, Crassus</hi> was pursuing

Disturbances and Dissentions were rais'd
in the City, Factions daily encreasing, nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
with the ancient Equity and Moderation, and
all Offices purchas'd with Bribes and Money, or else
gain'd by Swords and Clubs. The Consuls, finding
themselves debarr'd by the Power of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi>
from waging War and leading Armies as formerly,
made it their sole Business to enrich themselves out of
the Publick Revenues, or from the Bribes as well as
the Sallaries depending upon their Offices. <hi>Pompey</hi>
conniv'd at all this, hoping that the Infirmities of the
State wou'd occasion him to be created <hi>Dictator;</hi> and
for that reason he retir'd himself for a while, that his
Friends might have a fair Opportunity of insinuating
the Necessity of his Presence, as well as Authority,
for the preserving of the Peace of the City. At the
time for the new Election of Magistrates, there was
such a violent Contention among the Candidates that
for Eight entire Months none cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what still heighten'd these Mischiefs was the Death of

the Multitude, who immediately ran furiously to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>'s
House to set it on Fire; but he being well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to receive 'em, repuls'd and kill'd several of the
Assailants. Upon which they return'd to the Body,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102323:181"/>
where they pull'd all the Magistrates Seats in pieces,
made a Funeral Pile of 'em, and set Fire to it with
so much Rage, that all the stately Building where the
Senate us'd to Assemble, was burnt with <hi>Clodius</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
After this the Mutineers dispers'd themselves all
over the City, where, under pretence of searching for
<hi>Milo</hi>'s Friends, they committed the most insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Violences imaginable; so that the whole City was
fill'd with Murthers and Quarrels, till no Body durst
walk the Streets unarm'd.</p>
                  <p>These fatal Mischiefs turn'd all Mens Eyes upon
<hi>Pompey,</hi> as the fittest Person to redress all; but while
they were consulting about creating him <hi>Dictator, Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by many Perswasions, procur'd the Senate to make
him <hi>Consul</hi> alone, that so, if occasion were, he might
be afterwards accountable for any Male Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This was soon after done, having the Authority
of a <hi>Dictator</hi> conferr'd on him under a Gentler Name;
a thing never known in <hi>Rome</hi> before, but upon some
extraordinary Occasion, and for some few Days, when

surrounded him as he was Pleading, he was put out
in his Speech; and so <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>That it was happy for him that</hi> Cicero <hi>was out in
his Harangue, for otherwise he shou'd not have liv'd so well
at</hi> Marseilles <hi>as now be did;</hi> for that was the Place of
his Exile. <hi>Pompey</hi> having hitherto executed the Office
of a <hi>Dictator,</hi> took <hi>Scipio Metellus</hi> for his Collegue, whose
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102323:181"/>
Daughter <hi>Cornelia</hi> he had lately Marry'd, a Lady of no
less Accomplishments than Beauty. This considerably
strengthen'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Interests, who therefore now
thought it no ways difficult to overthrow the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> waiting only till Affairs were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more ripe for Execution: But <hi>Caesar,</hi> by his
Great Policy and Inudstry, by his noble Exploits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and his bountiful Presents at home, still se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
himself a sufficient Party in the City. He caus'd
a New <hi>Forum</hi> to be set up at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Place whereof
cost him 100000 Sesterces: He gave also to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
certain Plays, and a Publick Feast, in Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the Honours done to his Daughter <hi>Iulia,</hi>
being likewise a particular Incourager of Learning. At

all necessary Provisions for a Siege. <hi>Caesar,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Hazzard of such an Attempt, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Works he rais'd against this Place, both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

the great Numbers of the Succours that were March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his mighty Lines of Contravallation, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Management and Vigilance, he repuls'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and soon after he became Master of the Town,
to his Great Honour and Reputation, all other Places
submitting without delay. And thus ended <hi>Caesar</hi>'s se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Year's Expedition in these Parts, which, as it
was the most hazardous and dangerous, so it was the
most honourable and glorious that ever he undertook.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gauls,</hi> notwithstanding their Great Losses, and
the irresistible Power of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Arms, resolv'd to try
their Fortune once more, and many of their Nations

of their Designs, began his March from <hi>Bibracte,</hi> and
made great Devastations throughout the Territories of

in such a Manner, that they prov'd very useful

all the Parts thereabouts, after a long, and almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interupted
Course of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Glorious Conquests and

Honour and Renown, and the great Inlargement of

of their Name and Authority.</p>
                  <p>II. Now the Jealousies between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi>
began to be more conspicuous than ever, and well
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102323:182"/>
might a Rupture be expected, when two Persons, the
Greatest that ever <hi>Rome</hi> produc'd, were become Rivals
in Glory; especially when their Tempers were such,
that the latter cou'd not endure an Equal, nor the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
a Superiour. <hi>Caesar</hi> had now rais'd himself to an

then the Grandeur of his Mein, his unbounded
Generosity, and his Noble Actions, had entirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd

was a Refuge to all manner of Criminals, and such
as were much in Debt, a great many of which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
at his own Expence; but for some whose Debts
were larger than ordinary, he us'd to say, <hi>That one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War would make all even.</hi> All this was done at <hi>Gaul's</hi>
Expence, which might occasion this Observation, <hi>That</hi>
Caesar <hi>Conquer'd the</hi> Gauls <hi>with the</hi> Romans <hi>Steel, and the</hi>
Romans <hi>with the</hi> Gallick <hi>Gold. Pompey</hi> had observ'd, that
<hi>Caesar</hi> in his <hi>Consulship</hi> had rendred himself very distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Senate, therefore he made it his Business by
his outward Carriage and fair Demeanor to gain their
Favour, which he did with good success. <hi>Caesar</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of this, and for that reason endeavour'd vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

hinder'd by <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> one of the present
Consuls and his Great Enemy. Tho he was sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Jealousy, he resolv'd to endeavour

of an Alliance with <hi>Scipio,</hi> whom he joyn'd with him
in the Consular Dignity for the last Five Months.</p>
                  <p>The first Publick Appearance of the Division began
from <hi>Pompey</hi>'s two Laws, publish'd in his Consulship,
the first being <hi>to enquire into the Miscarriages of Officers

which were design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Violence was us'd, but all was manag'd with extream
Artifice and Cunning till the Election of the New
Consuls, who were <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> and <hi>Calidius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>

but <hi>Calidius</hi> was <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Enemy, and being carry'd on

                     <hi>Curio</hi> resolving not to be discourag'd, made the same
Proposal to the People as he had done to the Senate,
which was receiv'd with the greatest Applause imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and as a further Testimony of their Satisfaction,
they gave Power to <hi>Caesar</hi> to demand the <hi>Consulship</hi>
without removing out of his Province. This caus'd <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
to leave the City, under pretence of going to his
Government, but he really went no further than a
Country-House of his, where falling sick, he Wrote to
the Senate, <hi>That he was ready to resign all his Employments
when</hi> Caesar <hi>did the like, which he wou'd confirm upon his
Return to</hi> Rome. <hi>Curio</hi> immediately took this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

Army, for <hi>Pompey</hi> likewise demanded the Legion

to <hi>Rome</hi> from his Government of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for his Great Exploits, to have Merited the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Triumph. His Absence had hinder'd him
from joyning with either Party, and his present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
oblig'd him to be a Mediator between both,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102323:184"/>
but no Proposals of Accommodation wou'd be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd

abroad, <hi>That, his Soldiers had no Esteem for him, and
that they wou'd certainly come over to the Senates Party,
whenever they recover'd this side of the</hi> Alps. This Relation
gave <hi>Pompey</hi> great Confidence, so that <hi>Cicero</hi> cou'd not
be heard: And when he afterwards ask'd <hi>Pompey</hi> what
Forces he had to oppose <hi>Caesar,</hi> his Answer was, <hi>That
he need but stamp with his Foot, and an Army wou'd start
out of the Earth.</hi> Many of the Senators began to talk
very meanly of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> himself scornfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
<hi>That he wou'd bring him to an Account for his Actions,

being rejected, he re-pass'd the <hi>Alps</hi> with his third Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

rais'd about this Letter; but after a long time spent, a

                     <note place="margin">U. C. 705.</note>
his Diligence in preventing any Enemy, and pursuing
a Victory, was the most admirable; and here he found
it most necessary, since he had to deal with a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
far more expert than any he had hitherto been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with; therefore his utmost Skill and Policy was
to be made use of at this Juncture. He first sent a choice
Party of Men, arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as secretly as possible into <hi>Ariminum,</hi> the first Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Province. He himself spent his time at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
in seeing the Combat of the Gladiators, and when
Night came, sate down at the Table with his Friends,
but soon rose again, desiring 'em, <hi>to make themselves Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and he wou'd be with 'em in a moment;</hi> but he had
secretly order'd some Mules to be put into his Chariot,
in which Equipage he set forwards towards <hi>Ariminum,</hi>

                     </gap>d
to follow him several Ways, and one Legion, which
was all he had there. It was a troublesome Journey,
but they resolv'd to undergo it; so sometimes on Foot,
and sometimes in his Chariot; <hi>Caesar</hi> arriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102323:185"/>
Banks of the <hi>Rubicon,</hi> a little River which parted <hi>Cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alpine
Gaul</hi> from the rest of <hi>Italy.</hi> Here he began to
have some Remorse, and all the Misfortunes of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
War presented themselves to his melancholy
Mind, which put him upon considering, what Posterity
wou'd think of this Passage. Sometimes he had thoughts
of going back, and turning himself to <hi>Asinius Pollio, Tis
now in our Power,</hi> says he, <hi>to return, but if we pass this fatal
River, our only Retreat must be to our Arms.</hi> Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
say, That just by the Place where he stood, of a
sudden there appear'd a Man of extraordinary Stature,
who made excellent Musick with a Reed he play'd upon;
which uncommon Sight drew many of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to him, among the rest, a Trumpeter, from whom
this Man snatch'd his Trumpet, and sounding a Charge
with a more violent Blast than ordinary, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Water, and pass'd over to the other side.
<hi>Caesar,</hi> without Further Consideration pass'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
crying, <hi>Let us go where the Gods so loudly call, and
the Fury of our Enemies drive us!</hi> From thence he march'd
directly to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Resistance: so, with 6000 Men only he began that
famous War, sending orders to the rest of his Troops
to follow with all possible Diligence.</p>
                  <p>This unexpected Enterprize gave most dreadfull Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> every one imagining
<hi>Caesar</hi> at the Gates with all his Army; and it was an
odd Confusion to see the Country People running to
the City for Safety, and the Citizens flying into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Country for Security. <hi>Pompey</hi> himself was amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Cicero</hi> under great Difficulties, as appear'd by his Epistles
upon this Occasion; but what was the greatest Trouble
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> was the biting and reflecting Words of many
of his own Party, some laying Indiscretion to his charge,
others Injustice; and <hi>Favonius,</hi> a crack-brain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

want an Army if they wou'd follow him; That it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Houses nor their Provinces that cou'd inspire 'em
with the Love of Vertue and of Liberty, but Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
might find it in all Retreats; and that their following
him wou'd be the only Way to put 'em in a Condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their Houses with Glory.</hi> The consideration of
the present Danger, made 'em resolve to quit the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so the Consuls, and almost all the Senate with
great Precipitation follow'd him to <hi>Capua,</hi> where were
the two Legions which <hi>Caesar</hi> had sent from <hi>Gaul,
Pompey</hi> with all Diligence put his Affairs in order, and
resolv'd to retire towards <hi>Brundusium.</hi> He left <hi>L. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi>
in <hi>Corfinium,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> to Command in <hi>Capua.</hi>
who receiv'd his commission with some Reluctancy,

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Affairs seem'd to be in a better Posture by
<hi>Labienus</hi>'s leaving <hi>Caesar,</hi> and coming over to him,
which he did upon some Discontent, expecting to
have been made equal with <hi>Caesar. Caesar</hi> seem'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to value that, but either through Policy or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
sent all his Money and Equipage after him.
Still <hi>Pompey</hi> thought it most convenient to send to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
with Proposals of Accommodation, which he did
by <hi>Lucius Caesar</hi> his Kinsman, and <hi>Roscius</hi> the <hi>Praetor.</hi>
But the Demands on both sides cou'd not be agreed
upon, for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Business was only to gain Time,
having his chief Reliance upon the Forces of the <hi>East,</hi>
which were absolutely in his Interest, <hi>Caesar</hi> too, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the Valour and Affections of his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
had no Design of quitting his Arms, but only
to make it appear as fairly as he cou'd, that he had
taken 'em up with Justice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> now, without losing any further Time, seiz'd
upon the Towns of <hi>Picenum,</hi> which lay in his Way, and
in a very short time became Master of all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
This Progress redoubled the Fears at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who was come back to seize the publick
Treasure, was oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

the mean time the twelfth Legion came to joyn <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:102323:186"/>
who marched to <hi>Asculum,</hi> which <hi>Lentulus</hi> had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
himself of with ten Cohorts; but upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Approach, retreated in Confusion, a great part of his
Soldiers deserting him, as they had done <hi>Curio</hi> not
long before. <hi>Caesar</hi> march'd directly after <hi>Pompey,</hi> not
offering to attack <hi>Rome,</hi> as knowing it wou'd fall of
Course to the Conqueror; and the first Place that
made any Resistance was <hi>Corfinium,</hi> the Metropolis
of the Country of the <hi>Peligni,</hi> which was possess'd by
<hi>Domitius,</hi> who had lately rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d 20 Cohorts out of those
Parts. Now as this was the first Town that durst
make head against <hi>Caesar,</hi> all Persons with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
expected the Success of the Enterprize. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
made his Approaches with two Legions, and was
engag'd by five Cohorts, who defended a Bridge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three Miles from the City; but were soon dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
back to the Gates of <hi>Corfinium,</hi> which thereupon
was immediately invested. <hi>Domitius</hi> prepar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for a vigorous Defence, and wrote to <hi>Pompey, That

come up; That it wou'd not be for his Reputation to leave
so many Senators and Knights which were now besieg'd, as
well as so many Soldiers, to the Mercy of the Enemy.
Pompey</hi>'s Answer was, <hi>That he was not then in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to hazard all in a Battle; what</hi> Domitius <hi>had engag'd

he ought to think of making as fair and speedy a Retreat
as was possible.</hi> Upon this Refusal it was that <hi>Cicero,</hi>
became so angry with <hi>Pompey,</hi> as appears from one
of his Epistles to <hi>Atti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Domitius</hi> conceal'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Answer, giving out
that <hi>Pompey</hi> wou'd bring speedy Relief: but at the
same time consulted with his Friends how to make a
private Retreat; which being at last discover'd, his
Men seiz'd on him, and sent to <hi>Caesar,</hi> offering to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

the Offer ought not to be rejected, but however
kept his Men from entering that Night, to prevent

in mind of their Ancient Friendship, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many Favours he had formerly receiv'd at his
Hands. <hi>Caesar</hi> interrupting him, told him, <hi>That he came
not from his Province to injure any Man, but for his own
Security, and the Restoration of the</hi> Tribunes <hi>Office, and the
Liberty of</hi> Rome. <hi>Lentulus</hi> sufficiently incourag'd by this
Answer, desir'd leave to return into the Town to give

as to their Fortunes; and the next day <hi>Caesar</hi>
sent to the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> who were in Town,
with their Children, and the Officers of the Garrison
to come forth. All these he protected from the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Soldiers, and having a little insisted upon

such as touch'd it upon any Occasion but the</hi> Gallick

agreed well together, and that he had remov'd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Reasons by reducing all</hi> Gaul <hi>to the</hi> Roman <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi>
and immediately went to the Doors of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
but the Keys cou'd not be found, whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi>
sent to the People to break open the Locks; and when
<hi>Metellus</hi> had still the Boldness to dispute it with him, in a
great Rage he laid his Hand upon his Sword, threatning
to kill him, with these words; <hi>Know, young Man, that it is
harder for me to say this than to do it:</hi> Which so terrify'd
<hi>Metellus,</hi> that he retir'd. <hi>Caesar</hi> took out 3000 pound
weight of Gold out of the Treasury, and ever after that,
had the Treasury at his Command in all his Wars.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Caesar</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> upon his <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Expedition, and knowing all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
said with his usual Confidence, <hi>That he went to find

find a General without an Army.</hi> He receiv'd News in

Mountains to their Assistance. When <hi>Caesar</hi>
sent to 'em to submit, they return'd for Answer, <hi>That
they resolv'd to take part with neither</hi> Casar <hi>nor</hi> Pompey,
<hi>to both whom they had equal Obligations. Caesar</hi> incensed
at their Proceedings, immediately besieg'd the Town
with three Legions, and order'd twelve Ships of War
to be bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and brought before <hi>Marseilles. Caesar</hi> finding the Siege,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102323:188"/>
like to be very tedious, left <hi>D. Brutus</hi> to command
the Ships, and <hi>C. Trebonius</hi> to carry on the Siege, and so
departed for <hi>Spain</hi> with all speed, where <hi>Fabius,</hi> whom
he had sent before, joyn'd him with three Legions,
which, together with his own Forces, made a noble
Army. Upon a Report in that Country, That <hi>Pompey</hi>
was coming by Way of <hi>Mauritania</hi> to Command his
Troops in Person, <hi>Caesar</hi> us'd extream Diligence; and
to assure himself of his Men, he Borrow'd Money of
all his Officers, which he Distributed among his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
by that means engaging his Officers by their
own Interests, and his Soldiers by his Liberality. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franius</hi>
and <hi>Petreius</hi> were then posted nigh the City <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerda</hi>

Fighting, fearing to be hemm'd in; till by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
'em, they press'd forward into a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Place, which they still Maintain'd for Five Hours,
and then retreated in Good Order. Both Parties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to themselves the Honour of the Victory; <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
for driving the Enemy before him, and <hi>Afranius</hi>
for keeping the Post for which they Fought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Afranius</hi> had Greater Appearance of Advantage
shortly after; for the continual Rains carry'd away
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s two Bridges, and hinder'd the River from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fordable any where; Which reduc'd him to Great
Streights, not being able to get Provisions, nor to joyn
a Supply of Forces that came to him from <hi>Gaul,</hi> nor
yet to rebuild his Bridges, by reason of the Violence
of the Stream, and the Opposition he met with from
the Enemy, who lay on the other side of the River.
The News of this gave such great Hopes to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Party at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they went in Great Numbers to

made, and while the Enemy were diverted, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to Intercept some <hi>Gauls</hi> who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to joyn him, he carried the Boats in Wagons twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miles distant from his Camp, put 'em upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and with a wonderful Quickness and Dexterity
caus'd his Legions to pass the River; by which means
he re-built the Bridges. Thus he re-establish'd his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
got Provisions, joyn'd the Forces which came to
his Assistance, by his Great Skill astonish'd the Enemy,
and Gain'd so much Reputation, as, together with the
News of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Beating the <hi>Marseillians</hi> by Sea, gain'd
him five considerable Towns, and made several others
Capitulate. <hi>Caesar,</hi> who spared no Pains to distress his
Enemies, threw up divers Intrenchments and Ditches
in order to cut off the Water from their Camp, and to
make the <hi>Segre</hi> Fordable. <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

'em, and oblig'd 'em to Ford the River before they

reach their intended Place, nor return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Camp. By which means he reduc'd 'em to such
extremities of Hunger and Drought, that they were
all oblig'd to yield to his Mercy without any Bloodshed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar,</hi> to shew his kind and Generous Temper, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102323:189"/>
such as were never practis'd elsewere towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And in a short time after he became Master
of all <hi>Spain,</hi> sending back his Enemies loaden with
Shame and Obligations to publish his extraordinary
Clemency and Valour, while he himself departed for
<hi>Marseilles,</hi> which was then just upon the point of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s arrival they capitulated: During
which time <hi>Domitius</hi> made his escape by Sea; <hi>Caesar</hi>
pardon'd the Inhabitants, more upon the account of
their Name and Antiquity, as he told 'em, than for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Merit, and leaving two Legions in Garrison,
he departed for <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon his arrival there, he was
receiv'd with Great Satisfaction by most People,<note place="margin">Dic. <hi>lxxi.</hi> U. C. 706.</note> and
made <hi>Dictator</hi> by <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> the <hi>Praetor;</hi> but finding
this Office not well lik'd of, he laid it down after hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it 11 Days, and caus'd himself to be chosen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
with <hi>Servilius Isauricus.</hi> His Design was now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himself as many Friends as possible; in pursuance
of which Purpose he preferr'd several favourable Laws;
the first was concerning the Borrowing of Money for
the War, which, as it usually happens, having ruin'd
almost all Credit, and render'd a great many Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of Payment, <hi>Caesar</hi> order'd, that an Estimate
should be made of Inheritances, at the same Value
they bore before the War, and that Creditors should
take them according to his Estimation; by which
means he took away the Fears of a General Bankrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and supported the Credit of the Debtors. Besides,
he brought over to his Party all such as expected to
be favour'd in this General Valuation, which was the
principal Design of the Law. The other Law was, for
the calling home those who had been condemn'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s presiding in the passing Sentences of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<hi>Caesar</hi> likewise made several other Ordinances,
and after having quitted the Name and Dignity of
<hi>Dictator,</hi> departed for <hi>Brundusium</hi> to go against <hi>Pompey,</hi>
before which time he receiv'd the bad News of the

him in that Party, which he thought had the
most Justice on its side. In one of their Assemblies, by
the Politick Advice of <hi>Cato,</hi> it was determin'd, That
no <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen should, be put to Death out of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and that no Town subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

drew the Good Wishes of the People upon the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102323:190"/>
Authors of it, and gain'd the Reputation of great
Justice and Humanity to their Designs, and likewise
was the Occasion that the Fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> hung, for a
long time, doubtful, and was afterwards made use of
to justifie his Death.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these Disadvantages on <hi>Caesar</hi>'s side,
he proceeded with an uncommon Vigour, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Courage, and rendezvouzing at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Delay, shipp'd off 5 of his 12 Legions, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to no more than 20000 Foot and 6000 Horse
at this time; the rest were oblig'd to stay behind for
want of Shipping. <hi>Caesar</hi> very much incourag'd his Men,
telling 'em what glorious Actions they were going to
undertake; and in spight of the Rigour of the Season,
upon the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> he weigh'd Anchor. This much
surpris'd the Officers of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Fleet, to find him venture
so boldly through the Dangers both of the Weather and
their Navies. But <hi>Caesar</hi> tim'd it so well, that he made
his Passage in one Day, and landed his Men at a place
call'd <hi>Pharsalus,</hi> not daring to venture into any known
Port, which he believ'd to be possess'd by the Enemy.
Having once got to Land, he sent back all the Ships to
transport the rest of his Legions under the Command of
<hi>Calenus,</hi> but in their Passage, 30 of 'em fell into the hands
of <hi>Bibulus, Pompey</hi>'s Admiral, who, sensible of his former
Neglect, in a great Passion, set 'em all on Fire, destroying
both Owners and Seamen, hoping by this Example to
terrifie the rest; and for the future he took more than
ordinary Care in guarding the Coasts. In the mean
time <hi>Caesar</hi> took possession of <hi>Oricum</hi> and <hi>Apollonia,</hi>
which, at the sight of his Troops, surrender'd themselves;
by which means he cut off all Communication of Land
from <hi>Bibulus</hi> as long as he staid to intercept his Fleet.
<hi>Caesar</hi> still took care to justify his Actions, and for that
reason he sent <hi>Rufus,</hi> whom he had twice taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> once more to offer a Treaty, and to refer
all to the Senate and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> which prov'd of
no effect, for the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were too much of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pom
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102323:191"/>
Pompey</hi> was now in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where <hi>Rufus</hi> joyn'd
him, and fearing least <hi>Ceasar</hi> shou'd become Master of
<hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> where all his Ammunition lay, he March'd
with his whole Army to save that Place Upon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
at the City, the Laziness and Desertion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his new-rais'd Troops, made him cause all his
Soldiers to Swear, <hi>That they wou'd never abandon their
General, but follow him through all his Fortunes;</hi> which Oath
was likewise taken by all the Officers. He encamp'd
by the River <hi>Apsus,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> had posted his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
not far of, on the other side of the River, to cover
<hi>Apollonia;</hi> and both remain'd in this manner for some
time, impatiently expecting the Succours that were to
come up. But the Absence of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Legions at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium</hi>
was a severe Vexation to him, whose Passage
was chiefly obstructed by <hi>Bibul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself was in as ill a Condition, by being hinder'd
of the Conveniencies of Land by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Troops. At
last <hi>Bibulus</hi> dying of a Sickness at Sea, and leaving no
Commander in Chief to succeed him, much less Care
was taken than before. <hi>Caesar</hi> was sensible of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Opportunity, but was almost despairing that
his Troops were not arriv'd as soon as he expected 'em,
for he had written several times. At last, his great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
drove him upon an Action which nothing
cou'd excuse but the extraordinary Confidence he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had in his good Fortune, which was this: He dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
himself in the Habit of a Slave, and with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Secrecy, put himself on Board a Fisher-man's
Bark, at the Mouth of the River <hi>Apsus,</hi> with a Design
to pass to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where his Forces lay. They row'd
off in the beginning of the Night, but a stiff Gale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

rough, and the Master and Rowers made several At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to get out to Sea, but the Winds encreasing, he
order'd 'em to desist. <hi>Caesar</hi> finding his Design like to
be fruitless, on a sudden discover'd himself, <hi>Fear nothing</hi>
said he, <hi>for thou carriest</hi> Caesar <hi>and all his Fortune:</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:102323:191"/>
Mariners, encourag'd by the Presence of so Great a
Man, made fresh Endeavours, and got into the Sea,
but the Waves ran so high, that they were at last forc'd
to return to Land. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers, at his Arrival, ran
to him in great Multitudes, and told him with a great
Tenderness and Affection, <hi>That he had reflected upon
their Courages, by going to seek out New Forces, when they were
sure to Conquer without, whilst he was pleas'd to head 'em.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a short time after, <hi>Caesar</hi> receiv'd the good News
of the safe Arrival of most of his Troops under the
Command of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and <hi>Calenus,</hi> at <hi>Apollonia,</hi>
which consisted of 3 Veteran Legions, one new-rais'd,
and 800 Horse. They were closely pursu'd by <hi>Caponius,</hi>
Admiral of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Squadron, 16 of whose Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
perish'd by the sudden Turning of the Wind, and the
Badness of the Weather. But 2 of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships behind
there, were taken by the Enemy, and the Soldiers of
one put to the Sword; but those of the other, being old
Soldiers, by bravely defending themselves, escaped. The
nigh Distance of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Armies, had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
several Parlies as well as Skirmishes; and here
the last Propositions of Accommodation were made.
<hi>Pompey</hi> protested, <hi>That be wou'd never endure that the World
shou'd say, that his Life and Return was a Favour bestow'd
upon him by</hi> Caesar; and <hi>Labienus</hi> cry'd out, <hi>That nothing
cou'd make a Composition but</hi> Caesar'<hi>s Head.</hi> These Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
therefore being successless, <hi>Caesar</hi> decamp'd to joyn
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> did the like to hinder his Design.
He had no River to pass as <hi>Caesar</hi> had, but went and
posted himself in a Place which he thought most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for an Ambuscade, which he had laid for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony;</hi>
but he being advis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d of it by the <hi>Greeks</hi> of the
Country, entrench'd himself in an advantageous Post,
where he staid for <hi>Caesar,</hi> who soon after arriv'd; and
<hi>Pompey</hi> fearing to be hemm'd in between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
retreated to <hi>Asparagus</hi> nigh <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> leaving
<hi>Anthony</hi> the liberty of joyning <hi>Caesar,</hi> which he did the
same day. Thus these two great Men, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:102323:192"/>
at the Head of all their Troops, were in a Readiness
to dispute the Empire of the World, and, what was still
more valuable to them, the Pre-eminence of all that
Glory and Renown which they had gain'd by their
Arms, one in the <hi>West,</hi> and the other in the <hi>East:</hi>
And as these Actions were perhaps more Remarkable
than any before 'em in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, especially as
to matter of Conduct, so it may be convenient to be
somewhat more particular in relating of 'em.</p>
                  <p>VI. Great Skill and excellent Management was us'd
by both Generals; and <hi>Caesar</hi> resolving not to be out-brav'd
by the Rival of his Honour, March'd directly
towards <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Asparagus;</hi> and after three Days
March he came in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight of the Enemy's Camp, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
his own, from whence the next Day he drew out
his Troops to offer him Battel. <hi>Pompey</hi> stirr'd not, and
from that Moment, <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiv'd he must take other
Measures. And the next day he decamp'd to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> with design either of reducing <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
to shut himself up in the Town, or to cut off his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to such a very useful Place, which last in part suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
<hi>Pompey</hi> at first believ'd that <hi>Caesar</hi> was oblig'd
to draw off for want of Provisions, but understanding
his Design by Spies and others, the next Day began to
March, hoping to prevent <hi>Caesar</hi> by a shorter Way than
he was forc'd to take. Which <hi>Caesar</hi> being aware of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
his Soldiers what he cou'd, and left 'em but a
small Part of the Night for Rest, and arriv'd the next
Morning under the Walls of <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to discover the Van of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
secur'd a Hill call'd <hi>Petra,</hi> which commanded
the Sea, under which was a small shelter for Ships,
where few Winds cou'd annoy 'em. Both Parties intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
themselves in the Posts they had taken; and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
caus'd part of his Ships to come under his Camp
and immediately sent into <hi>Asia</hi> and other Parts for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and Ammunition. <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving then tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:102323:192"/>
the War was like to continue long, and finding the
Want of Corn, caus'd Magazines to be made in all
Parts not in the Enemy's Hands; and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his Diligence and Care, the Disadvantages he
labour'd under caus'd his Army to be but ill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
at last.</p>
                  <p>The Inconveniencies that were like to follow from
hence, put <hi>Caesar</hi> upon a new Design: All round <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Camp were certain little Hills high and steep, of
which <hi>Caesar</hi> possess'd himself, and built Towers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em in the nature of Redoubts; then causing
Lines of Communication to be drawn from Hill to
Hill, and other Works, he endeavour'd to block up
<hi>Pompey</hi> by that Circumvallation. This was done
chiefly to diminish the mighty Reputation that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had gain'd among Foreign Nations, when all the
World shou'd know that he was invested by <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and dared not hazard a Battel. But <hi>Pompey</hi> resolv'd
to run the hazard of any Scandal rather than a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
at this time, or to quit either <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> or the
Sea; so that both Parties at present were employ'd
in Designs and Stratagems. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men daily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on their Works to straighten the Enemy, and
those of <hi>Pompey</hi> did the same to enlarge themselves,
they having the Advantage as to Numbers; besides,
theirs being the innermost Circumvallation, was not
extended so far as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s. Tho' <hi>Pompey</hi> declin'd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to a Battel, yet he severely gall'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men
with his Archers and Slingers, which oblig d 'em to
make certain Blinds with Clothes and Skins for their
Defence against the Arrows; and no Day pass'd
without some Encounter or other, particularly when
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s ninth Legion was too far advanc'd, <hi>Caesar</hi>
brought it off safely when <hi>Pompey</hi> before believ'd it
impossible. It was very remarkable to find <hi>Caesar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
an Enemy stronger than himself, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
with all Provisions by Sea, while he himself
was reduc'd to extream Necessity for want of Corn.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102323:193"/>
Yet his Soldiers bore all with admirable Constancy,
remembring what great Honours they had often
gain'd after such Miseries as these. They made use
of Beans and Barley, and a Root call'd <hi>Chara,</hi> which
they mingled with Milk, some of which they often
threw among <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Soldiers, telling 'em, <hi>That they
wou'd rather eat the Barks of Trees, than let</hi> Pompey <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
now they had got him in their Power. Pompey</hi> was
extreamly surpriz'd at this, and said, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e did not
expect to have had Wild Beasts to deal withal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But afterwards when Summer came on, there was
a great Change; for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army cou'd hardly be
kept alive, being most distress'd for want of Water,
which <hi>Caesar</hi> by Dams and other Methods had turn'd
another Way. On the contrary, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army was
in very good Health, well furnish'd with Water and
all Provisions, except Wheat; of which also they
had fair hopes, Harvest being so nigh. After this,
follow'd several Skirmishes, and one Night <hi>Pompey,</hi>
understanding <hi>Caesar</hi> was absent a little way, attack'd
his Works, but was beaten off with considerable loss,
and forc'd to retreat into his old Trenches. In
this Encounter one <hi>Sceva</hi> a Centurion behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with a wonderful Bravery, killing two Officers
after he had been wounded in the Eye, Shoulder and
Thigh, as <hi>Appian</hi> relates it, and receiving 230 Shots
upon his Buckler. <hi>Caesar</hi> greatly rewarded him and
many others, and encourag'd by this good Success,
drew out his Men every day and offer'd Battel to
<hi>Pompey</hi> within view of his Lines; and tho' <hi>Pompey</hi>
drew out also in Battalia, yet he always kept his
Troops under Defence of his Ramparts, where <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
did not think fit to attack kim. <hi>Caesar</hi> had now
by means of his Officers drawn several Provinces of
<hi>Greece</hi> to his Party, and understanding that <hi>Scipio</hi>
was come into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he sent to him to procure
an Accommodation between him and <hi>Pompey,</hi> which
he might easily bring about, as having the command
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102323:193"/>
of an Army. But <hi>Caesar</hi> finding this not to succeed,
apply'd himself more closely to block up <hi>Pompey,</hi>
and with the utmost Art and Diligence, which
brought him to a more dangerous Condition than
ever; for his Horses had consum'd all their Barley,
and likewise all the Leaves of the Trees, so that
there remain'd no more Subsistence for 'em, and
they were now scarce able to go on their Legs for
want of Forage; all which gave very great Hopes to
<hi>Caesar</hi> and his Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>These Troubles and Inconveniencies which incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
<hi>Pompey,</hi> made him resolve to break through,
especially after he had been inform'd of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fortifications by <hi>Roscillus</hi> and <hi>Aegus,</hi>
two Brothers of considerable Note, who deserted <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
and came over to him. To carry on this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
he gave Orders to his light Harnass'd Men and
Archers to defend themselves with Bavins and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
of Osiers; then drawing out 60 Cohorts, he
put 'em on Board his Ships, and attack'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Works by the Sea, which had been too little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not well compleated. This was done with
such Effect, that all the Centurions of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
were cut off except one; and tho' <hi>Caesar</hi> and his
Officers us'd the utmost Endeavour to hinder <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Designs, yet by means of his great Conduct
and Forecast, he got out of his Fortifications, and
incamp'd in another Place by the Sea, where he
had both the Conveniency of all Forage, and of his
Shipping besides. <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving the Loss he had
sustain'd, and that the Course of the War had not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to his Expectation, resolv'd to
change it, and sit down close by <hi>Pompey.</hi> In that
Enterprize he design'd to cut off a Legion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
which was posted by a Wood; but this Action
brought on a general Battel, where his Men were
all entangled within the Intrenchments of the old
Camps lately abandon'd; and likewise so surpriz'd
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:102323:194"/>
and over-power'd by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Forces, that in spight
of all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Endeavours, they fled with great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
and Loss. The greatest part perish'd in
the Trenches, and on the River Banks, press'd to
Death by their Fellows. <hi>Pompey</hi> pursu'd his Victory
to the very Camp of <hi>Caesar,</hi> but durst not attack it,
being both surpriz'd with the Suddenness of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and the Fear of Ambuscades: And this was
his great Error in this Case; for <hi>Caesar</hi> himself
confess'd, <hi>That he had been lost without Redress, cou'd</hi>
Pompey <hi>have known how to make use of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Advantage gain'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> caus'd him to
be saluted <hi>Imperator; Labienus</hi> begging the Prisoners,
caus'd 'em all to be slain; and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party had
such Assurance, that not thinking any more of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Engagements and Dangers, they carry'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as undoubted Conquerors, which they report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all Places, not considering the many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that occasion'd this Success. But <hi>Caesar</hi> being
driven from his former Purposes, resolv'd to change
the whole Course of the War; and assembling his
Men together, with a fearless Mind spake to 'em af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner: <hi>We have no reason to be dejected or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
at our late Insuccess, but have much more to be
thankful to Fortune for the long and uninterrupted Course
of her Favours, in those many and glorious Conquests in</hi>
Gaul <hi>and</hi> Britain, <hi>and those happy and more successful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
in</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Spain. <hi>If after all these renown'd
Exploits and noble Acts, one little Disorder, one Error of
Inadvertency, or indeed of Destiny it self, has depriv'd us
of the Success we might reasonably have expected, we ought
to correct all by the Greatness of our Souls, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
of our Courages.</hi> After his Speech he cashier d
some Ensigns, but he needed to make no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
for his Soldiers offer'd to punish themselves
by any Labour or Danger, crying out with great
Impatience, <hi>To Arms, let us be reveng'd or die!</hi> But
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102323:194"/>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> thought it not convenient to put 'em to the
Tryal, till their Minds were setled, therefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make a fair Retreat to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> which he
did with that Diligence, that <hi>Pompey</hi> cou'd not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him, only some of his Cavalry came up with
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Reer, but were repuls'd with Loss. <hi>Caesar</hi>
caus'd his Baggage to march before, and his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of being eight Hours before <hi>Pompey,</hi> oblig d
<hi>Pompey</hi> in four Days to give over his Pursuit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to other Resolutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> was constrain'd to go to <hi>Apollonia</hi> to dispose
of his sick and wounded Men, and to muster his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but fearing lest <hi>Pompey</hi> should surprize <hi>Domitius,</hi>
one of his Lieutenants now in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> with three
Legions, he hastned with his utmost Diligence to
joyn him. <hi>Pompey,</hi> perceiving which way he dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his March, was in as great a Fear for <hi>Scipio,</hi> now
in <hi>Thessaly</hi> with the <hi>Syrian</hi> Legions, and immediately
set forward. So each General march'd with all the
Diligence imaginable, both to secure their Friends
and surprize their Enemies. <hi>Pompey</hi> had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Shortness of the Way, and <hi>Domitius</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
narrowly escap'd him, who coming to <hi>Aeginium</hi>
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> there happily joyn'd
<hi>Caesar. Caesar</hi> seeing all his Forces together, march'd
directly to <hi>Gomphi,</hi> the first Town in the Way from
<hi>Epirus</hi> to <hi>Thessaly.</hi> The Inhabitants, who before had
promis'd <hi>Caesar</hi> Obedience, now chang'd their Minds,
as many others had done, upon the Report of his
being beaten, being perswaded to it by the <hi>Praetors</hi> of
<hi>Thessaly</hi> then in the City; and after having sent to
<hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> for Succour, caus'd the Gates to be
shut against <hi>Caesar. Scipio</hi> was now at <hi>Larissa</hi> in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey</hi> was not arriv'd in this Province,
which caus'd <hi>Caesar</hi> to Attack <hi>Gomphi;</hi> he order'd
Ladders, great Baskets fill'd with Earth, and Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
to be got ready with all Speed; and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
represented to his Soldiers the great Advantages
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:102323:195"/>
of forcing a Place so very rich and well furnish'd,
he caus'd an Assault to be made, which was carry'd
on and supported with such Fury and Bravery, that
notwithstanding the extraordinary Height of the
Walls, the Town was taken in few Hours time.
<hi>Caesar</hi> lest it to be plunder'd, and, without stopping,
march'd his Army to <hi>Metropolis,</hi> which yielded to
him upon the sight of the Prisoners of <hi>Gomphi:</hi> This
Conduct of his brought over all the Towns in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly</hi>
to his Subjection, except <hi>Larissa,</hi> which <hi>Scipio</hi>
had possess'd himself of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Thessaly</hi> within a few Days after
the Taking of <hi>Gomphi,</hi> and advanc'd near <hi>Pharsalia,</hi>
whither <hi>Scipio</hi> went and joyn'd him with his Troops.
He was receiv'd by his Son-in-Law <hi>Pompey</hi> with great
Magnificence, making him Partaker both of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Authority, and ordering the Trumpets to
sound every Morning at <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Tent as well as his
own. <hi>Caesar</hi> was all the time giving Orders for the
Subsistence of his Army, and with great Skill making
Remarks upon the Inclinations of his Soldiers; and
finding them hearty and vigorous, caus'd 'em to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
as far as the Plains of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi>
was now encamp'd. The Approach of these two
noble Armies, in which were all the chosen <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions, whose Valour was to decide the Fate of
that great Empire; the Hatred and Ambition of
the Generals, animated by the Prize as well as the
Glory of such a Conquest; together with the small
Appearance of an Accommodation, made it out of
doubt that nothing but a general Battel cou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
this famous Quarrel. <hi>Pompey</hi> being the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the two, his Party did not question the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and fell into great Controversies who shou'd be
successively Consuls, who shou'd have <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and who shou'd have his Lands, Goods, and
Moneys, and likewise how all Dignities and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracies
shou'd be dispos'd of, with a great many
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:102323:195"/>
Things of the like Nature: In short, every one set
his Thoughts upon sharing the Fruits of the Victory,
without considering how to gain it. But <hi>Caesar</hi> was
far otherwise employ'd, using all the Care and Skill
imaginable to encourage and perfect his Men: He
every day sent out Parties, and exercis'd the lusty
young Men of his Legions to mingle themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Cavalry, and contend even with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for Swiftness; so tho' <hi>Pompey</hi> much surpass'd in
the Number of Horse, yet <hi>Caesars</hi> being so well and
skilfully assisted by these light-arm'd Foot, were not
at all afraid of 'em, and in one Rencounter they
defeated a great Number of 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar,</hi> now finding his Soldiers vigorous and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Action, drew out of his Camp, and offer'd
<hi>Pompey</hi> Battel. But that General had no such Design
at present, either suspecting his Troops, or dreading
the Loss of his Reputation; and therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to waste <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army with Fatigue and want of
Provisions. He drew indeed sometimes out of his
Camp, but always kept himself under his Trenches,
at the Foot of the advanc'd Ground where he was
posted. <hi>Caesar</hi> cou'd not attack him in that Place
without great Disadvantage, so that he resolv'd
to decamp the next Day, that by frequent Motions
he might weary out <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men, who were not
so hardned to Toil and Labour as his. Upon the
taking down of the Tents, Advice came that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Army was in Battalia, and far enough from his
Trenches; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> caus'd all his Troops to
halt, and with extream Joy told 'em, <hi>That now was
the happy and long-wish'd-for Moment, in which they might
gain themselves immortal Honour.</hi> After which he
drew up his Troops in order, and advanc'd with
'em towards the Place of Battel. <hi>Pompey</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side was extreamly troubled with melancholy
thoughts and presaging dreams, but now was no longer
able to hold out against the Importunities and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102323:196"/>
of his Officers, and therefore at present did
what he cou'd to incourage 'em, particularly by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
'em, <hi>That the Strength of his Cavalry, who had
promis'd him to Attack the Enemy's Flanks before they cou'd
discharge one Dart, was alone sufficient to gain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
Labienus</hi> seconded his Speech, adding withal,
<hi>That this was not the Army that</hi> Caesar <hi>perform'd such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
in</hi> Gaul <hi>and</hi> Germany <hi>with, which were all gone
home, kill'd with Diseases, or destroy'd at the last Battel at</hi>
Dyrrachium. After which <hi>Labienus</hi> took a solemn
Oath not to return into his Camp but with Victory;
which Oath <hi>Pompey</hi> himself took, and the rest after
him, not imagining that any thing cou'd be spoken
vainly by so skillful a Commander.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army consisted of 45000 Foot, according
to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and 7000 Horse; <hi>Caesar</hi>'s but of 22000
Foot, and not much above 1000 Horse; but <hi>Appian</hi>
with some reason excepts the Auxiliaries, which he
supposes to have been great on both Sides; tho' all
agree that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Forces were double the Number
to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s. <hi>Pompey</hi> left seven Cohorts to guard his
Camp, and drew up all his Men in three Lines, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Legion making three Battalions, and each Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
was drawn up in half Cohorts, that is, 200
Men in Rank, and eight in File. The <hi>Syrian</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were plac'd in the middle, under the command
of <hi>Scipio;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom <hi>Pompey</hi> most rely'd
upon, on the Right, under <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus;</hi>
and on the Left was <hi>Pompey</hi> himself, with the two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<hi>Caesar</hi> had restor'd at the beginning of the War,
under <hi>Lentulus.</hi> The rest were in the same Order
between <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Legions and the Wings; only <hi>the</hi>
Auxiliary Troops, at least such as fought in Order,
compos'd the Body of Reserve; for the others, they
were drawn out without Order upon the Left, with
the Archers, Slingers, and all the Cavalry, the Right
being fortify'd by a River. <hi>Caesar</hi> left two Cohorts
to guard his Camp, and drew up in three Lines
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102323:196"/>
also, in the same Order with <hi>Pompey;</hi> the tenth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was upon the Right, and the ninth upon the
Left, almost joyn'd to the eighth. The rest of the
Cohorts being drawn up between these Legions,
were on the Centre, where <hi>Domitius Calvinus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Sylla</hi> having the Right Wing, and <hi>Anthony</hi>
the Left. <hi>Caesar</hi> put himself at the Head of the
tenth Legion, whose Valour he had often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd,
and with design to be opposite to <hi>Pompey,</hi>
who intended to fall suddenly upon the Flanks of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Troops; but he soon perceiv'd it by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Battel, and thereupon he drew six Cohorts
out of all his Troops, of which he compos'd a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Reserve. He exactly instructed them in their
Duty; and above all, gave them to understand, <hi>That
all the Hopes of Victory depended upon their Valour and
Conduct alone.</hi> Lastly, he plac'd his Cavalry so as to
cover the Right of the tenth Legion, ordering over
and above his third Line not to march, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Signal from him.</p>
                  <p>Now it was that the Fate of the vast Empire of
<hi>Rome</hi> was to be decided by the greatest Generals, the
bravest Officers, and the stoutest Soldiers in the
World, each Man almost being inspir'd with the
Desire of conquering Gloriously or dying Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
As the Armies approach'd, the two Generals
went from Rank to Rank encouraging their Soldiers:
<hi>Pompey</hi> represented to his Men, <hi>The Iustice and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his Cause; the Advantage of their Numbers,
strengthen'd by the Assistance of so many Illustrious Senators;
and the Glory lately obtain'd at the Battel of</hi> Dyrrachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.
<hi>Caesar</hi> was contented only to demonstrate, <hi>That
he had endeavour'd by all possible Means to obtain an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace; and if his Enemies had pleas'd, they might
have spar'd the Blood of so many brave Men.</hi> So seeing
the Impatience of his Soldiers to fall on, he gave
the Signal of Battel; the Word on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s side was,
<hi>Hercules the Invincible;</hi> that on <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, <hi>Venus the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:102323:197"/>
There was now only so much Space <hi>between</hi>
the two Armies as was just sufficient for the Place of
Battel; but <hi>Pompey</hi> order'd his Men to receive the
first Shock without moving from their Places. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Soldiers seeing that, like Men of Skill, of their own
accord made a Halt in the midst of their Carrier;
and after taking a little Breath, ran furiously upon
the Enemy, first discharging their Javelins, then
drawing their Swords, as <hi>Caesar</hi> had given 'em Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men receiv'd the Charge without the
least Disorder, and falling on with their Javelins and
Swords, a cruel and bloody Battel ensu'd, which for
some time seem'd equal. Then <hi>Pompey</hi> order'd his
Cavalry to charge, which with the multitude of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Slingers, soon oblig'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men to give
ground, and got themselves upon the Flank of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as they first design'd. Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
order'd the six Cohorts to advance, which
were his Body of Reserve, to charge upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Enemy with their Pikes ported. This
Contrivance disorder'd those nice and esseminate
Knights; and the fear of spoiling their Faces, put 'em
into such Confusion, that upon the Rallying of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Cavalry, they were all broke in a Moment,
and the Slingers and Archers being thus abandon'd,
were all cut to pieces. <hi>Caesar</hi> industriously follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Advantage, advanc'd and charg'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Troops upon the Flank, which Charge they stood
with great Resolution, and the Allies bravely defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, when <hi>Caesar</hi> gave the Signal for his
third Line to advance, which fresh Troops pouring
in upon <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, weary'd out, and attack'd on all
Sides, easily broke 'em. The Flight began among
the Strangers, tho' <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Right Wing still vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
maintain'd their Ground; but <hi>Caesar</hi> causing
his Men to cry out, <hi>Kill the Strangers,</hi> but save the
Romans, the <hi>Romans</hi> laid down their Arms, and
receiv'd Quarter, but a miserable Slaughter was
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102323:197"/>
made among the Strangers, who fled with all
speed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar,</hi> now finding the Victory certain, and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
retreated to his Trenches, cry'd out to his Men,
<hi>That they ought to pursue the Victory, and take the Enemies
Camp.</hi> It was now Noon-day, and tho' they were
wearied out with the Extremity of the Heat, yet
upon seeing their General march a-foot at the Head
of 'em, they follow'd him with great Resolution,
and falling on with fresh Courage, the Enemy all
fled to the Mountains not far off. <hi>Pompey</hi> himself
was so extreamly dishearten'd and confounded, that
here he cou'd perform nothing worthy of his great
Courage or Reputation, but getting on Horse-back,
he fled to <hi>Larissa,</hi> and from thence to the Sea. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
found throughout the Camp much rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Tents, Tables spread with fine Linen,
and Cubbords cover'd with Plate, which sufficiently
shew'd the Luxury and Assurance of the Enemy.
<hi>Caesar</hi> earnestly desir'd his Soldiers, <hi>Not to amuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with Plunder, but to compleat this glorious Victory;</hi>
and by means of the great Respect they bore him,
he prevail'd. So a Trench was immediately thrown
up about the Mountain where the Enemy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
who, wanting Water, were forc'd to quit
it, and retire to <hi>Larissa. Caesar</hi> immediately follow'd
'em with four Legions, and after six Miles March,
drew up in Battalia, which caus'd the Enemy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to a high Hill, at the Foot of which
ran a River. Now, Night approaching, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Men were almost spent, and ready to faint with the
incessant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Toil of the whole Day; yet still by his
obliging Persuasions, he prevail'd with 'em to cut
off the Conveniency of Water from the Enemy by
a Trench. This immediately forc'd 'em to a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation,
only some Senators made their Escape in
the Dark. The next Morning <hi>Caesar</hi> order'd all the
Enemy to come down into the Plain and lay down
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102323:198"/>
their Arms, which they obey'd, and falling upon
their Knees before him, in the most suppliant Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
begg'd for Mercy, which he granted 'em with
all the Clemency and Kindness imaginable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Soldiers not to offer 'em the least Incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
nor plunder their Baggage. Thus <hi>Caesar,</hi> by
his wonderful Skill and Courage, and by the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
Industry of his Soldiers, obtain'd the most
compleat, tho' not the most bloody, Victory that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
General in the World did, 15000 of the Enemy
being slain in Battel, and 24000 surrender'd, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
losing a very inconsiderable Number.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> who just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had been the glorious Commander of Kings,
and all the Greatness and Magnificence of <hi>Rome,</hi>
now found himself reduc'd to seek Retreat with
some few of his Friends in a poor Fisherman's Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin:
From whence he went aboard another Vessel,
and made forward every Day as much as he cou'd;
but the ungrateful Sound of his Defeat still flew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, which so dejected and confounded him,
that he cou'd not think of any thing that might be
serviceable to him. His Assurance of Victory made
his Defeat most intolerable, leaving him naked and
disarm'd of all Relief: And his Misfortunes had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faturated
his Mind, that he could not so much as use
those Advantages he had still by Sea, where he had
a powerful and victorious Fleet. He sail'd first to
<hi>Amphipolis,</hi> then to <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where he took his Wife,
who bitterly complain'd <hi>of the ill Destiny which allid
her to</hi> Crassus <hi>first, and afterwards to</hi> Pompey, <hi>only to
cause the Ruine of two such Illustrious Families. Pompey</hi>
from thence directed his Course to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where
King <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> a Minor, was in War with his Sister
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whose Father <hi>Pompey</hi> had setled in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<hi>Pompey</hi> sent to him, <hi>That in regard of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Hospitality and Amity between him and his Father,
he desir'd a Retreat of him in</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and that by
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102323:198"/>
his Wealth and Power he wou'd support him, now fallen
into the utmost Misery and Calamity.</hi> The Message was
well enough receiv'd, but such as were Protectors of
the King, and Guardians of the Kingdom now in his
Minority, either induc'd by the Fear of the Armies
being gain'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> many of 'em having been
his Soldiers, or else despising the lowness of his Fortune,
gave a civil Answer openly to the Messengers, and
desir'd him to come to the King: But secretly plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
among themselves, sent <hi>Achillas,</hi> a principal
Commander and of great Boldness, together with
<hi>Septimius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Tribune, to kill him. They
met him with much Civility, and <hi>Pompey</hi> knowing
<hi>Septimius</hi> to have led a Company under him in his
War against the Pirates, went aboard a little Bark,
with a few of his Soldiers, and there was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously
and treacherously murther'd by <hi>Achillas</hi> and
<hi>Septimius,</hi> his Wife and Friends flying with what sail
they cou'd make. His Head being cut off, they left
the Body on the Shoar, which was carefully taken
up by <hi>Philip</hi> his Freed-Man, who gathering up some
Pieces of a Broken Boat for a Pile, was surpiz'd by
an old <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, residing in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:
Who art thou,</hi> said he, <hi>that art making these sad
Preparations for the great</hi> Pompey'<hi>s Funeral? Philip</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, <hi>One of his Freed-Men. Ab,</hi> reply'd he,
<hi>thou shalt not have all this Honour to thy self, but suffer me
to partake in an Action so Iust and Sacred; that among
all the Miseries of my Exile, I may please my self in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Honour to touch the Body, and assist at the Funeral
of the greatest and noblest Soldier that</hi> Rome <hi>ever produc'd.</hi>
After which they gave him the last Rites, the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of which Ceremony was very peculiar.</p>
                  <p>Such was the End, and such the Funeral of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey
the Great,</hi> who after his escaping so many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
and eminent Dangers, where he might have
fall'n with the Honour agreeable to the Greatness of
his Character, came at last to lose his Life misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102323:199"/>
by the Hands of three or four Villains; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now in the <hi>58th</hi> Year of his Age. This happened
near two Years after his Breach with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and this
cut off the second Head of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and
made way for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Absolute Power soon after;
and this hapned in the <hi>706th</hi> Year of the City,
<hi>A. M.</hi> 3957, about 12 Years after the beginning of
the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and 46 before our Saviour's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>

especially in the last, which Advantage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to pursue to the utmost; and knowing that all
his Enemies Hopes were lodg'd in the Person of
<hi>Pompey,</hi> he follow'd him with his usual Diligence:
And as tho' Fortune was resolv'd never to forsake
him, <hi>Cassius</hi> retreating into <hi>Asia</hi> with a Fleet of 60
Sail, fell in among <hi>Caesar</hi>'s little Barks he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for his Troops; and tho' he might easily have
ruin'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Presence and Behaviour so
over-aw'd him, that he immediately surrender'd
himself with all his Navy. <hi>Caesar</hi> shortly after ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Alexandria</hi> with two Legions and 800 Horse,
in ten Galleys of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and a few Ships of <hi>Asia,</hi>
ordering the rest of his Men to follow. Tho' these
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102323:199"/>
Forces were very inconsiderable, the Legions being
reduc'd to 3200 Men, yet the Confidence he had
in his Victories, and the high Reputation they had
gain'd him, made him believe that he shou'd meet
with Obedience where-ever he cou'd find Men.
Upon his landing at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he was entertain'd
with the News of the Death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> whose
Head was presented to him, and his Ring which
he us'd for his Signet. This mournful Spectacle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
reviv'd the Thoughts of his former Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which with the sad Imagination of the fatal
Misfortunes that attend the greatest Men, drew
Tears from his Eyes, and made him turn away his
Face with Horrour, keeping the Ring, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the Messenger in a Moment. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to shew his Respect to this great Man, caus'd
a magnificent Sepulchre to be built by the Place
where he was murder'd, with a Temple which he
call'd <hi>The Temple of Wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his entry into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> having his
Axes and Fasces carry'd before him as Consul, the
Multitude were much offended, as they were at
his Landing, crying out, <hi>That the King's Authority was
diminish'd;</hi> which occasion'd <hi>Caesar</hi> to give Orders
for other Legions, which were enroll'd for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Service, to be brought to him out of <hi>Asia.</hi> In the
mean time, as an Argument of his Confidence, he
made great Entertainments, and assisted at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Philosophers, who were in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
within that City. But <hi>Photinus</hi> the Eunuch, who
came to <hi>Alexandria</hi> with the young King, daily gave
him fresh Marks of his Dissatisfaction and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of making use of Arms; till at length the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of this Person, and probably the Reputation
of the admirable Beauty of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> caus'd him to
declare publickly, <hi>That the Controversie between the
King and his Sister belong'd to the Cognisance of the People
of</hi> Rome, <hi>and consequently to himself as</hi> Consul, <hi>and the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102323:200"/>
rather, because old</hi> Problemy <hi>by his Will had left his eldest
Son and Daughter Heirs, and the People of</hi> Rome <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
Upon this Account he intended to make up
all Differences between 'em, and sent to 'em <hi>to have
'em rather to plead their Causes before him than to decide
the Controversie by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Photinus</hi> had the Administration of
the Kindgdom, and he disdain'd to come to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Proposals, but thereupon procur'd <hi>Acbillas</hi> to march
directly to <hi>Alexandria</hi> at the Head of 22000 stout
Men, many of 'em being <hi>Romans.</hi> This forc'd <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
to take great Care, after he had secur'd the King's
Person, to secure himself in the Town, not being
strong enough to stand 'em in the Field, and to cause
his own Quarters to be strongly fortify'd, where,
nevertheless, he was shortly after attack'd by <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.
Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers bravely repuls'd the Enemy,
whose chief Design was to get Possession of the 50
Ships and 22 Galleys which were in the Haven,
which oblig'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> after a long and doubtful Fight,
to possess himself of the <hi>Pharos,</hi> a Tower of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Structure in an Islet just by, and to set Fire
to those Vessels; the Flames whereof being driven
by the Wind upon some Houses nigh the Port, burnt
'em down, and among 'em unhappily consum'd one
of the best Libraries in the World, belonging to the
Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and consisting, as some Authors
report, of 700000 Volumes. The Port made <hi>Caesar</hi>
Master by Sea, tho' he was close shut up by Land,
and the People of the Town were generally against
him. In the mean time the young Princess <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
came to <hi>Caesar</hi> with much Danger and Difficulty;
she embark'd in a Shallp with only <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> one
of her Domesticks, with whom she arriv'd that
Night under the Castle of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and there <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollodorus</hi>
binding her up in a Packet of those Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
which he brought along with him, took
her upon his Back, and by that means deceiving
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102323:200"/>
the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Guards, carry'd her to <hi>Caesar. Caesar</hi>
was too sensible of the Charms of Beauty, not to
be touch'd with those of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was now in
the Prime of her Youth, and one of those
sprightly Beauties whereof every Feature had its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Grace: All which, join'd with an admirable
Wit, and a Voice so soft and bewitching, that even
that Perfection alone, without the help of her Eyes,
which were the finest in the World, inslav'd the
Hearts of all who heard her; nor cou'd <hi>Caesar</hi> refuse
her his, but at first sight shew'd himself of her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
Ptolemy</hi> her Brother quickly found it, and
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Uneasiness in his Love, made the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
more Turbulent; but he soon quell'd all, and
as <hi>Consul</hi> and Tutor to the young Princess, in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly he read the Will of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and promis'd to put it in Execution.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Photinus</hi> was slain in the City by
a Tumult, and <hi>Ganymedes</hi> the Eunuch, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of assisting <hi>Arsione,</hi> King <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s youngest Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and by declaring her <hi>Queen,</hi> had caus'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>
to be slain, and procur'd himself to be made
General of the Army, who assuming the said Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
continu'd the Siege with much Vigour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<hi>Caesar</hi> to great Extremities by spoiling all his
fresh Water, which he soon remedy'd by his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Diligence, and digging abundance of Wells.
<hi>Caesar</hi> began now to expect his Succours with Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and being inform'd that the <hi>24th</hi> Legion was
arriv'd on the Confines of <hi>Africk,</hi> but cou'd not
come up by reason of the Winds, he embark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d with
his whole Fleet, but with only his Mariners, and set
forward to meet it. The Enemy knowing that he was
without Soldiers, atrack'd him; but he soon worst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'em, join'd his Legion, and return'd to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
This first Fight astonish'd the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi>
nevertheless they resitted, and came against <hi>Caesar</hi>
with a stronger Fleet than before, but were again
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102323:201"/>
routed, and forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to fly under the Peer of <hi>Pharos.
Caesar</hi> was only Master of the Tower, and making
an Attack upon the Peer with some little Success,
was nevertheless at last repuls<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

that not being able to hinder his Soldiers from

                     </gap>d
himself by swimming, but with so much Presence
of Mind, that he lost none of his Papers, which he
held out of the Water with one Hand, to preserve
'em from wetting, nor yet his Coat Armour, which
he carried in his Teeth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> finding they were not able by
Force to drive out <hi>Caesar,</hi> had recourse to their old
Arts of Dissimulation, demanding their King from
him, pretending, <hi>That they were weary of the Command
of</hi> Ganymedes <hi>and a Girl, and that were desirous of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Peace with the</hi> Romans <hi>under the Authority of their
lawful Prince. Caesar</hi> was sensible of their perfidious
Temper, but finding the War might be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and not much more dangerous, presently
deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Forces against him. But at this time <hi>Mithridates</hi>
of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> a Man of noble Birth, of brave Spirit,
and great Fidelity to <hi>Caesar,</hi> came with an Army to
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Assistance. He first took <hi>Pelusium</hi> by the
Way, and went to pass the River <hi>Nile</hi> at a Place

assist <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who before the Arrival of either,
had already beaten <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Men in one Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Caesar</hi> also defeated others before he cou'd join

took, and the next day attack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

save himself by Water, was drown'd. After this
Victory, <hi>Caesar</hi> met with no Opposition in all <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was the first that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102323:201"/>
so he made his Entry as Conqueror, and
pardon'd the Citizens in favour of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom
he establish'd Queen with her younger Brother <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi>
according to the Intent of their Father's Will,
driving out <hi>Arsione</hi> and <hi>Ganymedes.</hi> The rest of the
Days he staid in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he dedicated to the Love
he had for this beautiful Princess, and the Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
for his Victory. He spent much of his time
in her Company, and some Authors report that he

more agreeable to his Character and Philosophical

themselves by Sea, and others to relie upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Goodness, and embracing them with a more than
ordinary Tenderness that Night, his Discourses to

Maxim, <hi>That the Vertuous were only happy and free, but
wicked Men were always miserable and Slaves.</hi> His
Sons, suspecting his Intentions, at Supper took his
Sword from him, which he miss'd not when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,
but lying down in his Bed read <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
call'd <hi>Phaedo,</hi> concerning the Immortality of
the Soul. Then missing his Sword, he was very
angry and dissatisfy'd till it was brought him; then
feeling the Point, he laid it by him, saying, <hi>I am
Master of my self.</hi> He then took his Book again,
which he had read twice over, and fell into a sound
Sleep; but just as Day began to appear, he took
his Sword, and thrust himself through the Breast,
which not despatching him, he staggering fell upon
his Bed, and at the same time threw down a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon which he had drawn some Geometrical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
At the Noise of this his Slaves came in,
and with their Cries also brought his Sons and Friends,
who found him weltring in his Blood, and his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
out of his Body: His Eyes were yet open, which
caus'd his Physician to ease him upon his Bed; then
putting up his Bowels, which were yet unhurt, he

the Preparations for his Triumph upon four
successive Days; the first design'd for the Triumph
over <hi>Gaul,</hi> shew'd in a great many Tables the Names
of 300 Nations and 800 Cities, conquer'd by the
Death of a Million of Foes, whom he had defeated
in several Battels. The second Triumph was over
<hi>Aegypt.</hi> The third shew'd the Defeat of <hi>Pharnaces</hi>
in <hi>Asia.</hi> And the fourth that of King <hi>Iuba</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick;</hi>
which Triumphs were over Foreigners, not

and all the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers follow'd their great
General crown'd with Laurels, and in that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
he went to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the Steps whereof he
mounted upon his Knees, forty Elephants being
rang'd on each Side, carrying great Candlesticks,
fill'd with Flambeaus. The Silver Vessels, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Goldsmith's Work, which were us'd in these
Triumphs, amounted to 65000 Talents, which is
above twelve Millions of our Money, besides 1822
Crowns of Gold, weighing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 15033 <hi>l.</hi> which were
Presents that the Princes and Cities had made him
after his Victories, according to the Customs of those
Times. Out of these Summs he paid his Soldiers,
besides what he had promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d them in the beginning
of the Civil Wars. To every one 150 Pounds of
our Money, as much more to the Centurions, and
twice as much as that to the Tribunes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of the Cavalry; and for their Retreat after
the Wars, he gave them Inheritances in several
Places separated from <hi>Italy.</hi> The People also were
sensible of his Bounty, for he distributed to each
particular Person ten Bushels of Corn, and ten
Pounds of Oil, and added 100 <hi>Denarii</hi> to the 300
he had promis'd 'em before. Atfer this he nobly
entertain'd the whole People at 22000 several Tables,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:102323:205"/>
and that nothing might be wanting to the Pomp
and Magnificence of these Feasts, he caus'd 2000
Gladiators to fight before the People, and made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of Sea and Land-Fights of four or five
Thousand Men of a side, besides all sorts of Plays
and Shows. These Entertainments drew so many
People to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the greatest part of 'em
were forc'd to lie in the open Air, and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were stif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed in the Press; among the rest, two
Senators.</p>
                  <p>Many great Honours were after this conferr'd
upon <hi>Caesar,</hi> among which, was that of <hi>Master of
Manners;</hi> as if the Name of <hi>Censor</hi> was too mean,
for three Years; all joyning to shew their great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
in preferring him, some out of Love and
Respect, others out of Fear and Flattery: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
many began to dread the Severities of <hi>Marius</hi>
and <hi>Sylla;</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi>'s extraordinary Civility to both
Parties, and the Greatness of his Nature, in a great
measure freed 'em from any such Fears. He began
now to settle the Common-wealth, and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
new Laws: He committed the Power of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
to the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Equites</hi> alone; and both
by Laws, and his own Care, he restrain'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
Way of Living of rich Persons. And because
the City was manifestly exhausted, by reason of
Multitudes quitting it, he propos'd Rewards to all
such as had many Children. Then considering that
by his long Command in <hi>Gaul,</hi> he himself had Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of establishing an extraordinary Power,
by a Law he ordain'd, That no <hi>Praetor</hi> shou'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
above a Year in his Province, nor a <hi>Consul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two Years after the Expiring of his Office.
Moreover, to shew that nothing shou'd escape his
Care, he undertook to regulate the <hi>Roman</hi> Year,
which was at this time very much confounded; and
tho' <hi>Numa,</hi> the second King of <hi>Rome,</hi> had bestow'd
much Pains about it, yet still the Reckoning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:102323:206"/>
to Lunar Months, and the odd eleven Days and
a quarter, caus'd a great many Inconveniencies.
Whereupon <hi>Caesar,</hi> after his consulting the most able
Astronomers, being also himself very well instructed
in that Science, whereof he had written, regulated
the Year according to the Course of the Sun, allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to each Year 365 Days, and adding one Day
more every fourth Year, which was call'd the <hi>Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sextile;</hi>
and this is the Method which we to this
Day follow, and goes still by the Name of the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Account</hi> and the <hi>Old Stile,</hi> whereas the <hi>New Stile</hi>
is call'd the <hi>Gregorian Account.</hi> In this same Year
flourish'd <hi>Catullus</hi> the Poet, one of the principal <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatists</hi> of all the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IV. While <hi>Caesar</hi> was thus employ'd in the Affairs
of the Common-wealth, the two Sons of <hi>Pompey</hi>
had fortify'd themselves in <hi>Spain;</hi> and as the People
still passionately affected the Memory of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they soon gather'd together a powerful Army;
they also had very good Officers, and among the
rest <hi>Labienus,</hi> which oblig'd <hi>Caesar</hi> to go in Person
to oppose their Proceedings; tho' not without some
Unwillingness, by reason that his beloved Mistress
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> was now at <hi>Rome.</hi> He was now just made
<hi>Consul</hi> again,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dic.</hi> lxxiv Annual. <hi>U. C.</hi> 709.</note> and likewise <hi>Dictator</hi> for another Year;
and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who was <hi>Consul</hi> with him, he chose
for his <hi>Master of the Horse. Caesar</hi> proceeded in his
Expedition with his wonted Vigour and Celerity,
and arriv'd in <hi>Spain</hi> before the Enemy so much as
imagin'd it. <hi>Cneius,</hi> the eldest of the two <hi>Pompey</hi>'s,
had laid Siege to the City of <hi>Ulla,</hi> and <hi>Sextus</hi> the
younger Brother was in <hi>Corduba</hi> with a strong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<hi>Caesar,</hi> to raise the Siege, and to give some
Jealousie to <hi>Cneius,</hi> advanc'd towards <hi>Corduba,</hi> which
occasion'd him to raise the Siege before <hi>Ulla,</hi> and
come and oppose <hi>Caesar;</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> finding he cou'd
not draw him to a Battel, went and invested <hi>Atteg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:102323:206"/>
a Place of great Importance, and full of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
This Siege lasted some considerable time, and
the <hi>Pompeys</hi> endeavour'd to throw in Succours into
the Town, but in vain, till at last it was constrain'd
to eapitulate. <hi>Caesar</hi> being Master of this, several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Places submitted to him; and the <hi>Pompeys</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down, and fearing the rest shou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
were resolv'd to come to a general Battel, their
Army being now encamp'd in the Plains of <hi>Munda,</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi>'s not far distant.</p>
                  <p>Both Generals were equally impatient to come to
an Ingagement, so that <hi>Cneius</hi> drew up his Men by
Break of Day, well posting himself upon a Hill,
and the Exactness of their Order shew'd his Troops
to great Advantage, especially his Cavalry, who
were very well arm'd. <hi>Caesar</hi> with great Art drew
up his Troops likewise, and after he had advanc'd
a little Distance from his Trenches, made a Halt,
expecting the Enemy to come down from the Hill.
This Delay made <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers begin to murmur,
and so incourag'd those of <hi>Cneius,</hi> that they advanc'd
upon the declining part of the Hill; so both
sides gave a Shout, and the Battel began. This was
extraordinary Sharp and Dreadful on both sides,
those on <hi>Caesar</hi>'s side were extreamly incited by the
Hopes of putting an End to all their Labours by
this Battel, and those on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s side fought out of
Necessity and Desperation, most of 'em expecting
no Pardon, as having their Lives formerly given 'em,
when they had been overthrown with <hi>Afranius</hi> and
<hi>Petreius.</hi> The first Shock was manag'd on both sides
with so much Courage, that <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men, who had
been almost always us'd to Conquer, found here a
Stop put to their Fierceness; the Battel continu'd for
many Hours very obstinate, and <hi>Caesar</hi> was never
in so great Danger as now; he threw himself seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times with great Rage and Fury amongst the
midst of the Enemy, crying out to his Men, and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:102323:207"/>
asking 'em, <hi>If they were not asham'd to deliver him into
the Hands of Boys?</hi> So well did he encourage them
by his Speeches, but much more by a thousand brave
and noble Actions which he perform'd himself; that
at last with much Difficulty and a long Time, he
overthrew the Enemy, and kill'd 30000 upon the
Spot. This Battel was so fierce and dangerous, that
<hi>Caesar</hi> often said, <hi>That all other Places he fought for his
Glory, but at</hi> Munda <hi>for his Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All his Ensigns were taken, and <hi>Varus</hi> and <hi>Labienius</hi>
slain in the Battel. <hi>Cneius</hi> with 150 Horse escap'd to
<hi>Carteia,</hi> from whence, thinking to save himself by
Sea, he was forc'd by <hi>Didius, Caesar</hi>'s Lieutenant, to
return to Land, and being besieg'd within a Tower,
was attack'd so vigorously, that he was forsaken by
his People, and slain in a Cave where he had hid
himself. But his Brother <hi>Sextus</hi> escaping from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi>
so well conceal'd himself, that <hi>Caesar</hi> cou'd not
find him. All <hi>Spain</hi> immediately submitted to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and he exacted great Contributions from all the
Enemies Cities, under Pretence of punishing their
Rebellion. After which he return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> with
great Joy and Satisfaction, that he had at last brought
under Submission that Common-wealth which gave
Laws to the greatest part of the World. He enter'd
<hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, but this Triumph was by no
means attended with any joyful Acclamations of
the People, who were much concern'd to see the
Memory of their belov'd <hi>Pompey</hi> insulted over, and
the Race almost extirpated of one of the greatest
Men in <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Caesar</hi> did it the rather upon the
Account of bringing the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions into
Peace and Subjection, and the perfect finishing
the Civil War; which, tho' it continu'd not much
above four Years, had been so destructive to
the <hi>Roman</hi> People, that at a <hi>Census</hi> just before
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s last Expedition, there were found but one
hundred and fifty thousand Heads of Families in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:102323:207"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas in that <hi>Lustrum</hi> before, there were
three hundred and twenty thousand.</p>
                  <p>V. <hi>Caesar</hi> had now rais'd himself far above all <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and above all Mortals in that Age, by his
wonderful Acts, having subdu'd and conquer'd the
best Parts of the World, in almost as short a time
as others cou'd reasonably travel those Countries.
And now the Senate again began to conferr new
Honours upon him, and those greater than ever:
They made him <hi>Dictator in perpetuum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dic.</hi> lxxv. Perpetual <hi>U. C.</hi> 709.</note> 
                     <hi>Consul</hi> for Ten
Years, subjected all Magistrates, even <hi>Plebeian,</hi> to his
Power; and ordain'd that he alone shou'd command
the Armies, and raise Money, which made him
Sovereign Prince or King in effect. Among other
Titles he had that of <hi>Deliverer</hi> given him, and so
was enter'd in the <hi>Fasti,</hi> and a Temple erected to
<hi>Liberty;</hi> but above all,<note place="margin">Imperator.</note> that of <hi>Imperator,</hi> not in that
sense as Generals were wont to have it given 'em
by their Soldiers after some worthy Exploit, but as
it signify'd the greatest Authority in the Common-wealth.
From this <hi>Iulius</hi> was deriv'd the Name of
<hi>Imperator</hi> or <hi>Emperour,</hi> as likewise that of <hi>Caesar</hi> to his
Successours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this was the first beginning of the
<hi>Imperial</hi> State of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' it was not perfectly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
till some Years after. <hi>Caesar</hi> was likewise made
<hi>Censor</hi> for his Life time, so that now most of the
Magistracies seem'd to centre in him. As for the
Consulship, he divested himself of that for a certain
time, and created <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Trebonius</hi> Consuls for the
rest of the Year, of whom it happen'd that <hi>Fabius</hi>
dy'd the last Day of his Magistracy, and <hi>Caesar</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
<hi>Canivius</hi> for the remaining Hours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Cicero</hi> jestingly writ in one of his Epistles, <hi>That
during the Consulship of</hi> Canivius, <hi>not a Man din'd; yet
no Harm was committed in that time, for he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
vigilant, and ne'er slept throughout his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship.</hi>
From this time forward the Consulship grew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheaper,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:102323:208"/>
and few held it a whole Year, especially,
when all its Authority and ancient Dignity, was,
in a manner, swallow'd up by the <hi>Imperial</hi> Power
soon after.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> had order'd the Consulship, but for
other Magistrates he pretended he wou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
himself with 'em but leave 'em to the People
to be nam'd, according to the ancient Custom; but
it prov'd only a Pretence, for he made them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and sent 'em into the Provinces without the
ancient Way of <hi>Sortition.</hi> In other Magistrates the
same Number was observ'd; only the <hi>Praetors</hi> upon
the account of the Largeness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were encreas'd to sixteen,<note place="margin">16 Praetors. 40 Quaestors</note> and the <hi>Quaestors</hi> to
forty. Besides he had no other Way to gratifie those
to whom he had made large Promises, and this
caus'd him to admit many into the Senate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Distinction, whether the Person was a <hi>Soldier</hi> or
a <hi>Libertine</hi> by Original; so that the Number of the
Senate,<note place="margin">900 Senaors.</note> by this means, arose to nine hundred. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he also brought into the Ranks of <hi>Patritians,
Consulares,</hi> and of those who had born other Offices;
which became a Custom to those who were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Emperours.</hi> To his Friends he gave much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
both in Money and Lands, which was very
pleasing to them who made their Designs; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
took it very hainously, and testify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
either by Words or Libels. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of publick Money was now translated

                  </p>
                  <p>For the following Year <hi>Caesar</hi> enter'd upon the

                     <note place="margin">U. C. 710.</note> who was likewise
his <hi>Master of the Horse;</hi> and now he more closely
apply'd himself to the Business of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:102323:208"/>
than ever. He first took care to pardon all
such as had been in Arms against him, and greatly
tax'd the Cruelty of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and thereby obtain'd as
great a Name for Clemency, as before he had for
Valour. Then, to shew his generous Temper, he
caus'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statues to be set up again, to shew
that he esteem'd a great Soul and a magnanimous
Spirit even in his greatest Enemy; which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<hi>Cicero</hi> to observe in his Writing, <hi>That</hi> Caesar <hi>by
restoring</hi> Pompey's <hi>Statues secur'd his own.</hi> In this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Iulian</hi> Year, his Collegue <hi>Anthony</hi> procur'd by a
Law, that the Month <hi>Quintilis</hi> shou'd in honour of
his Name, be afterwards call'd <hi>Iuly;</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laws were made. In the mean time, as he was
no ways belov'd by those who were greatest in the
Senate; tho' his Ordinances had no other Design
than the publick Good, they forbore not to vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie
him by their Raileries. Now, tho' <hi>Caesar</hi> had Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their several Discourses, he bore it all with
so great a Moderation, that when some other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had yet the Boldness to violate his Reputation
by Libels, he never so much as enquir'd after them.
All his Designs shew'd the Greatness of his Soul; he
made a Proposition for adorning of the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
with a magnificent Temple consecrated to <hi>Mars,</hi>
and with a Theatre, and likewise the building of a
new <hi>Curia</hi> or <hi>Parish</hi> to be call'd <hi>Iulia.</hi> He rebuilt
<hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> sending Colonies to both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
He undertook to level several Mountains in <hi>Italy,</hi>
to drein the <hi>Pontine</hi> Marshes near <hi>Rome,</hi> and to
empty the Lakes, Works of prodigious Charge;
and likewise design'd to dig through the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of
<hi>Peloponnesus</hi> by <hi>Corinth.</hi> After these, he design'd an
Expedition against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to revenge the death
of <hi>Crassus,</hi> and they being conquer'd, to enter thro'
<hi>Hircania,</hi> along the Banks of the <hi>Caspian Sea</hi> into
<hi>Scythia,</hi> to open himself a Way through <hi>Germany</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Gaul,</hi> and so return to <hi>Rome:</hi> But all these vast
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:102323:209"/>
Designs soon came to an End, enjoying his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority but five Months.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi>'s good Fortune, which had appear'd by so
many Victories, his Merit and great Abilities, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Affection of the People, and the Love
of his Soldiers, had now rais'd him to a Degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other <hi>Romans.</hi> But as it usually happens in
Common-wealths, where overy one valuing himself
upon his own Merit, looks upon absolute Command
as a Right which he one Day in his Turn may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to; so it was now, for that his extraordinary
Advancement daily brought upon him the Jealousie
of the Senators. In the mean time, in an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
manner they continually flatter'd his Vanity
with new Honours, preferring him in his Life time
in some sort among the Gods, and declaring his
Person Sacred and Inviolable. They gave him the
Title of <hi>Father of his Country,</hi> stamp'd Money with
his Image, order'd publick Sacrifices on his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and his Statue to be set up in all Cities and in
all the Temples at <hi>Rome.</hi> Some Authors have
reported, that he procur'd these Honours by his
Authority, others, that they were freely bestow'd
upon him. However his accepting of all that was
offer'd him, caus'd him much Hatred from many,
which was discover'd more plainly one Day when
the Senate had decreed him some new Honours,
and came all in a Body to the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi>
where he was, to acquaint him with their Decree;
and he, whether out of a Mistake or Design, rose
not up, but receiv'd 'em sitting; which Neglect
much offended the Senators, and caus'd 'em to talk
very freely and publickly about it, particularly say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>That he plainly affected the Title of King:</hi> He had
indeed the Power in effect, but only wanted the
Name, which was odious to the <hi>Romans. Caesar,</hi>
who well knew the Effects of that Aversion, very
cautiously defended himself from that Odium; and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:102323:209"/>
one Day, when some People call'd him <hi>Lord</hi> and
<hi>King,</hi> he made Answer, <hi>That he was</hi> Caesar. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
he often let some Discourses fall, which
much promoted the Belief People had of his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
particularly, <hi>That a Republick was nothing but
a meer Name and Notion, and that</hi> Sylla <hi>had discovered
great Ignorance in laying down the Office of</hi> Dictator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> shortly after gave a fresh Occasion of Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
to the People, by his displacing the <hi>Tribunes</hi> for
imprisoning some Persons who had put Diadems up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Statues. And by another Instance soon after
he still more plainly perceiv'd the Affections of the
People, at the Celebration of the Feasts call'd <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percalia,</hi>
where he himself assisted at the Show, seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Tribunal in a Chair of Gold, and his
Triumphal Ornaments. <hi>Anthony</hi> passing through the
People, who open'd to make him way, went up to
the Tribunal, and presented a Crown to <hi>Caesar;</hi> some
clapp'd their Hands as if they approv'd of it, but
when <hi>Caesar</hi> put the Crown back, there was a general
Applause: <hi>Anthony</hi> offer'd it a second time, but still
with as little Marks of Satisfaction from the People;
<hi>Caesar</hi> again refus'd it, which was follow'd with loud
Acclamations on all sides. <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had laid this
Design before, now plainly understood their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and thereupon rising, commanded the Crown
to be carry'd to the <hi>Capitol;</hi> nevertheless he was so
concern'd, and so little Master of his Disorder, that
he said that Night to his Friends, <hi>That he wou'd freely
offer his Throat to any Man that wou'd cut it.</hi> And tho'
he had a thousand Testimonies of the Hatred he
lay under, he so abandon'd himself to his Designs,
that from this Moment he neglected all manner of
Means of securing himself against his Enemies.
When he was advis'd by some not to trust <hi>Brutus</hi>
too far, he open'd his Breast, saying, <hi>Do you believe
that</hi> Brutus <hi>cares for such poor Pillage as this?</hi> He was
sometimes heard to say, <hi>That he had rather die once by
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:102323:210"/>
Treason, that to be so miserable as always to live in fear
of it.</hi> And at another time, <hi>That the Republick had
more Interest in his Preservation than himself; that he had
gain'd Glory and Power enough, but after his Death, the
Common-wealth wou'd be more harass'd with Civil Wars
then ever it had been.</hi> And one Day being at Supper
with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> as his Friends disputed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
what Death was easiest, he reply'd to 'em,
<hi>That which is most sudden and least foreseen.</hi> He disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Company of <hi>Spanish</hi> Guards, and contented
himself with the Protection of his Friends, which
Proceeding of his much facilitated an Enterprize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Life soon after.</p>
                  <p>The Design upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Life was carry'd on with
extraordinary Caution and Secrecy, tho' above three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Senators enter'd into this Conspiracy, the
Principal whereof was <hi>Brutus,</hi> whose Life <hi>Caesar</hi>
had sav'd after the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
both <hi>Praetors</hi> at this time: The Name of <hi>Brutus</hi> had
been famous in <hi>Rome</hi> ever since. <hi>Brutus</hi> the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
under the Foot of whose Statue was found
written, <hi>Wou'd to Heaven thou wert alive,</hi> and certain
Billets were thrown into the <hi>Praetor</hi>'s Tribunal, in
these Words, Brutus, <hi>thou art asleep, and not a true</hi>
Brutus. <hi>Cassius</hi> was Author of most of these things,
and he hated <hi>Caesar</hi> upon several Accounts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
for his naming <hi>Brutus</hi> the eldest <hi>Praetor,</hi> when
he was above him in Age, and for his hindring him
from giving a Publick Show to the People. His
Behaviour towards <hi>Caesar</hi> gave him sufficient Reasons
to suspect him; and when his Friends advis'd him
to beware of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Dolabella,</hi> he told 'em,
<hi>That it was not those persum'd and plump Sparks that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
distrusted, but those pale and meagre Gentlemen.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
he still prepar'd for his Expedition against
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and caus'd sixteen Legions to march,
and 10000 Horse for his Passage into <hi>Asia.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to depart four Days after, when the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:102323:210"/>
spread a Report, That according to the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill</hi>'s
Oracles, the <hi>Parthians</hi> cou'd not be overcome
but by a King; and upon this Pretence <hi>Cotta</hi> was to
propose the giving him that Title to the Senate. <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
took this Occasion to go and visit <hi>Brutus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
of him, <hi>If be wou'd be at the Senate-House
when</hi> Caesar'<hi>s Friends were to propose the declaring of him
King? Brutus</hi> told him, <hi>that he wou'd be absent at that
time. But,</hi> reply'd <hi>Cassius, suppose you are call'd thither?
Then,</hi> answer'd <hi>Brutus, I shou'd think it my Duty to
speak, oppose, yea and die too, rather than part with the
Liberty of</hi> Rome. <hi>Ah,</hi> reply'd <hi>Cassius, what generous</hi>
Roman <hi>wou'd suffer you to die for his Liberty? You are
ignorant,</hi> Brutus, <hi>who you are, if you imagine that those Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
thrown into the Tribunal came from less than the most
Illustrious and Bravest Men of</hi> Rome. <hi>From other</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<hi>they demand Games, Shows, and Plays, but from
you, whose very Name is a Terror to Tyrants, they cry for
the Ruine and Downfal of Arbitrary Power, being ready
to expose themselves to the utmost Hazards, in expectation
of your auspicious Aid.</hi> After this Conversation they
parted; and <hi>Brutus</hi> for some time after appear'd
much discompos'd in his Thoughts, which occasion'd
his Wife <hi>Porcia,</hi> being in Bed with him, earnestly
to enquire the Reason of his Trouble. <hi>Brutus</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she wou'd disclose the Secret if urg'd to it by
Torture, <hi>Porcia</hi> immediately wounded her self on
the Thigh, and with a Masculine Courage let him
see, <hi>That she fear'd no Torments, nor cou'd act any Thing
below</hi> Cato'<hi>s Daughter;</hi> by which means she learn'd
the whole Design, and became one of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.
The Name of <hi>Brutus,</hi> whose Person was
much esteem'd, ingag'd a great many in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy;
so they resolv'd to put their Design in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the very <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and in the Hall
of the Senate.</p>
                  <p>A great many Prodigies and Dreams foretold this
Misfortune to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Spurina,</hi> a famous <hi>Augur,</hi>
                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:102323:211"/>
told him, <hi>That great Dangers threaten'd him upon the</hi>
Ides <hi>of</hi> March. He dreamt the same Night, that he
was carry'd above the Clouds, and that he shook
Hands with <hi>Iove;</hi> and his Wife <hi>Calpurnia</hi> also
dreamt, that her Husband was assassinated in her
Arms, the Doors of the Chamber opening at the
same time of their own Accord with much Noise.
This last Accident somewhat confounded him, and
his Wife by her Prayers and Tears, prevail'd so,
that he wou'd not go abroad that Day. But ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Brutus,</hi> call'd <hi>Decimus,</hi> who was one of the
Conspirators, tho' of the Number of his intimate
Friends, caus'd him to change his Resolution, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, <hi>He was much expected at the Senate, and it
wou'd be a great Shame for him not to venture out of
Doors, but when it shou'd please</hi> Calpurnia <hi>to dream fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably:</hi>
So <hi>Decimus</hi> carry'd him almost by Force
out of his Lodgings, and as if every thing seem'd
to contribute to his Destruction, a Slave, who came
to give him Advice of the Conspiracy, cou'd not
get up to him by reason of the Croud of People
that surrounded him. <hi>Artimedorus</hi> his Host and
Friend, having given him a Letter to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he mingl'd it without reading of it, among other
Papers that were given him: And <hi>Lena,</hi> who was
one of the Conspirators, entertaining him a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time in private as he came out of his Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the others, who believ'd themselves discover'd,
thought already of killing themselves with the Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which they had under their Robes, when <hi>Lena</hi>
quitting <hi>Caesar,</hi> and kissing his Hand, gave them to
understand, that he thank'd him for some Favour
which he came to obtain.</p>
                  <p>The Assembly of the Senate was at this time held
in a Place which <hi>Pompey</hi> had built for that Purpose,
and from thence was call'd the <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
where was to be seen his Statue in Marble, rais'd
upon a Pedestal. <hi>Caesar,</hi> as he was entring, met <hi>Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:102323:211"/>
and smiling told him, <hi>The</hi> Ides <hi>of</hi> March <hi>were
come; Yes,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Augur, but they are not past.</hi>
As soon as he had taken his Place, the Conspirators
mov'd towards him under Pretence of saluting him,
and <hi>Tullius Cymber</hi> approach'd to ask Pardon for his
Brother who was then in Exile: <hi>Caesar</hi> deferr'd the
Matter, and put back <hi>Cymber,</hi> who press'd upon him
so far as to take hold on both sides of his Robe; and
when <hi>Caesar</hi> cry'd out, <hi>That this was Violence, Casca,</hi>
who stood behind him, gave him the first Stab with
a Poniard nigh the Shoulder, but the Weapon glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
the Wound was not Mortal. <hi>Caesar</hi> struck
<hi>Casca</hi> through the Arm with his Dagger, crying out,
<hi>Vile Traitor, what do you mean? Casca,</hi> on the other
side, call'd his Brother, and <hi>Caesar</hi> wou'd have rais'd
himself, but he receiv'd a mortal Wound in his
Breast; and all the Conspirators charg'd upon him
together with so much Fury, that many of 'em were
wounded themselves. He nevertheless made great
Resistance, rushing and leaping among 'em like a
Lion, till perceiving <hi>Brutus</hi> with his Dagger in his
Hand, he struggled no more, but cry'd, <hi>What, my
Son</hi> Brutus, <hi>and thou too?</hi> Then covering his Face
with his Robe, and drawing his Skirts down to his
Knees, that he might fall decently, he sunk down at
the Foot of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue, having receiv'd three
and twenty Wounds, and the rest of the Senate
looking on with Wonder and Amazement, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to assist him.</p>
                  <p>Thus fell the great <hi>Iulius Caesur</hi> in the <hi>56th</hi> Year
of his Age, in the Court of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and at the Feet
of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue; a Person of the greatest Soul,
the most magnanimous Spirit, and of the most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Accomplishments and Abilities, that <hi>Rome,</hi> or
perhaps, the World ever saw; whether we consider
him in his Care and Vigilance, in his Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
or in his Knowledge and Learning; all which
noble Qualities made him belov'd and reverenc'd by
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:102323:212"/>
the People, honour'd and ador'd by his Friends, and
esteem'd and admir'd even by his Enemies. And set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside his Ambition, which was the Fault of the
Times as well as his Temper, he was never much or
justly tax'd with any great Vice but that of Women.
His Death put an end to the first <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Power occasion'd by the first <hi>Triumvirate,</hi>
but did not re-establish the Consular Authority, nor

its Ruine shortly after, with as great Miseries
as <hi>Rome</hi> ever suffer'd. It hapned in the <hi>710th</hi> Year
of the City, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3961, about 16 Years after the

and Disorder hapned among the Senate and
People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Conspirators soon perceiv'd
that their Fact was not like to meet with the general
Approbation which some expected. All the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
who were not Accomplices, fled with such Haste
and Precipitation from the Assembly, that some of
'em were in Danger of their Lives as they press'd
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:102323:212"/>
out of Doors; and the People, alarm'd at the News,
left all their several Employments, ran tumultuously
about all parts of the City, some for Information,
some for Safety, and others for Plunder. Which
Disturbances caus'd the Conspirators all to retire to
the <hi>Capitol,</hi> to which they were guarded by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Number of Gladiators belonging to <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Brutus:</hi> What they gave out to justifie themselves
to the People was <hi>Liberty;</hi> but that Pretence was not
much regarded by them, for they had been so us'd
to submit of late, and were so chang'd from their
ancient jealous and vigorous Temper, that they much
more dreaded the Effects of Poverty than Subjection.
<hi>Anthony</hi> now Consul, and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> were extreamly
enrag'd at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Death, and were resolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it to the utmost; therefore the latter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
got to a Legion of his just by, and led 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> where <hi>Anthony,</hi> as Consul,
commanded 'em. This much surpriz'd the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
and put 'em upon sending Deputies to <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> desiring 'em, <hi>To consider the sad Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a Division at this time; that no Hatred to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
<hi>Person had put them upon that Design, but only their
hearty Loves to their Country, which had already been so
drain'd by Civil Wars, that any new Disunion must carry
off the miserable Remainder; that they believ'd them also
too generous to let any particular Hatred transport them to
the Prejudice of the Publick. Anthony</hi> began to consider,

                     </gap>d,
and endeavour to get over <hi>Decimus</hi>'s Soldiers; and
for that reason return'd Answer, <hi>That tho' their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and their Oaths had engag'd 'em to revenge</hi> Caesar'<hi>s
Death, and tho' they thought it more honourable to live
without Reproach among a few good Men, than to
draw upon themselves the Miseries due to Falshood; yet
they were not obstinate, but were content to have the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:102323:213"/>
assembl'd, that they might be govern'd by so many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
and discerning Persons:</hi> Which Answer was
receiv'd with much Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The Senate was immediately call'd, where a great
many Debates arose, and several Opinions were
urg'd, which at last terminated in this, <hi>That they had
but two things to chuse, either to declare</hi> Caesar <hi>a Tyrant,
or that his Murderers stood in need of Pardon. Anthony</hi>
industriously oppos'd the former, urging, <hi>That if the
Memory of</hi> Caesar <hi>were condemn'd, all his Orders ought to
be cancell'd; and that wou'd be in Effect to proclaim so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Illustrious Men as he had rais'd, unworthy of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
which, besides drawing upon themselves the Contempt
of other Nations, wou'd infallibly turn to the Confusion of
the Common-wealth.</hi> After many violent Heats and
Disturbances in the House, and great Tumults at the
Doors, the Senate at last pass'd an Act of Oblivion
for all what was past, and ratify'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
with this Reason enter'd, <hi>Because it was requisite
for the Good of the Common-wealth.</hi> This Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion
brought Matters to a more peaceable Posture;

read before the Body of the People, which he
knew wou'd have a considerable Influence upon 'em;
which Danger the Conspirators had been so sensible
of, that they us'd their utmost Endeavours to hinder
its being read. In the Will it appear'd that <hi>Octavius</hi>
the Grandson of <hi>Iulia, Caesar</hi>'s Sister, was adopted
to take upon him his Name, and constituted Heir
of three parts in four of all his Estate, and <hi>Pinarius</hi>
and <hi>Pedius</hi> of the other fourth Part. To the <hi>Roman</hi>
People he left the Gardens which he had on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and to every Citizen, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
a certain Summ of Money. Among his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Heirs, who were to inherit in case of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:102323:213"/>
he substituted <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> one of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
Several others also who had dipp'd their hands
in his Blood, were nam'd for Guardians for his Son,
in case he had left one. These Tokens of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Goodness, and his great Affection for the People,
began to move the Multitude extreamly; but <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
being an Heir provok'd the Indignation of the whole
Assembly.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after this, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Body was brought
forth with extraordinary Pomp and Solemnity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born by some of the most. Illustrious of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
It was set down in the middle of the <hi>Forum,</hi>
with a Guard of Soldiers; in which Place was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a little Temple of gilded Wood according to
the Model of that of <hi>Venus;</hi> and in this Temple
was a Bed of Ivory, magnificently adorn'd with
Curtains of Gold and Purple Trophies, and the
Robe that he wore when he was assassinated. All
the People ran hastily to see this Sight, weeping and
lamenting afresh, and those who bore Arms made
deep Complaints, as if they demanded Vengeance.
<hi>Anthony</hi> ascending the Place, began <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Funeral
Oration in this manner; Romans, <hi>tho' I alone present
myself to celebrate the Memory of this great Man, whose
Body you see thus mangled here before ye, yet I can read in
each Man's Look the Affections of his Mind, and the
Thoughts of his Heart, which give nobler Praises than
my Tongue can express: So that when I shall recount to
you the Extent of his glorious Actions, the Variety of his
noble Vertues, and the Number of the deserv'd Honours
which the Senate and you have conferr'd upon him, I shall
not be so much the Publisher of my own Sentiments, as the
Interpreter of Yours.</hi> Then he mention'd all his Titles
of Honour, his Dictatorship, his several Consulships,
with the most deserving Name of <hi>Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
from whence he proceeded to his Vertues,
praising his generous Courage, his exquisite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his free Spirit, and above all, his unbounded
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:102323:214"/>
Clemency. After which he repeated the Oath which
the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had made to <hi>Caesar,</hi> by which
they swore, <hi>That his Person shou'd be sacred and Inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and call'd the Gods to witness that they wou'd defend
it with the hazard of their Lives.</hi> But observing some
Alteration in several of the Senators, he concluded
with saying, <hi>That what had been done ought rather to be
forgotten, since it was the Crime of some Infernal Spirits,
Enemies to</hi> Rome, <hi>rather then Men; and nothing ought
further to be thought of, than the honouring the Memory of
this illustrious Hero, and placing him among the Immortal
Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the End of this Oration, one of the principal
Attendants, as if some Fury had possess'd him, tore
off <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Robe from the Trophy, and shew'd it to
the People, crying out, <hi>That it was the Spoil of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
belov'd of the Gods, and reverenc'd by the World even
to Adoration.</hi> This and several other things he spoke
in a most moving Tone, using many great Outcries
and strange Postures of Sorrow, which extreamly
stirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d up the People's Compassion. At the same
time was expos'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Image in Wax, which
mov'd it self by Springs, and shew'd the several
Wounds which he had receiv'd upon his Face and in
his Body, and this Sight transported the People even
to Madness, and made 'em cry out, <hi>That they wou'd
inflect the most cruel Punishments, and execute the most
dreadful Revenges upon the Heads of all his Murtherers.</hi>
Upon the lighting of the Pile, all the old Soldiers
who had serv'd under him, with an unexpressible
Grief, threw into the Fire all their Coronets, Pikes,
Bracelets, and other Tokens of Honours which he
had given 'em. A great many Ladies of Quality
also threw in their Children's Robes and Ornaments,
with every thing they had of Value about 'em. The
People ran and tore up the Benches and Seats of the
Magistrates just by, and after that with flaming
Brands from the Pile, ran desperately to set Fire to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:102323:214"/>
the Conspirators Houses; and meeting with one
<hi>Cinna,</hi> whom they mistook for another of that Name,
they immediately tore him in a thousand Pieces.
The Conspirators themselves being of the greatest
Families, and well guarded, with no great Trouble
repuls'd the People; but nevertheless so great was
the Rage and Threats of the People, that they
thought it much more safe to retire from the City.
All the Strangers in <hi>Rome</hi> mourn'd after their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
and more particularly the <hi>Iews,</hi> who watch'd
several Nights at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Pile. At last Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
were given him, and an Altar erected in the
Place of his Burning, where <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
call'd <hi>Augustus,</hi> caus'd a Temple to be built,
and a Pillar of Jasper, twenty Foot high, with this
Inscription, <hi>To the Father of his Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time that <hi>Caesar</hi> was kill'd, his Heir
and Adopted Son <hi>Octavius,</hi> afterwards call'd <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
was at <hi>Apollonia</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> who upon the first
News of the Murther, notwithstanding the earnest
Advice of his Friends to secure himself there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Rome</hi> with all speed, with a full Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to revenge his Death; not questioning but to
find <hi>Anthony</hi> both a Friend and Assistant in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
But <hi>Anthony</hi> now was so much chang'd, and
so busily employ'd in his Projects of raising and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
himself, that he cou'd hearken but little to
such a Proposal; and when <hi>Octavius</hi> publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
himself <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Heir, and demanded his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of <hi>Anthony,</hi> or at least some part of it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him with great Coldness, and Contempt of
his Youth, refusing to give him any upon several
Pretences. Yet neither <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Repulses, nor his
Friends Advices to the contrary, cou'd stop <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
from pursuing his Designs, who was now
about eighteen Years old, of a great Wit, a lofty
Mind, and of a most insinuating Conversation, and
had a Face so Comely and Graceful, that it acquir'd
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:102323:215"/>
him a Veneration from all Men. That he might
be certain to gain the People's Hearts, he sold all his
Inheritance to pay off the Legacies given 'em by
his Uncle <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will, which procur'd him much
Love, and <hi>Caesar</hi>'s old Soldiers flock'd to him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Numbers, whom he accepted of out of
Fear to <hi>Anthony,</hi> who daily became more Suspicious
both to the Senate and People. <hi>Octavius</hi> manag'd
his Affairs with so much Skill and Dexterity, that
those who before admir'd at his Boldness of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Anthony,</hi> were now as much surpriz'd at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Address and Authority. <hi>Anthony,</hi> on
the other side, being sensible of the passionate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the People had for <hi>Pompey,</hi> to curry Favour,
propos'd the promoting <hi>Sextus</hi> his only surviving
Son; that in requital of his Father's Estate confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
he might have an Allowance out of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and the same Command of the Seas and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
that his Father formerly had. This was receiv'd
with great Applause, and strait enacted; so <hi>Pompey</hi>
was call'd back into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he afterwards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
a sharp War against <hi>Octavius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> was still Restless, and resolv'd, if it were
possible, to procure some Province to be assign'd him,
that he might get the greater Authority; and the
Difference daily increasing between him and <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
he desir'd to command the six Legions which
lay in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and obtain'd them by deceiving
the Senate with a false Rumour, that the <hi>Getae</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Death, had invaded that Province:
And because the Senate shew'd great Unwillingness
to this Demand, and more Jealousie of his Power,
he endeavour d to satisfie 'em, by preferring a Law
against any Man's being <hi>Dictator</hi> for the future, and
making it Death for any to offer at it. These Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
he design'd to bring over into <hi>Italy</hi> to awe
and command all; and the better to effect this, he
preferr'd another Law for changing of Provinces,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:102323:215"/>
and by that procur'd <hi>Macedonia</hi> for his Brother <hi>C. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi>
which had been assign'd to <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> and
the <hi>Hither Gaul</hi> for himself, which had been allotted
to <hi>Decimus Brutus.</hi> The Senate wou'd by no means
admit of this Demand, but sent to <hi>D. Brutus to
strengthen himself against the Pretensions of</hi> Anthony;
which caus'd <hi>Anthony</hi> to betake himself to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where partly by Force, and partly by Bribes,
he obtain'd it. But still he was not altogether so
Successful as he expected; for his daily Quarrels
with <hi>Octavius,</hi> and his little Care of revenging <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Death, gain'd him the Hatred of his Soldiers;
so that when he had brought over his Legions, two
of 'em went over to <hi>Octavius,</hi> who now was very
busie in going through all <hi>Italy,</hi> and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Soldiers out of the Colonies which his Uncle
had planted. At length <hi>Anthony</hi> with a considerable
Army march'd into <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whence he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> to depart, who gave Way to
him for some time; but at last retreated to <hi>Mutina,</hi>
where <hi>Anthony</hi> soon after streightly besieg'd him:
And thus a new War broke out in about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a Year after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Death.</p>
                  <p>II. About this time new Consuls were made,<note place="margin">U. C. 711.</note> which
were <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa,</hi> both great Friends of <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> as well as Intimates of <hi>Cicero,</hi> the former of
which serv'd under <hi>Caesar,</hi> and gave the Relation of
the Wars of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> which is annex'd to
his Commentaries. Upon their Assembling the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<hi>Anthony</hi> was declar'd Enemy to the State, but
especially by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Means, who now had made
many ingenious and severe Invectives against him,
which, in Imitation of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> he publish'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Name of <hi>Philippicks.</hi> This prov'd of great
Advantage towards the Bringing in, and Preferring
young <hi>Octavius;</hi> for tho' the Senate, as being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction, had little or no Esteem for
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:102323:216"/>
him, yet they resolv'd to make Use of him for his
Army's sake, and upon that Account erected him
a Statue, made him a Senator, tho' at this Age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
that he shou'd be consider'd as ten Years old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in respect of Publick Preferment, and likewise
gave him equal Power and Authority with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
themselves, whom they sent with all speed to
relieve <hi>Decimus</hi> now besieg'd by <hi>Anthony.</hi> Tho' the
Senate had oblig'd <hi>Octavius</hi> by these Honours, yet
their promoting and giving Provinces to all the
Conspirators, much more displeas'd him; and a
Letter from <hi>Anthony,</hi> upbraiding him <hi>with advancing
and assisting</hi> Caesar'<hi>s Murderers,</hi> gave him great Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
but concealing his Designs with a Prudence
surpassing his Age, he march'd with the Consuls.
The Consuls in a short time took <hi>Bononia,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
shortly after meeting <hi>Pansa,</hi> overthrew him;
but returning carelesly to his Camp, was worsted by
<hi>Hirtius.</hi> Not many Days after, a general Battel
was fought nigh <hi>Mutina,</hi> wherein <hi>Anthony</hi> with much
Difficulty, and great Bloodshed, was defeated, and
fled to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who then commanded in the further
<hi>Gaul.</hi> Both the Consuls dy'd of their Wounds,
<hi>Pansa</hi> first advising <hi>Octavius</hi> to join with <hi>Anthony;</hi>
and <hi>Decimus</hi> being at this time spar'd, tho' not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd,
by <hi>Octavius,</hi> thought of getting to <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius,</hi> now in <hi>Greece;</hi> but his Soldiers, not pleas'd
with the Journey, went over part to <hi>Octavius,</hi> and
part to <hi>Anthony;</hi> and himself, endeavouring with a
few Attendants to pass through <hi>Gaul,</hi> was taken and
betray'd at <hi>Aquileia</hi> by <hi>Sequanus</hi> Governour of the
Country, who sent his Head to <hi>Anthony.</hi> This was
the End of one of the chief Conspirators, which
was attended with the Deaths of <hi>Trebonius</hi> and <hi>Basilius</hi>
much about the same time; the former, excluding
<hi>Dolabella</hi> from <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by reason the
Senate had declar'd him an Enemy, was taken by
him, and after grievous Torments, had his Head cut
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:102323:216"/>
off, which the Soldiers kick'd about after a most
contemptuous manner; and the latter was murder'd
by his own Slaves, whom before he had us'd very
severely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> gain'd much reputation in these Wars, but
the Senate now finding little or no Occasion for him,
slighted him extreamly, and decreed all the Honour
that he had gain'd, to <hi>Decimus,</hi> whom he had reliev'd;
besides, they gave him many detracting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
Words, and deny'd him a Triumph when
he demanded it. From this Moment he resolv'd to
join with <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> sending back all the
Prisoners taken at the Battel of <hi>Mutina</hi> without Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
for since the Senators were most against his
Uncle, he cou'd not revenge his Death without some
new Assistance; and at the same time that he wrote
to these two, he sent 400 of his Soldiers into the
City, in the Name of his Army, to demand the
Consulship for him. The Senate was as ready to
deny him as the other two were to joyn with him,
which caus'd <hi>Octavius</hi> to send for <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
into <hi>Italy.</hi> The News of their Approach, and
at the Head of seventeen Legions, so terrify'd and
startl'd the Senate, that they immediately declar'd
<hi>Octavius</hi> Consul with <hi>Pedius;</hi> but upon the sudden
Arrival of some new Troops, they as soon repeal'd
their Decree again; and never was the Senate of
<hi>Rome</hi> so distracted between different Interests, and
so guilty of Irresolution as at this time. These new
Troops not answering their Expectations, the Senate
again decreed him Consul, and moreover advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
him above all Example: They decreed that after his
Consulship he shou'd take Place of all Consuls, and
tho' formerly they were displeas'd with his levying
Forces, as being a private Man, now they desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
him to encrease his Army, and order'd him the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of <hi>Decimus.</hi> The City was likewise commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Care, and Power given him to act what

he pleas'd, tho' without the Prescript of the Laws,
which he retain'd to his Death. So that <hi>Octavius</hi> now
with no great Difficulty procur'd Laws to condemn
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> with their several Accomplices,
and likewise to cancel those Decrees made against
<hi>Dolabella,</hi> and other of his Friends.</p>
                  <p>In a short time after <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Consulship, <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Octavius</hi> met
'em nigh <hi>Mutina,</hi> and after three Day Conference,
enter'd into a strict Combination with them; in
which it was agreed, <hi>That</hi> Octavius <hi>should quit his
Consulship, and leave the Title to</hi> Ventidius, Anthony'<hi>s
great Friend: That the Supreme Authority should be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between these three, which they should keep for the space
of five Years under the Name of</hi> Triumviri, <hi>and in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the</hi> Reformers of the Common-wealth: <hi>That
they should cause that Authority to be confirm'd by the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>People: That</hi> Anthony <hi>should have all</hi> Gaul, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
Narbon, <hi>which</hi> Lepidus <hi>was to have with</hi> Spain;
<hi>and</hi> Octavius <hi>should have</hi> Africk <hi>with</hi> Sicily <hi>and</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia:
Italy <hi>and the</hi> Eastern <hi>Provinces were for a while
to remain in Common.</hi> In this manner did these Men
divide the World between 'em, as if it had been
their Inheritance. They further agreed, <hi>That all
their Enemies should be destroy'd;</hi> and in this the Case
of <hi>Cicero</hi> caus'd the greatest Controversie; for <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
his implacable Enemy, wou'd consent to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
till his Death was determin'd: <hi>Lepidus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with it, but <hi>Octavius</hi> would willingly have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
him, upon the Account of former Friendship;
yet at last he consented, and for that Reason <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
permitted his Brother <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> his
Uncle <hi>Lucius,</hi> to be likewise proscrib'd. Lastly, it
was agreed, <hi>That</hi> Lepidus <hi>should be made Consul for the
following Year, and guard</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>while the
other two manag'd the War against</hi> Brutus <hi>and</hi> Cassius,
who now were strongly posses'd of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
and had lately taken <hi>Dolabella</hi> in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:102323:218"/>
beheaded him. In this manner was concluded the
Second <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> the Consequences whereof were
so dreadful, and which in effect gave the last Blow
to the Liberty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth. It
was concluded on above a Year and a half after <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi>'s Death, and was introduc'd, as some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
report, with many strange Presages and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prodigies.</p>
                  <p>III. Now was the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in a very mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and deplorable Condition,<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Triumvirate.</note> for the first Thing
done by the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> after establishment of their
Authority, was a dreadful <hi>Proscription</hi> of 300 of the
<hi>Senatorian,</hi> and about 2000 of the <hi>Equestrian</hi> Rank;
and nothing but Cries and Lamentations were heard
through all the City, and Murders committed in all
Places by the Soldiers. No Man dared refuse En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to any of 'em, who search'd the most secret
Places; and <hi>Rome</hi> at this time appear'd like a City
wholly expos'd to Waste and Pillage. Great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of uncondemn'd Persons perish'd in this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
some by Malice or Mistake, and others for
concealing or defending their Friends: In short, all
the most Tragick Fury that either Revenge or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
could produce, and all the most generous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that Love or fidelity cou'd inspire, were to be
seen in divers Accidents relating to this Proscription.
Though the Pretence was the revenging of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Death, yet many suffer'd upon the Account of their
great Estates, others out of Malice and old Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and some for their convenient Houses and
Gardens. Among those of greatest Note was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Varro,</hi> who now living to see and feel a second
<hi>Tricipitina,</hi> as he calls it in his Writings, yet with
much Difficulty escap'd with his Life. But <hi>Cicero</hi>
was the Man most aim'd at by <hi>Anthony,</hi> which
caus'd him to get on board a Ship with all speed;
but not being able to endure the Sea, he return'd to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:102323:219"/>
Land, saying, <hi>That he would die in his own Country
which he had so often preserv'd.</hi> Being weary both of his
Flight and his Life, he came to a small Village a
little above a Mile from the Sea. Here his Servants
terrify'd by several Prodigies, partly by Persuasion,
and partly by Force, put him again into his Litter,
and were carrying him back to the Sea. But <hi>Cicero</hi>
perceiving those that came to apprehend him, order'd
his Litter to be set down, and quietly laid out his
Neck to <hi>Popilius Lena,</hi> the <hi>Tribune,</hi> whom formerly
by his Eloquence he had sav'd from Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Lena</hi> cut off his Head and Hands, which he
presented to <hi>Anthony,</hi> who cou'd not forbear insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over those poor Members, and crying out, <hi>That
his Revenge was compleated, and he had no further Occasion
for the Proscription.</hi> But his Wife <hi>Fulvia</hi>'s Hatred
cou'd not be confin'd to Words, for she pierc'd his

and Hands to be set up upon the <hi>Rostrum,</hi> where
the People cou'd not without Horror behold those
sad Remains of a Man who had so often Triumph'd
there by the Force and Charms of his Eloquence.
Thus fell the great <hi>Cicero</hi> in the sixty third Year of
his Age, <hi>A Man,</hi> as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> observes, <hi>that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

                  </p>
                  <p>About the same time, <hi>Quintus, Cicero</hi>'s Brother,
was slain, together with all his Sons; but <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
Sons escap'd, for he had some time before sent 'em

was 100000 Sesterces, if done by a Free man, and
haif as much if done by a Slave, with the Freedom
of the City. This corrupted a great many, who
forgetting both Duty and Natural Affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:102323:219"/>
those whose Preservation they ought princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to have endeavour'd. Tho' many rare and
admirable Examples of the Love of Wives to their
Husbands, and of Slaves to their Masters, appear'd,
yet those of Children to their Parents were less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
However, <hi>Oppius</hi>'s Act may stand for many,
who, <hi>Aeneas</hi>-like, carry'd out his old and decrepid
Father upon his Back, and convey'd him to the Sea,
sometimes leading, and other times carrying him,
till they both escap'd into <hi>Sicily;</hi> from whence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon his Return, the People out of a just sense
of his Piety, made him <hi>Aedile,</hi> in which Office
wanting Money to set out the usual Games, the
Work-men did all without Wages, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
inrich'd him by their Voluntary Contributions.
As many as cou'd escape the Cruelty of the Proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
fled either into <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> or into
<hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Cornificius,</hi> but the greatest Number went to
young <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who was now very Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
especially by Sea. His Generosity was at this
time a very great Succour to many Illustrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
he sent Brigantines and other small Vessels to
all the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> to receive such as made their
Escape, and treated them with much Kindness and
Civility.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triumviri</hi> having almost satisfy'd their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
began now to think of Money, which they
very much wanted to carry on the War against
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius:</hi> For this reason they drew up a
List of 1400 of the richest Ladies of <hi>Rome,</hi> Mothers,
Daughters, or any Relations of their Enemies;
these Alliances were far enough fetch'd, for Riches
alone was sufficient to make 'em guilty in this Case.
These Ladies assembling themselves, first went to the
Female Relations of the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> and after that to
the Palace of these Magistrates, where, after several
Repulses, one of 'em was permitted to speak, upon
Condition that the rest wou'd be silent: This was

                     <hi>Hortensia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hortensius,</hi> who alone
had been able to dispute with <hi>Cicero</hi> for Eloquence,
<hi>My Lords,</hi> said she, <hi>these unhappy Ladies, which you see
here imploring your Iustice and Bounty, would never have
presum'd to appear in this Place, had they not first made use
of all possible Means, which either their native Modesty
might allow, or their best Understandings cou'd inform 'em.
Tho' it be contrary to the Rules of Decency prescrib'd to our
Sex, which we have hitherto most strictly observ'd; yet the
Loss of our Fathers, of our Children, of our Brothers, and

<hi>Cassius</hi> was immediately recall'd by <hi>Brutus,</hi> upon the

him, <hi>That their powerful Armies were not design'd for

Country; therefore they ought not so much to aim at the
Glory of new Conquests, as the Destroying those who sought
the Ruin of that Liberty. Cassius</hi> therefore leaving <hi>Syria</hi> to

scarce any thing but their Lives left 'em; but the
Inhabitants of <hi>Xanthus</hi> made such an obstinate Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
that scarce any were left alive, for they burnt
their City and destroy'd themselves with it. After
the reducing of these Places, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>
met at <hi>Sardis,</hi> from whence, after several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations,
they resolv'd to march against <hi>Anthony</hi> and

                  </p>
                  <p>Here it was that <hi>Brutus</hi> is reported to have seen
a Ghost in his Tent after Midnight. He ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
the greatest part of the Night in dispatching
of Affairs, and in Reading; and one Night being
thus employ'd according to his Custom, there was
a general Silence through all the Camp, especially
about his Tent, when of a sudden he heard an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
Noise at the Door, which open'd of it self
at the same time. <hi>Brutus</hi> casting his Eye towards
the Place, perceiv'd the frightful Figure of a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Spectre, of a proportion much more than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
which presented it self before him: He had
notwithstanding the Courage to speak to it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
<hi>Art thou a God, or art thou Man, and for
what Reason camest thou hither? I am,</hi> reply'd the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>thy Evil Genius,</hi> Brutus, <hi>and thou shalt see me again
near</hi> Philippi. <hi>Brutus</hi> very boldly answer'd, <hi>Well I
will see thee;</hi> and immediately it disappear'd. He
presently call'd up his Slaves, who all told him,
<hi>That they had neither seen nor heard any thing.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
walking all the rest of the Night, and early
in the Morning went to give an Account of what
hapened to <hi>Cassius,</hi> who, being an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> told
him, <hi>That all this proceeded from the Weakness of his
Senses, and the Strength of his Imagination at that time.
As for the rest,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>Let us not believe that
there are any such Spirits here, that have either Voice, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Shape, or Power over us; tho' I could wish there
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:102323:221"/>
were, that we might not only relie upon the Greatness of our
Forces, but likewise upon the Assistance of those Immortal
Beings, who cou'd not but be favourable to a Cause so Iust
and Sacred as ours is.</hi> This Discourse satisfy'd <hi>Brutus,</hi>
and soon after they pass'd over into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and so
to <hi>Philippi,</hi> a City between that Country and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
nigh which the Forces of the <hi>Triumviri</hi> were
posted.</p>
                  <p>It was with extraordinary Fear and Terrour that
all Persons stood waiting the Success of these two
powerful Armies, which were to decide the Fate
and Fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
Forces consisted of 19 Legions, and 20000
Horse, and the <hi>Triumviri</hi> of the same Number of
Legions, but much better compleated, and of 13000
Horse. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> encamp'd on a high and
convenient Ground nigh the Sea, where they were
supply'd with Provisions in abundance. The other
Party was much streightned for want of Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
having only <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thessaly</hi> open to 'em,
for <hi>Pompey</hi> had cut off all Communication from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
and <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> by their
several Navies. This made <hi>Anthony</hi> extreamly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of coming to a Battel, which <hi>Cassius</hi> being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of, refus'd to engage, tho' <hi>Brutus</hi> was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
saying, <hi>That he was impatient to put an End to
the Miseries of Mankind by a glorious Victory, or a noble
Death.</hi> At last <hi>Anthony</hi> with great Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
made a Way through a large Fen, and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
threw up Works against him, which with the
Soldiers Forwardness, caus'd a general Battel, tho'
much against <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Will, who declar'd, <hi>That he
was forc'd, in the same manner as</hi> Pompey <hi>was, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Liberty of the</hi> Roman <hi>People to the Hazard of a
Battel.</hi> In the Morning just before the Battel, <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
ask'd <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Opinion of what they ought to do
if they were unsuccessful, and <hi>Brutus</hi> reply'd, <hi>That
he had formerly in his Writings condemn'd the Death of</hi>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:102323:222"/>
Cato, <hi>and maintain'd that such a manner of avoiding
Disgraces, was an insolent Attempt against Heaven that
sent 'em; but he had now alter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d his Opinion, since he
was not Master of his Life, having already sacrific'd it
to his Country, he was resolv'd to change it for a Happier,
if Fortune prov'd his Enemy. Cassius</hi> imbracing him,
told him, <hi>Now we may venture against the Enemy; for
either we will be Conquerors our selves, or will have no
Cause to fear those that are so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Forces of the <hi>Triumviri</hi> were commanded
by <hi>Anthony</hi> alone, <hi>Octavius</hi> being now sick; and both
Armies being drawn up, <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party in a short
time attack'd that of <hi>Octavius</hi> with little Order,
but with so much Fury, that at the first Onset they
overthrew all that oppos'd, and pressing forward
with great Slaughter, they enter'd the very Camp
of <hi>Octavius,</hi> who had just retreated to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
was very hotly engag'd with <hi>Cassius,</hi> but in a short
time found means to open a Passage through the
Lines, and charging <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Troops upon the Flank,
overthrew 'em with great Slaughter; then pursuing
the Victory, he soon became Master of his Camp,
which Skill and Diligence he had learnt from <hi>Iulius
Caesar. Cassius</hi> retir'd to a Hill not far off, expecting
the Event of the Battel on his Partner's side, and
by reason of the greatness of the Dust he cou'd not
discern whose Cavalry it was that made towards
him at a distance: He therefore sent <hi>Titinius</hi> to make
the Discovery. <hi>Titinius</hi> was receiv'd with great Joy
by 'em, who were bringing Tidings of Victory,
but stay'd so long, that <hi>Cassius</hi> fearing <hi>Brutus</hi> had
been routed, and his Friend taken Prisoner, cry'd
out, <hi>Alas, to preserve the Remainders of a miserable Life,
I have ruin'd my best Friend:</hi> At these Words he retir'd
into his Tent, and kill'd himself, or caus'd his freed
Man to do it. <hi>Titinius</hi> arriv'd immediately after
with the Cavalry, all rejoycing, but their Joy was
suddenly dash'd, and <hi>Titinius</hi> first accusing himself of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:102323:222"/>
Folly and Laziness, in a great Rage, slew himself
upon the Body of his Friend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brutus</hi> was extreamly sorrowful for the Death of
his Companion, whom he call'd <hi>the last of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
causing his Body privately to be remov'd and
bury'd out of Sight, lest his Army shou'd be too
much dejected. In the mean time he told his
Friends, <hi>That he thought</hi> Cassius <hi>very happy in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the reach of those Misfortunes which remain'd for them
to suffer.</hi> He for some little time kept from Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
epxecting to starve his Enemies, who were now
in extream want of Provisions, their Fleet being
lately defeated; but at last, being forc'd to it by the
Fear of a general Desertion, and the Eagerness of
his Soldiers, he drew 'em up in Battalia. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that the Spectre which he had seen before,
appear'd to him again the Night before his great
Battel, but now said nothing. Whatever melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Apprehensions he had upon him, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
his Men as much as possible, promising 'em <hi>the
Liberty of Plundering the two Cities of</hi> Lacedemon <hi>and</hi>
Thessalonica; and when the Battel began, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness
of both Parties, made 'em throw aside their
missive Weapons, and betake themselves immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their Swords, fighting with great Fury, till after
much time, and more Bloodshed, <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party was
born down by main Force, and intirely defeated.
<hi>Brutus</hi> himself fled to a Hill hard by, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
all Night, and when in the Morning he saw
no Way of escaping, he began to cry out, <hi>O unhappy
Vertue, I follow thee as a solid Good, but thou art only a
meer Notion, a vain empty Name, or at best a Slave of
Fortune.</hi> Yet shortly after he told some of his Friends,
<hi>That he look'd upon himself much Happier than any of his
Conquerors, since he shou'd enjoy that Reputation which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
follows Vertue, and which Tyranny and Injustice cou'd
never deserve.</hi> Then going aside with a particular
Friend call'd <hi>Strato,</hi> he with all Earnestness begg'd
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:102323:223"/>
of him, <hi>To shew him the last Office of his Friendship;</hi>
and seeing him very unwilling to perform so hard
a Duty, he call'd for a Slave. <hi>Ah!</hi> then cry'd <hi>Strato,
It shall never be said, that the great</hi> Brutus, <hi>in his last
Extremity, stood in need of a Slave for want of a Friend;</hi>
so turning away his Head, he presented the Sword's
Point to <hi>Brutus,</hi> who threw himself upon it, and
immediately expir'd.</p>
                  <p>This was the End of these two memorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and as some write, they
themselves died by the same Weapons with which
they kill'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had given 'em their Lives af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> and after that, had loaden
'em with his greatest Favours; which Favours some
make use of to aggravate the Ingratitude, and others
to magnifie the Justice of the Act. All such as knew
themselves guilty of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Death, slew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their own Hands; but the rest rallying
themselves, sent Deputies to <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> for
an honourable Composition, which the two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
frankly allow'd of. By this famous Overthrow
the <hi>Triumviri</hi> establish'd their Authority so far as to
give the last Blow to the Liberty of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
for the Opposition they met from <hi>Pompey</hi>
was inconsiderable in respect of this, in which they
were to dispute for one Half of the <hi>Roman</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This hapned above two Years after <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Death, and about half a Year after the second

Commonwealth are generally the most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,<note place="margin">U. C. 712.</note>
so were these of <hi>Rome</hi> the greatest that ever
she had for the maintaining her Liberty. For in
the Sedition of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and in the Wars of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and <hi>Sylla, Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were only Sufferers;
and tho' in the Dissentions of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> the
Troubles were more General, yet several of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
and People thought they might well enough
stand Neuters out of their Respect to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which Name in Appearance was still reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd:
Whereas in these last Wars the Mask was
wholly laid aside, and all things were carry'd on in
such an open Manner, that there was an absolute
Necessity of Declaring for Liberty or against it.
But now all Pretence of Liberty was utterly ruin'd
by the Defeats of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius;</hi> and from that
Moment the <hi>Triumviri</hi> began to act as Sovereigns,
and to divide the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions between 'em as
their own by Right of Conquest, though <hi>Lepidus</hi>
was not much consider'd by the other two, as either
having no Share in this last Battel, or little Interest
among the Soldiers. The following Days after the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:102323:224"/>
Victory, were employ'd by the <hi>Triumviri</hi> in punishing
their Enemies; <hi>Anthony</hi> sacrific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d <hi>Hortensius</hi> to the

                     </gap>d himself in his Tent; and <hi>Quintilius
Varus,</hi> adorn'd with all the Marks of those Honours
he had born, caus'd himself to be slain by his freed
Man. <hi>Octavius</hi> upon this Occasion, appear'd more
Cruel than was agreeable to his natural Temper;
he sent the Head of <hi>Brutus</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to be thrown at
the Feet of his Uncle's Statue; his Ashes were sent
to his Wife <hi>Porcia, Cato</hi>'s Daughter, who according
to her Father's and Husband's Example, it is said,
kill'd her self, by swallowing down hot Coals and
Ashes. <hi>Octavius</hi> forc'd a Senator and his Son to
draw Lots for their Lives, but they both refus'd it;
the Father voluntarily gave up himself to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Son stabb'd himself before his Face.
To another that begg'd of him to have the Rites of
Burial, he said, <hi>That that wou'd s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on be at the Disposal
of the Ravens.</hi> These bitter Words and rigorous
Punishments render'd him both odious as well as
terrible to all the Prisoners who were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Triumviri</hi> had satisfy'd their Revenge,
they thought upon establishing their Authority. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
undertook to go into <hi>Asia</hi> to raise Money for
the Soldiers Rewards in those Provinces that were
Tributary to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and <hi>Octavius</hi> took upon
him to lead the old Troops into <hi>Italy,</hi> to put them
in Possession of the Lands that were promis'd 'em.
<hi>Anthony</hi> first visited <hi>Greece,</hi> as being the Country
where Flattery was manag'd with the greatest Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in the World, was familiarly present at the
Conferences of the Philosophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> and made
great Presents to that City. Then leaving <hi>Marcus
Censorius</hi> to command in <hi>Greece,</hi> he pass'd over into
<hi>Asia</hi> with all his Troops. There all the Princes of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:102323:224"/>
the <hi>East</hi> who acknowledg'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, came
to make their Court to him, and the fairest Princesses
strove to gain his Favour, either by the Charms of
their Beauty, or the Magnificence of their Presents.
This Crowd of Soveraigns that daily waited in his
Anti-Chamber, with their Praises and Submissions,
did most agreeably sooth his voluptous and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Temper. He pardon'd all those of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
Party that surrender'd themselves to him, except
<hi>Petronius</hi> and <hi>Quintus;</hi> the first was charg'd with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Conspirators, and the other with
betraying <hi>Dolabella</hi> in <hi>Laodicea.</hi> But then he took
away the Estates of several wealthy Citizens to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
his Flatterers and Buffoons; and assembling
the Deputies of all the Subjects and Allies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in those Parts, in a set Speech he insisted upon
<hi>his Necessities and their Duties,</hi> and so squeez'd out of
the Inhabitants almost all that Money which had
been left 'em by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius.</hi> After which he
went a Progress all over the Country, where he
frequently gave extraordinary Demonstrations of
Generosity and Good-nature. He pardon'd <hi>Lucius,</hi>
Brother to <hi>Cassius,</hi> and several other of his Enemies
in those Parts; but he spar'd none that had a Hand
in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Death, or were of the Number of the
Conspirators, so that never any Man's Death was
more severely reveng'd than his. <hi>Anthony</hi> then made
himself Soveraign Judge of the Differences between
the Kings of those Countries, as in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Ariarathes</hi> and <hi>Sysenes,</hi> for whom the Beauty
of his Mother <hi>Glaphyra</hi> was so powerful as to carry
the Crown from his Competitor.</p>
                  <p>But among all those Soveraigns in the <hi>East</hi> which
depended upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> none were of such Note
as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gypt,</hi> whose Conduct in
these last Wars had given her good Reason to fear
<hi>Anthony:</hi> For tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he had assisted <hi>Dolabella,</hi> yet at
the same time <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:102323:225"/>
fought for <hi>Cassius.</hi> This she knew had not at all
been pleasing to the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> considering what she
ow'd to the Memory of <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> especially
since the Love of that great Man had been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to all the World. Upon which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to meet <hi>Anthony,</hi> and try how much her Wit
and Beauty cou'd plead for her, since Reason
cou'd do so little; as if she had been resolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
and triumph over the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Persons of
their Generals. For besides the Addresses of <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> she had receiv'd those of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s eldest Son;
so that never Beauty was ever signaliz'd with more
illustrious Conquests. She had such a high Opinion
of her Charms, that she question'd not but to revive
that Flame in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Heart, of which formerly
he had given her a Testimony in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when
he had some Command there. But above all, it
was her Wit that most supported this Assurance;
for tho' her Person was admirable, and the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Eyes not to be withstood, yet there
were some at <hi>Rome</hi> that did not yield to her in the
least for Beauty; but none cou'd compare with her
for her agreeable Wit and her charming Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which never fail'd both to please and to persuade.
These Perfections, besides her wonderful Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
in Tongues and Learning, made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to go in Person to <hi>Anthony</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who
had sent <hi>Dellius</hi> to cite her to give an Account of
her late Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Never did any Princess appear in a more singular
and magnificent Manner than <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> arriving at
the Mouth of the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> she embark'd in a
Vessel whose Stern was of Gold, the Sails of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Silk, the Oars of Silver, which gently kept time
to a Consort of excellent Musick. The Queen was
laid under a Canopy of rich Cloth of Gold,
adorn'd like <hi>Venus</hi> rising out of the Sea, with lovely
Children about her like <hi>Cupids,</hi> fanning her, and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:102323:225"/>
her Women habited like <hi>Nereids</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> leaning
negligently on the Sides and Shrouds of the
Vessel: The Sweets that were burning perfum'd the
Banks of the River, which were cover'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Number of People, who ran thither with such
Eagerness, that <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was mounted on a
Throne to make a Shew of Majesty, was left alone,
while the Multitude flock'd to the River with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Delight and Wonder. <hi>Anthony</hi> in civility
desir'd her to Land and sup with him, but she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
desir'd his Company first, which he wou'd
not deny for fear of appearing ill bred. He was
extreamly surpriz'd at the Neatness and Magnificence
of the Entertainment, and with the ingenious Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Lights, and many other peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances.
The next Day he in his Turn wou'd
Treat her, an endeavour'd to out-go her in Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
but he soon perceiv'd he was far short of
it; whereupon he turn'd all into Mirth and Railery,
which she joyn'd with, and carry'd on with all the
Delicacy and Dexterity imaginable; till at last, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a more serious Air in her Discourses, she told
him, <hi>That she came not thither to clear her self, but to be
recompenc'd for the great Services she had done to him and</hi>
Caesar <hi>in assisting</hi> Dolabella, <hi>in Commanding a Fleet in
Person in spite of</hi> Cassius <hi>and his Commanders,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things, which she related with that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Cunning, and that Wit and Pleasantry,
that <hi>Anthony</hi> cou'd no longer defend his Heart; but
from that Moment entertain'd a Passion for her,
which was the Cause of all the future Misfortunes
of his Life. He was so strucken with her, that he
left all his former Business and Honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
and presently follow'd her into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
where, first sacrificing to her her Sister <hi>Arsione,</hi>
he liv'd with her all the following Year in all the
Ease and Softness to which his vicious Temper
cou'd prompt him, and all the Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:102323:226"/>
sures with which that luxurious Nation cou'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him.</p>
                  <p>II. While <hi>Anthony</hi> remain'd thus idle in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 713.</note>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> was extreamly busie about settling the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and dividing the Lands for satisfying
the old Soldiers. This he found very difficult, and
not a little dangerous, by reason it exasperated so
many against him; for it was absolutely necessary
for him to give up the several Towns allotted for
their Recompence, or else to satisfie his Soldiers
with a proportionable Quantity of Money, but that
cou'd not be rais'd since the Treasury was so much
exhausted. Almost all the Inhabitants of the Towns
concern'd in this Matter, came in great Multitudes
to <hi>Rome;</hi> and vast Numbers of Women with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in their Arms, whose tender Years and Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
drew every one's Compassion, daily fill'd the
Temples and Publick Places with their Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The People of <hi>Rome</hi> talk'd very freely and
boldly upon this Account, whose Complaints and
Murmurings <hi>Octavius</hi> bore with all the Discretion
and Cunning imaginable; first borrowing what
Money he cou'd, but finding not that sufficient, he at
last broke through all Difficulties, and gave his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Places and Lands for their Inheritance, as he
first design'd. The City of <hi>Cremona</hi> was one that
suffer'd most in this Distribution, for being so much
of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party, and <hi>Mantua</hi> by reason of her
Neighbourhood had more than her Share in these
Misfortunes, in which the <hi>Muses</hi> Darling, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Wit and best Poet that ever <hi>Italy</hi> produc'd, had
like to have perish'd. This was the great <hi>Virgil,</hi>
who was a Party concern'd in this publick Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for defending the Possession of his small Estate
from <hi>Arrius</hi> the Centurion, and very narrowly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd
Death by swimming cross a River. And 'tis
probable that this Adventure most of all contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:102323:226"/>
to his further Reputation and Advancement,
since these Troubles were the Subject of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Eclogue which was the first of his <hi>Bucolicks,</hi> he
being now about 28 Years of Age.</p>
                  <p>The many Disorders rais'd upon these Occasions,
and the frequent Dangers in which <hi>Octavius</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd,
gave <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> a fair Occasion
of endeavouring to bring about her Designs. Her
principal Concern was the bringing back of her
Husband, which she believ'd nothing but a War
cou'd effect; and therefore she resolv'd to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
those Methods to which her Rage and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
did then prompt her. <hi>Lucius</hi> the Brother of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
was then Consul, and to him she principlally apply'd
her self, who out of Respect to her who had been
so great a Friend to him, and out of a Distaste to
many of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Proceedings, readily comply'd
with her. Many plausible Pretences were made use
of to make a Breaéh with <hi>Octavius,</hi> and such cou'd
never be wanting in such unsettl'd and troublesome
Times as those. <hi>Rome</hi> was now in great Misery,
and <hi>Italy</hi> no less; Provisions were extream Dear by
reason of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s stopping all the Passages by Sea
from Abroad, and at Home the Troops consum'd
all the Increase of the Land, and besides committed
a thousand Disorders in the Cities, so that all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
was ruin'd, and the Shops of most People shut
up. <hi>Lucius</hi> made great use of these Mischiefs, and
<hi>Octavius</hi> us'd all means to quiet the Soldiers, and
pacifie the Country-People, who were driven from
their Possessions: He heard their Complaints, and
promis'd to do 'em Justice, which much incens'd
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers, who were also still more and
more stirr'd up by the Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ices of <hi>Fulvia. Caesar</hi>
openly complain'd of her, declaring, <hi>She wholly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the true Interest and Sentiments of her Husband;</hi>
but she hearken'd to none but her Friend <hi>Manius,</hi>
who persuaded her, <hi>That nothing but a War cou'd force</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:102323:227"/>
Anthony <hi>from</hi> Cleopatra'<hi>s Arms, and bring him into</hi>
Italy; and for <hi>Lucius,</hi> he had no other Sentiments
but what were influenc'd by these two.</p>
                  <p>These Disturbances began in Words, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Manifesto's, and such like; but soon came to
an open Breach, notwithstanding all the Care and
Caution of the most Prudent of both Parties. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ominent Persons were engag'd in this War; and
in regard that <hi>Lucius</hi> had declar'd against the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi>
most of the ancient Owners of the Lands
repair'd to him, and the new Possessors to <hi>Octavius</hi>
and to <hi>Salvidienus,</hi> then coming out of <hi>Gaul</hi> with
a great Power. <hi>Lucius</hi> march'd to oppose him, but
was diverted by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> one of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s great
Friends, and a valiant Soldier. Notwithstanding
the great Caution of <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Asinius,</hi> two of
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Commanders, <hi>Lucius</hi> was so hemm'd in,
and reduc'd to such Straits between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
that he was constrain'd to retreat to <hi>Perusia,</hi>
a strong City of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> where he was closely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
by <hi>Octavius</hi> and his Party. <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
attempted to relieve the Town, but <hi>Octavius</hi>
was so well posted that they cou'd not effect it, so
that <hi>Lucius</hi> was in a short time reduc'd to great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
for want of Provisions for so numerous a
Garison. He made several bold and desperate Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
but with no proportionable Success; till find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Soldiers reduc'd to the utmost Miseries of
Famine, he at last came out in Person, and giving
himself up into <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Hands, with great Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ness
interceded for his poor Soldiers, and begg'd,
<hi>That his Punishment might atone for their Crimes. Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
receiv'd him very Honourably and with much
Generosity, and all <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Soldiers were pardon'd
at the Desire of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s own Men, who cou'd
but pity the Miseries of their old Companions and
Country-men. The Town was design'd to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
but one of the chief Inhabitants call'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonicus,</hi>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:102323:227"/>
in a great Rage set Fire to his House,
which consum'd both himself and the whole City.
<hi>Ventidius</hi> and the rest made no Resistance; so that
this dangerous War was ended in a few Months
time, <hi>Pompey</hi> making but small Advantage of it;
and <hi>Octavius</hi> return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he enter'd in
Triumphant Robes, and crown'd with Laurel. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Feasts were also celebrated, and it was ordain'd,
<hi>That whenever any General hereafter shou'd merit the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Triumph, and be crown'd,</hi> Caesar <hi>shou'd have a
Share in his Honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. During this last War, and while <hi>Octavius</hi> was
settling his own Affairs with all the Skill and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of a most able Politician, <hi>Anthony</hi> was inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
passing away his Time at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the
bewitching Company of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and there fix'd
by the Charms of that Queen; regarding nothing
but the Enjoyment of those Pleasures she every
Day presented him with, in some new and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Shape. Never had Woman that exquisite Art of
refining and heightning of Pleasures by the Charms
of Novelty, that she had; she introduc'd 'em in the
most serious Business, and even the most inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Trifles when manag'd by her Skill, receiv'd
such an Air as made 'em the most agreeable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions:
So that whether they play'd, or treated,
or hunted, the Queen still made one, and was the
Soul of all, by her ingenious intermingling some
lively Piece of Wit, or by her unparall'd Grace in
relating some pleasant Adventure. Among the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of Diversions, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had invented a
Society, which she call'd, <hi>The inimitable Life,</hi> and
those who made the most sumptuons Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
carry'd away the Prize; which Treats were
prodigiously Expensive, as appears by several Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
out of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others. By all this Variety
of Pleasures and Delights did <hi>Cleopatra</hi> charm this
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:102323:228"/>
great Man, insensibly carrying him from one Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to another, and intirely gaining the Affections
of his Soul; so that <hi>Anthony</hi> had almost forgot the
great Reputation and Glory he had formerly gain'd
by his Arms, neglected the Toils and Fatigues of
War, and was just ready to let his former Glory
be swallow'd and lost in the more softer Delights of
Love.</p>
                  <p>In these Circumstances was <hi>Anthony</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
News that his Brother had been overthrown
by <hi>Octavius;</hi> that his Wife and all his Friends had
quitted <hi>Italy;</hi> that <hi>Octavius</hi> had made himself Master
of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which belong'd to him, and had got all
the Legions into his Hands which quarter'd there.
From another Part he receiv'd Advice, That the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> under Command of <hi>Pacorus</hi> their King's
Son, assisted by <hi>Labienus</hi> and <hi>Barzapharnes,</hi> had
made themselves Masters of <hi>Syria:</hi> That they had
likewise march'd as far as <hi>Ierusulem,</hi> which they
sack'd, and carry'd away <hi>Hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Brother, Prisoners, <hi>Herod</hi> himself ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
fled to the Mountains of <hi>Iudaea.</hi> These Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
so highly disadvantageous to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Affairs,
now began to rouze him from the Lethargy of his
Softness, and to make him consider how much his
Actions were like to disgrace the glorious Name of
<hi>Conquerour;</hi> whereupon he gather'd together 200
Ships, and a considerable Army, which he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in those Parts. His Design was immediately to

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:102323:228"/>
to gain an Alliance with <hi>Pompey,</hi> for the Sake of his
Shipping, not forgetting the least thing that might

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> suspecting <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Conduct, advanc'd

up all his Fleet and Force to him; from whence
they sail'd to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where they were forbidden

as Delegates, made up this dangerous Breach.
All Offences and Affronts were mutually to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and a Marriage was propos'd between <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Octavius</hi>'s half-Sister <hi>Octavia,</hi> and Widow of
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> a Lady of most extraordinary Beauty, and
as extraordinary Vertues and Accomplishments. Tho'
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> had so large a Share in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Heart, yet
he cou'd not without Baseness refuse a Lady of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>'s
admirable Qualities; and to avoid all present
Inconveniencies, he marry'd her. Then a new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was made between these
Commanders, the Bounds of their Dominions being
<hi>Codropolis,</hi> a Town of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> all from that place
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:102323:229"/>
Westward being to obey <hi>Octavius,</hi> and all Eastward,
<hi>Anthony. Africk</hi> was left to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
declin'd daily, and who having offended <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
had been confin'd by him to that Province.</p>
                  <p>According to this Division, <hi>Anthony</hi> sent <hi>Ventidius</hi>
into <hi>Asia</hi> against the <hi>Parthians;</hi> but the Troubles at
Home seem'd much greater to both <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
who were now entertain'd with the sad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Complaints of poor People, ready to starve
for want of Provisions, which <hi>Pompey</hi> hinder'd from
coming either from the East or West, by means of
<hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> which he had in his
Power, and from <hi>Africk</hi> by his navy also, which
was then most powerful at Sea. <hi>Octavius,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of some former Affronts, wou'd not be brought
to any Accommodation with <hi>Pompey,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the continual Cries and Prayers of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
whose Rage and Fury at last came to that
height, that he was nigh being ston'd by 'em, and
<hi>Anthony</hi> too, by coming in to his Assistance. At
last both he and <hi>Pompey</hi> were so far persuaded as to
come to an Enterview; but the latter demanding
large Privileges for the proscrib'd Persons, and to be
admitted into the Power and Place of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> the
Treaty was ineffectual. Yet the pressing Necessities
and frequent Mutinies of the People brought 'em
together a second Time, where, among some other
Articles it was concluded, <hi>That</hi> Pompey <hi>shou'd retain
all the Islands he had already, and</hi> Peloponnesus <hi>over and
above; that he shou'd have the Privilege of demanding the
Consulship in his Absence, and of discharging that Office
by any of his Friends: That he shou'd leave the Sea open,
and pay the People what Corn was due out of</hi> Sicily; <hi>And
that the</hi> Proscrib'd <hi>Persons, except such as were guilty of</hi>
Caesar'<hi>s Death, shou'd have all their Liberty to return.</hi>
And so a Peace was concluded to the great Joy and
Satisfaction of all People, which they testify'd by
many publick Games and Pastimes.</p>

Articles to quit <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> wou'd not do it till <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had satisfy'd him for such Moneys as were due
to him from the Inhabitants. <hi>Pompey</hi> wou'd by no
Means hearken to this, but immediately fitted out a
new Fleet, and provided himself of Forces, perhaps
giving Credit to <hi>Menodorus,</hi> who told him, <hi>That the
present Settlement of Affairs was no true Peace, but rather
a Cessation of Arms.</hi> He then renew'd his Cruisings
and Pyracies, which likewise renew'd the former

to <hi>Caesar,</hi> bringing in with him <hi>Corsica, Sardinia,</hi> and

to invade <hi>Sicily,</hi> but was beaten back by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
was in great Danger of his Life; and afterwards
his Ships lying at Anchor, were extreamly shatter'd,

<hi>Pompey</hi> shou'd attempt an Invasion, and sent to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
for his Assistance: Tho' he seem'd intirely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with such important Affairs, he found some
more agreeable in another place; and <hi>Livia</hi> the
Wife of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the Subject of 'em. The Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Woman, join'd with her refin'd and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Wit, made a great Impression upon his Heart,
which was much alienated from <hi>Scribonia,</hi> whom he
divorc'd for her insupportable Temper; and either
by his Entreaties or Authority, he oblig'd <hi>Tiberius</hi> to
yield him <hi>Livia,</hi> whom he marry'd, tho' then big
with Child, the Priests all allowing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> was now arriv'd at <hi>Brundusium</hi> with 300
Sail,<note place="margin">U. C. 716.</note> giving out, He came to assist <hi>Octavius</hi> in this
War. <hi>Octavius</hi> having not long before receiv'd the
News of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s quelling the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
together a noble Fleet, cou'd willingly have
dispenc'd with <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Civility. He thought he
was already too powerful, and therefore sought all
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:102323:231"/>
Arts and Pretences to excuse his going to meet <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony;</hi>
which Proceedings did not a little displease
him, as having been jealous of <hi>Octavius</hi> for a long
time. <hi>Anthony</hi> had then particular need of Soldiers
to employ against the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and willing to
spare the Charge of a Fleet, he design'd <hi>Octavius</hi>
shou'd take that, and furnish him with Land-Forces.
Whereupon <hi>Octavia</hi> generously offer'd to go to her
Brother, and clear all Misunderstandings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
all Differences that were like to arise, which
<hi>Anthony</hi> willingly agreed to. <hi>Caesar</hi> receiv'd her with
a Courtesie suitable to the great Affection he had
for her, but yet was so backward in answering her
Requests, that she publickly address'd her self to his
two great Friends <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> who had a
profound Respect for her, both for her great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and high Birth. <hi>My Lords,</hi> said she, <hi>you see here</hi>
Octavia, <hi>a Woman of the greatest Quality of the World,
now ready to be made the most miserable of all her Sex,
if your great Care and Wisdom prevent not these Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
The whole</hi> Roman <hi>People have fix'd their Eyes on
me, me the Sister of</hi> Caesar <hi>and Wife of</hi> Anthony; <hi>if
my ill Destiny shou'd bring these two to Arms, you have the
Chance of Fortune on your side, but I must fall whoever
gains, and be reduc'd to the fatal Necessity of losing a
Husband or a Brother.</hi> This moving Argument, join'd
with the Affection <hi>Octavius</hi> had for his Sister,
brought him to an Enterview with <hi>Anthony,</hi> where
extraordinary Civility was shewn to each other, all
little Differences were accommodated, and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
made as <hi>Anthony</hi> desir'd; and because the
time of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> set by the Senate was almost
expir'd, they prolong'd their Power for five Years
more, without ever regarding the Suffrages of the
Senate or People. After this, <hi>Anthony</hi> departed once
more for <hi>Syria,</hi> leaving <hi>Octavius</hi> in <hi>Italy, Octavius</hi>
deferring his Expedition into <hi>Sicily</hi> till the following
Year.</p>

                     <hi>Octavius</hi> determin'd to invade <hi>Sicily</hi> from three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Quarters; <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who had now join'd him,
was to make a Descent from <hi>Africk, Taurus</hi> from <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>
and he himself from <hi>Puteoli. Pompey</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to oppose each of these Commanders, but at
this time there needed not that Care; for <hi>Octavius</hi>'s
Fleet was a second time shatter'd and disabl'd by a
Storm, which so swell'd <hi>Pompey</hi> with Vanity, that
he styl'd himself <hi>Neptune's Son.</hi> However <hi>Octavius</hi>
wou'd not give over his Enterprize; for the
same Summer having recruited his Forces, and
refitted his <hi>Navy,</hi> he sent it out under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who first overthrew <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Fleet,
then was again worsted himself; yet after that land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
21 Legions, and 2000 Horse, besides 5000 Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
Men. No great or memorable Action hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on Land; but <hi>Pompey</hi> sent to his Enemy to
know if he wou'd fight by Sea, much fearing the
Land-Forces. <hi>Octavius</hi> accepted of his Offer, and in a
general Battel, in which <hi>Agrippa</hi> perform'd great
Acts, finally defeated him, having sunk 28 of his
Vessels. The rest were either taken or broken, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
only escap'd; and at the sight of this great
Overthrow, all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Land-Forces surrender'd
themselves to <hi>Octavius,</hi> so that with his seventeen
Vessels, he fled to <hi>Anthony</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> from whom he
expected Protection, in requital of what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
given to his Mother <hi>Iulia. Messana</hi> still held
out for <hi>Pompey,</hi> but the Garison at last yielded to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus,</hi>
and that brought all <hi>Sicily</hi> into subjection.</p>
                  <p>This Victory, tho' so advantageous to <hi>Octavius,</hi>
prov'd the Ruine of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who now having got
22 Legions under his Command, and a strong Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Cavalry, pleas'd himself with the ambitious
Thoughts of getting all <hi>Sicily</hi> into his Hands, to
which he pretended a Right, as first invaded by him.
Whereupon <hi>Octavius</hi> sent to him to complain of his
Proceedings; to whom <hi>Lepidus</hi> fiercely reply'd, <hi>That</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:102323:232"/>
Caesar <hi>had taken upon him all the Authority of the</hi> Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate,
<hi>when he had as much Right to it as himself.</hi> At
this <hi>Octavius</hi> with great Boldness went alone to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi>'s
Camp, with no other Assistance than that of
his own Merit, and the Authority he had gain'd by
his Victories. The Soldiers of <hi>Pompey</hi> look'd upon
him with great Respect, and drew round about
him; which <hi>Lepidus</hi> perceiving, he hastned thither
and made some of his Men charge <hi>Octavius,</hi> who
presently receiv'd a Hurt by a Dart. Yet <hi>Octavius</hi>
with a great Presence of Mind, went directly to the
Place where the Eagles of the Legions were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and taking one of 'em, he advanc'd it in the
Air; whereupon all the Legionary Soldiers ran in
Crouds, and saluted him as their General. <hi>Lepidus</hi>
being thus abandon'd by his Soldiers, quitted all the
Marks of his Authority which he cou'd no longer
keep, took deep Mourning and came and threw
himself at <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Feet. <hi>Octavius</hi> was much
mov'd at this mortifying Spectacle, to see a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir,</hi>
who had dispos'd of the Lives of many noble
Persons, reduc'd to beg his own; but he despis'd him
too much to take his Life; and tho' his Soldiers
wou'd have kill'd him, he sav'd him, but turn'd him
out of all his Authority and Power, except that of
<hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> and banish'd him to <hi>Cyrcaeum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus fell one Head of the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and their
Authority without any Competitor, came wholly
into the Hands of <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Anthony;</hi> which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
became almost indisputable by the Death of
<hi>Pompey,</hi> who was shortly after slain by <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> having first made several Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in those Parts. So that all Civil Wars were for

the <hi>718th</hi> Year of the City, and the <hi>7th</hi> of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Number of Letters and Memoirs of the chief Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
enough to occasion many new Disturbances.

since <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Octavius</hi> might in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Riches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, have found
all that cou'd be desir'd for the satisfying their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition:
But the secret Hatred between these two,
which broke out upon all publick Occasions, now
began to raise new Commotions in the <hi>Roman</hi> State.
The Passion of <hi>Anthony</hi> for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Presents of whole Provinces which he made
her, serv'd <hi>Octavius</hi> for a plausible Pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the War, and free himself from a Competitor
so formidable both for his Valour, and his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among the Soldiers. <hi>Anthony</hi> had now call'd
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> and there gave her all <hi>Phoenicia,
Coelo-Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with a great part of <hi>Cilicia,
Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Iudaea;</hi> which much displeas'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
People, who daily publish'd scurrilous Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Prodigality. <hi>Anthony</hi> being inform'd
of these Libels by his Friends from <hi>Rome,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
publish'd an Apology, wherein he affirm'd,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:102323:234"/>
                     <hi>That the Grandeur of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire was never so
conspicuous for the Conquests made, as for the Liberality
practis'd in bestowing the conquer'd Provinces: That true
Nobility was inlarg'd and multiply'd by the numerous Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that Soveraign Princes left in several Parts of the
World; and that was the Motive that induc'd</hi> Hercules,
<hi>from whom he deriv'd his Birth, not to subject himself to
the single Tye of one Wife, but to leave the Foundation of
several illustrious Races in all Parts, where he extended his
glorious Conquests.</hi> These false Reasonings which were
design'd to justifie his Passion, prov'd more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him, and made him appear odious to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who made Profession of a much stricter
Morality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> besides had march'd against the <hi>Parthians</hi>
with a mighty Power, which made the East trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but with very ill Success; for at the Beginning
the Enemy slew one of his Lieutenants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
defeated two Legions, and even he himself
was reduc'd to such Extremities, that he often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair'd
of his own Safety. At last after the Loss of
the fourth Part of his Troops, and all his Baggage,
he sav'd himself in <hi>Armenia,</hi> by the Advice of a
<hi>Roman</hi> who had been Prisoner among the <hi>Part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ians</hi>
ever since the Death of <hi>Crassus.</hi> Tho' <hi>Anthony</hi> in
this War behav'd himself with his usual Bravery,
yet the great Loss and shameful Retreat of such a
General as he, who in all probability was once able
to have conquer'd his Enemies, extreamly diminish'd
his former Reputation: And what was still more
disadvantageous to him, was the general Belief that
these Misfortunes were owing to his Passion for
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which had caus'd him to take no Measures
aright, but such as shou'd hasten his Return to her.
But what principally enrag'd the <hi>Romans</hi> was, the
taking <hi>Artabazus,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> whom <hi>Anthony</hi>
led in Triumph into <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This <hi>Rome</hi> cou'd
by no means bear, that a <hi>Roman</hi> General shou'd
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:102323:234"/>
impart such a peculiar Honour to a Foreign Nation,
and that she shou'd be depriv'd of the Glory of
insulting over vanquish'd Kings, which for so many
Years she had enjoy'd. All these Faults of <hi>Anthony,
Caesar</hi> made Advantage of, and above all exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the little Value he had for his Country: And
when he found the People sufficiently exasperated
against him, he resolv'd to send <hi>Octavia</hi> to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
that he might have a plausible Pretence to
declare War against him, if he shou'd Offer her the
Affront of sending her back without seeing her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> was now at <hi>Leucopolis,</hi> between <hi>Tyre</hi> and
<hi>Sidon,</hi> where he stay'd with an Impatience he was
not able to conceal, frequently leaving the Table to
run to the Sea-side himself, to see if the Queen were
coming. At last she came with great Quantity of
Cloathing for her Soldiers, and a vast Summ of
Money; at least <hi>Anthony</hi> gave her the Honour of
it when he distributed it. Almost at the same time
<hi>Niger</hi> arriv'd from <hi>Octavia,</hi> who staid at <hi>Athens,</hi>
from whence she sent her Husband word that she
had brought him Clothes and Arms, Horses and
Presents for his Officers, and 2000 chosen Soldiers
well arm'd. This was very unwelcom News to
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who fearing she cou'd not prevail against
so powerful a Rival when she appear'd, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feign'd a deep Melancholy, abstaining from Food
to make her self lean; and when she was near <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
she beheld him with languishing Eyes, and a
despairing Countenance like one besides her self
with Love; She let fall Tears in his Presence, and
turn'd away her Face, as if she desir'd to hide from
him those Marks of her Grief. These Artifices, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the smooth and cunning Flatteries of
<hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Friends, prevail'd so much upon <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Weakness, that they quite turn'd his Thoughts in
favour of his Mistress. He broke off his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enterprize against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:102323:235"/>
all the Instances of the King of <hi>Media,</hi> who
offer'd to join with him, and oppose that People
with his Cavalry accustom'd to their Way of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He only contented himself to make a Match
between one of his Sons he had by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and a
Daughter of that King; and after he had sent to
<hi>Octavius</hi> to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he waited on <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to
<hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Anthony</hi> began to show himself more luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and extravagant than ever, erecting a stately
Throne of Silver in the most publick Place in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
upon which were two Seats of Gold, one
for himself and the other for <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> There <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
dress'd like <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> like <hi>Isis,</hi> were
seated; and in the presence of all the People he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
her Queen of <hi>Aegypt, Cyprus, Lydia,</hi> and
Lower <hi>Syria,</hi> associating with her <hi>Caesaria,</hi> the Son
she had by <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> To the Children he had
by her he gave the Title of <hi>King of Kings;</hi> and for
their Dominions, to <hi>Alexander</hi> the eldest he allotted
<hi>Armenia, Media,</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> which he pretended
he wou'd conquer in a little time; and to <hi>Ptolemy</hi>
the younger, <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> Upper <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia;</hi> and
all things were perform'd with the greatest Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
and Solemnity imaginable. <hi>Anthony</hi> was still carry'd
away with new Pleasures and Delights by <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
and the Delicacy and Profuseness of their Treats still
daily encreas'd, till at last the Queen promis'd him
upon a Wager to give him a Treat of 60000 Pound
value of our Money. In this Treat was serv'd up
a golden Cup with a very strong dissolving Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
in which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> put one of her Pendants,
which was a Pearl of an inestimable value, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
drank it off. <hi>Plancus,</hi> who was to judge
of the Wager, immediately secur'd the other Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
which she was then taking off, and gave judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that she had already won the Wager; and
<hi>Anthony</hi> himself was extremely troubl'd for the Loss
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:102323:235"/>
of such a Jewel. The remaining Pearl, after the
Death of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> came into the Hands of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
who caus'd it to be cut asunder, and made it into two
Pendants for the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> which he thought
gloriously adorn'd with half of this prodigal Queen's
Supper.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Octavius</hi> was now much provok'd by <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Actions,<note place="margin">U. C. 720.</note> especially at his affronting his Sister, and
made Report of all his Practices to the Senate, who
began to have a far less Esteem for <hi>Anthony</hi> than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<hi>Octavia</hi> us'd her utmost Endeavours to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
these two, alledging, <hi>That her Interest ought not
to oblige</hi> Caesar <hi>to declare himself</hi> Anthony's <hi>Enemy,
since it wou'd be a shameful thing to have it reported in
future Ages, that the Love of one Woman, and the Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
of another, had caus'd the two Governours of the
greatest Empire of the World to plunge it into the Miseries
of a Civil War.</hi> Her great Generosity, her mild
Behaviour, together with the Love and respect to
her Husband, still further incens'd the People against
<hi>Anthony,</hi> for his ill Usage of a Lady of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Merit. <hi>Octavius</hi> at last resolv'd to declare
War against <hi>Anthony,</hi> but deferr'd for a while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
employ'd all this Year against several People of
<hi>Illyricum;</hi> at which same time <hi>Anthony</hi> also left <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
and went into <hi>Media,</hi> where he enter'd into a
League with that King.</p>
                  <p>The following Year <hi>Octavius</hi> chiefly employ'd in
Preparations against <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was now so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Designs, that he sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to
complain of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Conduct; alledging, <hi>That he
had seiz'd upon</hi> Sicily, <hi>without affording him a Share;
that he had dispossess'd</hi> Lepidus, <hi>and kept all his Governments
to himself; and that he had divided all</hi> Italy <hi>among his
own Soldiers, and reserv'd nothing for his in</hi> Asia. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
made Answer to these Accusations, <hi>That</hi> Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus'<hi>s
Conduct had oblig'd him to remove him; that as for
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:102323:236"/>
the Conquests he had made,</hi> Anthony <hi>shou'd have a Share,
when he had divided</hi> Armenia <hi>which he had conquer'd;
and as for</hi> Anthony'<hi>s Soldiers, that it was not likely that
they wou'd value a few pitiful Lands in</hi> Italy, <hi>after they
had conquer'd all</hi> Media <hi>and the Empire of the</hi> Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>by the mighty Exploits they had done in following their
General. Anthony</hi> was so inrag'd at this Jeer, that he
order'd <hi>Canidius,</hi> who commanded his Army, to
march without intermission with 16 Legions to pass
over into <hi>Europe,</hi> and he himself with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> came
to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where his Lieutenants had gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
800 Vessels, of which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> furnish'd 200
with 20000 Talents, and Privisions for all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Anthony,</hi> by the Advice of <hi>Domitius,</hi> resolv'd
to send back <hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> till the War was
ended; but she fearing lest <hi>Octavia</hi> shou'd take an
Advantage of her Absence, and make her Peace, by
large Presents gain'd <hi>Canidius</hi> to represent to <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
a great Number of Inconveniencies that her
Departure wou'd occasion; particularly, <hi>the depriving
him of the Assistance of the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>who were the best
Part of his Navy.</hi> These Counsels, and her own
cunning Insinuations, so far prevail'd upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s
deprav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d Temper, that he consented to her
Stay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> went both to <hi>Samos,</hi> where,
for Preparation for so great an Enterprize, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with all the Diversions and Pleasures that cou'd
be invented. Never were any Man's Cares so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
divided as <hi>Anthony</hi>'s; on one side all the Kings,
Princes and Potentates from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the <hi>Euxine
Sea,</hi>
and from <hi>Armenia</hi> to <hi>Illyricum,</hi> had Orders to
send Arms, Provisions and Soldiers to <hi>Samos;</hi> on
the other, all the Comedians, Dancers, Musicians,
and Buffoons were oblig'd to repair to this Isle: So
that frequently when a Ship was thought to come
laden with Soldiers, Arms and Ammunition, it
prov'd to be full of Players, Scenes and Machines;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:102323:236"/>
and while all the rest of the World was in extream
Misery and Desolation, Joy and all kind of Pleasure
reign'd here, as if they had all made choice of this
Place to retire to. But how Magnificent soever their
Entertainments were, <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fear and Jealousie
had so fowr'd his Temper, that he began to suspect
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> her helf, and wou'd eat nothing without a
Taster. But <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by her dextrous Management,
by several Instances soon let him see, <hi>That he cou'd
have no Guard against her Address, were not her Heart
interess'd in his Preservation;</hi> which made <hi>Anthony</hi>
leave off his troublesome Precautions, which he
found useless against the Arts of a Woman, who
cou'd so skilfully mingle inevitable Snares of Death
among her Pleasures. Every City of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
had a Share in his Sacrifices, and sent an Ox
thither to be offer'd, and the Kings who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
him, contended who shou'd make the noblest
Entertainments, so that it gave Occasion to one
to ask, <hi>What Rejoycings they would make for a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who made such magnificent Treats before a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
War?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Stay <hi>Anthony</hi> made at <hi>Samos</hi> was very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to <hi>Octavius,</hi> who cou'd make but small Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for War, by reason of the Discontents of all
the <hi>Italian</hi> Cities, occasion'd by the severe Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
laid upon 'em, and augmented by the News of
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Approach with such formidable Forces.
But when they saw that <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Preparations serv'd
chiefly to fill the Publick Places and Theatres of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,
Octavius</hi> found Means to appease 'em, and to put
himself in a Posture of Disputing the Empire with
Forces equal to his Enemies. Still <hi>Anthony</hi> began to
grow more odious to the <hi>Roman</hi> People; for having
brought <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there honouring her
beyond any Mortal before her, he sent to <hi>Rome</hi>
with Orders to <hi>Octavia</hi> to leave his House, with all
her Children. <hi>Octavia</hi> readily obey'd these unjust
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:102323:237"/>
Orders, without Murmuring, only lamenting her
hard Fate, <hi>because she was made to serve for a Pretence to
a War, whose Consequences must needs be fatal to her.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friends not being able any longer
to bear with his Disorders, abandon'd him, and <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
having got <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Will into his Hands, found
new Matter to complain of to the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which was <hi>Anthony</hi>'s ordering, <hi>That if he dy'd in</hi>
Rome, <hi>his Body shou'd be carry'd in funeral Pomp through
the principal Places of the City, and then sent into</hi> Aegypt
<hi>to</hi> Cleopatra. To this a Report was added, <hi>That</hi>
Anthony <hi>design'd to give</hi> Rome <hi>to</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>if his
Arms were prosperous, and to transferr the Seat of the
Empire into</hi> Aegypt; so that notwithstanding all the
Care of the more prudent Sort, and all their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to reconcile these two great Men, it plainly
appear'd, that nothing but the Sword could decide
the present Controversie.</p>
                  <p>III. As soon as <hi>Octavius</hi> found himself in a good
Condition to carry on the War,<note place="margin">U. C. 722.</note> he publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
it against <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and divested <hi>Anthony</hi> of
his Authority, which he had in a manner already
parted with in favour of that Princess. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
imply'd besides, <hi>That</hi> Anthony <hi>was now no longer
Master of his own Will, since</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>with her Philtres
had taken away the use of his Reason; so that he was not to
be esteem'd as a Person engag'd in this War, which was only
manag'd by</hi> Mardion <hi>her Eunuch, and</hi> Iras <hi>and</hi> Charmia
<hi>her Women, who were all his Governours.</hi> All <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Followers were invited over with great Promises of
Rewards, but not declar'd Enemies, partly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their growing Desperate, and partly to render
<hi>Anthony</hi> more inexcusable in making War against
his Country, only for the sake of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
The Forces of these two Generals were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the Empire they contended for, one
drawing all the East, and the other the West to his
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:102323:237"/>
Party. All the several Kings of <hi>Asia</hi> that were Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> follow'd the Fortune of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
some by their Persons, and others by their
Troops alone; all which, with <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Forces,
compos'd an Army of 100000 Foot and 12000
Horse, and his Fleet consisted of 500 Ships of War,
whereof many were of the largest Bulk. <hi>Octavius</hi>
in his Party had no Foreign Princes, and his Army
amounted to no more than 80000 Foot, but was as
strong in Cavalry as his Enemy's: In his Fleet were
250 Vessels, but all Light, better Mann'd, and
more convenient than <hi>Anthony</hi>'s. This Year, by
reason of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s recalling his Troops out of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
from the Protection of that Country, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
became Masters of it, and <hi>Armenia</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
lost.</p>
                  <p>The two great Men being now in readiness for
Action,<note place="margin">U. C. 723.</note> they first began to shew their Hatred by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
Letters; and when <hi>Octavius</hi> reproach'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
with his Love to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the Prodigality
of his Feasts, he, on the other side, put him in
mind <hi>of the famous Feasts of the twelve Gods, where he
and his other Guests represented the Deities they ador'd.</hi> To
which he added, <hi>His prepostrous Match with</hi> Livia, <hi>and
his infamous Divorce of</hi> Scribonia, <hi>for not bearing the
Insolence of that new Mistress;</hi> and all the <hi>Roman</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that <hi>Octavius</hi> had any great Familiarity with,
were brought upon the Stage. He proceeded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to tax <hi>Octavius with Cowardice at the Battels of</hi>
Mutina <hi>and</hi> Sicily; whereupon <hi>Octavius</hi> wrote to
him, <hi>That it was childish to fight any longer with the
Pen, but if he wou'd approach at the Head of his Army,
he shou'd have Ports in</hi> Italy <hi>to land without Molestation;
that he wou'd draw his Troops so far from the Sea, that</hi>
Anthony <hi>shou'd want no room for Encamping, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Men in Battalia.</hi> To make return to this
Bravade, <hi>Anthony,</hi> tho' he were much the older,
challeng'd <hi>Octavius to fight a single Combat, or if he
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:102323:238"/>
pleas'd, he wou'd give him Battel in the Plains of</hi> Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia,
<hi>where the great</hi> Caesar <hi>and</hi> Pompey <hi>had formerly
decided their famous Differences. Anthony</hi> was now at
<hi>Actium,</hi> a Town on the Coasts of <hi>Epirus,</hi> at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Gulf of <hi>Ambracia;</hi> and while he lay
there without Action, <hi>Octavius</hi> pass'd over from
<hi>Brundusium,</hi> and surpriz'd <hi>Toryne,</hi> a City nigh <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
This Exploit amaz'd <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers, because
his Legions were not yet arriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d; but <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to
re-assure 'em, made slight of it, and in a jesting
Way said, <hi>what Damage is it for</hi> Octavius <hi>to take the</hi>
Scummer? alluding to the Word <hi>Toryne,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>a Scummer;</hi> as if the Danger had been no
greater than the taking of a Dinner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> had brought all his Ships into the Gulf,
whither <hi>Octavius</hi> the next Day after the taking of
<hi>Toryne</hi> came forward, and offer'd him Battel. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s
Vessels were very ill Mann'd, however he
drew 'em into a fighting Posture, with their Oars
a-peek, as if he intended to bear down upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
but <hi>Octavius</hi> durst not engage him in that
narrow Passage, and therefore stood off to Sea;
the other refus'd to follow, but as he perfectly knew
the Country thereabouts, he cut off the Water from
<hi>Octavius</hi>'s Camp on every side, which much distress'd
his Army. But the Success of <hi>Agrippa</hi> in taking <hi>Leuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
Petras,</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> about this time, much reviv'd
the Soldiers, and likewise occasion'd <hi>Amintas, Deiotarus,</hi>
and <hi>Demitius</hi> to go over to <hi>Octavius.</hi> To the latter
of these, <hi>Anthony,</hi> according to his natural Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
sent his People and all his Equipage, which
so sensibly touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he was not able to outlive the Grief of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
a Man who thus by Kindness only had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
his Perfidiousness. In the mean time <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
arriv'd with the Legions, who now began to
change his Mind concerning <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> desiring <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,
To send her back, and go himself into</hi> Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:102323:238"/>
                     <hi>where he might fight by Land with so much more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
because</hi> Dicomes, <hi>King of the</hi> Getes, <hi>had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him a powerful Assistance:</hi> He farther told <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,
That it would be a renouncing both Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to put a Victory to the Hazard of the Seas and Winds,
which they were certain of at Land, by the Valour and
Experience of their General, who, to this Day, had kept
up the Title of</hi> Invincible; <hi>and by the Hearts and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
of their Soldiers, who had been try'd in so many
great Dangers. Anthony</hi> was much inclin'd to follow
this Advice, but <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whose Words were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
byass'd him the other Way, and oblig'd him
against his Will to hazard both his Empire and Life
in a Sea-Fight; and this, only that she might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
with more ease, if <hi>Anthony</hi> should lose the Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> had now resolv'd to fight by Sea, and
while he was putting his Fleet in Order of Battel,
a brave old Soldier, all cover'd with Scars, spoke
thus to him aloud, <hi>My noble General, do you despise
this good Sword, and this old Arm, which all my Wounds
cou'd ne'er yet weaken, that you shou'd put your Confidence in
brittle Boats and rotten Wood? Leave the Water to the</hi>
Aegyptians <hi>and</hi> Phoenicians, <hi>People born and nurst up in
that Element, but leave us</hi> Romans <hi>to the firm Land,
where we may boldly meet Death, and fall like Men. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
answer'd nothing, only by the Motion of his
Head seem'd to incourage him, tho' he himself was
not well satisfy'd; for when his Officers propos'd
taking away the Sails, he oppos'd it, alledging, <hi>That
he wou'd have none of the Enemy escape.</hi> That Day,
and the three following, the Sea was so rough they
cou'd not engage, but on the fifth, the two Fleets
advanc'd towards each other in good Order. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
in his Brigantine went about encouraging his
Men with the Remembrance of the many Victories
they had gain'd under his Conduct, telling 'em besides,
<hi>That the Largeness of their Vessels gave 'em Opportunity of
fighting as firmly, and with as much Assurance as on dry
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:102323:239"/>
Land; and that this Day as he expected the Empire of
the World from their Valour, so they might expect Rewards
answerable to so noble a Conquest. Octavius</hi> on his Side
gave no less Hopes to his Soldiers, especially since
they seem'd fearful of the Enemies Fleet; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things, said, <hi>The Enemies Vessels are laden
indeed, but not Mann'd; and if they exceed us in Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Men, we surpass them in Number of Soldiers. Be
therefore now, as ye, have ever been, Conquerors; to speak
more were to detain you from Victory, only call to Mind
your ancient Valcur; and remember that I am</hi> Caesar, <hi>and
you</hi> Romans.</p>
                  <p>It was both a noble and a terrible Sight, to see
the Shore on one side o'erspread with 200000 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, and the Sea cover'd on the other with an
incredible Number of Vessels fill'd with Soldiers. Nor
was the Battel less remarkable, which began on both
Sides with great Courage and Bravery, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
for a considerable Time; when <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
weary'd with Expectation, or overcome with Fear,
unexpectedly tack'd about, and fled toward <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus</hi>
with sixty Sail. And what was still more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
<hi>Anthony</hi> himself, who had formerly shewn so
many eminent Marks of his Valour, now forgot
the Care of his Honour and Safety, and fled after
her, playing the Part of a cowardly Soldier, while
each of his Soldiers perform'd the Office of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
General. Thus <hi>Anthony</hi> abandon'd his Men
that so generously expos'd their Lives for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
and getting into <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Galley, he sat for
a long Time by himself in a confus'd Melancholly
Posture, without so much as seeing the Queen, tho'
he had follow'd her without any apparent Reason
but the Thoughts of her Absence. The Battel,
notwithstanding, continu'd with great Obstinacy
till five in the Evening, when <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Forces were
partly constrain'd by the great Conduct of <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
and partly persuaded by the obliging Promises of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:102323:239"/>
                     <hi>Octavius,</hi> to submit; and herein <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
did much efface the Memorry of the Battel of
<hi>Philippi,</hi> and the cruel Proscriptions of the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate.</hi>
The Consequence of this Victory was very
advantageous to <hi>Octavius,</hi> for all <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Land-Forces,
tho' very firm and resolute for some time,
were in a little time after very willing to accept
of such Conditions as <hi>Octavius</hi> offer'd, and upon
that all yielded to him, <hi>Octavius</hi> generously sparing
all but a very small Number, who in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Manner were his declar'd Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> now was carry'd away with melancholy
Reflections and dispairing Thoughts, and through
Shame or Anger refus'd to see <hi>Cleopatra</hi> for several
Days together; till arriving at <hi>Tenarus,</hi> her Women
so bestirr'd themselves, that they brought 'em to see
one another, and to eat together. Here News was
brought him by several of his Friends of the Defeat
of his Fleet; but not suspecting the Revolt of his
Army, he wrote to <hi>Canidius</hi> to retreat through <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
and return to <hi>Asia,</hi> and took what Care he
cou'd for the safety of his Friends that were about him,
offering 'em what Money he had, and commanding
'em to leave him. After this he retir'd to <hi>Africk,</hi>
from whence he sent <hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
almost alone, without any other Company
than <hi>Aristocrates</hi> and <hi>Lucilius;</hi> one a <hi>Greek,</hi> and the other
a <hi>Roman,</hi> both excellent Orators. Here <hi>Anthony</hi> heard
of the Revolt of his Land-Forces, which put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a violent Rage and Despair, that he attempted
to kill himself; but was hinder'd from that fatal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
by the Prayers and Remonstrances of his
Friends, who persuaded him to return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
where he found <hi>Cleopatra</hi> about an Enterprize that
well shew'd the Greatness of her Spirit. This Queen
had drawn her Galleys upon Carriages for 100 Mile,
over that Neck of Land which joins <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Africa,</hi>
to the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> where she design'd to embark her
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:102323:240"/>
self with all her Treasure, and her choicest Friends,
and plant her self in some remote part of the
World. But the <hi>Arabians</hi> soon forc'd her to abandon
that Design, and thereupon she apply'd her self to
fortifie the Avenues of her Kingdom, which were
of very difficult Access. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Behaviour was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different, shewing nothing but a shameful Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
He shunn'd all Company, and built a House
near the <hi>Pharos,</hi> where he shut himself up without
either Friends or Domesticks, <hi>to imitate</hi> Timon, as
he said, <hi>since he had no less Reason to hate Mankind than
that</hi> Athenian, <hi>being betray'd by those whom he had
most oblig'd.</hi> But he cou'd not long force his natural
Temper, and therefore, as Debauching is a great
Relief to People of his Humour, he quitted his
Cell in a little Time, and apply'd himself whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Feasting and Luxury, and many sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies.</p>
                  <p>IV. <hi>Octavius</hi> was now in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 724.</note> whither he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
by <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Letters, after he had pass'd one
part of the Winter in <hi>Athens,</hi> and the other at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</hi>
The Occasion of his Return into <hi>Italy</hi> was the
Mutiny of his Soldiers which he had sent to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium</hi>
after the Victory, who, after their usual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
had demanded their Rewards and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
<hi>Octavius</hi> stay'd at <hi>Brundusium</hi> but a short
Time, only while he appeas'd his Soldiers, and gave
all necessary Orders; after which with his Fleet he
sail'd into <hi>Syria,</hi> while his Army march'd along the
Coasts of <hi>Africk</hi> to attack <hi>Aegypt</hi> on the other side.
All the Kings of <hi>Asia,</hi> Allies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> came
to assure him of their Obedience; and none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more forward than <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Iudaea,</hi>
who went as far as <hi>Rhodes</hi> to lay his Crown at <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>'s
Feet, and offer'd him both his Person and his
Troops. This Prince was one of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s greatest
Friends, and for that Reason he had so little Hopes
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:102323:240"/>
of the Success of his Voyage, that in pursuance of
his Natural Bent to Cruelty, he left Order with two
of his Confidents to put his Wife <hi>Mariamne</hi> to
Death, whom he passionately lov'd, in case he
shou'd miscarry. This Secret was reveal'd to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amne</hi>
by one of his Instruments; and <hi>Herod</hi> being
reproach'd with it at his Return, caus'd the Death
of this unfortunate Princess, who for her admirable
Beauty, and her noble Race from that of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees,</hi>
deserv'd a better Fate. <hi>Octavius,</hi> to give a
famous Instance of his Clemency, pardon'd <hi>Herod,</hi>
gave him his Crown, and receiv'd him into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
but wou'd not spare <hi>Alexas</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who
had been <hi>Anthony</hi>'s greatest Flatterer, and afterwards
a most perfidious Traytor to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> seeing themselves abandon'd
by all their Allies, resolv'd at last to send <hi>Euphronius,</hi>
their Children's Tutor, to make some Proposals to
<hi>Octavius. Cleopatra</hi> privately sent a Golden Crown
and Sceptre, with a Royal Seat, to <hi>Octavius,</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for her Children; and
<hi>Anthony</hi> only desir'd he might live as a Private Man
at <hi>Athens,</hi> if <hi>Octavius</hi> was not willing he shou'd tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
still in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He absolutely rejected <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Propositions, but sent to <hi>Cleopatra, That there was no
manner of Favour which she might not reasonably expect,
if she wou'd either put</hi> Anthony <hi>to Death, or Banish
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im.</hi> With this Answer <hi>Euphronius</hi> return'd, and
with him <hi>Thyreus,</hi> a Freed-Man of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
very Cunning, and fit to manage any Intrigue;
who coming with a Message from a young Emperor,
to an ambitious Princess, possess'd with a mighty
Opinion of her own Charms, had no difficult Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to her. But these secret Conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> and him, and the Honours she
did him, threw <hi>Anthony</hi> into such a furious Passion
of Jealousie, that he immediately order'd him to be
cruelly Scourg'd, and in that Condition sent him to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:102323:241"/>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> with Letters, <hi>That he had chastis'd</hi> Thyreus
<hi>for insulting over him at a Time when his bad Fortune had
put him into an ill Humour; but if this Proceeding offended
him, be had his Freed-Man</hi> Hipparchus <hi>by him, whom he
might use after the same manner, and so be upon equal
Terms:</hi> Which was a pleasant Way of being reveng'd
upon <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> the first of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Freed-Men
that went over to <hi>Coesar. Cleopatra</hi> omitted nothing
to clear <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Mind of Jealousie and Suspicion;
she redoubl'd her Fondness and Caresses, and when
her Birth-day came, she kept it as was suitable to
their deplorable Condition; but <hi>Anthony</hi>'s was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
with great Splendor and Magnificence, so that
all the Guests were enrich'd by the noble Presents she
made upon his Account.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Octavius,</hi> having gather'd all his
Forces together, surpriz'd the City of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> which
was surrender'd to him by <hi>Seleucus;</hi> and it was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
reported, That this Governour had done it
by <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Order; but she, to clear her
self, deliver'd up his Wife and Children into
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Hands. Near the Temple of <hi>Isis</hi> she
had built a stately Building, design'd for a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.
Into this Place she remov'd all her Treasure,
as Gold, Silver, Jewels and other such valuable things,
and fill'd it besides with Torches, Faggots, Tow,
and other combustible Matter; so that <hi>Octavius</hi> was
much afraid lest out of Despair she shou'd burn her
self in it with all those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast Riches. Therefore
while he was marching towards <hi>Alexandria</hi> he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no Occasion of giving her Assurance of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and kind Usage. The nigh Approach of so
formidable a Rival, began once more to rouse up
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and reviv'd all those Sparks of Greatness
and Generosity in his Breast that seem'd to have been
wholly extinct. <hi>Anthony</hi> now knew that he had no
Hopes but of dying like a <hi>Roman,</hi> and this he fully
resolv'd upon: So he rally'd all the Troops he had,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:102323:241"/>
made a brave Sally upon <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Horse, and beat
'em into their Camp, which he put into Disorder;
nor did <hi>Anthony</hi> ever shew more Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
than now. Upon this Victory, <hi>Anthony</hi> enter'd
<hi>Alexandria</hi> as in Triumph, and went all Arm'd to
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> to bring her the good News of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
presenting one of his Knights to her, who had
behav'd himself bravely in the Fight. The Queen
rewarded his Valour with an Armour of Gold, but
that very Night, this ungrateful Wretch went over
to <hi>Octavius,</hi> which dangerous Example much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<hi>Anthony.</hi> He try'd to provoke <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and challeng'd him to a single Combat; but
was coldly answer'd, <hi>That</hi> Anthony <hi>had Ways enough
to die without seeking that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> now finding his Affairs in a dangerous
Condition, resolv'd to make the last Push both by
Sea and Land, with a full Design to conquer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
or die bravely. He order'd his People to
treat him chearfully, and fill him his Wine plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
<hi>Perhaps,</hi> said he, <hi>this may be the last Service you
can do, for to Morrow you may have another Master,
while I lie extended upon the Ground, despis'd by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
Finding his Friends much mov'd at this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
Discourse, he added, <hi>However I will not do
you so great an Injury as to lead ye where Death is more
certain than Victory.</hi> At the dead of Night, when
the whole City was in a deep Silence, on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
was heard a dreadful Noise of Voices, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Cries, like those of <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> which
passed through <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and went out of the Gate
that looked towards the Enemies Camp, as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
relates it. At break of Day, <hi>Anthony</hi> posted those
few Troops he had remaining, upon the rising
Ground nigh the Town, from whence he sent
Orders to his Gallies to engage the Enemy. They
advanc'd in Order of Battel; but as soon as <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s
Ships approach'd the other, the Soldiers all held
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:102323:242"/>
down their Arms and saluted <hi>Octavius</hi>'s; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the Salute, both Fleets joyn'd and stood
over-against the City. All his Cavalry seeing this,
left him, and went over to <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Camp, his
Infantry being forc'd presently to yield.</p>
                  <p>This unfortunate General, abandon'd thus by his
Men, and finding he cou'd not die with Glory in
the Field, return'd back to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> overcome
with a dreadful Rage and Fury, running and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, <hi>That</hi> Cleopatra <hi>had betray'd him, when he
had ruin'd all his Fortunes for her Sake alone!</hi> The
Queen hearing of this, in a great Fright retir'd to
her Monument, secur'd the Doors, and let down
the <hi>Port-cullis;</hi> and then made a Report be spread,
that she was dead, which was soon brought to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony:</hi>
This sad and sudden News recall'd all that
Love and Tenderness he had for this Princess; O
<hi>wretched</hi> Anthony, cry'd he, <hi>What hast thou here in
this World, when Fate has snatch'd the only Thing for
which thou cou'dst endure to live?</hi> Then retiring to his
Cabinet, he laid aside his Armour, and renew'd his
Complaints; O Cleopatra, said he, <hi>our Separation is
not my greatest Grief, for we shall meet again; but what
afflicts me most, is, that I, who have commanded so many
gallant Men, shou'd be out-done by a Woman in Courage.</hi>
Immediately he call'd <hi>Eros,</hi> the most faithful of his
Free'd-Men, whom he had engag'd by Oath to
kill him when he shou'd think it necessary, and
now bad him perform his Promise. <hi>Eros</hi> drew out
his Sword, as if he design'd to perform that fatal
Duty; and turning aside, gave himself a Wound,
which threw him dead at his Master's Feet. <hi>Dear</hi>
Eros, cry'd he, <hi>I thank thee for teaching me to do what
I ought my self;</hi> and upon that he thrust himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Belly, and fell backwards upon his Bed. Tho'
the Wound was Mortal, yet the Blood stopping,
he came to himself, and most earnestly begg'd of
his Friends to dispatch him; but they all fled from
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:102323:242"/>
him, leaving him in a miserable Condition, tossing
and struggling with the Anguish of his Pain, whilst
<hi>Diomedes</hi> came to carry him to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony</hi> understanding <hi>Cleopatra</hi> yet liv'd, begg'd
and entreated in the most moving Manner in the
World to be carry'd to her; and with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
and pain they lifted him up to the Door of
the Monument. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> having only her two
Women, durst not open the Door, but let down
Cords from the Window. All the People of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
were present at this sad Spectacle, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appear'd so lamentable as to see this great Man,
renown'd for so many Conquests and Victories, bath'd
in his Blood, and just expiring, holding out his
Hands to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and faintly endeavouring to raise
himself; and to see this famous Queen striving, with
her Body just out of the Window, with the feeble
Assistance of her Women, to pull him up, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all the time seeming to assist her with their Cries
and Tears. When after much Pain she had drawn
him up, she embrac'd him, and laid him gently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Bed, tearing all her Cloathes in a most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Passion, beating her Face and Breast, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Anthony her Lord, her Husband, her Emperour!</hi> and
tho' her own Misfortunes were very great and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing,
yet she forgot them all at the sight of
this deplorable Object. <hi>Anthony</hi> begg'd of her <hi>to
moderate her Grief and Transports,</hi> and ask'd for some
Wine, either because he was thirsty, or because he
thought it wou'd soon end him. After he had drank,
he exhorted <hi>Cleopatra to endeavour to save her Life if she
cou'd do it with Honour, and for that End</hi> Proculus <hi>wou'd
be her best Friend in</hi> Caesar'<hi>s Camp; that she wou'd not too
deeply reflect upon the cruel Turn of Fortune which he felt
in his last Days, but rather think what Glory and Renown
he had liv'd in, famous for so many noble Victories; Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and Dignities; and that after he had been the first
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:102323:243"/>
Man of the World, and the most illustrious of all the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>he was at last overcome by a</hi> Roman.</p>
                  <p>At the finishing of this Discourse, <hi>Anthony</hi> expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in the <hi>53d.</hi> Year of his Age; a Person of as
great Spirit and Valour as any among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
since the Death of <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> yet softn'd, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and entirely ruin'd by a Woman. His Death
put an End to all the Civil Wars, and gave <hi>Octavius</hi>
Opportunity to make his Fortunes as he pleas'd; and
from this Period many Historians date his Reign;
others three Years after; and some from <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Death. This hapned in the <hi>724th</hi> Year of the
City, the <hi>3d</hi> of the <hi>187th Olympiad,</hi> and the <hi>13th</hi> of

and Valour, and one with whom he had contracted
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:102323:243"/>
so strict a Friendship and Alliance. He call'd his
Friends in, to whom he declar'd, <hi>That he had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
nothing to the Overthrow of</hi> Anthony <hi>through any
Hatred or Ambition;</hi> shewing 'em the Copies of the
Letters he had writ to him, which contain'd nothing
but just and reasonable Proposals, and <hi>Anthony</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
full of Passion and Disdain. After this he
sent <hi>Proculus</hi> to employ his utmost Address to seize
upon <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> extremely desiring to save her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but more especially to grace his Triumph with
this Queen, who had so long triumph'd over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Commanders. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> refus'd <hi>Proculus</hi> Entrance,
but through the Door demanded <hi>Aegypt</hi> for her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
which caus'd <hi>Proculus,</hi> after observing the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Monument, to return to <hi>Octavius,</hi> who
the same Instant sent <hi>Gallus</hi> with him to make her new
Propositions. While <hi>Gallus</hi> was discoursing with <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
below, <hi>Proculus</hi> with two others enter'd by the
Window at which <hi>Anthony</hi> had been drawn up;
which one of her Women perceiving, presently
shreek'd out, <hi>Wretched Princess, thou art taken alive!</hi>
Upon which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> turn'd quick, and drew out
her Dagger to stab her self; but <hi>Proculus</hi> caught hold
of her, saying, <hi>Madam, will you at once injure your self
and</hi> Caesar, <hi>in depriving him of the most illustrious Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
he can give of his Generosity; and make the best and
gentlest Prince in the World pass for Cruel and Barbarous?</hi>
Whereupon he disarm'd her, search'd her lest any
Poison shou'd be conceal'd about her; and after he
had secur'd her, he return'd to <hi>Octavius</hi> with this
joyful News.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> was extreamly satisfy'd to find this haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Queen at his Disposal, who before had lifted the
Crown of <hi>Aegypt</hi> above the Empire of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
He first commanded <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> to Guard her with
the greatest Care, and yet to serve her like a Queen;
after which he made his Entrance into <hi>Alexandria</hi>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:102323:244"/>
after a solemn and pompous Manner. The Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of <hi>Octavius</hi> follow'd by so many arm'd Soldiers,
who breath'd nothing but Destruction, drove the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> into great Fears and Apprehensions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
his Mercy upon their Knees. <hi>Octavius</hi> told
'em, <hi>He pardon'd 'em for the sake of their illustrious
Founder</hi> Alexander, <hi>for the extraordinary Beauty of the
City, and for his great Esteem he had for</hi> Arrius <hi>their
Fellow-Citizen and Philosopher.</hi> Several Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and <hi>Roman</hi> Senators begg'd of him the Body of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> to pay their last Respects to him, but he
wou'd not deprive <hi>Cleopatra</hi> of a Satisfaction so dear
to her; and more than that, he took Care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
her with what was needful for the Pomp of
the Funeral, which she solemniz'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
magnificence. <hi>Octavius</hi> took further Care that
nothing shou'd occasion the Encrese of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s
Afflictions; but the Greatness of her Soul, and the
Nobleness of her Courage, made the Loss of her
Liberty insupportable to her. Her excessive Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and the many Blows she had given her
Breasts, put her into a slow Fever, which gave her
great Hopes of ending her Sorrows, and her Life
in a short time. She had besides resolv'd to abstain
from Eating, if her Physician had not discover'd
this Secret she had trusted him with to <hi>Octavius,</hi>
who immediately threatned to put her Children all
to Death, if she persisted in her Obstinacy: This
was the only thing she cou'd be sensible of, and the
Thoughts of this caus'd her to comply, and receive
whatever they prescrib'd her.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Octavius</hi> resolv'd to visit <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and
by his Civilities give her fresh Assurance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
He found her upon a plain Bed, and as soon
as she perceiv'd him, she rose in her Shift to throw
her self at his Feet, with her Hair in disorder, her
Face torn, her Breasts bruis'd, her Eyes red with
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:102323:244"/>
weeping, and her Voice weak and trembling; all
which Accidents cou'd not deface the Brightness of
her Eyes, nor the Charming Air of her Face. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
civilly lifted her up, and sat down by her; and
immediately she enter'd upon the justifying her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
but when her Art and Skill fail'd her against
manifest Proofs, she turn'd her Discourse into hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Supplications, and deliver'd him an Inventory
of all her Treasure and Jewels. <hi>Seleucus</hi> her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
accusing her of concealing several things, <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
in a great Rage threw her self out of her
Bed, dragg'd him by the Hair, and beat him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely;
which some think was only a Pretence of
shewing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> her beautiful Shape and Body,
which she had too great a Confidence in. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Octavius</hi> only smil'd at this Action, and led the
Queen to her Bed. O Caesar, cry'd she, <hi>after the
Honour of Visiting me in this miserable Condition, is it not
cruel and barbarous, that a vile Slave shou'd accuse me of
laying aside a few Trifles; alas, not to adorn my self, but
to present 'em to</hi> Livia <hi>and</hi> Octavia, <hi>that their generous
Intercession may in some measure procure your Favour?</hi> This
Discourse gave great Satisfaction to <hi>Octavius,</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it imply'd a Desire she had of living; and
thereupon he assur'd her, <hi>She might keep her Iewels,
and that he wou'd use her more generously than she cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
reasonably hope for;</hi> and so retir'd; much satisfy'd
with his Success, having, as he suppos'd, over-reach'd
her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleopatra</hi> being soon after inform'd by <hi>Dolabella,</hi>
one of <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Favourites, and her Admirer, that
<hi>Octavius</hi> had resolv'd within three Days to send her
and her Children away, earnestly begg'd of <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to suffer her first to pay her last Oblations to the
Memory of <hi>Anthony,</hi> which he granted her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
she was carry'd to the stately Sepulchre where
<hi>Anthony</hi> was laid; and only attended by her two
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:102323:245"/>
Women, she fell upon her Knees, embrac'd his
Tomb with extream Grief and Passion; and after
a Flood of Tears, she cry'd, <hi>My dearest Lord, I was
a Queen and wore no Chains when I first plac'd thee in
this Monument, but now I pay my Duties, I'm Fortune's
Slave; my servile Body is reserv'd to grace the Triumph
of thy Foes, on which I dare not so much as print the
Marks of my Grief. These Tears, these Pangs of Grief
are the last Tokens of the Love and Duty of thy</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,
<hi>who now must be forc'd far from thee: No Chance
cou'd separate us while living, but our cruel Destiny will
part us in our Deaths; and as by a strange Turn of
Fate</hi> Aegypt <hi>has afforded thee a Tomb, so</hi> Rome <hi>will
me, the only Courtesie I shall receive from thy Country:
Yet I hope the Heavenly Powers that guard your happy
Abode, (for ours bave betray'd us) will stemm the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror's
Pride, and suffer him not to triumph over thee in
my Person. Hide me therefore here, and receive me into thy
Tomb; for among all my bitter Griefs and heavy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
none e'er press'd my Soul so hard as living thus long
without thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the finishing of these sad Lamentations,
she crown'd the Tomb with Garlands and Flowers,
embracing it as if she design'd to grow to it, till
her Women took her from thence to a Bath; after
which she attir'd her self after a most gorgeous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and eat as sumptuously as she cou'd. After
Dinner she clear'd the Room of all except <hi>Iras</hi> and
<hi>Charmia;</hi> and having procur'd an Asp to be secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought in among Figs, Grapes, and Flowers, she
apply'd it to her Arm; just before which she sent a
Letter to <hi>Octavius,</hi> wherein she most passionately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of her hard Fate, and very earnestly beseech'd
him, <hi>That it might be permitted her to be bury'd in the same
Tomb with</hi> Anthony. <hi>Octavius</hi> in all haste sent some
Messengers, who found her dead upon a Golden
Bed, adorn'd with her Royal Robes, in Posture of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:102323:245"/>
one asleep, with <hi>Iras</hi> also dead at her Feet, and
<hi>Charmia</hi> just breathing, and placing her Diadem
right. One of the Messengers very angrily ask'd,
<hi>Is this well done,</hi> Charmia? <hi>Extreamly well,</hi> reply'd she,
<hi>and becoming a Princess descended from so noble a Race of
Monarchs;</hi> at which she expir'd at her Mistresses
Feet. <hi>Octavius</hi> was extreamly troubl'd at <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s
Death, as being depriv'd of the noblest Ornament
of his Triumph: However, he cou'd not but admire
the Greatness of her Courage, who notwithstanding
the Weakness of her Sex, preferr'd Death before
the Loss of her Liberty, or the Appearing below her
Quality. He order'd her a Magnificent Funeral,
laying her Body by <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, according to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
and her Women were interr'd with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pomp in Memory of their Fidelity. She was
then thirty eight Years of Age, having reign'd
twenty two, twelve whereof she pass'd with <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
and her Death put an End to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Kingdom, which had flourish'd for many Ages.
Her Son <hi>Caesario</hi> which she had by <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
was shortly after slain by <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Orders, who was
told by <hi>Arrius</hi> the Philosopher, <hi>That many</hi> Caesar'<hi>s
were of dangerous Consequence. Aegypt</hi> was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
reduc'd into a Province, and <hi>Octavius</hi> caus'd
his Soldiers to cleanse the Chanels of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which
much improv'd the Fertility of the Soil: And since
this Kingdom much enlarg'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions,
especially as to Riches, and his entire Victories
brought Peace to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, at his Return he
was receiv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> with an universal Joy and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as a Person who had put an End to the
Miseries and Calamities in the greatest Part of the
World. He triumph'd three Days; for <hi>Illyrium,</hi>
for the Battel of <hi>Actium,</hi> and the Conquest of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
with extraordinary Splendor and Magnificence;
all which were attended with a happy shutting of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:102323:246"/>
the Temple of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which had stood open 205
Years.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> now finding himself Lord and
Governour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">U. C. 725.</note> partly by the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with which the People had at several Times
invested him, and partly by the Ruine of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
after this resolv'd to exercise all the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of a sweet temper'd Prince, and all the
Cunning of an exquisite Politician. To assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Adherents was his first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Care, to which End he publickly reported,
that he had burnt all <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Letters and Papers
without reading them; well knowing, that as long
as any thought themselves suspected Adversaries,
they wou'd never shew themselves real Friends. To
the Senators and Magistrates he made sumptuous
Feasts and Treats; to the <hi>Plebeians</hi> and Common
Sort he exhibited magnificent Shows and Plays;
and both he entertain'd with such Variety of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
as might reasonably banish their Sorrows for
the old <hi>Proscription,</hi> and remove their Fears of a new.
With great Wisdom and Dexterity he regulated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Abuses and Corruptions in the State; and tho'
he wou'd not give up the least part of his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet he exercis'd it with that Discretion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that the Common-wealth was more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
under his Government than when it enjoy'd all
its Privileges. He allow'd the People all their due
Liberties, only retrench'd the Liberty of making
Factions and Dissentions in the State; and to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
he restor'd their ancient Splendour, but banish'd
their late Corruption: He contended himself with a
moderate Power, which wou'd not afford him the
Freedom of doing Ill; but he made it Absolute,
when it impos'd upon others the Necessity of doing
Well. So that the People were not less Free, but in
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:102323:246"/>
Matters of Sedition; nor the Senate less Powerful,
but in Matters of Injustice; and the <hi>Romans</hi> seem'd
to have lost nothing of the Happiness that Liberty
might produce, but only the Misfortunes it might
occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> having establish'd so good an Order, found
himself extreamly embarrass'd with various Thoughts
and Opinions, and long consider'd with himself,
whether he ought to retain the Government of the
Empire, or restore the People to their first Liberty.
The eminent Examples of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
put him to many Doubts and Scruples, when he
consider'd that the former, who had voluntarily
quitted his Authority, dy'd peaceably in the midst
of his Enemies; and the latter, for retaining of it,
was assassinated by his most intimate Friends. But
then he consider'd on the other side, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
had been so extreamly harrass'd and
broken by violent Factions and Civil Wars, that
the Yoak wou'd prove their greatest Relief, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as he wou'd manage it. He found likewise that
the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had lost much of their ancient
Vigour and Desire of Liberty, and the Senate as
much of its ancient Firmness and Resolution; and
that there were such numerous Corruptions and such
dangerous distempers in the State, that nothing but
a Change cou'd cure or correct 'em. As he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that both Senate and People never wanted a
Head so much as at present, the Advantage of which
they were in this short time sensible of, so these
Considerations gave him great Hopes, and almost
as great Resolutions. However, this most wary
Prince thought it highly necessary for his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to consult his two intimate Friends <hi>Agrippa</hi> and
<hi>Mecoenas,</hi> the former most famous for his Courage
and Valour, and the latter for his great natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.
<hi>Octavius</hi> taking these two into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:102323:247"/>
ask'd their Advice, telling 'em among other
things, <hi>That they were his Friends, therefore he had made
'em his Iudges, as Men that were able to speak Soundly,
and willing to speak Freely: That he knew 'em to have a
greater Care of his Honour than his Profit, but more of the
Common-wealth than of both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Agrippa <hi>return'd the first Answer to this purpose:</hi>
You may well admire, my generous Lord, that I, who am
certain of an uncommon Promotion under your Empire,
shou'd advise you to a private Retirement; but since I
esteem your Honour above my own Profit, and the Publick
Good before my particular Preferrment, I am sure You will
pardon me. You have now gloriously finish'd the Civil Wars,
and brought an honourable Peace to your Country; but what
will the Advantage be, without a Restoration of that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for which those Wars were begun? Or what Benefit can
the People reap from so noble a Victory, if it be us'd only
as an Instrument for their greater Slavery? A Word so
odious to the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, that whenever that has
seem'd to have been aim'd at by any Person, no Vertues
could shield him, no Merits protect him, no Services se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him from the Rage of the People; no, not those of your
great Father <hi>Julius:</hi> And can you hope to escape? But
say, That the Divine Power shou'd so protect you as to out-live
such Dangers, wou'd you also out-live your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
Are you willing that Posterity shou'd brand you with
Tyranny, and perhaps with Baseness, in curbing and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Stop to the Fame and Grandeur of your Country?
A Country which has gain'd all its Renown and Reputation,
and owes all its great and glorious Acts to a Government
quite contrary to what you seem inclin'd to; and a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under which other Nations have generally been most
prosperous and flourishing. Therefore your Generosity shou'd
lead you to set your Country free, and since you are already
Master of the World's Forces, and without Rival in the
Empire, and have both Senate and People at your Mercy;
to do it now wou'd strike all Detraction dumb, and make
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:102323:247"/>
future Ages stand amaz'd at the Greatness of your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>Mecoenas <hi>on the other side declar'd his Thoughts
after this Manner:</hi> Be not deceiv'd, most noble Prince,
with the specious Shew of Words and Names; but since just
Heaven has ordain'd you a Father, as well as a Master of
your Country, rather hearken to her real Wants and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
than to the fallacious Clamours of the Rabble, who
like Children cry for what wou'd prove their Ruine. Our
Republick is a Ship fraught with Multitudes of various
Nations, and destitute of a Pilot, which for many Years
has been miserably toss'd and shatter'd, and is now ready
to be cast away, without your relieving Hand to save it.
In former times indeed this thriving Empire did not seem
to want a Monarch; but is is now grown too vast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy,
to subsist without one. Formerly the Strictness of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline and Morality, and the Fears of
rival Nations kept the Common-wealth from sinking: Yet
in those pure Times, what Commotions in State, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
in Government, what Divisions and Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were occasion'd by the <hi>Tribunes</hi> Rage and Peoples Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
<hi>Camillus, Rome</hi>'s second Founder, and <hi>Scipio,</hi>
that Scourge of <hi>Carthage,</hi> were disgrac'd, and the great
<hi>Coriolanus</hi> banish'd, only because their Worth alone had
lifted 'em above the ordinary Pitch of Subjects But then to
mention all the numerous Troubles and dreadful Miseries
of these latter Times, were to revive our Sorrows, which
you in a great Measure have allay'd; and since by your
Means your Country has recover'd some of her Spirits, it
is your Duty to establish her in perfect Health, which can
be no Ways done but by retaining the Empire. And this
Advice is not only for the good of your Country, but also
for the Security of your Person: for the resigning of
your Authority wou'd be the Parting with your Safety.
<hi>Pompey</hi> was contemn'd after the Disbanding of his Army
at <hi>Brundusium;</hi> and tho' your Uncle Julius fell, it was
not for retaining his Power, but for grasping of it too
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:102323:248"/>
strongly, which you know better how to manage. In the
gaining of an Empire there is no Medium between the
Death of an Enemy, and the Life of a Prince; and since
you have already gone so far, you must either resolve to be
Greatest in the State, or Least among the People, to be <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
or Nothing,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> thank'd 'em both for their friendly Advice,
and after some dubious Expressions, declar'd himself
rather inclin'd to <hi>Mecoena</hi>'s Opinion; withal telling
them, <hi>That he was but the Instrument of the Destinies,
to put their Wills in Execution; and since they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shewn themselves so favourable to him, he had all the
Reason to hope that his Friends wou'd not be backward in
their Councels, or any other necessary Assistance.</hi> Upon
which <hi>Mecoenas</hi> proceeded to give him many wise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and Directions, how to manage his Affairs
to the best Advantage, both as to his Countries Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and his own Security, as may be seen at large
in <hi>Dion Cassius.</hi> Among a great many other things
he told him, <hi>That his virtuous Behaviour wou'd be a
greater Security to him than all his Forces: That if the
People found him modest and unblamable in his Life,
not exacting Money from others while be abounded in
Riches, not pinching others while be was luxurious, nor
punishing others while he was loose and licentious, they
wou'd certainly love and honour him as a true Father
and Preserver of his Country.</hi> But this he told him as
his principal Rule by which he ought to guide
himself; <hi>Always to preserve the Love of his Subjects,
and if he wou'd do exactly as he himself wou'd expect
from his Prince, if he were a Subject, then he shou'd
not fail of being prosperous in his Designs, happy in his
Life, and famous in History.</hi> He concluded all with
telling him, <hi>That if in taking upon him the Soveraign
Power, he fear'd the Name of</hi> Kingdom <hi>as odious, he
might omit that, and manage all under the Title of</hi>
Caesar: <hi>If he thought not that sufficient, they wou'd give
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:102323:248"/>
him that of</hi> Imperator, <hi>and wou'd adorn him with some
other venerable Note of Honour; so that he might enjoy
all the Privileges of a</hi> Kingdom <hi>without the envious
Name of</hi> King, <hi>which the</hi> Romans <hi>cou'd not endure.</hi>
All these Things confirm'd <hi>Caesar</hi> in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinions; and from this time he began to
pursue his Designs with more Care and Diligence
than ever.</p>
                  <p>III. The <hi>Romans</hi> were now arriv'd to their utmost
Height as to polite Learning, and an exquisite Taste
of Things, as appears from their several Writings:
For besides <hi>Virgil,</hi> formerly mention'd, at this time
flourish'd the two greats Wits, <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> the
pleasantest and perfectest Poets in their Kinds;
and likewise <hi>Livy,</hi> the Prince of all the <hi>Roman</hi>
Historians; all which had a great Share in <hi>Octavius</hi>'s
Familiarity, as well as <hi>Mecoenas</hi>'s. <hi>Octavius</hi> was a
great Promoter of all sorts of Learning, and having
brought a General Peace to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he
had a fairer Opportunity both of incouraging that,
and of following his other Designs. He had an
admirable Faculty of discerning and penetrating
into the Humours and Ambitions of the principal
Men; in which he was much assisted by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
found in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Coffers, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preserv'd, and secretly made use of as he
found Occasion. As for Words and Libels, he took
little or no Notice of, having learnt that both
from his Uncle <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Mecoenas, Never to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at what was spoken against him.</hi> And this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
he found much to his Advantage; for by this
he not only understood the Minds and Affections
of the People more easily, but perceiv'd that as
long as the common Sort retain'd this Liberty of
Speech, they were the less sensible of the Loss of
Liberty in State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="444" facs="tcp:102323:249"/>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> was now in his fifth Consulship, and by
the Advice of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> he took upon him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Imperator,</hi> not in that Sense it was anciently
wont to be given for Victories obtain'd, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the chief Command or Authority, as it
had been decreed to his Uncle <hi>Iulius.</hi> And the
great Industry of <hi>Agrippa</hi> was no less serviceable to
him than the wise Counsels of <hi>Mecoenas;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he had at first advis'd him to contrary
Methods, he now prov'd as useful an Assistant as the
other. Shortly after he was made <hi>Censor,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
with him; and among other things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Office, he took great Care to purge
and reform the Senate, into which many <hi>Equites</hi>
and unworthy <hi>Plebeians</hi> had crept, during the late
Civil Wars; and then encreas'd their Number to
a Thousand,<note place="margin">1000 Senators.</note> which his Uncle had brought to
nine Hundred. All this he did with great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Discretion, always shewing much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to that venerable Assembly; and tho' he
continually diminish'd their Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he still preserv'd their ancient Glory and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
well knowing that <hi>Iulius</hi>'s Contempt of the
Senate, did most of all forward his Ruine; he put
two Persons; namely <hi>Cluilius</hi> and <hi>Furnius</hi> into the
Rank of <hi>Consulares,</hi> because they had been design'd
for Consuls, tho' prevented by others. He also
rank'd certain Families among the <hi>Patritians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most of those had perish'd in the late Wars.
One great and publick Way of bridling the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
was his publishing an Edict, forbidding any
<hi>Senator</hi> to Travel out of <hi>Italy</hi> without his Leave;
a thing very strictly observ'd by his Successors:
For he well knew that the Presence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Persons of that honourable Rank might
raise great Commotions in an unsetled State. Yet
not wholly to imprison 'em, he gave 'em Liberty
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:102323:249"/>
to visit <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Gallia Narbonensis,</hi> Provinces ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to the Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnish'd
for Wars, and by reason of their Variety
of Pleasures, more likely to weaken their Minds
than to arm their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>In the following Year, <hi>Octavius</hi> having enter'd
upon his sixth Consulship,<note place="margin">U. C. 726.</note> together with <hi>Agrippa</hi>
his Collegue, made a <hi>Lustrum,</hi> which was many
Years after the last Celebration of one, and in this
four Millions and 63 Thousand Polls of <hi>Romans,</hi>
in which Number must be reckond all Women,
Children, Servants, and Slaves; a Number almost
incredible, if compar'd with the present Cities of
the World, but the less, if we consider the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
bigness of the City and Suburbs, which good
Authors affirm to have been fifty Miles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
at this time. <hi>Octavius</hi> at that time likewise
celebrated Games, which had been Decreed in
Memory of his Victory at <hi>Actium,</hi> and it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that they shou'd be renew'd every fifty Year,
four Colleges of Priests, taking care of 'em; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Pontifices, Augurs, Septemviri,</hi> and <hi>Quindecem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi>
by Courses. He caus'd many other delightful
Games and Exercises to be made, all at his own
Cost and Charges, using all possible Methods to
divert the People from fixing their Minds upon
his Actions, and their ancient Freedom. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
that two Persons of <hi>Praetorian</hi> Rank shou'd
Yearly over-see the Treasury, and gave to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
four times as much Corn as they were wont
to have; to some Senators he gave Money, some
of this Rank being so poor, that they cou'd not
bear Offices belonging to their Dignity. All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
and Debts to the Exchequer he made
void that stood good before the Battel at <hi>Actium,</hi>
except what concern'd Buildings. He suffer'd no
Sacrifice to be offer'd to <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:102323:250"/>
the <hi>Pomaerium,</hi> and took great Care about set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Religion, and repairing of the Temples. And
because many unjust Things had been ordain'd
during the late Seditions and Civil Wars, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the last <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> he made 'em all void
by one Edict, and caus'd 'em to cease from his
sixth Consulship. Thus <hi>Octavius</hi> more and more
setled the Peace of the City, and gain'd the Hearts
and Affections of the People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IV.</hi> Octavius <hi>now entring upon his seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">U. C. 727.</note>
                     <hi>and finding all Matters ripe for his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
he went to the Senate-House, after he had
prepar'd all the Senators who were for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and in a studied Speech spoke to this Effect.</hi>
When I consider with my self the immense Greatness,
and boundless extent of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> I am
strucken with Surprize, nay and Amazement, to imagine
that any Mortal dare undertake the sole Administration
of so vast a State. What Nation have not either begg'd
Peace at our Gates, or felt the Fury of our Arms at their
own? And what Countries have not we conquer'd and
brought to Subjection; making the Rising and Setting
of the Sun, the Bounds of our Dominions? Therefore it
must proceed from a wild and extravagant Opinion of
their own Abilities, when any pretended to bare that
Burden which none but the immortal Gods cou'd sustain.
As for my own Part, who may with Modesty affirm,
that I have put an End to all domestick Wars, and have
brought Peace to the City, I dare not presume to attempt
it. Tho' I am invited to it by all the powerful Charms of
commanding the greatest People upon Earth, and the most
glorious Empire next Heaven, and also entic'd by the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Opportunity of establishing my self that ever <hi>Roman</hi>
had; yet I freely divest my self of all that Power and
Authority, which my Arms have gain'd, and you have
given me: An Action which I presume is no less glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:102323:250"/>
than just, far exceeding the Conquests of <hi>Gaul,</hi>
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> an Action no less hardy
than those bold Performances of <hi>Coecles,</hi> of <hi>Scaevola,</hi>
of <hi>Curtius,</hi> of <hi>Regulus,</hi> and of the <hi>Decii.</hi> And
further to shew you, that the true Spirit of the ancient
<hi>Romans</hi> is not extinct in me; I do not only restore
to you all your former Laws and Privileges, and such
Things as I have been entrusted with, but likewise all
that I have further acquir'd since my first Authority;
and may this Action prove auspicious and fortunate
to my Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> enlarg'd much upon the Particulars, and
upon the finishing his Speech, the Minds of the
Senators were variously affected. Many knew his
Design, and therefore agreed with his Intentions;
the rest either suspected his Aim, or believ'd his
Words. Of these some admir'd his Policy in
concealing his Purposes; others were concern'd at
his Design, some at his Cunning, and others at
his Refusal of the Government. Many hated the
popular Form of Government as dangerous in
these Times, and approv'd of the Change, being
well satisfy'd with <hi>Octavius</hi>'s Administration. Most
of the rest being worn and weary'd out with
their many vain Strugglings for their Liberty, and
very desirous of Ease and Rest, chose rather the
Present Estate with Security, than to strive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Old with Danger. So that the Product
of their several Affections were the same; for
those who wish'd he was reduc'd to a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
were very fearful of what might follow;
and such as desir'd he might retain his Power,
were as sorry for the Loss of their Hopes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cou'd they who did not believe him, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him; for some wanted the Will, and others
the Courage to do it. No Man, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believ'd
his Speech or not, durst commend it,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:102323:251"/>
because a great many were displeas'd with it, and as
many afraid of it. Wherefore having often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him whilst speaking, soon after he had
done, they unanimously besought him with many
Words and Entreaties, <hi>That he alone wou'd take upon
him the Administration of the thei Government;</hi> and after
many Arguments and Persuasions, they compell'd
him, as it were, to accept of the Sovereignty.
And that his Person might be more safely preserv'd,
they immediately decreed the Pay of his Guard to
be double to that of all other Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> by his Artifice of pretending
to lay down all his Power and Authority, got it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to him both by Senate and People. Yet that
he might seem to be Popular, he refus'd to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
all the Provinces, or to have a perpetual
Power over such as he shou'd take care of: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the weaker and inward Provinces, being in a
more peaceable Posture, he left to the Senate; the
most powerful and outward Provinces, and those
most expos'd to Enemies, he kept to himself,
saying, <hi>Than he desir'd that the Fathers might enjoy
their Power with all Ease and Safety, while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

useless, and of no effect, and by this he engross'd
all the Soldiers and Militia to himself. To the

<hi>Spain,</hi> all <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as also <hi>Syria, Phoenicia,
Aegypt, &amp;c.</hi> which were Frontier Provinces. Over
these Provinces he assum'd the Government but
from ten Years, well remembring how dangerous
the Word <hi>Perpetual</hi> had been to his Uncle <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
and adding, <hi>That as soon as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he wou'd quit his Power.</hi> After this he set over the
Provinces of both sorts Men of <hi>Patritian</hi> Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but over <hi>Aegypt</hi> one of the <hi>Eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>estrain</hi> Rank
only, and with the lowest Title of all other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
fearing lest a Person of the highest Rank
presuming upon the Wealth and Situation of that
Country, shou'd prove dangerous to the <hi>Roman</hi>
State. He alotted <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> to Senators, and
the rest of the Provinces to <hi>Praetorians;</hi> but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
either to take upon 'em this Employment
within five Years after they had born Offices in
the City. They held their Government but for
a Year; and as soon as Successors were sent 'em,
they were immediately to depart the Provinces,
and not to fail of being at <hi>Rome</hi> within three
Months.</p>
                  <p>As soon as <hi>Octavius</hi> had but made his Oration
about resigning his Command, and distributing the
Provinces, many Honours were conferr'd on him,
as that Laurel shou'd be planted before his Gates
in the <hi>Palatium,</hi> and upon those Trees Oaken Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
to be hung, as for one who was a perpetual
Conqueror of Enemies, and Preserver of Citizens.
The House of the Emperor also was for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
call'd the <hi>Palatium</hi> or <hi>Palace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Palatium.</note> not by any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
but because <hi>Octavius</hi> liv'd on the <hi>Palatium</hi> or
<hi>Palatine Hill,</hi> and there was his <hi>Praetorium:</hi> His
House also receiv'd some Dignity from the Mount
it self, because <hi>Romulus</hi> liv'd there; therefore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
if the Emperors were remov'd else-where,
yet the House were still call'd <hi>Palatia</hi> or <hi>Palaces.</hi>
Immediately after the Provinces were divided, and
all Publick Affairs settled, it was debated in the
Senate, whether <hi>Octavius</hi> ought to have the Title
of <hi>Romulus,</hi> because he had founded the Empire;
but the more venerable Name of <hi>AUGUSTUS,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustus.</note>
propounded by <hi>Munacius Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us,</hi> at length seem'd

                     </gap> and Temples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
by <hi>Augurs</hi> were term'd <hi>Augusta</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
Caesar,</hi> tho' he much desir'd that of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
yet perceiving he shou'd be suspected of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Title of <hi>King,</hi> declin'd it, and was sirnam'd
<hi>Augustus,</hi> intimating something in him more than
<hi>Mortal;</hi> and this he accepted of, a Title expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
more Dignity and Reverence, than Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And Things are call'd <hi>Augusta,</hi> which are most
worthy of Honour, and most Sacred; wherefore
the <hi>Greeks</hi> express it by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Venerable.</hi> From
this Day forward began the Sovereign Power and
Authority to be in the Hands of one Man, and
by a Law call'd <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> all the Power of the
People and Senate was transferr'd upon <hi>Augustus.</hi>
When his ten Years were expir'd, ten more were
added, and after that as many more, so that he
had his Authority still continu'd for his Life; for
which Cause his Successors, tho' they had the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
settled on 'em for the Term of Life, yet at the
End of every ten Years, solemniz'd at it were the
Renewing of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> became Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, neither by Inheritance,
nor Usurpation, nor Conquest, nor Election, yet
by means of 'em all. This great Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
hapned in the <hi>727th</hi> Year of the City,
<hi>A. M.</hi> 3978, in the second Year of the <hi>188th O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad,</hi>
482 Years since the Beginning of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular</hi>
State, 303 since the Beginning of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Empire, 33 since the Beginning of the <hi>Mix'd
State,</hi> 17 since the Death of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and 25
before our Saviour's Nativity.</p>
                  <p>Here ended the greatest <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in the
World, and at the same time began the greatest <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
a Monarchy so well fix'd, and firmly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
that nor all the tyrannical Carriage of those
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:102323:252"/>
Monsters of Men that succeeded <hi>Augustus,</hi> cou'd
shake it; a Monarchy, which if it be consider'd
with others, as to its Power and Riches, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with its Extent and Continuance, there
is scarce any room left for Comparison; and a
Monarchy which the <hi>Romans,</hi> for many Years,
believ'd Indissoluble and Immortal. The <hi>Roman</hi>
Dominions were now almost brought to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Extent, containing in <hi>Europe, Italy,</hi> both the
<hi>Gauls, Spain, Greece, Illyricum, Dacia, Panonia,</hi> with
some part of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> In <hi>Asia,</hi> all
those Provinces which went under the Name
of <hi>Asia Minor, Armenia, Syria, Iudaea,</hi> with
part of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Media;</hi> and in <hi>Africa, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Africk, Numidia, Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Lybia;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many Islands, and some Parts of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
All which comprehended the greatest, and
far the best Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> with very large Parts
of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> being no less than between 3
and 4000 Miles in length, and about half as much
in breadth. As to the yearly Revenues of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
by a moderate Computation, it has been reckon'd
at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh forty Millions of our Money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Gaul</hi> paid five, and that without being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
burdensom to the People. But what still makes
it seem greater, is what <hi>Vespasian</hi> told the Senate at
his coming to the Empire, that he wanted 40000000
of <hi>Sestercium</hi>'s to settle the Common-wealth, which
amounts to 312000000 of our Money.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, they had now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so elevated a Temper, either for the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Genius, or the Force of the Soul, as in some
Time in the Republick; but had something more
Polite and Sociable; and never were more glorious,
or at least, more pleasant Times than now, all Wars
and Contests ceasing, all Arts and Sciences flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
and all Riches and Pleasures increasing.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:102323:253"/>
In short, <hi>Augustus</hi> made the World happy, and was
happy in the World; he had nothing to desire of the
Publick, nor the Publick of him: And considering
the many Evils he occasion'd before he came to the
Empire, and the great Good he did after he was
Emperor, it was said with good Reason, <hi>That he
shou'd never have been born, or never have dy'd.</hi> But
for his Actions afterwards, and his further settlement
of the Empire, I must leave to the other Volume of
this History.</p>
