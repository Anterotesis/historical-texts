         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from the General meeting of Officers of the Army, and directed

               <salute>DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER it pleaſed the Lord ſo wonderfully to appear for his people in owning the
poor endeavours of his ſervants as to the late Wars in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by
that Glorious victory he was pleaſed to give us at <hi>Worcester,</hi> this Nation being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſuch an unexpected peaceable condition, It was the expectation of thoſe that
feared the Lord, that ſome ſuitable returns would have been made to the glory of God,
the comfort of the godly, and the well being of the People of this <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hitherto it hath been matter of ſad lamentation, that the good things hoped
for, have not been brought forth amongſt us; inſomuch that the work of the Lord hath ſeemed to ſtand
ſtill, and all the inſtruments thereof have been like men of no might, or like a woman in travel ready to
faint for want of ſtrength to bring forth, whileſt thoſe that ſtand by are waiting for the birth; Which
Satan, the grand Enemy of God and his people, obſerving, hath not been wanting to ſtir up his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
to conceive new hopes, and by new deſigns to endeavour the deſtroying of that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
the Lord hath hitherto owned; and to ſet up an oppoſite intereſt, which might reproach the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
works of God, and make the inſtruments whom he hath uſed, and bleſſed, Offenders.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the conſideration of theſe things lay ſad upon our hearts, together with the late miſcariage of
our Fleet, it pleaſed the Lord to put into the heart of the General &amp; the Officers now at the Head-quarters
being of, and belonging to the Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> to ſeek the Lord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to humble our ſelves at his ſeet, for thoſe evils which might cauſe him to withdraw his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
from us, and to manifeſt tokens of his diſpleaſure againſt us. And after ſeveral daies waiting at the
Throne of Grace, we were generally convinced.</p>
            <p>That our hearts have been looking after the things of this world, and our own private affairs, more
then the things of Jeſus Chriſt and his People.</p>
            <p>That we have been overtaken with a ſlothful ſpirit, and growing weary of the work of the Lord,
have been ready to ſay with <hi>Baruch. Wo is me now, for the Lord hath added grief to my ſorrow, I fainted in my
ſighing, and I find no reſt,</hi> Jer. 45. 3.</p>
            <p>That thoſe that fear the Lord, both in the Army and elſewhere, have not in this time of peace ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
their intereſt one in another as they ought, to the <hi>edifying of each other in love,</hi> as the Churches
did Act. 9. 31. (<hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Galilee <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>and were edified, and
walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghost were multiplied.</hi>) But have been too apt
by evil ſirmiſings, and jealouſies, to grieve the hearts, and weaken the hands of one another.</p>
            <p>That the people of this Nation are ſubject to grievous oppreſſions through the obſtruction of Juſtice:
and that the Lord might ſay to us, for whom he hath done ſuch great things in <hi>England,</hi> as he did to his
Vine-yard <hi>Iſa. 5. 7. And he looked for Judgement, but behold Oppreſſion, for Righteouſneſſe, but behold a Cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That through the corruption of many in places of authority, ſome <hi>good</hi> men are made to ſuffer for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſake and many bad men take encouragement in their licentious principles, and prophane practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
by reaſon whereof wickedneſs doth very much abound amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe and the like conſiderations, we have been ſtrongly convinced, that it is a duty very
much incumbent upon us to awaken our ſelves, and by all lawful waies and means to endeavour the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of theſe following things, which have been promiſed by the Parliament, and, as we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are under their preſent conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For the preventing the many inconveniencies apparently ariſing from the long continuance of
the ſame perſons in Supreme Authority, That there may be ſucceſſive Parliaments conſiſting of men faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the intereſt of the Commonwealth; Men of truth, fearing God, and hating covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Lawes may be regulated in ſuch ſort, that what is good in them may be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the corruptions, abuſes, delaies, vexations, unneceſſary travels and expences, and whatſoever
ſhall be found really burthen ſome and grievous to the people, may be taken away.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That liberty and protection may be given by a Law to all the truly godly though of different
judgements, to worſhip God peaceably, without impoſing upon, or moleſting one another. And that
no encouragement be thereby given to ſuch as are popiſh or prophane in the exerciſe of their ſuperſtitious
forms, or licentious practiſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt may be diſpenſed to all the people of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and thoſe that labour faithfully in that work, receive all due countenance and encouragement.</p>
            <p>And having thus freely opened our hearts to you, we earneſtly begg the aſſiſtance of your prayers,
(in which we truſt you will be frequent and fervent) that we may in all things demean our ſelves as
becometh us. And what the Lord ſhall ſet upon your hearts, by way of conviction either as to ſin, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if you do communicate the ſame to us, we ſhall take it as a ſign of your acceptance of this our brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
freedome towards you.</p>
            <p>We ſhal now commend you to the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and remain your moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Friends and brethren.</p>
