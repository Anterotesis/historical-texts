            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>HAving obſerved that in one of the late Trials, it did appear by one of the
Witneſſes, that the Jeſuits old flam is ſtill alive in ſome of their mouths,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Powder-Plot was but a trick of <hi>Cecil</hi>'s (as <hi>Ireland</hi> told Mr.
<hi>Jenniſon</hi>) to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Papiſts, I have thought good to give here
an account of the Trial and Execution of Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> written by a Learned
and Eminent Roman Catholick, the Truth of which he had confirmed to him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others of the ſame profeſſion, who were eye and ear witneſſes of what he writes;
and which he addreſſed unto the Pope himſelf: and therefore I preſume he may be
accounted by Papiſts a more impartial Relater, then if he had been a perſon in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumſtances, or had not told it the Pope to his face to keep him from
being fallible in Sainting a Traytour; for the Author had ſaid but a few lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Garnet</hi> had been lately inſerted into the Catalogue of Holy Martyrs in the
Engliſh Martyrology, made by one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> ſometimes Scribe to Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in
the Engliſh Colledge at <hi>Rome.</hi> I confeſs I have ſometimes wondred at the wit,
as well as the im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udence of thoſe men who think they have finely excuſed themſelves
by ſaying that <hi>Cecil</hi> trapan'd them into that Plot. (for that they were in it over
head and ears, the preſent Relation ſhews) when as they might more truly have
ſaid that the Devil drew them into the Conſpiracy, (as they ſaid he diſcovered it)
which would have been the better excuſe of the two; by how much the Devil is a more
ſubtle Seducer, and ſo it will be the leſs imputation of reproach to have been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted
by him; but in laying the fault on <hi>Cecil,</hi> they do thereby but prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as weak as wicked, and as much Fools as Knaves, and ſo renounce that Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
attribute of their Order. Upon this Narrative the Reader will (I doubt not)
make many conſiderable Remarks; as for inſtance,</p>
            <p>1. That it's no new thing for a Jeſuit to curſe and ban himſelf to juſtifie a lie;
and therefore leſs to be wondred that they ſhould die with a lie in their mouths
now.</p>
            <p>2. That one Reaſon of their ſo doing is, becauſe they think the contrary cannot be
prov'd againſt them; or, upon their Execrations of themſelves, will not be believed
to be true.</p>
            <p>3. That they have a certain Doctrine of Equivocation among themſelves, how
far, and when it may be made uſe of, which unleſs others knew too, they cannot tell
how far or when to truſt them; but if they did know, the trick would become uſeleſs
and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>4. That the Society is greatly improved ſince thoſe times, eſpecially in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
vein; for here poor <hi>Garnet</hi> is ſaid to have bluſh'd, when found in a lie, and
to have confeſt his fault; but his Succeſſors had ſo much of the <hi>White,</hi> that no
red could be ſeen; they are now got above ſuch childiſh paſſions, as our late Trials
and Executions have given us abundant Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>5. That all Papiſts were not in the Plot Then, as 'tis hop'd they are not Now;
but what they might have been after the blow given, we know not; but as then 'twas
diſown'd when it ſucceeded not, ſo now deni'd that it may go on; but I ſhall leave
the Reader to make his own further Obſervation.</p>

            <head>THE
TRYAL
AND
EXECUTION
Of Father
HENRY GARNET, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FAther <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> being at that time Superiour-provincial of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
in <hi>England,</hi> was in a Publick Court of Judicature held by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Peers of the Realm, and thoſe Privy Counſellours to our Serene
King (many thouſands of men, and among them many Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
being preſent) arraigned and condemned, and afterward executed for
being a contriver of, or conſenter to, or at leaſt privy to that moſt horrible
Powder-Treaſon.</p>
            <p>There were many proofs offer'd to the twelve Jury-men (who by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Cuſtom are to paſs their Verdict, whether the Priſoner at the Bar be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or not of the Crimes whereof he is accuſed, before the Judge may paſs his
Sentence) by the King's Council and other Lord's appointed by the King,
who ſate upon the Bench, which did prove the ſaid Father <hi>Garnet</hi> guilty
of contriving, or conſenting to, or at leaſt being privy to the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Treaſon.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it would be too tedious to reckon up in particular all thoſe
proofs which were taken and objected againſt him, both out of letters written
with his own hand, and produced by the King's Council, and alſo out of his
own free Confeſſion, which he had before his Trial made unto the Lord's Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
who examin'd him, and ſign'd with his own hand; (for, which is very
conſiderable, he was not compelled to diſcover the truth by putting him to any
kind of torture, which yet is uſual in all other Nations, but they only took
thoſe things in writing, which he of his own accord would confeſs) And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
out of the Teſtimonies of the Conſpirators themſelves (and Mrs. <hi>Anne
Vaux,</hi> one very intimate and familiar with him) all which are apparently to
be ſeen partly in the Publick Records, ſince printed by Authority, and partly
in the Anſwer of the Biſhop, then of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> now of <hi>Ely</hi> to <hi>Matthew Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who doth examine the matter with great accuracy: Therefore I ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64572:3"/>
content my ſelf to relate only ſome few things of many, which I have heard
confirmed to me by Roman Catholicks, who were preſent at his Trial, which
he either was publickly convicted of, or confeſſed himſelf in open Court.
And which may be abundantly ſufficient, for your Holineſs to make a clear
Judgment from them, whether Father <hi>Garnet</hi> be to be accounted a true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
of Chriſt, and to have ſuffered for righteouſneſs ſake, or elſe a very Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
and to have ſuffered for his own demerits; or elſe, being neither Martyr
nor Traytor, he were condemned of that Powder Conſpiracy unjuſtly only,
and without ſufficient Evidence. <hi>Firſt of all</hi> therefore there were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proofs offered to the Jury, which did ſeem to prove evidently, that Father
<hi>Garnet</hi> was <hi>privy</hi> to the ſaid Conſpiracy, and therefore himſelf did in open
Court before all preſent confeſs,</p>
            <p>1. That he had had ſome notice of the <hi>Plot</hi> in the general, even out of
Confeſſion, from <hi>Catesby,</hi> who was the principal Conſpirator; when he came
to Father <hi>Garnet</hi> to ask his advice, whether it were lawful in any caſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the innocent together with the guilty; which (ſaid Father <hi>Garnet</hi>) at
firſt I thought to be but an idle queſtion, though indeed afterwards I did ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that he had ſome ill deſign in his mind; and yet to this queſtion he gave
his Reſolution, <hi>viz.</hi> That without doubt a man might lawfully deſtroy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
together with the nocent, if the doing of it might produce ſo much
good as might countervail the death of ſome innocent perſons.</p>
            <p>2. He confeſſed alſo that he could have known the whole Plot in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
from <hi>Catesby,</hi> who would have made to him a particular Narrative of his
Deſign, which yet <hi>Garnet</hi> would not liſten unto. But Father <hi>Garnet</hi> affirmed
that he did deſire <hi>Catesby</hi> once and again to acquaint the Pope with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
To which <hi>Catesby</hi> returned this Anſwer, that he would not
learn the Pope's mind of him, which himſelf did not at all doubt of.</p>
            <p>3. He confeſt that he had heard the whole Conſpiracy in Particulars from
the Jeſuit Father <hi>Oſwald Treſmond, alias Greenwel,</hi> whom he ſtrictly injoyned,
(ſaid Father <hi>Garnet</hi>) both to deſiſt from the Enterprize himſelf, and to uſe his
utmoſt endeavour that the reſt of the Conſpirators ſhould proceed no further.</p>
            <p>But to this his Anſwer the King's Attourney thus replied; that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
was not true, but ſeigned and ſhifting, and only palliated under the
pretext of Confeſſion, ſeeing that about this Confeſſion Father <hi>Garnet</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noriouſly
ſhuffled before the Lords Delegates: For being commanded to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſeriouſly whether or no he had really in Confeſſion heard the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Particulars; <hi>I anſwer</hi> (ſaith Father <hi>Garnet) that as we were walking,</hi> Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
alias Greenwel <hi>declared the whole matter under the greateſt zeal;</hi> which
I underſtood of the zeal of Confeſſion, though he perhaps might mean ſome
other leſs zeal; neither can I affirm it for certain that he did intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what he did in way of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſaid, that there was no credit to be given to his
bare Affirmation or Negation, ſeing that Father <hi>Garnet</hi> had formerly before
the Lords Delegates been convicted of manifeſt perjury to his own great
bluſhing and confuſion. For when after his ſecret diſcourſe with <hi>Oldcorn</hi> the
Jeſuit (<hi>alias Hall</hi>) (which yet was over-heard by ſome) he was asked by the
Lords Delegates, and deſired to anſwer without Equivocation, whether or no he
had had any conference with Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> in the Priſon; Father <hi>Garnet</hi> did
peremptorily deny it upon his Salvation, which he repeated with ſuch horrid
Imprecations (ſaid the Earl) that he ſeemed to wound the ears of thoſe that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64572:3"/>
heard him. And yet ſo ſoon as Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> confeſt that he had diſcourſed
with him, Father <hi>Garnet</hi> bluſhed ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> pardon of the Lords Delegates, and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quivocation could relieve him. And
afterward the ſame Earl asked Father <hi>Garnet</hi> that he would produce but ſo
much as one Argument beſides his own ſimple Negation, which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a prudent man to believe that he was not conſenting to the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
<hi>to whom Father</hi> Garnet <hi>anſwered not a word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the ſecond place,</hi> That Father <hi>Garnet</hi> was not only privy, but alſo <hi>conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to the Conſpiracy, theſe among others were the proofs.</p>
            <p>1. His Silence and concealing of it, having heard it in the general from
<hi>Catesby,</hi> (and might alſo have heard it in particular but refuſed) yet did not
reveal it. For he that conceals what he ought to diſcover, is ſaid to conſent
to it; and he which doth not hinder what he might, and ought to hinder, by
revealing it, it is manifeſt that he is conſenting to it.</p>
            <p>2. The Father <hi>Teſmond</hi>'s and Father <hi>Gerrard</hi>'s (both Jeſuits) and the reſt
of the Conſpirators perſiſting in the Plot; who did wholly depend upon the
Authority of thoſe Fathers, eſpecially <hi>Garnet,</hi> in this wicked Enterprize; as
alſo the words of Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> the Jeſuit to <hi>Humphrey Littleton,</hi> when (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conſpiracy was diſcovered) he told him that <hi>Catesby</hi> and others were
miſerably wounded by the ſuddain firing of Gun-powder, and that he was
heartily ſorry that the pains of ſo many days was now vaniſhed into ſmoke,
and was come to ſo lamentable an iſſue; whom Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> bad not to
take it ſo much to heart, nor judge of the Equity of the Cauſe by the Event.
For, the <hi>Eleven Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and thoſe) gathered together at God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
did twice joyn battle with their <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yet
both times they loſt the day. And <hi>Saint Lewis King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> raiſed a vaſt
Army, and went to the Holy War againſt the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> though he had a good
Cauſe, yet was he conquered, and his Army routed. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo that
ſo ſtoutly defended <hi>Rhodes</hi> againſt the Aſſaults of the <hi>Turks,</hi> yet were they
conſtrained to reſign the City to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>For, all theſe things do ſeem to make it ſufficiently manifeſt, that Father
<hi>Garnet</hi> did not truly and really deteſt that Conſpiracy, nor cordially command
Father <hi>Teſmond</hi> and Father <hi>Gerard</hi> to deſiſt from it; ſince it is not likely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they had well underſtood that Father <hi>Garnet</hi> did conſent to that Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
that they durſt have perſiſted in ſo horrid a wickedneſs; which, if it
were once diſcovered, would prove the <hi>Ruine</hi> of their whole <hi>Society</hi> here in
<hi>England;</hi> and this, contrary to the command of their <hi>Superior.</hi> Nor that
Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> ſhould dare to commend it as a good Enterprize even after it
was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (to conclude) that Father <hi>Garnet</hi> was not only privy and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but alſo an <hi>Adviſer</hi> of it, theſe among others were the
Reaſons brought to prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſhewing to <hi>Catesby</hi> of two Apoſtolick Letters or Briefs of Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> (which were ſent to Father <hi>Garnet</hi>) whereof one was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<hi>to our Beloved Sons the Catholick Princes and Nobles;</hi> the other, <hi>To our
Beloved Son the Arch-Prieſt, and the reſt of the Clergy of</hi> England. In which
Letters the Pope exhorts the Engliſh Catholicks, that after the death of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> they ſhould not admit of any to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> how near
ſoever he were in blood, but only ſuch an one as would not only Tolerate, but
with all his might Promote the Catholick Faith, and, <hi>More Majorum,</hi> give his
Oath that he would perform it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64572:4"/>
For, by theſe Letters was <hi>Catesby</hi> confirmed in his wickedneſs, thus arguing
from them. Thoſe who might then be kept out, may now be caſt out again.
It is as lawful now to hinder the King from enjoying, as it was then to hinder
him from entering; but then <hi>Clement</hi> would have us Catholicks to have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
his obtaining, and therefore now it ſhall be my care to look to this
matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond was Father <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Anſwer to the Queſtion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby,</hi>
concerning the ſlaughter of the Innocent together with the Nocent.
From theſe two did <hi>Catesby</hi> ground himſelf, and build all his Intentions upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Third,</hi> was the perſiſtence of Father <hi>Teſmond</hi> and Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> in
their wicked Enterprize, and Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi>'s commending it as a good Act,
though now diſcover'd and unſuccesful; for it is not credible that they
ſhould dare to do ſo, unleſs they had ask'd the Advice, and known the mind
of their Superiour, that is, Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> eſpecially in a matter ſo weighty
and ſo dangerous to their Society, as this might prove.</p>
            <p>At length Father <hi>Garnet</hi> being much moved by the Speeches of the <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and the <hi>Earl of Salisbury,</hi> brake forth into theſe words:
That he had done more than he could form any juſt excuſe for; And <hi>wiſh I
had never known the Buſineſs of this Powder-Treaſon;</hi> and at laſt he humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
God and the King, that the other Catholicks might not fare the worſe
for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe and many other Arguments (which for brevity ſake I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not) it ſeems to be plain, that the Jury, and the Lord Chief Juſtice (to
whom it belongs to pronounce Sentence of Life or Death) might deſervedly
think, that Father <hi>Garnet</hi> having had notice of the Treaſon (and that out of
Confeſſion) and yet not revealed it, and ſeeing it was his own fault that he
had not particular notice of it, that ſo he might have revealed it, and ſince that
to make it appear that he had particular notice of it, in Confeſſion only, there
is nothing but his own ſimple Aſſertion (to which in this matter credit ought
not to be given; eſpecially ſeeing he was before convicted of perjury) was,
if not a <hi>Counſellor of</hi> and <hi>Conſenter to,</hi> yet at leaſt <hi>privy</hi> to that Treaſon
which he did not reveal; and therefore according to the Ancient Laws of
<hi>England, Guilty of High-Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, all the Arguments and Proofs of what had been ſaid and done,
together with Father <hi>Garnet</hi>'s Anſwers, being heard and referred unto the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
Verdict, who brought him in Guilty of the Charge laid againſt him; The
<hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> pronounced this Sentence againſt him, that <hi>he ſhould be
drawn, hanged and quartered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Earl of</hi> Salisbury <hi>ask'd Father</hi> Garnet <hi>if he had any more to ſay:
To which he Anſwered;</hi> No my Lord, but I humbly beſeech your Lordſhips to
recommend my Life unto the King, at whoſe command I am moſt ready to die, or to
live and do him ſervice.</p>
            <p>And theſe things were tranſacted in the publick Tryal of Father <hi>Garnet</hi> at
his Arraignment, which I have recited faithfully, though perhaps not all in
the ſame Order wherein they were done. But of what paſſed at his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this is the Sum which follows.</p>
            <p>Being brought to the Place of Execution, and having aſcended the Scaffold
which was ſet up on purpoſe; Sir <hi>Henry Mountague</hi> Recorder of the City of
<hi>London</hi> (being commanded by the King to be there preſent) asked Father <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64572:4"/>
if he had any thing to impart to the People that ſtood about him, telling
him that it was no time now to diſſemble, ſince his Crimes were manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all; and therefore if he pleaſed he might teſtifie to all, what he thought
concerning his own Condition, and his Crimes; for he ſhould have free leave,
if he had any thing to ſay. Father <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered, that his voyce was ſo
low, and his ſtrength ſo ſpent, that, if he ſhould ſpeak to the People, he could
not be heard. But to thoſe that ſtood by him on the Scaffold, he ſaid, <hi>that it
was a wicked Plot,</hi> and the <hi>Deſign was ſo horrid, that if it had taken effect, he could
not but have deteſted it from his very ſoul;</hi> adding that he only knew of it in
general from <hi>Catesby,</hi> and yet herein he had offended that he had concealed it,
and neglected to prevent it; but what he knew particularly of it, he ſaid, he had
heard it only under the Seal of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>But the Recorder admoniſhed him that he would remember theſe four
things the King had by him in writing, ſigned by Father <hi>Garnet</hi>'s own hand,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Greenwel</hi> (or <hi>Teſmond</hi>) had ſignified the matter to him, not as a ſin,
but as that which he before was acquainted with, and to the intent that he
might ask his advice about it.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Teſmond</hi> came to him that they might be confirmed in
their wicked undertaking.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>Teſmond</hi> and he had a good while after, had a Conference in <hi>Eſſex</hi>
concerning the Particulars of the Gun-Powder-Treaſon.</p>
            <p>4. That <hi>Teſmond</hi> had asked Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> who was to be Protector of the
Kingdom? and Father <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered him; <hi>That was to be reſpited till the
matter was done and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things ſhew that theſe wickedneſſes were known to you otherwiſe
than by Confeſſion; and theſe things are under your own hand. Father</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
<hi>anſwered,</hi> whatſoever is under my hand is true; and becauſe he had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to his Majeſty what he knew, Sentence of death had juſtly been paſſed on him,
and he begg'd pardon of his Majeſty for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſaid Father</hi> Garnet, I am come hither on this day which is the Feaſt of
the Invention of the Holy Croſs, to put an end to all the Croſſes which I have
ſuffered in my Life, <hi>You are not ignorant of the cauſe of my ſuffering;</hi> I
confeſs I have offended againſt the King, and am ſorry for it, ſo far as I was
guilty of the Plot, <hi>viz.</hi> in concealing it, and for this I humbly beſeech his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to forgive me. <hi>The Plot againſt the King and Kingdom was bloody, and
ſuch as if it had been</hi> Executed, I ſhould have deteſted with all my heart and
ſoul. And truly I am very much grieved and troubled that Catholicks ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
undertake ſo horrid and cruel a wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Then turning from the People to them that ſtood about him, he made an
<hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Lady Anne Vaux;</hi> and as concerning the Pope's Briefs, and
<hi>Edmund Bainhem</hi>'s going beyond Sea; and the Powder-Plot, he referred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to his Arraignment and his Confeſſions, for whatſoever he had confeſt
and given under his hand, was true.</p>
            <p>And then preparing himſelf for death, he kneeled down at the Ladder's
foot, by which he was to aſcend the Gallows, and asked if he might pray, and
how long? it was anſwered, that he might pray as long as he would, and that
none ſhould interrupt him.</p>
            <p>When he had riſen up again; The Recorder obſerving by his Geſture, that
he was diſcompoſed by earneſt expectation of a Pardon, bid him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64572:5"/>
himſelf, and his own ſoul, for he was brought thither to die, and die he
muſt; withal requiring him that he would not Equivocate now with his laſt
Breath, but if he knew any thing that might be prejudicial to the King or
Kingdom, that he would declare it.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered, <hi>This is no time to Equivocate;</hi> how far forth it's
lawful to Equivocate, and when, I have already declared my Opinion elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
<hi>but now I do not Equivocate, and I know no more than I have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being now upon the Gallows, he uſed theſe words;</hi> I recommend my ſelf
to all good Catholicks; and I pray God to protect the King's Majeſty, the
Queen, the Royal Iſſue, and the Lords of the Privy Council; whom I ſalute moſt
officiouſly, and with whom I am ſorry that I ſhould diſſemble. But I did not
think they had had thoſe Proofs againſt me which they had, until they produced
them: For then I thought it a greater honour to confeſs, than before to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
my ſelf.</p>
            <p>As for my Brother <hi>Teſmond,</hi> I wiſh that the Truth may appear, for falſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
would faſten more upon him than he is guilty of: I had never accuſed
him, had I not thought he had been got out of danger. I pray God the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
may not fare the worſe for my ſake; and I exhort them all, that they never
have any hand in ſuch Treaſons and Rebellions againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Then ſigning himſelf with the ſign of the Croſs, and commending himſelf
to the Holy Trinity, and the Bleſſed Virgin, the Ladder being turn'd, he end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Life.</p>
            <p>And all this (<hi>moſt bleſſed Father</hi>) was tranſacted, not in ſecret hugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mugger,
but openly, and as it were upon the Stage, partly at his Publick Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> before five Illuſtrious Earls, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
to judge in the Caſe, and who had for their Aſſeſſers (beſides <hi>the
Lord Mayor</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) three <hi>Chief Judges</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of an almoſt infinite number of men, among whom many were Roman
Catholicks; partly at his Execution in the midſt of the City before the gate
of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to which alſo there was a great conflux of People aſſembled; So
that your Holineſs, if you ſhould doubt of the truth of any thing here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and will not give credit to ſo great a multitude of Proteſtants, (who, it's
no way likely, ſhould ſpeak falſly in a thing ſo Publick, and concerning which
they might eaſily be convinced of falſhood (if any were) by ſo many Roman
Catholicks who were preſent both at the Tryal and Execution) yet by thoſe
Roman Catholicks themſelves, who were not Conſpirators; but are much
grieved that thoſe Fathers ſhould have an hand in ſo <hi>horrid a wickedneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the great detriment and ſcandals which from thence have befallen
the Catholick Religion; While they are yet alive, you may eaſily be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the very truth of the ſeveral Particulars which I have related, which
I my ſelf have heard from Catholicks themſelves, who were preſent at the
Tranſactions.</p>
