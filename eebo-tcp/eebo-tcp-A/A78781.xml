            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Conceſſions of the moſt materiall things deſired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as well for a Declaration of His clear intentions by thoſe former Anſwers, as for a further and finall Anſwer to the ſaid Prepoſition and Paper of the 17. His Majeſty ſaith as followeth.</p>
               <p>That albeit, for the reaſons expreſſed in His former Paper, He cannot conſent to a Bill, and the Ordinance for Aboliſhing Biſhops: Yet for the ſatisfaction of His two Houſes, and ſetling the publique Peace, He will conſent to a Bill for the taking away of all Arch-biſhops, Chauncellours, and Commiſſaries, Deanes, and Sub-deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Arch-deacons, Canons and Prebendaries, and all Chaunters, Chancellours, Treſurers, Sub-Treſurers, Succenters, and Sacriſts, and all Vicars Chorall, and Choriſters, old Vicars and new Vicars of any Cathedrall or Collegiat Church, and all other their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Officers out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and out of the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, His Majeſty will Conſent to ſuſpend the exerciſe of all Epiſcopall Government for the ſpace of three yeares; and hath Conſented, and will Conſent to confirme the Form of Church Government now preſented to Him for the ſaid three yeares; And that no other ſhall be uſed during that time. In which time His Majeſty continues His deſire; That a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be had with the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (twenty of His own nomination being added) To the end, that His Majeſty and His two Houſes may within thoſe three yeares informe themſelves of the practice of the Primitive Church in Point of Epiſcopacy, and may accordingly agree in limiting the Biſhops to the Councell and Aſſiſtance of Presbyters, and in the exerciſe of their Juriſdiction and increaſing their number if it be thought fit.</p>
               <p>And His Majeſty will Conſent, that in caſe no Settlement ſhall be agreed on within the ſaid three years, Then after the ſaid time, the power of Ordination ſhall not be exerciſed by Biſhops without the Councell, and Aſſiſtance of Presbyters. And that no other Epiſcopal Juriſdiction ſhall be exerciſed by Biſhops, but ſuch, and in ſuch manner as ſhall be agreed on by His Majeſty and His two Houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And His Majeſty doth proſeſſe, That, if in that time He be Convinced, that the Function of Biſhops is not agreeable to the Word of God, or that Chriſt Commanded any other Government, He will moſt chearfully imbrace that, and take away Epiſcopacy; But untill He be ſo Convinced, He believes Himſelf bound in Conſcience, as it is above expreſſed.</p>
