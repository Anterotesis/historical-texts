            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Euen thus (surely) it falles forth with vs at this present, concerning especiallie the matters controuerted betweene our selues and those our Antagonists. For they, not only giuing the <hi>Canuisado</hi> of late to her Maiesties high <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but hauing withall (by the venemous <hi>infection</hi> of their <hi>viperous pennes</hi>) verie vncharitablie endeuoured to wound <hi>S.

And by priuiledge thereof he hath very peremptorily <hi>imprinted</hi> and <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi> sundrie <hi>seditious pamphlets,</hi> hauing thereunto nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>warrant</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>dispensation</hi> from <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>testimonie</hi> of sound <hi>conscience,</hi> no nor so much as the holie <hi>approbation</hi> of any good christian <hi>subiect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, he hath for a season (though feare and shame enforceth him now to pluck in his head) very prowdlie <hi>ietted</hi> from countrie to countrie like a pettie new <hi>Pope</hi> among his owne <hi>Cardinals</hi>; yea and that also in his <hi>pontificalities,</hi> portrayed and contriued after the <hi>new-found popelike cut.</hi> The which their <hi>vnbridled insolencie,</hi> when we indeuoured to encounter, by publishing (as we verily beleeue) the infallible <hi>truth</hi> of these intricate <hi>matters</hi> in a <hi>treatise</hi> at large, and had signified so much to themselues by <hi>word</hi> and by <hi>letters</hi> in an only desire of doing them good, they labored by <hi>letters</hi> and otherwaies to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our said enterprise a time at the least. And in the meane time (<hi>by printing and publishing</hi> the <hi>trifling toyes</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:9964:6"/>
that their new found <hi>trifling trade</hi>) they haue sought <hi>to forestall</hi> our former good purpose, and laboured to calme our carefull endeuours for doing them good. Yea, and by these their <hi>preuenting practises,</hi> they do (in effect) but disdainefullie say vnto vs, with <hi>Pope Hildebrand</hi> their prowd <hi>copartner, Deere brethren, you haue bin some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too slow in publishing those your dialogicall Discourses concerning Spirits and Diuels.</hi> Howbeit, we (by these our <hi>subsequent labours</hi> and second <hi>encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>) may with <hi>Cassinensis</hi> very conscionablie replie vpon them thus: and you, oh counterfeit <hi>Exorcistes, you haue bin ouer-hastie by much,</hi> not only in killing your good <hi>predecessour</hi> by your <hi>poysoned penne,</hi> but also in broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a fond <hi>triall</hi> abroade, without any <hi>triall of truth:</hi> in designing a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> so opposite to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ:</hi> and in discouering a <hi>Detection,</hi> to <hi>detect</hi> your great follie, and shame to the world.</p>
            <p>The truth of the <hi>premisses</hi> (good christian <hi>Reader</hi>) may be made more apparantlie euident, if thou wilt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently examine, first, the <hi>pamphlets</hi> themselues: and then next, the <hi>spirit</hi> it selfe which may be supposed to endight the same.</p>
            <p>The <hi>pamphlets</hi> themselues (notwithstanding any their outward florishing shewes) they are inwardlie faultie (we verily thinke) both in <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they are ouermuch faultie in <hi>matter,</hi> is more then may be denyed, being euery of them fraught full of vnsound, and <hi>absurd positions,</hi> as shall be shewed hereafter in a short <hi>Catalogue</hi> prefixed before this <hi>booke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, that they be likewise faultie in their <hi>manner or forme,</hi> may easily appeare vnto such as are not vtterlie ignorant of <hi>methode:</hi> or, do any thing know what belongs to <hi>an orderlie manner of writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, their <hi>manner</hi> of writing, it seemes to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Schismaticall,</hi> and very shrewdlie to sauour of a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine

            <p>Besides that, their <hi>manner</hi> of writing, it is also verie enigmaticall, obscure, and cloudie: their <hi>sentences or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> they are (in effect) no better then <hi>riddles,</hi> and for the most part so vncertaine, so variable, so flitting, and so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, as none but themselues may possiblie <hi>spell, or spie forth their meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefely, the very <hi>frame</hi> itselfe of their whole proceeding resembleth fitlie a paire of <hi>tarriours,</hi> or <hi>tyring yrons,</hi> and serueth to no other purpose at all, but to hold men occupied all the day long about <hi>a new nothing to hang on their sleeues.</hi> Or they may well be compared to an intricate <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,</hi> or <hi>maskaring maze,</hi> from whence (when a man is once entred into them) he wots not which waies to winde himselfe forth, as may plainely appeare vnto such as careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consider the same, and this in effect for the <hi>Pamphlets</hi> themselues.</p>

vnwonted experiment, from a poore <hi>Boy</hi> at <hi>Northwich</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi>; euen now (at this present) essentiallie possessed of Satan.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but how are you certaine the <hi>Boy</hi> is (in deed and in truth) <hi>essentially possessed of Satan?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Why sir, I my selfe haue beene there sith he was so posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to take a circumspect view of his fearefull fits: and doe plainely perceiue (<hi>by his supernaturall actions and passions</hi>) that he is (in verie deed) essentiallie possessed of some <hi>spirit</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell</hi> at the least.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>So were you with him also (as some doe crediblie auouch) immediatlie before he fel into these his supposed fittes: and might therfore (for any thing known to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with himselfe or some others, concerning those his cosoning courses. But be it supposed you neuer saw him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and then tell vs how you dare so confidently conclude from those his supposed actions, an <hi>essentiall possession</hi> of some <hi>spirit</hi> or <hi>diuell:</hi> sith <hi>diuels</hi> (you know) are such spirituall and inuisible substances, as may not possiblie be discerned by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>corporall sense.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Why sir? his <hi>supernaturall actions</hi> do plainely demonstrate the same to all the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>Rehearse some few of those his supposed supernaturall <hi>actions</hi> I pray you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>I will. First he continuallie <hi>waggeth his head</hi> without anie intermission at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>So doth the <hi>palsie sicke patient,</hi> as we may see by daylie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: and (which more is) whereas the palsie-sicke hath no intermission at all: that your pretended <hi>Demoniake,</hi> hee onelie waggeth the head in the day time and when people are present, howbeit in the night time he sleepes very qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etlie as his owne mother reporteth. And therefore if an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bare <hi>wagging of the head</hi> doth necessarilie argue an <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9964:52"/>
possession:</hi> then euery <hi>palsie sicke patient</hi> that waggeth the head, hee also is essentiallie possessed of <hi>Satan.</hi> Howbeit sir? we also our selues haue seene this your supposed <hi>Demoniake</hi> as well as your selfe: but could not perceiue in him any such supernaturall actions or <hi>passions,</hi> as you boldlie report vpon your bare credit.</p>
               <p>Besides that, if the onlie bare <hi>wagging of the head</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie conclude a supernaturall action: then euery little childe that playeth wag-wanton, it also effecteth some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall action. Moreouer this one and the rest of those your pretended <hi>Demoniakes,</hi> they were and are commonlie ouertaken with those their supposed <hi>supernaturall fits,</hi> when they are layd on their <hi>bedde,</hi> and closelie vnder a <hi>couerlid:</hi> by which meanes they may the more easilie wagge their heads, or worke any their pretended actions, and so likewise the sooner deceiue the sillie beholders. Who being wholie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp before with a deepe impression of some supposed es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall <hi>possession:</hi> were thereby so fearefullie forestalled in iudgement, as they could not prouidently behold nor adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedlie consider the manner of the <hi>Demoniakes</hi> working. And therefore this <hi>wagging of the head,</hi> it is no such supernaturall <hi>action,</hi> as may vndoubtedlie conclude an <hi>essentiall possession.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>But sir? besides this extraordinary wagging of the head, he is also of a <hi>supernaturall strength.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>No such <hi>supernaturall strength</hi> was apparant to vs, being present with him (I assure you) in the very extremitie, or middest of those his pretended <hi>fits.</hi> For the one of vs did ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily hold his head, his shoulders, and all the other parts of his bodie from mouing at all, yea, and this also euen in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the <hi>boy</hi> himselfe, or of any supposed <hi>Diuell</hi> inherent within him: and therefore this <hi>supernaturall strength,</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supposed and suggested by your selfe and your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, then any waies soundly prooued, or but probablie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated to vs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Besides all this, hee was vndoubtedly of a <hi>supernaturall knowledge:</hi> for if two or three had suddenly come into the parlour where he lay, with <hi>seuerall bookes</hi> of sundrie matters
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9964:52"/>
hid close in their <hi>hats:</hi> hee could tell which of them had the holie <hi>Bible</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>hat,</hi> and at him he would catch and snatch, letting all the <hi>prophane bookes</hi> passe quietly by him without any such stirre at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>So could <hi>Bankes his blacke horse</hi> very sensiblie demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate what money some had in his purse, with sundrie other <hi>trickes</hi> more admirable then this by much: and yet not possessed at all with a <hi>Diuell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So a <hi>blind man</hi> (but casting his <hi>staffe</hi> at all aduenture) may happely at some time to kill a <hi>Crow:</hi> and yet neither indued with <hi>supernaturall knowledge,</hi> nor possest with a <hi>Diuell</hi> in the doing thereof.</p>
               <p>So likewise, a <hi>blindfolded lubber</hi> playing at <hi>blindman buzz,</hi> may happely (by skuffling vp and downe in the house) to light vpon one and the selfe same person for two or three times together: and yet not assisted therein at all with any <hi>supernaturall knowledge,</hi> or led thereunto by any the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie directions of either <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Diuell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, so likewise a little <hi>yong child</hi> playing at <hi>handie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> may happely (for three or foure times together) to make choise of that <hi>hand</hi> wherein the <hi>pin</hi> or the <hi>point</hi> is placed: and all this (I hope) without any <hi>supernaturall knowledge</hi> at all. And therefore it is very absurd that your selfe (from any such <hi>action</hi> as stands only vpon <hi>hap and hap hazard</hi>) should so confidently conclude a <hi>supernaturall knowledge,</hi> and so (by consequence) an essentiall <hi>possession</hi> of either <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Diuell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides that, how confidently soeuer you report this point of chusing the <hi>Bible</hi> before any other <hi>booke</hi> else: there bee some of good credit, and such also as fauour your cause (so farre forth especially as they perceiue not as yet the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie truth) who doe confidently report that in deede and in truth, this your supposed <hi>Demoniake</hi> did so much as you say for once or twice: but that at some other times againe hee had failed grosly therein: and therefore this <hi>tricke</hi> of <hi>hap-hazard,</hi> is no such certaine <hi>signe,</hi> as may vndoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an essentiall <hi>possession,</hi> in that your pretended poore <hi>patient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you a little before (if you haue not forgotten) that (whensoeuer you hapned afresh vpon some other such <hi>new-found
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9964:53"/>
Demoniake</hi>) we then should haue some other <hi>new signes</hi> of this your supposed essentiall <hi>possession</hi> to make your <hi>game hit:</hi>

                     <hi>Supra, in pag.</hi> 44.45.</note> and now I perceiue it is growing very fast towards such a pretended <hi>period.</hi> For behold, wee haue here now (in this your newly pretended <hi>Demoniake</hi>) two other <hi>essentiall signes</hi> forsooth of an essentiall <hi>possession:</hi> namely, the <hi>wagging of the head:</hi> and the <hi>playing at handie dandie.</hi> Alas <hi>Exorcistes,</hi> though your <hi>conscience</hi> trembleth not, yet me thinkes your very <hi>face</hi> should blush for shame, in reporting these <hi>trifling toyes</hi> for true and <hi>infallible tokens</hi> of an essentiall <hi>possession</hi> of some one <hi>Diuell</hi> or other, inherently couching within the very bodie of this your <hi>new-found Demoniake.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>But sir, besides all this the <hi>boy</hi> (I assure you) he is (for the whole time of his fearefull <hi>fits</hi>) so <hi>senselesse</hi> in euery part, as he neither <hi>seeth,</hi> nor <hi>heareth,</hi> nor <hi>speaketh,</hi> nor <hi>feeleth:</hi> and therefore essentially <hi>possest</hi> with a <hi>Diuell.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>How know you for certaine, that hee is (in deede and in truth) so <hi>senselesse,</hi> as you beare vs in hand? You are able (I confesse) to know when your <hi>selfe</hi> neither <hi>seeth,</hi> nor <hi>heareth,</hi> nor <hi>speaketh,</hi> nor <hi>feeleth:</hi> but that you should (in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) discerne as soundly of any such <hi>defect of sense</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is much more (I beleeue) than you are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate truely vnto vs. For be it supposed, that (for the whole time of those his pretended <hi>fits</hi>) there is in him no <hi>vse of his senses</hi> in any outward appearance to men: doth it follow necessarilie, that therefore there is within him also no true <hi>habite of sense</hi> at all? that is more (I beleeue) then you may truly auouch. Sith a man in a <hi>traunce</hi> may seeme (in all outward appearance) as though he were vtterly <hi>depriued of sense:</hi> when yet still he retaineth soundly <hi>an habite of sense,</hi> though (for a season) he wanteth the <hi>vse</hi> and practise thereof.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Exorcistes.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the very <hi>instance</hi> you giue, doth cleerely illustrate the infallible truth of that which I tell you. For euen as a man in a <hi>trance</hi> may seeme (in all outward appearance) as if he were <hi>sensles:</hi> so doth this poore boy (I assure you) in euery of those his fearefull <hi>fits:</hi> and therefore he is essentially <hi>possest</hi> with a <hi>Diuell.</hi>

               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>That followeth fayre and farre off: yea and (by as good reason) you may likewise very boldlie conclude, that the man in a <hi>traunce is also possest</hi> with a <hi>spirit</hi> or <hi>Diuell</hi>: because (in all outward appearance) he seemeth no <hi>lesse sensles</hi> then this your pretended <hi>Demoniake.</hi> But (by the way) be it here graunted freely vnto you, that an vndoubted <hi>true sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse</hi> doth argue (in deed) an <hi>essentiall possession:</hi> yet are you not able to demonstrate truely vnto vs, that the <hi>boy</hi> at <hi>Northwich,</hi> is (in those his pretended <hi>fittes</hi>) vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and truly <hi>so senslesse</hi> as you beare vs in hand, but that (howsoeuer it seemed in outward appearance) he both <hi>sawe</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>spake,</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> as may very probablie be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thus.</p>
               <p>First, that he <hi>sensiblie heard</hi> it is very apparant, in as much as my selfe but wishing (in his presence) a sight of his <hi>vrine,</hi> and being told by his <hi>parents,</hi> that the <hi>vrine</hi> which he first made in the morning was newly cast forth, but yet (said they) if you stay any time, you may happilie haue some from him afresh before it bee long: within a while after, such meanes was made by the <hi>boy</hi> (notwithstanding he was then in the <hi>extremitie of his fit</hi>) as I had forthwith his <hi>vrine</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) in no lesse orderly a manner, then if he had been in his perfect estate, which argueth plainely, that either his <hi>mother</hi> she had an extraordinarie <hi>reuelation</hi> concerning the fit time for affoording his <hi>vrine</hi> vnto her: or that the <hi>boy</hi> himselfe (hauing heard before my <hi>motion</hi> concerning that matter) did make such meanes as (notwithstanding that his said <hi>fit</hi>) his <hi>mother</hi> very orderly receiued his <hi>vrine</hi> without any spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at all in the <hi>bed,</hi> and therefore this concludeth no <hi>sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse condition,</hi> but rather the contrarie.</p>
               <p>Againe, that he <hi>sensiblie sawe</hi> at that present, we proue it thus: because (besides the often casting of his <hi>eyes</hi> vpon vs at sundrie times) when his sister also came to his <hi>bed</hi> side in a foule or <hi>sluttish coate,</hi> and was therefore rebuked sharpelie of her <hi>mother:</hi> the <hi>boy</hi> (both seeing his <hi>sisters sluttishnes,</hi> and hearing his <hi>mothers rebukes</hi>) hee <hi>laughed</hi> heartilie thereat. And thereupon, the <hi>mother</hi> being tolde by the one of vs there, that the <hi>boy</hi> (it should seeme) he was not so <hi>sensllesse</hi> as they would beare vs in hand, her answer was this: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9964:54"/>
that the <hi>shrewd boy,</hi> he would oftentimes laugh in his <hi>fittes</hi> at many such <hi>knaueries:</hi> which argueth in him no such <hi>sensles condition</hi> as your selfe would pretend.</p>
               <p>Againe, the <hi>Boy</hi> being kept (for tenne dayes together) in the <hi>Lord Bishop of Chester his pallace,</hi> and secretlie watched by some of his <hi>seruants,</hi> to spie forth his counterfeit carriage if any such were: he told his mother so much when hee was returned home (as she confesseth her selfe) and how the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops men stood <hi>peeping</hi> at him through the <hi>chinkes</hi> of the <hi>dore</hi> to spie forth his <hi>practises.</hi> But <hi>mother</hi> (saith he) I <hi>saw</hi> them full well, and was also as <hi>craftie</hi> as they: which argueth no <hi>sensles condition</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>Againe, that he also (at that present) very <hi>sensiblie felt,</hi> may thus be prooued. Namely, for that the one of vs holding him fast perforce (as we told you before) he not onlie endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preuent our sayd purpose, but when hee perceiued himselfe to be conquered in despite of his teeth, he forthwith <hi>roared</hi> and <hi>cryed out:</hi> which argueth plainely that he <hi>sensiblie heard,</hi> and <hi>saw</hi> and <hi>felt</hi>; yea, and that he might also be made to speake (as appeares by his <hi>crying</hi>) if he were well <hi>coniured</hi> a while with a <hi>three corded whippe.</hi> And therefore for any thing hitherto heard, this your <hi>new-found Demoniake,</hi> hee was not so sensles, as your selfe would <hi>senselesly</hi> beare vs in hand.</p>

admitte <hi>the case</hi> to be thus; The <hi>Queenes Maiestie</hi> (next and immediatly vnder <hi>God</hi>) doth gouerne this kingdome by her <hi>absolute authoritie.</hi> This <hi>absolute authoritie,</hi> she hath <hi>(in part)</hi> dispensed to some certaine <hi>persons,</hi> subordinate vnder her, for the orderly <hi>execution of iustice and mercie</hi> among the rest of her <hi>subiectes:</hi> ratifying, and approuing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer those <hi>persons</hi> shall correspondently conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>tenour of her Maiesties pleasure,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at large in her <hi>Lawes.</hi> Yea, and approouing the same to be as <hi>authenticall,</hi> as if she (by her <hi>absolute authoritie</hi>) had effected the same in her owne proper person.

               <p>That <hi>Scripture,</hi> it may not be <hi>appropriated to the Apostles</hi> (you say) for many <hi>respects:</hi> making their pretended <hi>excuse</hi> (from a supposed want of time, in the timely dispatch of those speciall <hi>exercises</hi>) the principall <hi>respect</hi> thereof.

               </p>
               <p>For, First you were throughly acquainted (it seemes) with all the <hi>spare time</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> then had at that present.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is very likely you knew how <hi>much of that time</hi> they must necessarily haue bestowed to the full: in the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall discharge of that duetie.</p>

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:9964:75"/>Thirdly, you were also very certaine no doubt, that if they but wanted <hi>one minute</hi> of that your appointed time: then surely (how succinctly, or how feruently soeuer they should put vp their <hi>prayers to God</hi>) their labours therein had been vtterly lost.</p>
               <p>Lastly, you were made priuie (it seemes) to the <hi>Apostles purpose</hi> then, in <hi>not praying at all:</hi> who, perceiuing some want of time for the timely performance of those speciall <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> would not therefore vndertake them at all, for losing their labors, but tooke (as it seemes) their said want of time for a <hi>backesette,</hi> or a profered aduantage in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per defence, if haplie they should faile (as they did) in the powerfull <hi>dispatch of that enterprise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now surely, the <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> are highly beholding vnto you for this their proper <hi>defence</hi>; whereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (it should seeme) were vtterly ignorant.

               <p>Very true. Howbeit, by <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> those selfesame <hi>meanes were sanctified,</hi> for the powerfull effecting of those speciall workes.</p>

               <p>Namely, first, <hi>an ordinarie naturall medicine</hi> to effect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>cure:</hi> as for example, <hi>eie-bright</hi> to cleere the dimnes of sight.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, for <hi>plowing and sowing,</hi> very certaine it is the same shall euermore effectually prosper, in procuring <hi>abundance</hi> or <hi>barrennes</hi> vpon the ground at the least: which are the <hi>two certaine ends</hi> whereunto they are certainly appointed of <hi>God.</hi> For howsoeuer we may (by the secret <hi>operation of God</hi>) beholde in <hi>Isaack his tillage the blessing of abundance:</hi>

               <p>The reason is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>D.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Orthodoxus.</speaker>
               <p>That is vntrue. For if the <hi>Lord</hi> hath appointed <hi>the meanes it selfe to a certaine end,</hi> he is not then at libertie, but hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>bound himselfe to that selfesame meanes,</hi> so farre forth especially, as concernes that <hi>certaine end</hi> whereunto he hath certainly appointed the same: yea, and he must also (in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) euen make the said <hi>meanes</hi> to be very effectuall. So as if at any time the <hi>meanes</hi> it selfe be vtterly <hi>ineffectuall,</hi> we may certainly conclude, that the <hi>Lord</hi> had not certainly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same to that <hi>certaine end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which point Master <hi>Darell</hi> perceiued full well,<note place="margin">

So then, if <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> be (as you say) an ordinarie <hi>meanes</hi> very certainly and purposely appointed of <hi>God</hi> for the powerfull expelling of <hi>Diuels,</hi> the said <hi>meanes</hi> (being vsed accordingly) must needes bee effectuall from time to time: and (being so made effectuall) the worke it selfe is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly <hi>miraculous.</hi>

               <p>Moreouer, if you haue no <hi>assurance</hi> at al to preuaile in this case, why did you then so presumptuously vndertake to <hi>pray for a spirituall blessing</hi> vpon those your <hi>Demoniakes,</hi>

               <p>By all the premisses then you may plainly perceiue, that (notwithstanding the supposed force of this your first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) the worke it selfe (being truly effected in such sort as you say) it was vndoubtedly a miraculous worke.</p>

               <p>And (which is to be respected the most of all) they doe thereby very strongly confirme <hi>the wisards of the world</hi> in their <hi>wicked opinions,</hi> concerning the <hi>supposed force</hi> of those their <hi>filthie sorceries</hi> and <hi>magicall inchauntments:</hi> bearing the the world in hand, that (by the onlie <hi>meanes</hi> of their filthie <hi>charmes,</hi> their <hi>frame of words,</hi> their superstitious <hi>inuocations,</hi> and other their <hi>vnlawfull orisons</hi>) they are able (without any more adoe) to amend whatsoeuer is amisse in man or beast.</p>

For if none (in these daies) be <hi>essentially possessed of Satan,</hi> do tel me (I pray you) how we are to esteeme of such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>passions,</hi> as do eftsoones befall to sundrie distressed <hi>persons?</hi>

               <p>I will simplie tell you what my owne selfe suppose them to be, and how also I would haue your selfe and all others accompt of such accidents.</p>
               <p>First, such extraordinarie and vnwonted occurrents may eftsoones appeare, and be practised by meere <hi>cousoning col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions,</hi> and craftie conueiances of <hi>legerdemaine.</hi> Yea, and these counterfeite <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>passions</hi> may also bee broached, either by the only pretended <hi>Demoniake</hi> himselfe (as did the <hi>dissembling caitife,</hi> who cousoned that reuerend father Master <hi>Fox</hi>) without the assistance of any other besides: or else such extraordinarie actions they may be effected by the ioynt assistance, helpe and direction of some <hi>craftie confederate,</hi> conioyned with that the aforesaid pretended <hi>Demoniake,</hi> in the couert dispatch of those his counterfeit <hi>prankes.</hi> Of this kinde of <hi>Demoniakes,</hi> the world hath been successiuely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in euery age since the <hi>Primitiue Church:</hi> and therefore no wonder at all though now (in these daies) some certaine persons should likewise <hi>depart from the faith,</hi>

                  <hi>giuing heede to spirits of error, and to doctrines of Diuels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes againe the pretended <hi>Demoniake</hi> may (in deed and in truth) be easily drawen to beleeue that he is (without doubt) <hi>essentially possessed of Satan,</hi> when there is no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all, he hauing onely (at vnwares to himselfe) and by some <hi>paltrie Priest</hi> or cunning <hi>Impostor</hi>) beene before verie grosly abused; partly by Patheticall and circumuenting perswasions, and partly also by some intoxicated perfume, some filthie confection or potion. The which bewitching sorceries doe so strangely disorder the poore <hi>Patients body,</hi> his <hi>minde</hi> it selfe with all the powers and faculties concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them both:<note place="margin">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9964:133"/>
beleeue that the partie (in deed) is <hi>essentially possessed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.9.10.</note> Yea and (which more is) the very <hi>Exorcist</hi> himselfe (who pretendeth and vndertaketh the supposed <hi>dispossession</hi> of this newly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Demoniake</hi>) he may also very easily beare the <hi>behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in hand, that he is vndoubtedly some mightie <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico</hi> in this new-found trade of <hi>Diuillitie,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly these <hi>extraordinarie</hi> and vnwonted <hi>occurrents,</hi> they may and doe also eftsoones arise from meere <hi>naturall causes,</hi> namely, from <hi>Mania,</hi> from <hi>Melancholy,</hi> from <hi>Lunacy,</hi> from <hi>Furie,</hi> from the <hi>Phrensie,</hi> from the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> from the <hi>Mother,</hi> from <hi>Conuulsions, obstructions,</hi> and sundry such other <hi>vnnaturall accidents,</hi> as we haue eftsoones declared in our former <hi>discourses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>vnwontednes</hi> and efficacie of which vnnaturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, the <hi>minde</hi> it selfe (being mightily disordered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by meanes of the <hi>Phantasie</hi>) doth easily resolue that some <hi>extraordinarie operations</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> doe mightilie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper his <hi>natural constitution,</hi> and strangely afflict the same in euery part. Of this kind of extraordinarie <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> very many but lately departed this life, and many yet liuing haue oftentimes had an experience: yea and the best vse you may possibly make of all those your eight supposed <hi>Demoniakes</hi> (more especially of your newly pretended <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> sprong vp in <hi>Cheshire</hi> of late) is only this. Namely, that the excesse of <hi>melancholy,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the <hi>Diuell</hi> (being alwaies desirous to worke (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the deare children of <hi>God</hi>) the greatest <hi>disturbance</hi> that may be, and finding withall some such lewd disposed <hi>person</hi> as is naturally enclined to all manner of <hi>knaueries</hi>) he taketh the oportunitie of so fit a <hi>subiect,</hi> and worketh so cunningly vpon the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>that lewd persons nature,</hi> as the <hi>partie</hi> himselfe is easily brought to beleeue, and to beare others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in hand, that he is (in deede and in truth) <hi>essentially posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9964:134"/>
of Satan.</hi> Yea, and (which more is) the said <hi>vngratious body</hi> (partly for <hi>gaine,</hi> partly for <hi>glory,</hi> and partly also in <hi>an affected desire</hi> to be deemed <hi>terrible</hi> to others about him) he doth from thence forth very willingly endeuour himselfe to <hi>speake</hi> and <hi>to act some</hi> such strange and vnwonted <hi>acts,</hi> as the like were neuer espied in him before. By which his <hi>villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous practises,</hi> the silly <hi>beholders</hi> (surprised before with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate opinion of <hi>Demoniacall possessions</hi>) are easily brought to intertaine for infallible truth, that the <hi>partie</hi> is (in deed) <hi>essentiallie possessed</hi> with some <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Diuell.</hi> Of this kinde of <hi>Demoniakes,</hi> we haue often <hi>experience</hi> in euery age: and the cousoning of good Master <hi>Foxe</hi> doth plainely confirme.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>premisses</hi> then you may plainely perceiue, that the supposed strange <hi>actions</hi> or <hi>passions,</hi> in any such falslie preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Demoniakes,</hi> they may, and are also eftsoones effected without any <hi>supernaturall power of a Diuell:</hi> and therefore you neede not so easilie be ledde to conceiue of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in such sort as you doe, but ought rather to examine the <hi>causes</hi> themselues with the sundrie <hi>occasions</hi> and <hi>seuerall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of <hi>persons,</hi> of <hi>times,</hi> and of <hi>places</hi> with other <hi>occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:</hi> that thereby you may more soundly be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thereof.</p>

               <p>I say and hold (as before) that there are <hi>essentiall possessions</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> in these daies of the <hi>Gospell:</hi> and that <hi>sole prayer</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> is a <hi>perpetuall ordinance established by Christ,</hi> for the powerfull expelling of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Diuels</hi> to the ende of the world.</p>

               <p>Behold <hi>Exorcistes?</hi> these <hi>Questions</hi> (you see) they fully containe <hi>the whole scope of our conference:</hi> doe take them therefore to your <hi>fauourits,</hi> that they and your selfe may more soundly consider vpon them.</p>
